But the social security system that we inherited from the Conservatives is failing the very people that it is supposed to help and is holding our country back.”In a sign of the growing pushback which ministers now face, Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, warned against “balancing the books on the backs of sick and disabled people”.Kendall’s changes amount to the biggest shake-up of Britain’s welfare system since universal credit was introduced over a decade ago, and come after years of unsuccessful attempts to bring down the numbers of people claiming long-term sickness benefits.Britain is unique among European countries in not having cut those numbers to pre-pandemic levels. Kendall told the Commons on Tuesday that spending on working-age sickness and disability benefits was up £20bn since the pandemic, and was forecast to rise by a further £18bn by the end of this parliament to £70bn a year.View image in fullscreenTerry Jermy, the Labour MP for South West Norfolk, said: ‘I really dispute this idea that it’s too easy to claim Pip.’Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianMuch of Kendall’s package of measures is aimed at reducing incentives to stay out of work. The work and pensions secretary is scrapping the system of giving higher incapacity payments for those unable to work than to those who can, in a bid to make sure as many people as possible are looking for work.There will also be a new “right to work” scheme for those on incapacity benefits so they can try to return to work without risking losing their entitlements.People under the age of 22 wanting the health top-up to universal credit will no longer qualify under plans being consulted on, with the savings being reinvested in work and training schemes to help get them into the workplace.But the most financially significant decision is Kendall’s plan to introduce drastically tighter limits for who can claim personal independence payments (Pips), which are intended to help people with their quality of life and are not connected to employment. The Pip savings will help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stick to her fiscal rules when she announces her spring statement next week.Under the new system, people who cannot cook a simple meal for themselves but can heat food up in a microwave would not be eligible for the payments unless they have other needs to be taken into account. Needing assistance to wash their hair or their body below the waist would also be judged as insufficient to claim the payments, which are currently worth up to £185 a week.Ministers will not lay out where exactly the £5bn savings are coming from until next week, though officials indicated most would come from reduced Pip spending. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the plan would see between 800,000 and 1.2 million people losing support of between £4,200 and £6,300 a year by 2029-30.Louise Murphy, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Around 1 million people are potentially at risk of losing support from tighter restrictions on Pip, while young people and those who fall ill in the future will lose support from a huge scaling back of incapacity benefits.“While it includes some sensible reforms, too many of the proposals have been driven by the need for short-term savings to meet fiscal rules, rather than long-term reform. The result risks being a major income shock for millions of low-income households.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These reforms will only serve to deepen the nation’s mental health crisis.”Anela Anwar, a member of the End ChildPovertycoalition, said: “The proposed cuts … would deepen child poverty and call into question the government’s commitment to reduce this.“At a time when the government is developing a strategy to reduce child poverty – it is shocking that it is also proposing to make significant cuts to family incomes.”Quick GuideWhat mental health and benefits support is available?ShowMental health support• Mind runs a support line on 0300 102 1234 as a safe and confidential place to talk openly.

The potential rebels include several who were first elected last year who have so far remained overwhelmingly loyal to the government.Neil Duncan-Jordan, the newly elected MP for Poole, said: “There is a genuine concern that tightening the eligibility criteria for Pip will plunge more disabled people into poverty.Benefitsare already far from generous, so this is going to feel particularly cruel.”Terry Jermy,who beat Liz Trussin South West Norfolk last year, did not say how he intended to vote, but said: “I am disappointed that there are things in there that will make more difficulties for disabled people, particularly in relation to Pip.”Jermy, who helped his father claim Pip for 10 years after he had a stroke, added: “I really dispute this idea that it’s too easy to claim Pip.”Another new Labour MP said: “I don’t blame Liz [Kendall] for any of this but the reality is this will make a considerable number of my constituents a lot poorer. And that’s not what we came here to do.”One of their colleagues added: “There is plenty I like about this package. I’m still not going to vote for it.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareDisabilityBenefitsLiz KendallMental healthUniversal creditPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Crew-9 back on Earth. Nick, Aleksandr, Butch and Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,” a voice from mission control said, shortly before a pod of frolicking dolphins appeared and swam around the bobbing craft.“What a ride. I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear,” Nicholas Hague, the third American onboard, replied.1:03Dolphins welcome Nasa astronauts stuck in space back to Earth – videoWilliams and Wilmorearrived at the ISSon 6 June last year, intending to stay long enough to evaluate Starliner’s docking and operational capabilities during its first crewed flight and return home no more than 10 days later.But a series of technical issues and safety fears led Nasa and Boeing tosend the capsule back to Earth emptyin September, and extend the pair’s stay by making them crew members onboard the space station in place of two other astronauts still on the ground who were reassigned to other future missions.The Dragon capsule, called Freedom, undocked from the orbiting outpost at 1.05am ET on Monday, containing Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.“We’ll miss you, but have a great journey home,” Nasa’s Anne McClain had called out earlier from the space station as the capsule pulled away 260 miles (418km) above the Pacific.1:49NASA astronauts 'Butch and Suni' return to Earth after nine months in orbit – videoHague, who arrived at the space station with Gorbunov in September, said it had been a privilege to “call the station home” as part of an international effort for the “benefit of humanity”.Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa’s live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.The capsule was lifted on to a recovery vessel about 30 minutes after the splashdown.“Awesome job, both uphill and downhill,” Hague told mission controllers, referring to his flights to and from the space station, immediately before a side hatch was opened and the astronauts were lifted out on stretchers, a routine practice, and taken for medical evaluation.View image in fullscreenRoscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov is helped out of a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.Photograph: Nasa/ReutersHague was first to emerge, smiling and waving, followed by Gorbunov, then Williams and Wilmore to cheers and applause from the recovery crew. Williams grinned and waved a thumbs-up sign; Wilmore shook the hand of a crew member and waved as he was led away.Williams returned home as the American astronaut with the second-longest combined time in space, 608 days over three visits to the space station, the first in 2006. Only Peggy Whitson, a former chief of Nasa’s astronaut office, has more, with 675 days over four space flights.Williams and Wilmore’s odyssey became something of a political football, with the SpaceX founder and Donald Trump acolyteElon Muskinsisting without evidence they had been “abandoned” by the Biden administration, and Trump attempting to paint last week’s long-scheduledroutine crew rotation flightas a special rescue mission ordered by the White House.View image in fullscreenThe moment of splashdown.Photograph: Keegan Barber/Nasa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe fallout left the astronauts in an awkward position, with Wilmore telling reporters from space earlier this month that Musk’s claim he offered to bring them home last year, but was rebuffed by Joe Biden, was “absolutely factual”, while admitting: “We have no information on … what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that process went.”Yet in Februaryhe told CNN: “We don’t feel abandoned, we don’t feel stuck, we don’t feel stranded. I understand why others may think that … if you’ll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative, let’s change it to ‘prepared and committed’, that’s what we prefer.”View image in fullscreenA diver jumps off the capsule after it was lifted on to support vessel.Photograph: Nasa/ReutersSwollen eyeballs, baby-like skin, and the overview effect: how astronauts feel when they return to EarthRead moreMusk, meanwhile, becameembroiled in a public disputewith the Danish astronaut and space station veteran Andreas Mogensen, who accused him of lying, and pointed out that Tuesday’s return of Williams and Wilmore, alongside their ISS Crew 9 colleagues was scheduled as long ago as September.In response, Musk posted to the X platform he owns that Mogensen was “fully retarded”, drawing him deeper into conflict with retired astronauts and ISS veterans and brothers Scott and Mark Kelly, who defended their European colleague.View image in fullscreenCrew leader Nick Hague gives a thumbs-up.Photograph: Keegan Barber/Nasa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe bad blood has continued, with Musk calling Mark Kelly, Democratic senator for Arizona, “a traitor” for visiting Ukraine and urging US military and humanitarian support for the country in its war against Russia; and the politician retorting that Musk was “not a serious guy”. Kelly has alsoditched his Tesla car, manufactured by another of Musk’s companies, in protest at the billionaire’s role in slashing federal budgets and staffing.View image in fullscreenButch Wilmore was one of the two US astronauts stuck on the ISS for months.Photograph: NASA/Getty ImagesThe future of Boeing’s Starliner capsule, developed as part of Nasa’s commercial crew program, remains uncertain. Engineers have examined the spacecraft at its White Sands, New Mexico, base attempting to find the cause of problems that arose during its maiden crewed flight, including thruster issues and a series of small helium leaks.Aviation Week reportedthat Starliner was unlikely to fly again in 2025, but that the company retained confidence in its product and was working towards earning a new flight readiness certification.Explore more on these topicsNasaInternational Space StationSpaceXElon MuskSpaceBoeingnewsShareReuse this content"

Symptoms can include excruciating pain, restricted movement, inability to work and reluctance to mix socially. Some people feel better within weeks but others can find their life dominated by chronic pain for years.The wide range of treatment available includes painkillers, acupuncture, stretching, massage, anti-inflammatory drugs, laser and light therapy, and manipulation of the spine.However, the bad news for the many who endure back pain is that only 10% of these non-surgical treatments usually deployed actually have any effect – and the rest provide little or no benefit.Only six out of the 56 treatments analysed are effective and even those yield only “small” relief. The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.“The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain. Our review did not find reliable evidence of large effects for any of the included treatments.”The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: exercise, spinal manipulative therapy,taping, antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.Interventions that “probably provide little to no difference in pain” include exercise, paracetamol, glucocortisoid injections, anaesthetics and antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs.However, having a massage, taking painkillers and wearing foot orthotics “may provide” large reductions in pain.Heat, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may produce a “moderate” reduction in pain. Osteopathic treatment and using muscle relaxants and NSAIDs together may produce a small lessening of pain.However, two treatments may increase someone’s pain, including extracorporeal shockwaves and the anti-inflammatory drugcolchicine.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that family doctors often refer patients with back pain for physiotherapy as a first-line treatment, to be assessed and given exercises to perform, or to link workers, who suggest non-medical interventions.“Many patients do report feeling some relief from the interventions – medical or not – that we suggest,” Hawthorne said.Tim Button, the president of the British Chiropractic Association, welcomed the study’s endorsement of spinal manipulation and taping as effective treatments.“Our members are increasingly seeing patients come to them with back pain, worried that they can’t work and stuck on NHS waiting lists,” he said.“While this may not always be a‘miracle cure’to chronic musculoskeletal conditions, it is as effective as other non-invasive treatments and makes a real difference to how quickly people can get back to work and normal life.”A Chartered Society of Physiotherapy spokesperson said: “Physiotherapists carry out an in-depth assessment to identify the root causes of back pain, which will be different for everyone and can range widely from stress, fear of movement and poor sleep to smoking, obesity, job-related strain, and insufficient physical activity.“Exercise has been shown to be the most helpful treatment for back pain. Hands-on treatments have been shown to have a small benefit to back pain, but only when used as part of a whole treatment programme, which includes exercise.“Similarly, injections may be beneficial as part of a treatment programme, but not on their own.”Explore more on these topicsBack painPhysiotherapistsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

And I want to promise you – and them – this is only the beginning,” Netanyahu told viewers.Earlier, Israel’s defence minister raised the prospect of many weeks or even months of war inGaza.“Hamas must understand that the rules of the game have changed,” Israel Katz told reporters during a visit to an airbase, adding that “the gates of hell will open and it will face the full might of the IDF in the air, at sea and on land” if hostages were not freed.The Israeli army has issued evacuation orders covering the northernmost and eastern parts of Gaza, suggesting renewed ground attacks could be launched soon.View image in fullscreenA woman mourns next to the body of a person killed in Israeli airstrikes, at al-Maadani hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APPalestinian health authorities reported 404 deaths in the strikes, which Israeli military officials said targeted Hamas military commanders and political officials. More than 600 were reported injured. Air attacks and artillery fire were reported to be continuing across much of Gaza during the afternoon and into the evening.Aid officials in Gaza said hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were on the move to comply with the Israeli evacuation orders. “There is no resilience. People … are in a very weak state, physically and psychologically,” one aid official in Gaza told the Guardian.In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before carrying out the strikes.View image in fullscreenGrieving relatives mourn Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAttacks were reported in northern Gaza and in the central cities of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. One strike was reported to have killed 17 members of a family in Rafah. The dead included five children, their parents, and a man and his three children, medics at the hospital that received the bodies said.World leaders express outrage at Israel’s renewed bombing of Gaza civiliansRead moreWitnesses said patients lay on the floor of the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, some screaming, and a young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. At al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, survivors held rushed funeral rites for dozens of body bags lining the yard. Mothers sobbed over the bloodied bodies of children, as warplanes hummed in the sky. Doctors struggled to treat the flow of wounded.Casualties included senior Hamas officials, including the most senior political leader in Gaza and ministers, as well as many women and children, Palestinian officials said.Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said Israel had launched strikes after discovering Hamas was planning new raids to capture or kill Israeli civilians or soldiers and because Hamas had refused to release more of the 59 hostages held in Gaza, thus breaking the ceasefire agreement that came into effect in January.“Hamas could have chosen a different path. It could have chosen to release all the hostages but instead chose refusal, terror, and war,” Shoshani said in a statement.Netanyahu’s office said Hamas had rejected proposals from Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for an extension of the pause in hostilities.Hamas said hostage releases were due only during a scheduled second phase that Israel agreed in January but has since refused to discuss or implement.The first phase of the ceasefire agreed in January involved 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead Israelis returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Under the scheduled second phase of the ceasefire, there would have been a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of all hostages and a definitive end to hostilities. With the backing of the US, Israel has been pushing instead for thereturn of all remaining hostagesin exchange for further prisoner releases and a 30- to 60-day truce, in line with Witkoff’s proposal.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather possessions after an airstrike that hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEarlier this month, Israelblocked deliveries of aid from entering Gazaand cut off remaining electricity supplies in an effort to pressure Hamas.Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said the international community faced “a moral test”.“Either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,” Nunu said.The strikes come at a tense moment in Israeli domestic politics. Netanyahu said on Sunday he wouldfire Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, a controversial move that immediately prompted accusations of authoritarianism and plans for protests on Wednesday. Critics accuse Netanyahu of using war to reinforce the support of far-right allies for his coalition government and so maintain his own grip on power.Thousands of people took part in a protest in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night against Netanyahu’s plans to dismiss Bar, along with Gali Baharav-Miara, Israel’s attorney general, who is a fierce critic of the prime minister.Much of Gaza lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on 7 October 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages.The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins. Ninety per cent of houses are damaged or destroyed, and much of the population is displaced. Roads, hospitals, schools, sanitation systems and much else have been reduced to rubble.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I parked in front of our house, entered the yard and my wife greets me crying, shouting: ‘Petko, Petko, they announced on TV that you have died!’“I could not understand what she was telling me and what had happened. Then two of my friends called me. Being buried alive is quite stressful, really.” He also saw a lighter side, though. “When I heard the terrible news, I poured myself a small brandy,” he said.Arda’s players and those of their opponents, Levski Sofia, had stood by the centre circle with their heads bowed on Sunday, after being in receipt of erroneous information as to Ganchev’s mortal status.Club officials were made aware of their mistake and posted an apology on Facebook before the match had finished.“The management of PFC Arda would like to express a huge apology to the former Arda player Petko Ganchev and his relatives after the club received wrong information about his death,” the club wrote. “We wish Petko Ganchev many more years of good health and to enjoy the success of Arda.”Ganchev said Arda’s sporting director, Ivaylo Petkov, had phoned him to apologise, and he attempted to retain perspective on a situation he described as “not easy at all” to deal with.“So many people called me – relatives, friends, acquaintances and not so big acquaintances,” Ganchev said. “The situation was not pleasant, but in the end we have to be positive.“Look, sometimes such things happen. It is normal to spread a rumour here in the village, but they announced it in front of the whole football audience of Bulgaria.” The match ended 1-1.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballBulgarianewsShareReuse this content"

If the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, doesn’t approve an overdue budget for 2025 by 31 March, the government will be automatically dissolved and the country will hold early elections.For many in Israel, the overnight bombardment ofGaza, the deadliest since the early months of the war in 2023, was a clear sign Netanyahu had made a political decision about the future of the conflict.Campaigners for hostages still held in Hamas captivity attacked it as an immense betrayal. Ayala Metzger, whose father-in-law Yoram Metzger was kidnapped to Gaza and killed in Hamas captivity, challenged Smotrich in parliament on Tuesday.“There are deals on the table, and you are choosing to continue sacrificing more hostages and soldiers,” Metzger shouted at him in parliament, the Times of Israelreported. He ordered security to remove her, saying: “We paid [a price] too. Let’s not have a competition.”Nor did criticism come only from the left, or the families most directly traumatised by the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that began the war.Retired Maj Gen Amos Yadlin, former head of Israel’s military intelligence directorate, said that restarting the war while hostages were still in Gaza would undermine the military’s effectiveness in operations there and damage morale.“A responsible Israeli leader, who has no internal political consideration, would bring all the hostages back in one group, up front, [in return] for ending the war, and then will take care of the second goal of the war to dismantle Hamas,” he said in a briefing to journalists on Tuesday.“When Israeli reservists came [to serve] in October 2023, their main motivation was to bring back the hostages. Now someone has to convince them that the ground operation will bring back the hostages [alive], not bring them back dead. This is a tough job,” he added.Those cracks in morale have already started showing. The military announced on Tuesday it had dismissed a combat navigator from the reserves who said he would not report for duty in protest at the government’s conduct, the Haaretz newspaper reported. The air force said it was an isolated case, but some senior officials are concerned that others will follow suit.Netanyahu’sresistanceto a state commission of inquiry into failings on 7 October has added to anger inside Israel and fuelled critics who say he is managing the war for political rather than patriotic ends.The prime minister has always strongly rejected these accusations, arguing from the early days of the war that military pressure was the best way to bring hostages home – even though most of those who are back have returned in ceasefire deals – and that only the “total destruction” of Hamas would ensure Israel’s future security.His office blamed the militant group for the collapse in the ceasefire, saying it launched the strikes because the group “repeatedly” refused to release hostages, and rejected proposals from US envoy Steve Witkoff.The deal, always fragile and violated repeatedly by both parties, had slid into limbo this month after a deadline for the end of the first phase passed without any progress to a second phase.Netanyahu delayed starting negotiations on that second phase as scheduled in February, pushing instead to draw out the first stage. Yadlin said that had undermined Israel’s longer-term position.“I think Hamas would have broken [the] negotiations anyway, by a very, very tough position. But legitimacy is important, and if you sign an agreement you have to negotiate.”Regardless of motivation, the political dividends of restarting the war were clear almost immediately. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right party leader who quit his cabinet post in January over the ceasefire deal, announced his return to government within hours.He hailed the overnight attacks as “the right moral, ethical and justified step”, in a statement that suggested he expected them to be the start of a wider campaign. That was confirmed by foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who told visiting members of the US lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committeethat the overnight bombing was not part of a “one-day attack”.Evacuation orders issued for parts of Gaza suggested that Israel was preparing for a ground war, even if no decision has yet been made on sending troops in. Israel’s new chief of defence staff,Eyal Zamir, approved Gaza attack plans on his first dayin command earlier this month, Israeli media reported.The latest attack brought a chorus of condemnation from around the world, with close allies including the UK, the United Nations and humanitarian groups among those warning of the catastrophic consequences for over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.However, Saar said Washington was told about the strikes in advance and backed them. The US is Israel’s main supplier of weapons and its diplomatic protector in international forums such as the United Nations.Donald Trump has previously warned there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas didn’t release all the hostages. If he is onboard with a new phase of fighting, there may be little that Netanyahu’s domestic or international critics can do to quiet the guns.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But charities have said the changes will push more disabled people into poverty.These are the key changes announced on Tuesday:1.An overhaul of disability benefits to make only the most severely disabled eligibleAt the heart of the measures are changes to personal independence payments (Pips), paid to people with a disability regardless of their income or whether they are in work. These payments can vary depending on the severity of the disability, and claims have risen significantly in recent years.The government will legislate for a change in Pip so people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the “daily living element” from November 2026. It will not affect the mobility component.Scoring a four is a high bar. Needing prompting to prepare food, help with showering or washing and dressing the lower body, and needing help to engage with others are all measures that score below a four.Kendall said she had rejected other proposals, including plans to bring in vouchers rather than cash for disabled people, means-testing Pip or freezing it.2.Cuts for new claimants for the health top-up – but a rise in universal creditThe government says there is a “clear financial incentive to define yourself as incapable of work”. People who are permanently signed-off work because of sickness and receive the health top-up of universal credit receive more than twice as much as those looking for work.The government says it wants to rebalance this. The health top-up will be frozen for existing claimants and cut for new claimants. But to mitigate – although it will not fully compensate – there will be a permanent above-inflation rise to the standard rate of universal credit. That means a pay rise for everyone, intended to try to move towards equalising the benefits received for those who cannot work with those who are looking for work.Quick GuideWhat mental health and benefits support is available?ShowMental health support• Mind runs a support line on 0300 102 1234 as a safe and confidential place to talk openly.

It will be frozen for current claimants, in practice a real-terms cut.Kendall also said the government would consult on stopping people getting the health top-up for universal credit until they are 22.3.‘Right to try’ work for disabled people without going back for a benefits reassessmentThe government will legislate for a “right to try” work for disabled people, meaning they are not penalised if they attempt to work again. Kendall said it would mean guaranteeing that “work in and of itself will never lead to a benefit reassessment, giving people the confidence to take the plunge and try work without the fear this will put their benefits at risk”.4.Work capability assessment scrapped from 2028Kendall said the WCA to get the top health-related rate of universal credit was “complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants” and said it would be scrapped.Instead, extra financial support for health conditions in universal credit will be available solely through the Pip assessment so extra income is based on the impact of someone’s health condition or disability, not on their capacity to work.5.More face-to-face assessments for people claiming higher benefits for their disabilityKendall criticised the fact that face-to-face assessments under the Conservatives had fallen from seven in 10 to only one in 10.She said the government would shift the focus back to doing more face-to-face assessments and said they would be recorded.6.No reassessment for people with the most severe disabilitiesKendall said she wanted to end the stress and uncertainty for people with the most severe disabilities whose conditions would never improve. She said they would never be reassessed under the changes.In an acknowledgment of the stressful and punitive process that has been in place, she said she would fundamentally overhaul the Department for Work and Pensions’ safeguarding approach.7.Unemployment insurance could be paid at a higher rate than jobseeker’s allowanceKendall said the government would consult on merging jobseeker’s allowance and employment and support allowance, meaning those who have paid into the system can get higher benefit payments for a period of time.The proposal would introduce a time-limited unemployment insurance paid at a higher rate. Kendall said it would mean that for people who had paid in, “you’ll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track”.8.£1bn investment in new work programmes to get people back into jobsAfter a long battle with the Treasury, Kendall has won more funding for a programme of changes, including overhauling jobcentres and the role of work coaches. Kendall said the government needed to do “far more” to help people stay in work and get back to work, including more rights to work from home that would help people stay in jobs.Plans are being trialled for GPs to refer people to employment advisers rather than signing them off sick. There will also be a “keep Britain working” review led by the former John Lewis boss Charlie Mayfield, which will help establish what employers can do to keep disabled people in work.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsUniversal creditLiz Kendallkey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Graphics byLucy SwanandPaul ScrutonTue 18 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 11.44 EDTShareProspects for the US economy have cooled significantly in a matter of months. After outperforming its international peers last year, warning lights are flashing on a dashboard of economic indicators as analysts warn that Donald Trump’s erratic approach is hitting the world’s largest economy.Fears of aUS recession this year are growing, in what is being called a “Trumpcession”, amida sharp decline in business and consumer confidenceas the president threatens punitive import tariffs on US allies and enemies alike.Most economists reckon a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output – can be avoided. But it is clear there are storm clouds gathering within the president’s first 100 days back in the White House.GDPUS growth in gross domestic product (GDP) had outpaced international peers in recent years, and since the Covid pandemic in particular – helped by the Biden administration pumping billions of dollars into the economy through theInflationReduction Act. The former president did not get much credit, though, as voters felt the squeeze from the period of high inflation triggered by the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.Chart on GDP per capitaThis week, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’sGDPNow, which measures GDP economic growth in real time, suggested the US economy would contract at an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter. However, this widely followed indicator can be volatile, and it is heavily influenced by the US trade deficit, which soared in January.Chart on GDPNowTrade balanceThe US goods trade gap surged to $153.3bn in January. This was driven by record import volumes, an increase of $36.2bn to $329.5bn in total, as US businesses rushed to bring shipments into the country to avoid potential tariffs.Chart on the balance of tradeUS gold importsA significant driver of the import rise was inbound shipments of “finished metal shapes”, which include bars of gold. The trend is also attributed to traders rushing to get ahead of potential US tariffs. A widening trade deficit would normally weigh on a country’s GDP, because imports are subtracted from the measurement. But because gold bought to sit in a vault is not consumed or used in production, it is excluded.Chart showing the US imports of gold barsThis means the Atlanta Fed is likely to be overestimating the hit to first-quarter GDP. Still, there are other signs that theUS economyis cooling.InflationTrump had promised to “bring prices down, starting on day one” and “cut energy costs in half within 12 months after taking office”.Official figures show the headline annual rate as measured by the consumer price index was 2.8% in February, after an unexpected rise to 3% in January from 2.9% in December. Energy costs are down by 0.2% on an annual basis.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)said on Mondaythat Trump’s trade wars risked stoking inflation. It increased its US inflation forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, up from a previous estimate of 2.1% made in December.Chart on US inflationEmploymentThe US jobs market has boomed in recent years, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% in early 2023, the lowest level since the year of the first moon landing in 1969. The rate has ticked higher in recent months, but remains historically low at 4.1%. This has been spurred by rapid growth in the numbers of jobs being added to the economy.Wage growth has also strengthened, and has remained above inflation since early 2023, helping households to rebuild some of their purchasing power lost during the recent rise in living costs.Chart on the monthly change in employeesStocksThe US stock market has powered to record highs in recent years. Tech stocks and the “magnificent seven” – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – have led the charge in particular, buoyed up by investors betting on the growth of artificial intelligence.The Biden administration oversaw a strong stock market performance, helped by the economic recovery from the pandemic. However, Wall Street surged after Trump’s election victory in November, amid investor expectations for tax cuts that could increase company profits. Markets have been rattled in Trump’s first 100 days amid concerns over his erratic approach to the economy and the threat of tariffs hitting growth and stoking inflation.Chart on US stock marketsThe US dollarThe US dollar had been rising sharply against other leading currencies, reflecting the strength of the economy and investor concerns that Trump’s policies could stoke inflation. Tariffs pushing up the price of imported goods, driving up inflation, could force the US Federal Reserve to hold back from cutting interest rates.With inflation having fallen back, the Fed cut its benchmark rate last year by a whole percentage point – from a range between 5.25% and 5% to between 4.25% and 4.5%. Higher inflation could limit its capacity for further rate cuts.A dramatically slowing economy could force the central bank to take action to lower borrowing costs. This has led to a pullback in the dollar in recent weeks.Washington has long held a “strong dollar” policy in the view that it supports the purchasing power of US consumers, helping to keep inflation low. The dollar is also used as the currency of choice for world trade and underpins the financial system. The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has said this approach is not changing. But Trump has argued that a weaker dollar would benefit US manufacturing by making exports cheaper for overseas buyers.Chart on the dollarPrices of inputs for manufactured productsBusiness surveys have shown a marked increase in input costs for US manufacturers, providing an early warning sign for growth and inflation. The price gauge on the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) shows raw material costs rose sharply at the start of this year, in the first signs of supplier difficulties and discussions about who will pay for tariffs. The rise in input costs could dent US manufacturing output, and is likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for finished goods.Chart on prices of inputs for manufactured productsConsumer spendingUS consumer spending unexpectedly dropped in January for the first time in almost two years, with a fall of 0.2%, the biggest decrease in nearly four years. Cold temperatures in some parts of the country, as well as wildfires in California, were likely to have hit spending. However, some analysts warn consumer sentiment has taken a knock amid mounting concern over the strength of the economy.Chart on US consumer spendingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyGlobal economyStock marketsGoldInflationInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

If only it had waited for their trial …Jack SealeTue 18 Mar 2025 18.05 EDTShareLeaving Neverland,Dan Reed’s 2019 film, which laid out accusations that the singer Michael Jackson sexually abused children, is among the most impactful and important documentaries of the past 10 years; the view of one of the 20th century’s biggest stars irreversibly changed, as rumour and innuendo were replaced by a detailed narrative that was hard for all but Jackson’s most committed fans to doubt. As well as altering Jackson’s reputation for ever, Leaving Neverland offered a wider look at how abusers groom their victims, why those victims can choose to protect their abuser, and how and why the parents of victims might fail to protect their child.It was also about the extremes of fame. His celebrity allowed Jackson to bewitch young fans, and disarm families who would otherwise have balked at an adult stranger befriending their child. It gave him the drivers, bodyguards, hotel suites and mansions he needed to spend time with young boys. (Nobody denies that a series of children were alone with him for long periods, and shared his bed, although his estate strongly denies all allegations of sexual abuse.) And his fame gave him the power to settle lawsuits. It helped Jackson deflect public suspicion too, since it was just about plausible for his eccentrically childlike persona to include being seen with a string of pre-pubescent companions. The mega-famous can hide in plain sight.Leaving Neverland review – astonishing accounts of Michael Jackson’s sexual abuseRead moreLeaving Neverland 2: SurvivingMichael Jacksonis another film about life in the public eye, but this time the world’s gaze is on Jackson’s two accusers from the original film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck. The story starts in 2013 when Robson appears on US television to make his claims, and extends for the next decade and beyond as Robson and Safechuck seek redress in court, a process made more complicated by the lag between the alleged abuse and the accusation – about 20 years – and by the fact that Jackson died in 2009.The two men have to overcome legal arguments, which are initially successful, that their claims are beyond the statute of limitations and that they cannot be directed at Jackson’s estate or at the company that still handles his affairs, MJJ Productions. When Leaving Neverland is released in 2019, they also face a wave of vitriol and misinformation from Jackson supporters and media agitators who know nothing about the facts of the case, but earn a kick or a buck from posing as experts. The reaction to Leaving Neverland forms the most memorable section of Leaving Neverland 2: there is an extraordinary clip of Robson and Safechuck appearing on a show hosted by Oprah Winfrey, herself an abuse survivor, who praises them for their courage while warning them of the negative reaction they are about to endure.The new film, however, struggles to deal with how comprehensive the old one was. Although Safechuck talks movingly here about reconnecting with the younger version of himself, fighting for that boy’s interests and wondering what he would say to him, the obvious topics for a film about the aftermath – the difficulty survivors of abuse have with forming adult relationships, the pain of maintaining a relationship with the parents who didn’t step in, the lifelong anguish of those parents – were all covered in Leaving Neverland.‘I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had armed people say they’ll shoot’ – Dan Reed on the fallout from his Michael Jackson filmsRead moreSo we are left with the somewhat dry legal battle. Robson and Safechuck have their case thrown out, so they appeal, helped by the release of Leaving Neverland contributing to a change in the law regarding abuse victims belatedly speaking out. The tale culminates in a recording of a Zoom hearing – luckily a split-screen video call is as visually engaging as courtroom footage would have been – in which the MJJ Productions lawyer is dressed down and tripped up by visibly annoyed judges. But we’ve gone through a lot of arcane legalities to get to this point. The film’s closing caption tells us that the big trial, as opposed to these pernickety preliminaries establishing whether there is a case to answer, will take place in 2026. Leaving Neverland 2, which has arrived six years after the original film, might as well have waited seven.We also feel the absence of the other side of the debate. While Leaving Neverland could be forgiven for setting out the accusers’ testimony without peppering it with denials from their more powerful opponent, it would be useful now to hear from MJJ Productions. Reed shows us a letter where he begs them to participate in this new film – he highlights a paragraph where he literally writes: “I’m begging you.” Their refusal means the question of who knew what within Jackson’s staff can’t properly be explored. Reed has done fine work in telling us a highly significant story, but at this stage there is not enough more of it to tell.Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichael JacksonreviewsShareReuse this content"

It sold more than 2.7m copies in its first week, according to theNew York Times. Across the US, fanslined upin the cold outside of Target stores to nab special edition copies. In the UK, there were midnight-releasepartieswhere attendees wore costumes, made friendship bracelets and applied dragon-themed temporary tattoos.The Empyrean series is a prime example ofromantasy– a genre that blends high fantasy and romance. It follows the cadet Violet Sorrengail as she trains to be a dragon rider. Fast-paced and detailed, the books boast mythical creatures and magic. There’s also a lot of sex. On more than one occasion, sturdy wooden furniture is broken during vigorous bouts of lovemaking. Violet climaxes every time with her generous lover, Xaden. Violet and Xaden’s dragons are mates – and they have sex too.Romantasy has exploded in popularity in recent years. It’s also lucrative. In May 2024, Bloomsbury publishing announced that it had itshighest sales yearever thanks in large part to Sarah J Maas, whose romantasy series A Court of Thorns and Roses (known by fans as Acotar), Crescent City and Throne of Glass saw a 161% sales increase in the 2023-2024 fiscal year.View image in fullscreenCosplayers posing as A Court of Thorns and Roses characters during New York Comic Con 2023.Photograph: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for ReedPopFans say it’s easy to get hooked. Emily Porter, a photographer based in West Virginia, started reading romantasy in the summer of 2024. She had never been a big romance fan, but loved fantasy stories. “I was seeing those Acotar books everywhere – in stores and on friends’ Instagram stories – so I figured I’d see what all the fuss was about,” she says.Although Porter had been an avid reader as a teenager, after college she didn’t read much – maybe 10 books a year. She finished all five books of the Acotar series in less than a week. Then, she began tearing through other romantasy series. In the eight months since she first cracked open Acotar, she says she has read nearly 150 fantasy romance books.“I went from being embarrassed about not reading books at all to being embarrassed about reading over 20 books a month,” Porter says.Highly sexual fantasy stories are nothing new. But romantasy is part of arecent waveof entertainment that makes sex look not just enjoyable, but fun for women. The genre tends to have strong, opinionated heroines; hot male protagonists who ask about consent; diverse characters; queer storylines; and mutually enjoyable couplings.View image in fullscreenWomen have told sex therapist Vanessa Marin that romantasy books have encouraged them to explore their sexuality.Photograph: Vanessa MarinAnd for some of its readers, it’s improving their real, non-magical sex lives.Vanessa Marin, asex therapistand host of the podcast Pillow Talks, says she started reading romantasy novels because so many of her clients and followers were talking about them: “It got to a point where it was a professional obligation.” She’s heard from a lot of readers who say their lives and relationships have benefited from romantasy.“I’ve had a lot of women tell me: ‘Previously, I felt like I had low libido or even no libido, and these books feel like they’re bringing me back to life,’” Marin says.Reading about sex causes readers to think about sex more. This in turn causes them to desire it more. “It’s keeping sex top of mind,” she explains.Women have told Marin the books have encouraged them to explore their sexuality in ways they haven’t before, whether it’s trying out a new position they read about, or centering their own pleasure during sex like many of the genre’s protagonists do.Porter says romantasy hasn’t changed her sex life, but it’s reinforced her confidence in her own long-term relationship. “The tropes and elements I love the most all remind me of my own relationship with my partner,” she says.Dragons, magicians and fairies abound in romantasy, but the genre’s recent explosion has produced more unusual stories. One of Porter’s favorite authors, Mallory Dunlin, wrote a book called The Gardener and the Water-horse, which, according to Porter, features “an immortal being who can shift into a man, and a horse, but really he’s a lake – like a body of water – who’s also a virgin”.These playful, surreal, magical elements are part of what makes romantasy so appealing, Marin says. “Most of us tend to take sex very seriously, so to have something that feels fun, playful, lighthearted and whimsical, that’s a really great thing for a lot of people.”Romantasy isn’t the only kind of horny escapism consumers are flocking to. The first three series of Bridgerton are three of Netflix’s 10most popular showsof all time. Romantic TV leads like Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Katherine Moennig (The L Word) and Lucien Laviscount (Emily in Paris) voice breathy episodes for the audio erotica app Quinn, which describes itself as “created by women, for the world”.In Laviscount’s episode, the Regent, he voices Peter Kelly, a notorious jewel thief who “recalls a series of thrilling encounters with fellow thief Katerina Laszlo”. Moennig voices Sam Shaw, a reclusive rockstar “and you are tasked with ghostwriting her memoir”.Quinn’s listenersreportedlytune in for 24m minutes every month. On aReddit forumdedicated to discussing the app, users say the content helps them explore and reconnect with their sexuality. “[Quinn] literally woke me up,” wrote one user. “I thought my libido had mostly gone to sleep.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the recent content that shows women enjoying sex is made by women. When sex scenes are “produced or written by a woman, that’s really different than when it’s written or produced by a man”, says Christina Marshall, abookstagramexpert and self-described “romantasy fiend”. Erotic content produced by women tends to foreground women’s desire and consent, she says.The sex also tends to be safe. Faye Keegan, CEO and co-founder of Dipsea, another audio erotica app (“stories made by women, for women”), says their content shows situations that are sexually, emotionally and physically safe for women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s not a villain in this story”.Nevertheless, stories that feature sexually aggressive or very persistent male suitors are also popular. For instance, a lot of male romantasy heroes are possessive and hyper-fixated on their partners. When Xander sees Violet talking with her ex-boyfriend in Onyx Storm, for example, he uses his magical shadow powers to slam the ex into a wall.Marshall says these characteristics are green flags in a fantasy book, but red flags in real life. “I don’t actually want some stalker, ultra-possessive person,” she says. She argues that these characteristics are an exaggerated way of showing a man’s devotion.“In a fantasy book, he’s going to burn down the whole world and kill all these people for you,” she says. “In reality, you just want someone who’s going to put your best interests first.”Many romantasy fans say the genre doesn’t get the respect it deserves. Marshall recalls being at a reading where a man described Acotar as “fairy smut”. (The protagonists of the series are faeries – hot, immortal magical beings – and there is a lot of sex.) The comment annoyed Marshall. “What makes you think that this epic fantasy is fairy smut, when you would never call Game of Thrones dragon smut?” she says. To her, it is part of a “longstanding pattern of dismissing anything women love as frivolous”.View image in fullscreenChristina Marshall says Instagram and BookTok have taken romantasy to a new level.Photograph: Christina MarshallThe idea that romance books were some sort of low-brow, shameful pastime was never accurate, says Leah Koch, co-owner of the Ripped Bodice, the first romance bookstore to open in the United States. “[Media] was pushing that narrative, but it is not really true.”Still, romance connoisseurs acknowledge that this moment is different. Koch says that in the 10 years she’s been running the Ripped Bodice, she’s seen readers attitudes shift from “proud, but insular”, to “yelling from the rooftops, and saying: ‘If this is something you have a problem with, you’re the weird one.’”Marshall says Instagram and BookTok – TikTok users who post videos about books – have taken romance and romantasy to a new level. BookTok was key to the supersonic success ofMaasandColleen Hoover, theauthorof It Ends With Us, for example. “It became a new forum for readers to connect, and amplified a conversation globally that existed already, but was happening in the privacy of our homes.”In addition to this bottom-up pressure, Keegan, of Dipsea, says there have been more women in positions of power bringing these stories to broader audiences. “Bridgerton is a great example,” she says. “Shonda Rhimes had the budget and the sway to make that kind of content. These stories aren’t new, but being able to bring this big-budget Netflix experience, that’s what’s new.”Curious about sex parties? Here’s what they’re really likeRead moreFantasy and period pieces also offer a much needed form of escape at a time when women’shealth,safety,gender identity,sexualityandreproductive rightsare being widely threatened.“The shittier things get on earth, the more people want to go fly with dragons and divorce themselves from reality,” says Koch. Contemporary romance – where two regular people with charmingly twee jobs meet and fall in love – isn’t enough of an escape anymore. “Sure, he’s a cute baker and she owns a flower shop and whatever, but still, you wonder if his mom voted for Trump,” Koch says.The desire for female-centered romantic and erotic content doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.Expertspredict genre fiction like romantasy will continue to grow in popularity. Netflix recently shared asneak peekof Bridgerton season 4, and a Fourth Wing TV series inearly stagesof development.“The real world is exhausting and stressful,” says Porter. “I’d rather spend my free time being immersed in fantastical worlds with creative magic systems, adventures, happy endings, and best of all – yearning.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyRomance booksRomance filmsFantasy booksSarah J MaasSexWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a fair bet that when Liz Kendall was elected to parliament in 2010, she never imagined that one day she would be giving a statement to the Commons as work and pensions secretary thatincluded a £5bn cut to the welfare budget. It’s not generally the type of thing that Labour members get into politics for. But time, ambition and pragmatism all play their part. And, on Tuesday, that moment arrived for Liz.We were at the tail end of the five stages of grief. The denial. This wasn’t really happening to her. The anger when she realised it was really happening to her. There was no way of avoiding her destiny. The bargaining. Perhaps she could spin this as a good thing. Yes, that was it. Cuts were a moral force for good. She would be helping people in ways they didn’t know they needed helping. Depression. Who wouldn’t stare into the abyss given her choices? Finally, acceptance. It was what it was. A shitty job but someone had to do it. So she might as well try to enjoy herself.Kendall wasn’t short of outriders. Though you couldn’t be sure how many of her cabinet colleagues were there just to offer moral support. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves may also have been there to make sure Liz had no last-minute wobbles and missed out the bits about the cuts.Wes Streetingwas revelling in his newfound role as enforcer. Wes has never yet met a scrounger with anxiety and depression whom he couldn’t shout at and bully back into work.The others, not so much. Angela Rayner was fairly inscrutable. Not all the changes were entirely to her taste. Ed Miliband and Bridget Phillipson also looked as if they would rather be elsewhere. They consoled themselves with the knowledge that at least they didn’t have to be Liz and go through a two-hour ordeal at the dispatch box. Though their turn may one day come.Meanwhile, theLabourbackbenches were packed. Full of MPs hoping for the best, but fearing the worst. Only 30 Tories were in situ on the opposite side of the house. This wasn’t their fight. They have no real interest in people who are out of work or disabled. Other than to make life worse for them.2:05Liz Kendall unveils Labour's 'action to fix the broken benefits system' – videoLiz started off at a canter, as if sounding like she believed this stuff would make it true. It was a successful strategy. Because, by the end, she spoke with the conviction of the newly converted, pleased also to have got out alive. This was her big day out as one of the grownups and she had passed the test. Her reward was a pat on the shoulder from Starmer.We began with the positives. The good news story. She was ambitious for the country. She wanted everyone to feel as good about their work as she did. Though she understood that not everyone could have her job of wanting people to feel good about themselves. This was beginning to get almost meta. People were being denied the dignity of work by a system that everyone knew was being scammed by many. There were some, she graciously accepted, who could not work. They would still be taken care of. Cue muted cheers from her own backbenchers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone under the age of 22 would be prevented from claiming health top-ups for universal credit. Yes. Liz had been informed that a young person could never be properly described as disabled until they were at least 22. There would also be cuts to personal independent payments combined with a new assessment regime. Anyone with mental health problems or a disability would be placed on a stool and immersed underwater. Those who drowned were genuine claimants. Those who survived were trying to cheat the system and would be denied payments. Simple. The old ones are still the best.After that, we were all in need of a good laugh. Fortunately Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, was on hand to oblige. Her response to Kendall will give her nightmares for years to come. Not just the outright derision from Labour MPs but her own MPs holding their heads in their hands in disbelief. It’s just as well Helen had never been asked to do a work capacity assessment as she would have failed miserably. She has missed out on a lifetime on benefits.Whately had just one job. To try to drive a wedge between Kendall and her largely sceptical backbenchers. Instead, she – temporarily at least – bound them tightly together. To call her hapless is to be too generous. That adjective is reserved for Kemi Badenoch, who was off giving yet another pointless speech that no one was listening to because it coincided with a major announcement in the Commons.“Everything is a mess,” said Whately. But also, somehow, OK. The welfare bill was too high and yet she had forgotten who had been in power for much of the past 15 years. “Governing is hard,” she sobbed, as she listed all the things she would have liked to have done but somehow never did. Everything was too little, too late. She wanted the cuts to go deeper, but she didn’t know where. This was either a very public suicide note. Or a sophisticated resignation speech. Maybe she’s already had enough of opposition.The Labour responses to the statement could be filed more under sorrow than in anger. Though no less dangerous for Kendall for that. Some did accept the need for an overhaul of a system so open to abuse, but none could bring themselves to welcome the cuts. The list of dissenters was as long as your arm. Debbie Abrahams, Clive Lewis, Clive Efford, Florence Eshalomi and Rachael Maskell among them. Starmer may find he has a substantial rebellion on his hands when the bill eventually gets a second reading.As for the handful of Tories in the chamber, their contributions varied from the curious to the insane. Esther McVey wondered what jobs disabled people and young people would be doing given that the labour market was contracting. She had a point. One million low-paid jobs aren’t going to appear out of nowhere. Harriett Baldwin wanted reassurance that terminally ill people wouldn’t be made to work, while Mark Pritchard thought she would pack the armed forces with disabled people. It’s a thought.All the while, Kendall only grew in confidence. Frequently mistaking criticism for support. Maybe she was expecting worse. Still, it worked for her. If she wasn’t fully on board with her changes at the beginning of her statement, she clearly was by the end.Explore more on these topicsWelfareThe politics sketchLiz KendallWes StreetingLabourBenefitsDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

He wanted to talk about young male violence towards women and he had two stipulations: he wanted to do it in a series of single shots, and he didn’t want to blame the parents.Adolescence review – the closest thing to TV perfection in decadesRead moreI enthusiastically got involved and suggested we write together. At first, we didn’t know why Jamie, the perpetrator of the attack, did it. We knew he wasn’t a product of abuse or parental trauma. But we couldn’t figure out a motive. Then someone I work with, Mariella Johnson, said: “I think you should look into ‘incel’ culture.”I expected to be confronted by anger and aggression; what I didn’t expect was to quickly grasp the attraction of the so-called “manosphere”. I knew almost immediately that if I was an isolated kid, I would find answers as to why I felt a bit lost. One of the central ideas – that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men – would have made adolescent me sit up and, frankly, nod. The path then becomes: what do you do to upset that equation? How do you manipulate and harm in order to reset a female-dominated world that works against you? If you believe one part of the logic, the other half becomes conducive.The only episode Stephen left me alone with was episode three. He said to write a two-hander that looked into Jamie’s mind. Writing it, I was shocked at how much of Jamie I had in me. His pain, his anger, contains sides of me I didn’t want to see. He comes from a good background, like me; he’s a bright boy, like I was. The key difference between us? He had the internet to read at night whereas I had Terry Pratchett and Judy Blume.View image in fullscreen‘Katie’s loss is the apex of the tragedy, but I hope it’s OK to say that Jamie is a tragedy, too’ … Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixJamie is not a simple product of the “manosphere”. He is a product of parents that didn’t see, a school that couldn’t care and a brain that didn’t stop him. Put 3,000 kids in the same situation and they wouldn’t do what he did. Yet spend any time on forums on 4chan or Reddit, spend any time on most social media platforms and you end up, quite quickly, in some dark spaces. Parents can try to regulate this, schools can stop mobile phone access but more needs to be done. There should be government support because the ideas being expressed are dangerous in the wrong hands and young brains aren’t equipped to cope with them.My son is almost nine. In two years’ time he will be begging me for a smartphone. By that point, 60-70% of his class will have phones. Do I say no and isolate him? I can put controls in, but I’m not digitally sophisticated; my 12-year-old nephew already runs rings around me. I have seen what he could see and I don’t know how to stop him seeing it. I know I’m in the same position as hundreds of thousands of parents worrying about these things.Josh MacAlister’s protection of children (digital safety and data protection) bill originally proposed banning phones in schools and introducing a digital age of consent that would ban social media use until 16. This was watered down, for reasons I’m unsure of, and by the second reading what was decisive had become discursive. Instead of legislation, the government has committed only to an assessment when the problems of the present are so clear.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreIf it was my decision, I would be talking of smartphones like cigarettes and issuing an outright ban on all use by under-16s, but if that isn’t possible the digital age of consent is a fine alternative. In Australia, social media companies will be liable for fines of up to £25m if they don’t systematically stop children younger than 16 from holding accounts; in France and Norway there arerestrictions up to 15. We need to do something similarly radical here.What you hope when you make a piece of social realism is to create a conversation. We wanted to make something that people want to watch, of course, but we also wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament. This show is a tragedy. Katie’s loss is the apex of that tragedy, but I hope it’s OK to say that Jamie is a tragedy, too. We will not solve the problem by kicking this issue into the long grass. This requires urgent action. I hope the government is brave enough to reconsider it.Adolescence is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionJack ThorneStephen GrahamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But mostly the game leaves you alone to enjoy feudal Japan.In this fraught time period, there is a sense of constant danger, each conversation like careful steps on a knife’s edge. The story is complete fiction of course, but it does weave around actual historical events and figures, and the developers at Ubisoft have clearly gone to great pains to make the settings feel authentic, both landscapes and the people who inhabit them. You’ll automatically remove your shoes when entering a building, and famous temples appear as they would have looked then, rather than as the tourist destinations they are now.The world truly is gorgeous, with several provinces to explore in all seasons and weathers, and period-accurate cities including Kyoto and Osaka. Giant temples rise up over busy towns full of stalls and workshops, while mossy shrines are scattered along winding paths through the countryside. You’ll see Japan in all colours, too, from the gentle pinks of spring’s sakura blooms, to the fiery-coloured leaves blanketing the hills in autumn, to the inky darkness of a winter’s night. It’s easy to be distracted by the view mid-mission when you’re surrounded by ancient red torii gates, or notice a random puppet performance in the street. Ubisoft’s Japan feels alive. It also feels totally overwhelming, at times.As much fun as it is to roam the countryside on horseback, scouting out new villages and historic sites, there’s just so much of it that it’s easy to feel lost. There are plenty of missions and side quests that will guide you around the map, but there’s a lot of repetition in those tasks. To kill a high-level samurai you will need some help; the person who can help you wants a favour, which involves findinganotherperson who wants you to kill adifferentsamurai, and so on. Over the game’s long run time, this starts to grate.View image in fullscreenImportant feature: you can pet all the cats (and dogs) in Japan if you want.Photograph: UbisoftThe dual protagonists do help to alleviate the feeling that you’re stuck in a repetitive loop. For the first 10 to 15 hours of the game, you’ll step into the sandals of shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe, a young woman seeking revenge after her home was destroyed, and help her to rebuild her life and set up a network of spies and rebels from a secret mountain base. Then there’s Yasuke, a principled black samurai based on the real historical figure of the same name, who appears briefly in the game’s introduction, then disappears until Naoe gets close to Nobunaga.Naoe is light on her feet, capable of scaling walls and temples with ease, while also melting into shadows to creep around enemies. Her stealthy approach makes for some fun sneaky moments, such as stabbing through paper shoji screen-doors for a surprise attack. That tip-toe approach comes at a cost, though, when she’s faced with a brawl. Enemy strikes hit her hard and she’ll quickly get overpowered in a fight. Yasuke, on the other hand, is brutally strong, and capable of running straight through those screen doors and shrugging off sword strikes like they’re a tickly irritant. He can still assassinate foes like Naoe can, but he does it head-on rather than in the shadows. In a series that has traditionally prioritised stealth, it feels extremely liberating when you bust through a castle’s gate and face everyone head on. Both characters are viable options to play through most of the game and you can swap between them (mostly) at will.View image in fullscreenFew other games have done such a good job with this setting … Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.Photograph: UbisoftUnfortunately, no matter whom you play as, you’ll have to put up with a few niggles in a fight. While dodges and parries feel amazing when you can pull them off in one-on-one scraps, you’ll often find yourself surrounded as more opponents are alerted to your presence, which makes it really tricky to see where hits are coming from. When you’re creeping around castle rooftops and taking your time picking enemies off, springing backwards into the shadows afterwards before scoping out your next kill, everything feels as it should. But the instant you get into a fight on the ground it starts to feel messy and frustrating.‘It’s been a challenge’: Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the quest to bring feudal Japan to lifeRead moreWhile I did find myself getting annoyed running back and forth between quest givers, I still can’t stop thinking about Shadows. Excellent performances and emotionally resonant moments, such as Naoe’s painful recovery after she loses everything she holds dear, mean you’ll feel every bit of sorrow and anger alongside the game’s heroes. Events are often troubling, as power struggles between lords often come at a huge cost to locals, and you see the unwelcome effects of your actions on your allies.Few other games have done such a good job with this setting, as you run through lush bamboo forests before scaling ancient castle walls and sneaking inside to steal treasures. These moments of brilliance more than compensate for its weaker points.Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is released on 20 March; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

So five years ago, whenschools were told to closeand lessons went online, a siren went off inside her.“The lockdown terrified me,” she said. The government’s planning was focused on keeping children safe, but many were at increased risk from domestic and family abuse at home. The introduction of online schooling, meanwhile, broke the hard-earned social contract between schools and parents “for a lifetime”.Schools are still dealing with “terrifyingly high levels of school avoidance”, said Easthope. But where once parents and teachers worked together to help a school-refusing child back into class, suddenly there were parents who could no longer see the value of school.Five years on the fallout continues. Uncertainty, increased inequality, accelerated screen use and crippling anxiety are just a few of the Covid legacies affecting children and young people. Covid babies are now five and struggling to meet basic developmental milestones; 1.6 million children in England are still persistently absent from school; and students whose university years were stolen by the pandemic are still struggling with low mental health.Graph of school absencesFelix*was in his second year at university when the pandemic struck. His campus closed, lectures went online and his international student flatmates left the UK. He was alone and is still counting the cost.“There’s a stark difference between me before and after,” he said. “Outwardly I might appear the same but the profound loneliness of those two years stunted my social development. I feel massively let down. Those two years, I remember almost nothing.”Major milestones passed by almost unnoticed. “My 20th birthday I had a couple of glasses of champagne in the front garden with family. My 21st was two mates in the back garden.”Faith in those in charge was damaged. “I feel robbed by government and by the university. My ability to form relationships has been affected. I’m almost 25 and I’ve no idea what I want to do,” Felix said.How Covid changed the way Britain thinksRead moreEasthope said: “It all comes back to calling this what it was. It was a disaster. We are all disaster survivors now. We were told for a period of time to be terrified, so there was this growth of the anxious parent because we gave them every bloody reason to be anxious.”For many that anxiety never went away. “I saw a mum run behind a child the other day who was about six. She said: ‘Rachel, Rachel, your rucksack is open.’ It was really dramatic, really hyperbolic. What I recognised in that mum was something I’m so used to seeing in disaster survivors – we’ve taken away their sense of safety. People are on edge.”Simultaneously the relationship between children and screens changed irrevocably. Easthope remembers seeing her five-year-old with three devices open in front her to access online lessons during lockdown. “It was our laptop she was talking through, she had to load things on a tablet and she had a phone as well. I just felt this desperate sinking feeling about what we had just done.”View image in fullscreenA notice outside a closed school in West Bridgford, Nottingham, in March 2020.Photograph: Tim Goode/PAWhile many schools are now trying to take children’s phones away from them, Easthope, an international adviser on disaster response and recovery and the bestselling author ofWhen the Dust Settles, says there are 18- and 19-year-olds who simply “cannot exist without technology. They cannot imagine putting [their phone] away.”The children’s commissioner for England, the former headteacher Rachel de Souza, has been at the heart of efforts to get children back in school since lockdown and has highlighted the online safety issues that have become apparent since young people were asked to move their lessons and social lives online. The “tsunami” of mental health problems affecting children since lockdown – one in five experience a common mental health problem such as anxiety or depression – remains a huge concern.De Souza is worried that children do not feel those in powerare listening, and fears the consequences that follow. “What I’m seeing is a surge of interest online in populism and the Reform party among young people,” said De Souza. She also flagged an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, among young people – the legacy of sexual health clinics closing during Covid and interruptions to sex education in school.Graph showing disadvantaged pupils falling further behind“The Covid-19 pandemic brought uncertainty to all our lives, but for children it disrupted their education, routines and social connections in ways we are still coming to understand,” said De Souza.“Despite that, this is not a cynical generation. They saw their communities rally together with acts of kindness, and volunteers provide essential lifelines for people in isolation.“For some, extra help is still needed to help them start regularly attending school again, to socialise confidently with their friends, or to overcome trauma – and for too many this has not been available.“Many children facelong waits for mental health care, there is poor oversight of children still missing from education and robust regulation of online spaces is needed urgently as children spend increasing amounts of time on the internet.“It is more important than ever,” she concluded, “to listen to [children’s] voices and involve them in decisions that shape their future and the country’s recovery.”The children’s laureate, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, sees an analogy between children’s experiences of the pandemic and child evacuees in the second world war. “My mum was evacuated to north Wales, and one night she and her sisters were taken up on to a roof and shown a red glow in the sky across the water, and they were told, ‘That’s Liverpool in flames’. She’s dead now but she was still talking about that into her 80s.”View image in fullscreenThe relationship between children and screens changed irrevocably during Covid.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockAlthough she had happy memories of evacuation, that terrifying image of her home city burning remained with her. It is the same with Covid. “After anything like this, there’s always a period of forgetting. But kids won’t have forgotten they were frightened. They won’t forget that their parents were scared, that’s a huge thing.”Soon after lockdown, Cottrell-Boyce asked teachers what had changed. “They’re still a bit like toddlers,” one teacher told him. They can’t share. They’re bad at losing. Musical statues, duck, duck, goose – we can barely get through a game without an outburst.”He added: “They wouldn’t sing – that’s the one that broke my heart.” Visiting schools since, he said the most striking legacy was the uncertainty. “Stuff that you and I grew up thinking was as unnegotiable as the weather [like going to school] is suddenly negotiable for the cohort that’s gone through.”He wants to be optimistic. “I really hope kids will carry forward with them into the future the sense of community and the knowledge that there very much is such a thing as society. That the things that connect us are more durable than the things that divide us.”Helen Dodd, a professor of child psychology at the University of Exeter and an expert in children’s play, said the lockdown reminded people of the importance of children playing together, a small but important win. She warned however that non-attendance at school would have long-term consequences. “If they’re not in school they’re missing out on their education and that has long-term impacts in terms of what the rest of their life opportunities look like.”Adults have largely gone back to what they always did. “We’ve stopped appreciating that, for our children, they can’t go back to being four and do that year again.” Life events during childhood “lay the foundations of who we are and how we see ourselves”. They cannot be easily replaced.Anne Longfield was the children’s commissioner for England when Covid struck. She said children’s vulnerabilities – poor mental health, poverty, the attainment gap between rich and poor, and unmet special needs – were increasing even before the pandemic after years of austerity. Covid “poured rocket fuel” on them, and the subsequent cost of living crisis compounded this.“There’s a generation of children who’ve lost faith in the predictability of life and lost faith in normality remaining the same. It’s an uncertainty that they now live with, and that’s enormous really, isn’t it?”*Name changedExplore more on these topicsCoronavirusHow Covid changed usYoung peopleChildrenSchoolsChildren's healthTeachingMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Has the great dealmaker been building up … the wrong nation?Tue 18 Mar 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTShareNaturally I assumed the feeling would pass, but one whole week after the US president turned the lawn of the White House into acrappy car dealership, I keep finding myself feeling … optimistic. I know, I know. But if anything, I find myself feeling a little bit more optimistic every day – and sometimes a lot more. Not for America, which keeps electing him, but for the rest of the world. It really would take a heart of stone for governments from Beijing to Delhi to Warsaw to look at the clip of this old guy trying to sell his friend’s electric cars and not think: “Ooooooooh, that is very, very bad vibes. Still, it’s good for us!”In China they have ironically nicknamed Trump “the nation builder”, meaning he is doing an incredible, bigly impressive job of bolstering the Chinese nation. Not to be disrespectful to that ancient golf bore holding the little piece of paper listing hiscar salesman talking pointsand gibbering “everything is computer”… but can this guy even organise an oligarchy? He’s certainly making his precious stock market run, stricken, in the direction of the nearest bathroom.As for Trump’s genius henchmogul Elon Musk, Tesla’s share price has halved over the past three months, with the FT reporting today that hedge fund short sellers have made$16.2bn betting against it. Last week a JP Morgan noteattempted to contextualisetheir grimly downgraded outlook for the firm: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.” Listen, I’ll take their expert word for it. But I feel like even I can think of something similar in the history of the social media industry. Last year the entrepreneur and professorScott Galloway observed of Xsince Musk’s purchase of it: “No company over $1bn in revenue has ever lost 60% of its revenues in a 12 month period in a non-war period. I don’t think that’s ever happened. Twitter is literally the worst-performing business in history since a change in ownership.”Admittedly, as is now clear, X was a political project for Musk, so perhaps that was a strategic haemorrhaging of value. It certainly bought him a keyboard army, albeit one that doesn’t appear to have a whole lot better to do all day than suck anonymously up to him. Indeed, for having the temerity to post this article on X, I expect a number of rape and death threats from Maga folk who are now, like some cowboy-booted modern take on the poor East Germans, being told to buy one type of car. Even worse, it’s one of the electric type, that until very recently they were formally required to dismiss as soyboymobiles. So look, I understand: mandated ideological 180s are very upsetting. And in any case, I always threaten to rape and kill people when I’m winning an argument.In the weeks after the Trump administration got under way, the pace at which it was smashing, cutting, or walking away from things at first seemed discombobulating, frightening – even tragic. And it remains so for many Americans. But here outside the US, the alternative view is that it has saved many years, potentially decades, of the various factions of the rest of the world dithering away while thinking “Maybe we should get it together? Then again, how would we get it together? We should probably get it together … ” Thanks to the Nation Builder™, everyone is simplyhavingto get it together, and fast. Defence is obviously the toughest issue, and suggesting otherwise is a level of facetiousness to which even this column couldn’t aspire. But it’s not undoable, mainly because it can’t be. Meanwhile, stripping out the various moral dimensions, where is the money really going to flow? Towards countries like the one building factories where they make batteries that cancharge a car in five minutes(sorry, Elon) and are so big you have to fly over them – or the one where the leader turned the seat of power into a garage forecourt?Sometimes you don’t need to be steeped in every economic and geopolitical detail to get a macrotrends gut feeling. Let’s face it, all that the White House lawn spectacle lacked was one of those flailing inflatable tube men that entice/terrify potential customers. And I felt something similar again yesterday, watching the White House press secretary reveal herself as one of those countless modern idiots who have only heard of one war in history (the second world one) – and who don’t even understand that. Yesterday,Karoline Leavitt could be found declaring: “It’s only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now.” Bless! Taking a slightly longer look into history, I think America owed France a favour before it was the other way around. But getting lost in these stoopid yesteryear arguments is not really something winners do, is it? Anyone speaking at the superpower podium should at least give the impression of having bigger fish to fry.On a local level, I’ve no idea whether the UK will be one of the nations Trump accidentally ends up building. On recent form, and with our proven propensity for taking dumb decisions and electing limited or actively awful leaders, you wouldn’t put a whole load of money on it. But opportunities in a world that America has chosen to put in flux are openly presenting themselves. I can’t help feeling that fortune will favour those who are blithely pushing on with it, not plaintively pushing cars literally in their own back yard.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsTeslaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Where will his perpetual war lead next?Simon TisdallIsrael, backed by a capricious Donald Trump, never intended to honour the ceasefire. These airstrikes mark a dire new phase in the conflictTue 18 Mar 2025 11.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 11.55 EDTShareThe first and last rule of Benjamin Netanyahu’s doctrine of perpetual warfare is brutally to the point: peace cannot and must not be allowed to last. As indiscriminate, deadly fire once again descends upon the defenceless people of Gaza, unleashed on the orders of Israel’s bellicose prime minister, an anguished cry is heard. Is the precious two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas definitively over? To which comes the dismaying answer: it barely matters. This truce, now shattering into a million pieces, was but a brief, deceptive pause ina war that never stops.It doesn’t stop because Netanyahu is sustained in office by the unceasing state of national emergency that he and his supporters have nurtured and prolonged since the 7 October 2023 terrorist attacks. The war doesn’t stop because Netanyahu’s overarching aim – the destruction of Palestinian hopes of nationhood – is doomed to fail. It does not stop because those, inside Israel and abroad, whocriticise Israeli government actionsface being dismissed and abused for supposedly acting not in good faith and out of alarm at the human toll, but from antisemitic motives.Most of all, perhaps, the war that the terrorists triggered 18 months ago continues, and threatens once more to expand, because Netanyahu and his far-right Jewish nationalist and ultra-religious partners have found in it a vehicle to pursue the larger goal of a greater Israel. They and theirviolent settler alliesuse it as an excuse to expand land grabs and intimidate Palestinian residents in the occupied West Bank. New areas of Syria’s Golan Heights have been seized. Resettlement of Gaza itself is another stated objective.Perpetual warfare can only be sustained if the other “side” continues to fight. So degraded are Hamas’s forces, it almost seems unable to do so any longer. The lack of an immediate armed response to the Israeli strikes that began on Monday night speaks to relative weakness. And yet Hamas is not vanquished. Each time ahostage was handed over, its black-hooded fighters made a great show of militant defiance. As long as any credible, agreed “day after” plan is lacking – and absent a ground invasion and full-scale, long-term occupation – Hamas will remain in effective charge in Gaza. And so the war goes on.Netanyahudid not want the ceasefire in the first placeand has constantly sought a breakdown he could blame on others. He only consented to stop shooting on 19 January under pressure from Donald Trump and his ubiquitous envoy, Steve Witkoff. Due to be inaugurated the following day, Trump was imperiously demanding an end to the conflict his predecessor, Joe Biden, failed to halt. Loth to rain on Trump’s parade, and eager to win favour, Netanyahu agreed, fingers crossed tightly behind his back.Yet even then, with more than 48,000 Palestinians dead, tens of thousands injured or traumatised and most of Gaza’s 2 million population homeless, Netanyahu was not ready to stop. He knew that far-right cabinet ministers would not tolerate peace for long. One, Itamar Ben-Gvir, hadalready resigned in protest. Others were threatening to do so, thereby potentially collapsing his government. He knew, though for him this has been a secondary consideration throughout, that many Israeli hostages remained in captivity – 59 at the last count, alive and dead.0:55Deaths reported in Gaza as Israeli military resumes strikes – videoNetanyahu never seriously intended to honour the second phase of the ceasefire, which was supposed to begin on 1 March and which calls for full Israeli military withdrawal. Heblocked humanitarian aid; he cut water and electricity supplies; he delayed second-phase implementation and obstructed talks to get it back on track. He waged war by other means. And when these provocations failed, he insisted, in breach of the ceasefire deal, that Hamas unilaterally liberate more hostages while offering only limited prisoner releases and a temporary truce extension in return.Perpetual warfare, even when undeclared, is difficult to justify and Netanyahu, indicted for war crimes by the international criminal court and widely condemned in Europe and the Arab world, is desperately short of backers. His predicament has worsened of late. Accused of a growing authoritarianism, he is embroiled in a row over hisbid to sack the Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar. A new corruption scandal involving Qatari money also swirls around him. In this context, a Gaza “distraction” may be considered timely.“Netanyahu is waging a holding action on every possible front – against early elections, against a state commission of inquiry [into the 7 October attacks], against a deal that would bring back the 59 remaining hostages, living and dead,”wrote Haaretz’s Amos Harel. “The prime minister is acting like someone who has nothing left to lose. Intensifying the battle to the point of chaos serves him.”With more than 400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, killed so far, and with Israel threatening continuing and expanding strikes,cries of anger, horror and dismayfrom the Palestinians, the UN, international aid agencies and foreign governments echo like ghostly laments across the devastated Gazan wasteland. They are as familiar as they are futile and disregarded.A far from chastened White House, proudly confirming complicity in the Israeli strikes, appears keen they continue. The January ceasefire process appears dead. Trump’s absurd plan for a Gaza Riviera is nowhere to be seen or heard now. Thwarted, he hits back vicariously, egging on Netanyahu. Yet it would be naive not to see a broader, schematic Trump connection. In recent days, he has rattled sabres in Iran’s face, demanding Tehran resume talks on curtailing its nuclear programme or face military action. At the same time, he launched huge airstrikes on Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.‘Ceasefire’ is a hollow word for Palestinians – the killings, displacements and denial of aid continue | Nesrine MalikRead moreIn Trump’s simplistic, zero-sum world, it’s all the same deal. “As President Trump has made clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran – all those who seek to terrorise not just Israel but the US – will see a price to pay, and all hell will break loose,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.Is Yemen an early warning? Is Trump moving to defend Israel against Iranian attack – a possibility relentlessly rehearsed by Netanyahu to justify his unending state of war? Or is Trump actually preparing the ground for an Israeli-US strike going the other way, as many in Tehran believe?Like some previous US presidents, and oblivious as ever to history, Trump believes he can remake the Middle East almost by an act of imperial will. But unlike Barack Obama, who dreamed in Cairo in 2009 of a democratic renaissance, Trump is remodelling by diktat, backed by the use or threat of brute force. Palestine is the benighted place in which Trump’s messiah complex and Netanyahu’s doctrine of perpetual war collide. Where next?

It seems likely that disabled people and those unable to work will be pushed even further into hardship.I am a single father and get personal independence payments (Pip). I have mental health issues and was diagnosed with autism towards the end of the Covid pandemic. I also receive universal credit, getting the limited capability for work-related activity element, which, we now know, will be cut for new claimants and frozen for existing ones like me. As inflation continues to rise, the freeze will mean that my income falls and I’m left struggling even harder to make ends meet. I already live on the edge of existence with the amount of money I have to survive on after paying unavoidable expenses. Every day is a new challenge – not knowing what food I can afford to buy, and is also more expensive in the local shops I have to use because I can’t afford to travel to larger supermarkets.In our family, there are no Christmas or birthday treats, no fun days out or the occasional takeaway, no newspapers or magazines, no TV or streaming subscriptions. If it is not an absolute necessity in order to survive then we can’t even consider spending on it. Every single penny in cost increases in recent times, from food to medicine or utility bills, is a penny that has to be found from elsewhere.But after years of cutting back there is just no way I will be able to cut back any further if the proposed changes to disability benefits go ahead. And ifLabouris so ready to cut social security, might there be even more of this to come?The uncertainty around the future and what lies ahead leaves me suffering from so much anxiety that I am barely able to focus on living. I spend most of my time worrying about how we will survive.Things have been difficult like this for a while. During the pandemic, living on a basic income, I couldn’t afford to cover everyday costs like school meals, school uniform, household bills and broadband. I was unable to replace much of my daughter’s school uniform throughout secondary school, and at the start of lockdown we did not have an internet connection at home – something that was essential for my daughter’s schooling. Covering the cost of broadband meant making enormous sacrifices. I have since been forced to switch off the heating at home and I have drastically reduced the amount of electricity we use by not turning on lights unless absolutely necessary and limiting myself to one cup of coffee each morning.My own health, both physically and mentally, has worsened over the years because I have neglected myself to make sure my daughter is as well cared-for as possible. Diet is a very important part of one of my health issues, but fresh, healthy, nourishing food is more expensive to buy, leaving me in a cycle of ill health and poverty.The changes to benefits andthe cuts announced todayare going to be another kick in the teeth for many, including me. I’m relieved that the freeze to my Pip payment that I was expecting has not been announced. But the changes that have been confirmed are still extremely dangerous. These announcements will push people’s stress and anxiety levels up, further worsening health issues for those needing to claim. Tightening the eligibility to make a claim will not do anything positive to help those in need.I’m anxious about thechanges to the assessment process, and that there will be big delays in getting people assessed for Pip, leaving people being wrongly assessed due to the shortage of fully trained staff and medical assessors who can properly understand how physical and mental health issues affect many people in different ways. There is already a shortage of qualified support workers and work coaches to spend the time needed to assess people in a way that does not make claimants feel as if they do not deserve the help and support they need with respect and dignity.I was one of a group of parents living in poverty who met with members of the government in Downing Street last year to push for changes to this broken system. I worry now that our pleas for change have been ignored. The governmentshould be helpingto support people with disabilities and those living on low incomes, as was promised in the lead-up to the last election. There must be other ways of bringing the government’s costs down.Today’s measures will take many years to implement, leaving those claiming disability benefits with even more uncertainty about their future and how they will be able to survive safely. The system is already difficult to understand and negotiate. But today’s announcements simply make things tougher for everyone at a time when they need help the most.Brian takes part inChanging Realities, a collaboration between almost 200 parents and carers on a low income, researchers at the University of York and Child Poverty Action GroupExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionDisabilityLabourPovertycommentShareReuse this content"

Six parties have made proposals, said the company on Tuesday, adding that it hopes to have afinancial restructuring deal on the table by the end of June. Five of the six plans involve write-downs for holders of the senior class A debt. Then came the vague – but crucial – bit. Most of the proposals “are conditional on further, and varying, regulatory support and accommodations being achieved”.What does that mean? The company will not explain what form of “support and accommodations” it has in mind, but a natural reading says this is a plea for special treatment.If it’s a naked attempt to bully ministers into overruling Ofwat on bills, it sounds like wishful thinking. Even for a government desperate not to see Thames enter special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation, loading even more pain on to consumers would be a capitulation too far.The regulator’s “final determination” last December – itallowed a 35% rise in bills, rather thanthe 59% Thames wanted– was, as the name suggests, meant to allow no room for revision by Ofwat itself. The only route to appeal is to go to the Competition and Markets Authority, but Thames has just asked to suspend that process for 18 weeks while it talks to would-be bidders.Green activists try to make citizen’s arrests of Thames Water executivesRead moreMore likely, Thames is referring to matters outside the determination, such as financial penalties for bad behaviour. That could cover a wide sweep, taking in current regulatory investigations, possible new ones, plus fines for failing to hit investment targets in the next five years.From the point of view of would-be suitors, it would make sense to nail down those risks before committing a penny. You don’t want to “piss away” the fresh money in fines, as one company source put inthe Guardian’s report last week. Rather, it would be preferable to wrap everything into a grand settlement with both Ofwat and the Environment Agency, the other important regulator in this drama. The company could throw any yet-to-be-revealed legal risks into the mix.That, at least, is how one can imagine such a bargain being presented. There would be talk of lines being drawn in the sand, and of clean breaks from the past. In the regulatory corner, officials could claim to have saved a fortune in enforcement costs by dealing with the investigations in one job lot.Yet outsiders should be suspicious of behind-closed-doors manoeuvres. Transparency is next to zero. A fuzzy “accommodation” in the name of pragmatism can also be code for a regulator surrendering its ability to hold a future board of directors to account.One should fear a cosy stitch-up to the advantage of the class A bondholders whose first motivation is to minimise their losses. They know their hit would be greater if Thames enters the special administration regime (SAR), thus they have every reason to cajole Ofwat and the Environment Agency into signing a peace deal that encourages a private sector solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The virtue of the SAR process is that it promises a properly clean break. Losses would be imposed on bondholders after a pure assessment of the cost of cleaning up the mess. Note that even some of the would-be suitors say it would be as easy for them to invest in Thames on its exit from SAR.Regulators cannot go soft at this late stage.

Even after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt, those observing Palestinian-Israeli affairs knew the ceasefire never really meant Israel ceased its fire on the besieged coastal territory.Between 22 January and 11 March, at least 700 Palestinians were either killed by the Israeli military or their bodies were retrieved from areas medics could not previously access,according toministry of health in Gaza as reported by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In the past two months, Israel has also reneged on the terms of the truce,refusing to allow tents and trailersfor people to seek shelter from the freezing cold that led to the death of several people, mainlybabies, health officials say.The ceasefire also stipulated that Israel would allow heavy machinery to enter Gaza to begin the process of removing the rubble. It did not do so, and the United Nations says it will take350 yearsto clear the destroyed homes and infrastructure and begin rebuilding if Israel does not lift the current blockade.Another stipulation – a rather important and urgent one – was allowing more aid to flow into Gaza. Although more trucks did enter during the initial phase of the agreement, Israeli authorities made it impossible for aid groups to make a dent in the dire humanitarian situation. On 2 March, hours after the first phase of its ceasefire deal expired, Israelblocked the entryof all aid shipments to Gaza, while simultaneously carrying out drone attacks, according to a BBC report.Even before Israel made this decision, it had already been systematically restricting the entry of everything from scalpels and scissors to generators,toys and spices. But with the complete halt of food, fuel and other necessities, humanitarian organisations feared Gaza was “facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity”, according to a UN report, with Médecins Sans Frontières accusing Israel of using aid as a “bargaining chip” with which to negotiate.The so-called truce was a political manoeuvre, a pause that allowed Israel to reset the clock on its war while maintaining the core elements of its siege and occupation. Israel continued its war on Gaza through an ongoing choking blockade, aerial attacks, and the killing and abuse of Palestinian prisoners. In the West Banka parallel warrages on, with Israeli forces raiding Palestinian homes, carrying out assassinations anddetainingpeople in the thousands.This is a pattern we have seen before: an overwhelming Israeli assault, a mounting civilian death toll, global outrage leading to calls for a ceasefire, and then a brief de-escalation. But during that time, Israel fortifies its military positions, re-arms, and sets the stage for the next round of violence. For instance, in2008-09’s Operation Cast Lead, and after a six-month ceasefire, Israel launched a devastating 23-day assault on Gaza, claiming Hamas had violated the truce. However,reportsindicated that Israel had planned the attack months in advance, using the ceasefire to prepare militarily.Israel often agrees to ceasefires when international scrutiny mounts. By doing so, it presents itself as the reasonable party while shifting blame on to Palestinians when violence resumes. By engaging in ceasefire talks without addressing occupation and the siege,Israelensures that the status quo remains unchanged, preventing any long-term resolution. A real ceasefire would require an end to Israel’s ongoing occupation and the suffocating siege on Gaza – not just a temporary pause in violence. Until then, any so-called truce remains an illusion.WhatGazaneeds is not another fleeting truce, but a fundamental shift in international policy – one that stops treating Israel’s actions as above reproach and starts holding it accountable for its violations of human rights and international law. Anything less will ensure that this cycle of violence continues, with devastating consequences for the people of Gaza and the Palestinian people overall.Dalia Hatuqa is an independent journalist specialising in Palestinian-Israeli affairsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Who’s to blame for its passing?Zoe WilliamsThere has been outrage over Transport for London’s decision to remove those mini station libraries, but let’s not rush to call it ‘health and safety gone mad’Tue 18 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 07.10 EDTShareIn my nearest tube station, there used to be a book-swap in the entrance, which I used to love for the sheer speed of uptake. You could drop any old random nonsense there in the morning and, by the time you came home in the evening, it would be gone. Once, I left an anthology of short plays from 1976. It wasn’t a particularly special year for plays, and not one of them was by anyone you’d have heard of – but by the time I got on the tube, someone in my carriage was reading it.As satisfying as that was, I could hardly call it a huge part of my life. So when the little exchange libraries vanished overnight, I was nothing like as outraged as a lot of people I know, who blamed, variously: health and safety gone mad;Sadiq Khan(and, fair play, I guess he is the only person you could name from Transport for London, but it feels unlikely that his was the deciding vote); philistinism; modernity. What on earth could have prompted this barbaric act?EnterJim Waterson, erstwhile Guardian reporter, who now runsLondon Centric, a Substack for news about the capital. Since the King’s Cross fire, he said, it has been against fire-safety regulations to have combustible material in any part of a station.Why was Balding rolling around on a sofa with a spaniel when she should have been presenting? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreI remember that event, mainly because it was horrific and 31 people died, scores more injured, but also because, prior to it, you could smoke on the tube. It was an age ago; just trying to get a mental image of people lighting up in a tube carriage puts it in the 80s; to be more exact, it was 1987.What is incredible is that the fire was forgotten for long enough that combustible materials were ever re-introduced into tube stations. I can think of some other solutions to the sad passing of the book-swap; we could leave our books in neat piles outside the tube, and hope it doesn’t rain, for example. But we probably have to accept that health and safety hasn’t, in fact, gone mad, but has merely continued on its slow yet sane path, rousing itself to take action one hazard at a time.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our obsession with getting enough shut-eye stems, I suspect, from the fact that so many of us feeltiredallthetime.Akin to their cursed revival oflow-rise jeans, the TikTok generation have repackaged a perennial preoccupation and given it their own spin: sleepmaxxing. Co-opting its name from another online phenomenon (looksmaxxing), the term refers to any number of hacks that purport to improve sleep.What is sleepmaxxing?On social media, sleepmaxxing encompasses a wide variety of sleep tips and tricks, including but not limited to: taping your mouth shut to forcibly breathe through your nose, using nasal dilators to widen the nostrils, and taking supplements such as magnesium and melatonin.Using red lights rather than regular lights in the bedroom supposedly boosts melatonin production, a claim conveniently made by a company that sells sleep lights.As wearable smartwatches and fitness trackers have grown in popularity, so has an interest inmonitoring one’s own sleep. Smart trackers now provide sleep scores, with breakdowns of sleep phases, measures of sleep efficiency and even suggested bedtimes.Much of the content around sleepmaxxing online is couched in the language of self-optimisation, as well as a looksmaxxing-adjacent pursuit of aesthetics: sleeping on your back prevents your face becoming asymmetric, influencers claim, while a mouth taping brand suggests its product will give its users “a perfectly aligned jaw”.What does the evidence say?Though consumer sleep trackers are improving in accuracy, “there is quite a bit of variability between devices”, according to Melinda Jackson, an associate professor at Monash University.“Most consumer-grade sleep tracking devices are better at estimating total sleep time than accurately distinguishing between light and deep sleep,” Prof Fatima Yaqoot, an epidemiologist and sleep scientist at the University of the Sunshine Coast, says. “Relying too much on a ‘perfect sleep score’ or fixating on achieving an ideal number may lead to sleep-related anxiety and worsen the overall sleep experience.”Sleep perfectionists: the exhausting rise of orthosomniaRead moreSleep researchers have coined a term for this anxiety – “orthosomnia”, which is often driven by sleep-tracking devices.“The best measure of sleep quality is how you feel upon waking,” Yaqoot says. “If you wake up feeling rested and refreshed, that means you slept well” – regardless of what a device reports.So will a shut mouth make for better shut-eye? Probably not.“Some of the concerns raised on social media with mouth breathing have been around poor oral health, increasing risk of infection, and poor sleep,” Jackson, a registered psychologist specialising in the treatment of sleep disorders, says.“Nasal breathing can be beneficial in terms of filtering and humidifying the air, as well as improving lung function through promotion of diaphragmatic breathing.”She notes that there have been very few studies looking at the effect of mouth taping during sleep. And, Yaqoot points out, it can worsen airway obstruction in people with sleep apnoea.As for nasal dilators, “I don’t see any harm in doing that if you are a nose breather”, Jackson says. “If it’s not going to be harmful and you’d like to give it a go, and it works for you, great, but there’s possibly a bit of placebo effect in these strategies.”The best position for sleeping depends on who you are: if you’re heavily pregnant, say,side sleeping is safest. Side or stomach sleeping can also reduce snoring, while sleeping on one’s back may reduce lower back pain and the likelihood ofskin changes.What about melatonin? Should I take a supplement?Increasing drowsiness at the end of the day is driven by natural increases in melatonin, produced by the brain’s pineal gland. “When we wake up in the morning [and] light hits our eyes, that production stops,” Jackson says. “It’s low during the day and then starts to peak in the evening to help us with sleep onset.”Shorter wavelengths of light – such as blue lights from digital screens – are more likely to stop or slow the production of melatonin. “I wouldn’t say that red light enhances production of melatonin but it just doesn’t impact it as much as other wavelengths,” Jackson says. “When we talk about light, there’s not just the wavelength but also the lux – the illuminance of that light. Any light, if it’s bright enough, will impact our sleep to some degree.”Melatonin supplements can help to reset the internal body clock for people with jet lag or after shift work but are “not particularly helpful” for improving sleep in those who don’t have a diagnosed sleep disorder, Yaqoot says. “While melatonin use is considered safe for the short term, since in addition to sleep it also affects reproductive hormones and other biological functions, there are risks to affecting these functions, and long-term use needs more evidence.”Magnesium supplements are primarily useful in people with diagnosed deficiencies but “there’s currently limited evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium on insomnia symptoms”, Jackson says.What do experts recommend for a good night’s sleep?“Night-time sleep is directly influenced by what we do during the day,” Yaqoot says. Experts suggest:Beginning the day with exposure to sunlight, to align the body’s internal clockKeeping consistent bed- and wake times, even on weekendsLimiting afternoon naps to no more than 30 minutesReducing caffeine intake later in the afternoonAvoiding heavy meals right before bedReducing screen exposure before bedtimeDeveloping a calming pre-bedtime routine, such as reading, meditation or deep breathing.Good sleep hygiene also means avoidingbed rottingwhere possible, Yaqoot says. “While rest is essential … spending long hours in bed while awake weakens the brain’s association between bed and sleep, making it harder to fall and stay asleep.”On average, it takes 20 to 30 minutes to fall asleep, Jackson says. “If you’re falling asleep within four to five minutes, it can be a sign that you are experiencing some sleep deprivation.”Behavioural changes alone, though, are insufficient to address underlying sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnoea, which require support from a health practitioner.Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

This was one of the deadliest days since the early months of the conflict, sparked by the lethal Hamas raid of 7 October 2023. Israel says it was attacking “terror targets”, but health authorities in Gaza say that 174 children and 89 women were amongthe more than 400 dead. Evacuation orders issued by the military suggest that a renewed ground offensive may be on its way for traumatised and repeatedly displaced Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu warnedthat it was “only the beginning”and the military issued new evacuation orders to traumatised and repeatedly displaced Palestinians. Families of the remaining Israeli hostages are terrified and angry too,attackingthe government for choosing to give up on them.Horror is piling upon horror. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since the war began, and the numbers grew even during the ceasefire, many due to Israel’s blocking of aid. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, belatedly acknowledged that as a breach of international law on Monday – only for the prime minister’s spokesperson torebuke him. A UN report last weeksaidthat Israel’s attacks on women’s healthcare in Gaza amounted to “genocidal acts”, and that security forces had used sexual violence as a weapon of war to “dominate and destroy the Palestinian people”. A previous UN commission found that “relentless and deliberate attacks” onmedical personneland facilitiesamounted to war crimes.Building on the ceasefire always looked difficult. Negotiations never seriously began for the second phase that was supposed to bring about a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, and the total withdrawal of Israeli forces – never mind consideration of the hypothetical third phase, Gaza’s reconstruction.Mr Netanyahu, who blames Hamas’s intransigence in refusing to release all the hostages now for the end of the ceasefire, iskept in power by endless conflict. The Israeli prime minister was due to testify in his corruption trial on Tuesday butcancelled, citing the renewed offensive. He needs support to pass a budget by the end of the month or his government will be dissolved. Resuming air strikes hasbrought backone of his far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and should prevent the other, Bezalel Smotrich, from jumping ship. Israelis challenging, as authoritarian, his attempts todismiss his internal security agency chief, Ronen Bar, can be accused of undermining the patriotic cause. Yet most Israeliswantedto move to the second phase of the ceasefire, according to a recent survey. The testimony of returned hostages has refocused attention on the plight of those still held.The renewed attack has been widely and rightly condemned in Europe and the Arab world. But Israel, which was undeterred by Joe Biden’s feeble scoldings, is now dealing with a US president who told it to pause for a beat but is happy to give it the green light to resume and urge it to go further. Donald Trump has repeatedly promotedthe forced displacement of Palestinians– another war crime. The US and Israel have reportedlycontacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somalilandabout resettling uprooted Palestinians. These plans are no more tolerable for being far-fetched. The Arabpeace planwas a clear statement that there is a better alternative. But for Israel’s right, which will not tolerate Palestinian aspirations to statehood, the destruction of hope is not merely a result of this war, but the goal. It must not succeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But reducing payments to disabled claimants will only increase hardshipTue 18 Mar 2025 14.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 15.22 EDTShareWith self-imposed fiscal rules leaving it little room for manoeuvre, the government has made its choice: no to more borrowing, tax rises or thewealth taxsuggested by some of its own MPs – andyes to cutting disability benefits.Speaking in the House of Commons, Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, did her best to talk up the £1bn funding she has secured to help people back into work. But the bleak reality is that £5bn of cuts to disability and incapacity benefits are expected to leave up to 1 million people worse off. Dress it up as they might – by blaming the Tories for everything that has gone wrong with the system, and warning that the trajectory of rising claims is unsustainable – this is a wrong and cruel decision that ministers should live to regret.A possible freeze in the level of personal independence payments (Pips) paid to disabled people was dropped after protests. A means test has also not materialised, so the entitlement remains universal. But thecriteria for claims are beingtightened, at the same time as a separate assessment process for the health element of universal credit is scrapped. For those who don’t meet the new Pip criteria, there could be a£3,500 annual loss of incomefrom next year (more details will come from the Office for Budget Responsibility). For many thousands of vulnerable households, this will be a life-changing loss of income.The health top-up of universal credit is being frozen rather than cut for current recipients, meaning there will be no sudden drop. But the prospects for new claimants are grim: thenew annual rate will be £2,444 lower– unless resistance from MPs and campaigners leads to changes, as it should. Since claimants areconcentrated in poorer areas, these cuts can be expected to exacerbate regional inequalities and increase hardship, including hunger, in places that are already depressed.There is no doubt that the benefits system is flawed, and reform is needed. The decision to raise the basic rate of universal credit, and reduce the gap with the amount paid to those unable to work, is overdue and welcome. In time, this rebalancing may contribute to improving claimants’ health, which many experts believe has been adversely affected by existingincentives– particularly the Tories’ removal of support from those preparing for work, which penalised those who were less seriously ill or getting better.Ministers are right to be concerned that the number of people who are too ill to work hascontinued to risesince the pandemic, when in other countries it fell back. The new “right to try” a job without losing benefits is a positive step. So is the commitment to protect those with the most severe disabilities. But such measures, and even the £1bn employment support package, are dwarfed by the cuts. The overall impression is of a secretary of state who had the rug pulled from under her by the Treasury’s demand for savings.These are the wrong choices, and the government’s efforts to sell them are making matters worse. Alarmist rhetoric about the unaffordable burden on taxpayers scapegoats claimants and damages society. Although health-related claims have risen, the overallshare of national income spent on social securityhas been stable. It is shameful for a Labour government to place a higher value on fiscal rules, and commitments not to raise taxes, than on the needs of disabled people. Campaigners must keep fighting.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I worked as an NHS GP and hospital specialist for 25 years. Those of us working in the service could see where many of the major problems lay, but rather than listening to those working at the coalface, David Cameron seemed to be seduced by Lansley’s ideas.The disastrous effects of the reorganisation were seen most clearly when the Covid pandemic struck, with respect to provision of personal protective equipment and the test-and-trace debacle. Effective public health pathways had been changed and there was no joined-up thinking whatsoever.Now we have elderly patients fit for discharge lying in hospital beds as plans for social care reform are again kicked down the road. Patients awaiting hospital admission lie in corridors, where care is clearly substandard despite the heroic efforts of doctors and nurses. It is scandalous.What happens if we have a new administration in four years, another reorganisation? We must stop theNHSbecoming a political football and have some cohesive and effective forward planning before it really is too late.Dr Michael CohenBristolThe cuts to integrated care boards are yet another example of short-term cost-saving measures that will weaken our economy, public services and workforce (30,000 jobs could go in Labour’s radical overhaul of NHS, 14 March). Good jobs are not just expenses; they are investments in a stable, productive society.Beyond the numbers, there is a deep human cost. Many of those losing their jobs are the very people who worked tirelessly to keep the NHS from collapsing after years of underfunding. To reward them with redundancy rather than support is an insult. What’s even more troubling is that aLabourgovernment, supposedly the party of workers and vulnerable people, is making these cuts instead of pursuing fairer ways to raise revenue. Rather than increasing taxes on those who can afford it, they are targeting NHS staff while ignoring the system’s deeper issues.The NHS is inefficient, but not because of its workforce. The real causes are years of deliberate underinvestment and the unchecked power of NHS trusts, which act as bureaucratic fiefdoms obstructing modernisation.Frontline staff today are less efficient than their predecessors, not due to lack of skill but because they are trapped in an outdated, fragmented system.If Labour is serious about fixing the NHS, it must invest properly, break down power imbalances, and implement long-term change. Instead, it is choosing the same failed austerity playbook. The UK cannot afford to dismantle its skilled workforce under the guise of fiscal responsibility.Jeremy WainmanPontefract, West YorkshireWhen I joined the NHS as a manager nearly 35 years ago, my boss explained to me that there was a fundamental rhythm to the reorganisation of the NHS. Incoming governments, he said, centralised things, believing that they could “fix the NHS”, and then, when they discovered that they couldn’t, they decentralised again to avoid the blame. Here we go again…Nigel TurnerLondonMatthew Weaver (How did Andrew Lansley reorganise health and create NHS England?, 14 March) misses one change that had a big impact on communities: the transfer of the ownership of many health service buildings to a company, NHS Property Services (NHSPS), charged with obtaining national market value from them. In Devon, community hospitals paid for by local donations became the property of NHSPS without anyone being informed, and wards were closed with the intention of selling sites for housebuilding.In Seaton, more than a third of the hospital – a wingfunded entirely by local people– has been empty for nearly eight years, partly because NHSPS won’t vary its rental charges to allow for new uses, despite a huge local outcry andlengthy discussions. Wes Streeting should look into NHSPS, and would be welcome in Devon to see the problems for himself.Martin ShawSeaton, DevonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Some have decided to take a punt on Reform UK as they feel they have nothing to lose and it is the only party offering an alternative.That alternative should beLabour, but with its refusal to discuss immigration in a meaningful way, its apparent desire to recreate austerity, to cut benefits for ill and disabled people, having already cut the winter fuel allowance, and its refusal to raise money by cutting tax allowances for the rich, the party seems to have ruled itself out.To be the truly transformational government we all wish for and beat Reform UK, taxes, particularly on the wealthy, need to go up.Phil TateChesterWhile few would doubt that Mike Amesbury’s deplorable assault of a member of the public made his position untenable, your editorial (16 March) correctly points out the importance of this byelection. Electors who feel excluded from decision-making may disregard the administrative chaos of Reform UK and focus on the ever-increasing cost of living and shortage of social housing. A demagogic candidate may successfully use these concerns to tap into the belief that the three major political parties are oblivious to the problems faced by many.Labour, the Liberal Democrats and moderate Tories should come together in Runcorn under a moderate candidate with an efficient and very visible campaign.Keeley CavendishDulwich, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

You could just see ­looking around that people were tuned in and really want to buy into that.”Tuchel, who is preparing for the qualifying ties at Wembley against Albania on Friday and Latvia on ­Monday, made the point that there would be only 24 days of training before theWorld Cup. As such, it was even more important to ­create a spirit of “brother­hood” – one in which every­body pushed one another and, as Burn put it, no one was “afraid to speak up if something is not right or should change”.The Newcastle defender said: “For that initial meeting, it was more pro­bably about a mentality and how he wanted us to act around each other. He said he’d spoken to players from previous tournaments and from other countries about what the difference was between when they went out in early rounds and what happened when they won it. And a lot of it was about interactions.“In the NBA [Tuchel said], the best teams historically are normally the teams who are high-fiving each other, picking each other up and have a lot of those interactions. Knowing that we do a lot of that at Newcastle and speak about it, I think they can keep people switched on, give people little bits to keep motivation levels high. That’s something that we’ll probably look into and implement.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel has taken inspiration from the NBA in his early England team-building talks.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PABurn is living the dream, following up his England selection – which Tuchel told him about last Thursday night – with a goalscoring, man-of-the-match performance in theCarabao Cup final winagainst Liverpool on Sunday. Burn said he had sought to park the ­England news to focus on the final with Newcastle and he did something similar with the celebrations of his club’s first domestic trophy in 70 years as his attention turned to the internationals.Burn’s boyhood hero, the former Newcastle captain Alan Shearer, told him that he should simply retire now. “I said ‘I’ve gotEnglandtomorrow’,” Burn said. “It was getting a bit rowdy [at the Newcastle team hotel afterwards] and I was just ready to go to sleep!“Sunday hasn’t sunk in and I don’t think it will for a long time. I still feel pretty numb about it all. I really want to feel something but my focus is completely on what I can do here for England.“I’ve had so many messages. I’ve had the same phone number since I was 16 so I’ll probably have to change that at some point. It was stressing me out not replying to everyone so I sat for about two hours [on Monday night] just texting everyone back.”Burn’s story has been well told. The release by Newcastle when he was a boy, not being able to make local and county teams, playing youth football for Blyth Town and Blyth Spartans. He cut his teeth in the professional game at Darlington, for whom he played in League Two and the Conference. He was released by Fulham at 24. He became a Premier League regular at Brighton only in 2019-20.View image in fullscreen‘Sunday hasn’t sunk in’: Dan Burn headed to St George’s Park the day after Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/Shutterstock“I have been doubted a lot throughout my career,” the 32-year-old said. “Not many people who watched me play at Darlington would think I’d be sat here doing a press conference with England. I feel like I just really had this chip on my shoulder that I want to prove people wrong.“When you have been passed over for so many international breaks, you accept that the time has passed. But the new manager has taken that chance on me and I just want to grasp that opportunity. It’s similar to when I went to Newcastle [in January 2022]. I thought that opportunity had passed me by but I’ve managed to do that.”Tuchel had joked last Friday that Burn was very tall but easily overlooked. Did Burn smile at that? “Yeah, a little bit but it’s probably the story of my career,” he said. “Visually on the pitch, if I do make a mistake, I feel it is probably magnified just by how it looks. I was surprised how tall the gaffer was. I obviously remember him from Chelsea but I never noticed that!”Quick GuideEngland squadShowGoalkeepers:Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton), James Trafford (Burnley).Defenders:Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Levi Colwill (Chelsea), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Tino Livramento (Newcastle United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Kyle Walker (Milan, on loan from Manchester City).Midfielders:Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), Curtis Jones (Liverpool), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa).Forward:Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa, on loan from Manchester United), Dominic Solanke (Tottenham Hotspur).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tuchel oversaw training with his full squad on Tuesday afternoon, three under-21 players also joining in – Taylor Harwood-­Bellis, Adam Wharton and Liam Delap. Burn wants to go step-by-step, to get on for his first cap at some point but, ­having ended one decades-long trophy drought, he wondered whether the same could happen with England.“I see a lot of similarities between Newcastle and England in that respect. From speaking to him [Tuchel] last night, I’ve got confidence that everything will be done to try to finally bring the trophy home.”Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could have been worse for the hosts but for Maria-Luisa Grohs’s save to deny Lindsey Heaps from the penalty spot.Grohs was making her first start for Bayern since receiving a cancer diagnosis last November, and she dived low to her left to save Heaps’s effort just before half-time. The visitors had taken the lead in the 35th minute when Chawinga broke clear and fired into the far corner.Bayern threatened through Pernille Harder and Klara Bühl, while at the other end Grohs stuck out a leg to keep out a Kadidiatou Diani effort and saved again from Heaps.

A key part of the role involves protecting and conserving the Town Moor – 1,000 acres of green space and an area bigger than New York’s Central Park on which the Freemen sublet grazing land to farmers with the proceeds going to charity.During his initiation ceremony, during which he will be presented with a scroll, Howe must hold a musket and bible and sign an oath. He will also need to present the city’s mayor with a silver coin, minted before 1910.Given that Newcastle United’s Saudi Arabian owners are contemplating building a new stadium on Leazes Park, a part of the Town Moor, close to St James’ Park, Howe could soon find himself experiencing a conflict of interests. He will be invited to attend quarterly meetings of the the Town Moor joint working group.In the 1990s assorted pressure groups strongly opposed the club’s previous, ultimately shelved, plan to construct a new ground on Leazes Park.View image in fullscreenCouncillor Karen Kilgour says ‘what Eddie [Howe] has achieved is nothing short of extraordinary’.Photograph: Steve Brock/PAAs guardians of Newcastle’s green spaces, the Freemen – some hereditary and others, such as Howe, honorary after performing the “highest service” for Newcastle – remain an influential, if slightly mysterious body, proud of their medieval heritage. These days they are no longer expected to carry arms but change has come slowly. It was not until 2009 that women were granted the right to “freelage”, an honour previously restricted to male heirs of Freemen.In April 2010 the first 10 hereditary female “Freemen” were sworn in. They included professor Ruth Plummer, director of the Sir Bobby Robson cancer trials research centre at Newcastle’s Freeman hospital.Other honorary Freemen of Newcastle have included Nelson Mandela, who was honoured for his “services to the cause of freedom” at a time when he was in prison in South Africa.Dan Burn, the Blyth-born scorer of Newcastle’s first goal in the 2-1 win against Liverpool, has been nominated to receive the freedom of Northumberland.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

Women’s tennis, in some ways, was built on the success of its child prodigies – Chris Evert, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters – who audaciously stormed towards the top in their youth, demanding attention.Those days are long gone. Between the improved depth, physicality and professionalism at the lower levels, possibly a more sparse talent pool and the WTA’s age eligibility rules restricting the number of tournaments a child can contest, it is increasingly more difficult to flit up the rankings so early.Jack Draper dismantles Holger Rune to claim Indian Wells titleRead moreFor those reasons, the first three months of the season have been fascinating.Mirra Andreeva continued to defy trendsand patterns on Sunday by winning the biggest title of her career at Indian Wells at 17 years old.It is difficult to overstate the significance of this achievement. A few weeks after winning her first WTA 1000 title in Dubai last month, Andreeva triumphed in California by outplaying andoutsmarting Iga Swiatekand Aryna Sabalenka, the two best players in the world, in consecutive three-set matches to win the title. She is now on a 12-match winning streak and has risen to No 6 with a bullet.Before Andreeva, two players under 18 had beaten the top two in a WTA event: Steffi Graf and Serena Williams. The other teenager in the top 100, meanwhile, is the 18-year-old Australian Maya Joint, at No 80.Despite her youth, it still feels like Andreeva has not missed any steps in her development and her recent form is right on schedule. Two years ago, Andreeva broke through, defeating two top 20 players en-route to the fourth round of the 2023 Madrid Open. Since then, she has rapidly risen up the rankings, reaching the French Open semi-finals and breaking into the top 20 last year. The obstacles she has faced and the tough lessons learned on her path have been just as important in her growth. She has endured plenty of difficult losses that sharpened her game and strengthened her character.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva has made significant offensive improvements as she grows into an adult.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APFrom the moment she emerged on the tour, it was clear Andreeva was blessed with a unique improvisational game. She possesses a large variety of shots, intelligent point construction and the ability to time the ball sweetly and redirect pace, particularly with her wicked two-handed backhand. Her game was sometimes underpowered against the top players, but as she continues to grow into an adult and gain physical strength, she has made significant offensive improvements. Her increased ball speed and weight of shot this year have allowed her to trade from the baseline with the best players as equals.That growth was particularly on show in the final stages of her title run. Against Swiatek, Andreeva was spectacular in horrendous windy conditions, overpowering the Pole from the baseline as she lasered down-the-line backhand winners from all parts of the court. The added pace on her first serve was astonishing; the 126mph ace she struck in the first-set tiebreak is one of the fastest women’s serves of all time. After trailing by a set against Sabalenka, Andreeva expertly soaked up the world No 1’s enormous strokes, again serving well and dragging the Belarusian into uncomfortable parts of the court with her drop shots and low slices. At such a young age, Andreeva’s game is already complete.The momentum Andreeva has built has much to do with her blossoming partnership with the 1994 Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martínez, who Andreeva has frequently bantered with during her on-court interviews. Aside from being a quality coach – she helpedGarbiñe Muguruza to a Wimbledon titlein 2017 – she seems an enjoyable person to work with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The next challenge for Andreeva and Jack Draper is simply to move on. The Miami Open main draw began on Tuesday with Naomi Osaka in action. While Emma Raducanu plays her first match against the 19-year-old Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii on Wednesday, Andreeva and the other seeded players have received a first-round bye.In the men’s draw, which will showcase Novak Djokovic’s return to Miami for the first time since 2019, Draper will begin his pursuit of the “Sunshine Double” against either Jakub Mensik or Roberto Bautista Agut in round two.The reality of being a top player and consistently making deep runs in the biggest events is that they have less time to reflect on those successes.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The England centre tries to stem the flow of pain while I scuffle around in search of a tissue in one of my pockets. It takes a while, but I finally dig out a stray sheet of kitchen towel.Jones laughs, while still crying, as she accepts my scrunched-up offering and assurance that it is unused. She wipes her eyes and continues talking about the personal tragedies of the past year. Jones’s childhood was haunted by her mother’s alcoholism and then, between August and December, both her parents died – her Welsh dad, Simon, and then her English mum, Paula.US rugby hopes Ilona Maher will be part of England and Fiji DC doubleheaderRead more“Mum was a deep human, but she could never articulate how she felt,” Jones says in her naturally husky voice that is now thickened by grief. “She said to me towards the end: ‘I need help’, but she was always introverted. She had low self-esteem, but she had been such a beautiful young woman. Then, as she got older, she wasn’t that beautiful any more.”That repetition of “beautiful” cracks Jones open. My little old kitchen towel is sodden with tears, but Jones nods emphatically when I ask if we should keep talking this way. “Yes, 100%,” she says. “It’s important to me.”The women’s Six Nations begins on Saturday and, a year ago, Jones was reeling from her father’s diagnosis. “It was 24 January 2024 and we were at home. Celia, my partner, my sister, Abby, and me were about to eat sushi. My dad came home with his partner from the hospital. He said: ‘I’ve got some shit news. I’ve got cancer, stage four.’”Jones looks up. Her partner, Celia Quansah, washer Olympic sevens teammateat the Tokyo Games and their rugby success lit up her dad. “He had two last aims,” Jones says, “and one of them was to see me play sevens in the Paris Olympics and the other was to play snooker as long as he could. He loved Ronnie O’Sullivan.”He didn’t make it to Paris, but Jones smiles when I say he couldn’t have picked a better snooker hero. “Yeah, Ronnie’s a bit rough round the edges and so was my dad. He was a proper Cardiff boy.”Despite the shattering news, Jones played brilliantly in the Six Nations andEngland won the grand slam. “It was the best rugby I’ve ever played because nothing is as bad as hearing that news. Nothing can make me sadder, or diminish my value more than losing my dad, one of my best mates and the rock of our family.All through the Six Nations my dad kept saying: ‘You played out of your skin, Megs.’View image in fullscreenMeg Jones celebrates scoring England’s in their victory over Ireland on their way to a grand slam in last year’s Six Nations.Photograph: Steve Bardens/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“He went to the Bristol game,Wales v England. He was a proud Welshman, but he supported me. I had a good game and he was buzzing.”When did she last talk to him? “In July, in his garage. He was a plumber and he was telling me how much the copper pipe had cost and whether he should take it to the scrap yard. We were crying.”He wanted her to go to a music festival in Budapest soon afterwards and it was there she heard the news. “Stormzy had just finished and I was having a good time with a few beers when my sister rang and said: ‘He’s gone, Meg.’ He died peacefully at home.“Abby sat beside him on the bed and said: ‘I love you so much, Dad.’ He said: ‘I love you too, Abs. OK, you’re boring the fuck out of me now.’ That’s what he always used to say on the phone. If he was fed up he’d say: ‘You’re boring the fuck out of me now. Bye-bye.’”Six Nations 2025 awards: our writers pick their tournament highlightsRead moreJones laughs, her drying face creasing with delight. “The fact those were his last words was perfect. It was him to a T and he then took his last deep breath and passed.”Four days later, she joined the England camp in preparation for theWXV tournament in Canada. John Mitchell, the head coach, and a few of her friends knew what had happened, but the rest of the squad were oblivious. When she left soon afterwards, having badly injured her ankle, they thought Jones was crying because she was out of the tournament. She was dealing with something far more searing.“My mum didn’t go to my dad’s funeral and I called her a bitch. It wasn’t right to say that because she was ill. But I was angry about losing my dad and that she wasn’t there to look after us. His death triggered her massively and she got anxious about seeing the family.”Her parents had split up, after years of trauma in Cardiff, when Jones was 17. “I used to hear them arguing and the next morning she’d be like: ‘Cup of tea, love?’ My dad would say: ‘Are you joking? You’ve been binge-drinking the last two weeks.’ She’d say: ‘I know. Sorry.’“My dad didn’t realise that me, my brother and sister could hear everything. When I told him he thought: ‘I need to protect my kids.’ He made a really tough decision to basically kick my mum out and she ended up with my gran … I just feel sad for her because she had been so intelligent.

She had a big crash when she was 11 and hit her head and had brain surgery. It was one of her motivating factors to get into such work.”Jones pauses before adding: “I always thought how ironic it was that she was looking after people with brain damage on crazy long shifts and then coming home and not looking after herself. She could run that ward blindfolded, but at home she was a mess. Mum would go three weeks drinking heavily and then have four weeks completely sober. Wouldn’t touch a drop. Then she’d start again.”After surgery on her ankle, Jones went to her mum with her foot in a boot and her heart in a cage. She would not allow herself to grieve. “All I focused on was: ‘Fix my mum, fix my mum.’ She was incontinent and so I was bathing her, making sure she was clean and fed. There was still hope I could save her. Mum felt it, too. She’d say: ‘There’s always hope, Megs.’ But part of her brain also said: ‘Alcohol will fix me.’”Jones began talking toThe Living Room, a charity to help those affected by alcohol and drug abuse. “Wyn [Ellis Owen], their founder and former CEO, is remarkable. He is a 76-year-old alcoholic who has been in recovery for 35 years and he helped me so much. My mum agreed to meet him on 7 December, but she passed away two days earlier. Before she died she rang Wyn to say: ‘I can’t make it, I’ve been drinking.’”Guilt sometimes rises up in Jones, needlessly but understandably, as she gives me a timeline. “In mid-October I’d done two weeks with her and we were going out for coffee, walks, dinner and she wasn’t drinking. Two weeks clean. She’d gone past the shakes and was going to AA meetings. Her sister came from Poland to stay with her.“I went back to my own life, but it was stupid. I left [the Italian liqueur] Disaronno in the fridge. She was at home and just thought: ‘Fuck it. This will fix me.’ She was sad because she was thinking about the love of her life, my dad, and how sad we were. We should have poured that bottle of Disaronno down the drain with all the other alcohol. That was the one that got her drinking again.”The last days were desperate. “I said to the paramedics: ‘Can you not take her?’ They said they couldn’t if she refused and was still functioning. I pleaded with them, crying, and said: ‘Mum, go to the hospital, let them detox you properly. We can start afresh.’ But she was such a proud woman who didn’t want to go to the hospital where she had worked so long.”Jones clutches the shredded kitchen towel tightly. “Perhaps I didn’t push enough and insist she be sectioned. She was doubly incontinent, couldn’t get up, living on her own. I said: ‘Can someone help me?’”Paula could not be saved and Meg, her youngest daughter, is now benefiting from counselling while she has returned to rugby with renewed purpose. In a World Cup year, with England hosting the tournament, Jones has a chance to play a key role in bringing women’s rugby to mainstream attention.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

England are the dominant team in women’s rugby and have lost once in 51 games – the2022 World Cup finalagainst New Zealand, which Jones missed as she was playing sevens.Jones is now one of England’s two vice-captains and her empathy and emotional intelligence are defining features of her leadership: “Vulnerability is really important. It allows you to connect and the biggest thing for me is to inspire and also be inspired.”After facing Italy at home on Sunday, England travel to Cardiff to play Wales the following Saturday. How will Jones control her emotions returning to Wales as memories of her parents pulse through her? “Breathing is a big factor and I really want to be in the present. It’s going to be a trigger, but I just hope it’s in a positive way. I know my dad would have been there. My mum too. So I’m going to relish it.”It will be the day before Mother’s Day and Jones nods. “Another trigger. With grieving we speak about the firsts – first Father’s Day, first birthday, first Christmas. They’re all triggers. But they’re also times you can reflect on the good days and your memories. I’ll be thinking so much of Mum and Dad and all they meant to me.”There has been more death in her family: “My gran, my mum’s mum, passed away three weeks ago. She was 95. She went to the funeral of my mum but my gran was a hard woman, didn’t show much emotion. We’d speak about it and she’d have a tear in her eye and her next breath would be: ‘Cup of tea?’”Jones talks about becoming a patron for The Living Room and starting a family of her own with Celia. Hope and light pour out of her. “I’ve delved deep into love and compassion and that’s changed my outlook. I know how important it is to tell people you love them, you’re there for them.“I look through texts with my mum now and I constantly said: ‘We love you, Mum and I want to help you.’ I continuously said that because I didn’t want her to feel judged. I wanted her to see the love around her. That’s all you can do.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's Six NationsWomen's rugby unionRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The incident was referred for a bunker review at the time but the punishment was not increased beyond the 10 minutes in the sin-bin.The Breakdown | My team of the Six Nations: from Lions in waiting to France’s new King LouisRead moreHe will, however, now face an independent disciplinary hearing on Thursday after being accused for striking an opponent with “any part of the arm, shoulder, head or knee”.The Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, was baffled by the decision not to send off Mauvaka midway through the first half of his side’s 35-16 defeat. France led 10-0 at the time but Scotland cut the deficit to 16-13 before half-time.Townsend said after the game: “It clearly was a non-tackle incident, it was after the whistle. So, if there was head contact and that was intentional, it shouldn’t be anything to do with the force that was involved.“I feel sorry for Ben White here, because he did nothing. He was first of all pushed to the ground, and a push is nothing in rugby, and then he got collided in the head, so I don’t know how it wasn’t raised to a red card.”Explore more on these topicsFrance rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Scotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes with the territory for Mauricio Pochettino, what with his territory these days being the United States and the job of managing the men’s national team. For a World Cup. That the US will largely host next year. And yet Pochettino felt the dial turn a little further on the Friday before last when he watched a clip ofDonald Trump hosting Gianni Infantinoat the White House.“Can the US win?” Trump asked his presidential counterpart at Fifa. To which, for a man as obsequious as Infantino, there was only one reply. Pochettino smiles. “Gianni said yes, but I was disappointed with this answer,” he says. “He should say: ‘You need to ask your great coach, Pochettino.’ Because for sure, he can give a better opinion.”Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump have taken the 2026 World Cup for themselves | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreThe Argentinian has never liked people encroaching into his areas of expertise. It is a part of his self-belief. How would he have dealt with the question? Perhaps with a greater degree of expectation management because Pochettino knows the US are some way short of the elite. There remains work to do to develop the sport in the country.But Pochettino is nothing if not a romantic, someone to see the possibilities and afterwalking away from Chelseaat the end of last season, he found the stars aligning, seducing him. He remembered a line from Daniel Levy, his former chairman at Tottenham. “Daniel always told me that football was about timing,” Pochettino says, and this was perfect – a once in a lifetime opportunity opening up before him. He signed a one-campaign contractwith US Soccer in August. A return to club management could wait.The timing would be wrong for Pochettino with regard to the England job, which wasvacated by Gareth Southgateafter Euro 2024 and occupied at the time by Lee Carsley on an interim basis.Pochettino was linked to the positionand not only because John McDermott, with whom he worked productively at Spurs, was overseeing the appointment as the Football Association’s technical director.The way Pochettino tells it, he was “never involved” in the process that ended with the FA turning toThomas Tuchel in mid-October. “The decision [of the FA] to start the search for a coach was after we signed with the US,” Pochettino says.Would he have considered England? Pochettino’s instinctive reaction is to say yes because, well, that is just him. He normally wants to be in these kind of conversations. But as an Argentinian, he feels his nationality might have been a problem. “For sure, the history [between the nations] is there and that can be controversial … an Argentine guy defending the flag of England,” Pochettino says. “I love England. This is like my home now. But I was never put in that position so it’s not a situation we need to analyse.”View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino took the job to experience a different culture. He says the US was ‘always a mystery’ to him.Photograph: Kevin Kolczynski/APPochettino has checked in with the US at a seismic moment for the game in the country, the most exciting and potentially transformative since it hosted the 1994 World Cup, which led to the formation of Major League Soccer in 1996.Pochettino The 53-year-old says the US was “always a mystery” to him and was drawn to experiencing a different culture, taking in new things such as an NFL game, which he did when he watched the Los Angeles Rams at the SoFi Stadium. Also, to get his head around counterintuitive stuff such assome of his players having not played football until they were 12. The need to adapt is one of Pochettino’s buzz phrases.The bigger picture shows US Soccer primed to move all of its national teams into a purpose-built training centre in Atlanta in April 2026. According to Pochettino, that will be when people see “football is going to be a serious sport [in the US] because it has a home”.He adds: “When you go to the US now [for camps and matches], one time you go to Los Angeles, then it’s New York, Chicago, Miami, Orlando or St Louis. Where is the centre for football? If you look at the training centres of the NFL and baseball, you say: ‘Wow.’ With football, it is: ‘Where is the team going to train? We need to ask the colleges and universities.’“We have Lionel Messi in the MLS and he is helping a lot. But creating the new training centre in Atlanta is as important an impact as having a Messi. In five or 10 years, for sure the US can be No 1 in the world.”USA’s Tim Ream: ‘I don’t have many more of these camps left. I don’t take it for granted’Read morePochettino returns on several occasions to something that has been said for years – the potential for the game in the US is extraordinary. “For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host,” he says.“And then it’s a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win. The players know it’s going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it’s welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver.”Pochettino’s American employers seem more relaxed than his previous set at Chelsea.When he was hiredby Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali in the summer of 2023, the club were reeling from a 12th-placed Premier League finish and there were members of staff who feared they had further to fall.Pochettino would guide Chelsea to sixth and strong runs in the domestic cups, the form consistently good after Christmas. He helped to improve the performance of plenty of players while dealing with numerous injuries; impositions from above, too. Whose idea was it to recruit a specialist set-piece coach from outside Pochettino’s tightly knit circle?At various points during the season, he did not sound as if he was loving the job and from the outside looking in, it was possible to see it as a doomed professional relationship. To repeat: Pochettino demands control and authority in his areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We can be proud of the way we finished.”After eight seasons with Southampton, Spurs and Chelsea, Pochettino will always be connected to the Premier League. He has watched with interest as Pep Guardiola has struggled at Manchester City. There has been a bit of competitive tension between the pair in the past; Guardiola’s “Harry Kane team” comment about Pochettino’s Spurs went down very badly. But the respect has usually been there and never more so than now.“I am 100% convinced that Guardiola today is a much, much better coach,” Pochettino says. “It is difficult for him to be better but now he is because he is suffering things that sometimes [only] we suffered in the beginning. When you start your career as a coach it is not easy sometimes to find the right project. If before he was one of the best of the best, he is much, much better. He is a real manager now.”As for Spurs, where Pochettino managed for five and a half years, doing pretty much everything apart from winning a trophy, the love affair endures; the sense of unfinished business. “In the bottom of my heart, I still feel the same – I would like one day to come back,” he says. “Not because of my ego. It’s because my feeling is I would like one day to win with Tottenham.View image in fullscreenOne of Mauricio Pochettino’s high points at Tottenham was beating Ajax in the 2019 Champions League semi-final.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“We were so close and it was so painful. The problem was that this type of journey creates a lot of friction for different reasons and I made mistakes. But the good thing is when you are clever, you learn from them.“It’s like when a relationship finishes … I feel empty, I feel so disappointed. With everyone but also with myself because I didn’t manage well [enough]. Tottenham is now a club with an expectation to win. That is why I would like one day to come back. It’s six years since we left and it’s always going to be a special club for me.”What kind of host will Donald Trump be for the World Cup and Olympics?Read morePochettino is preoccupied with the adventure at hand; the journey, and that applies on a literal level, too. The travel is a big factor. “They still didn’t give me …come se dice? The green card,” he says, after being asked whether he enjoys celebrity status in the US. “The last time in Los Angeles we were waiting one hour and a half in the queue. I am not complaining but I cannot feel this status. I will feel it if one day they give me the green card.”The vast majority of Pochettino’s squad play for European clubs, most of them in the top leagues, but mitigating the distances to them, together with the relatively small number of contact hours, is prominent among the challenges. He says he is leaning on new technologies in his working strategy.Pochettino has won five of his six matches, losing to Mexico in Guadalajara, and has two in the Concacaf Nations League finals this week – against Panama on Thursday, then Mexico or Canada on Sunday, both in at SoFi Stadium. As always, he is pushing to create the right connections, the right energy. The pressure will only continue to rise. Pochettino relishes the heat.Explore more on these topicsMauricio PochettinoUSATottenham HotspurUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

All countries will be expected to submit stringent national plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but preparations have been overshadowed by the complex geopolitical situation.‘Backsliding’: most countries to miss vital climate deadline as Cop30 nearsRead moreMany developed countries, including EU member states and the UK, are scrambling to devote more money to defence in reaction to Donald Trump’sthreats to withdraw US support to Ukraine, and his warnings on foreign policy. Trump is alsowithdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement.Countries must not make a choice between defence and climate, Toni told the Guardian in an interview in London, but must understand that reducing efforts to combat the climate crisis would have an impact on their future security.“Wars come and go. Unfortunately, climate change is there for a long time. We need to take climate change very seriously, otherwise we will have even more wars in the future. So that trade-off between short-term defence needs now, versus the long-term need to prevent this bigger fight on climate change, is absolutely needed.“[Whether] we should put climate into the defence budget or not, each country will decide,” she added. “Climate is a bigger battle, not of one country but humanity.”Germany’s coalition agreement, signed last week, includes €100bn (£85bn) to be spent on the climate over the next 12 years, alongside massively increased defence spending, achieved by removing the country’s longstanding “brake” on increasing debt.The UK has taken an opposing tack,slashing overseas aidandthreatening to cut the budget for Great British Energy, the national renewable energy champion, in order to pay for increased defence spending while staying within the “fiscal rules”self-imposed by Rachel Reeves, the chancellor.Toni, an economist by training who has previously worked in civil society roles, spoke out against the UK’s move, which many experts have warnedcould reduce developing countries’ capacityto tackle the climate crisis.“Obviously, it’s not a good signal,” she said. “We need to understand that signal, and what type of consequences those signals have.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Toni predicted that the US’s turn away from climate action under Trump would not weakenChina’s efforts to cut carbon.“There is no vacuum in leadership, and Chinese companies are really going forward with the decarbonisation process, because they realise it is very good for their own economy,” she said.All countries have agreed to“transition away from fossil fuels”, she said, so she expected China to address that issue in its national plan, known as anationally determined contribution (NDC)under the2015 Paris climate agreement.Developing countries could use their NDCs as investment plans, to attract private and public sector cash from overseas, she added. “We are hoping that the NDC becomes part of a social and economic plan of development.

Prosper said he wanted to outdo the death toll of the Virgina Tech shooting, which remains the deadliest school shooting in the US, leaving 33 dead.View image in fullscreenNicholas Prosper had earlier pleaded guilty to killing Giselle Prosper, left, Juliana Falcon and Kyle Prosper.Photograph: Bedfordshire Police/PAThe prosecutor Timothy Cray KC said: “The defendant’s main wish was to achieve lasting notoriety as a mass killer. Specifically, he wanted to imitate and even surpass other mass killers around the world.“He had conducted in-depth internet research on shootings in the United States of America, Norway, Australia and New Zealand.“He understood his plans, if realised, would bring about the greatest number of deaths in a school or other mass shooting in the United Kingdom and possibly even in the United States of America.”Prosper wrote a note saying the planned shooting would be “one of the biggest events ever”, Cray said.His premeditated plan was months in the making and killing his family was part of it, the court heard. The day before carrying out the murders, Prosper bought a shotgun from an online seller for £650 after he “made a high-quality forgery of a shotgun certificate or licence”.He had planned to shoot his mother and two younger siblings dead at their flat in Leabank, Luton, while they slept and then travel to St Joseph’s school at about 8.30am to carry out the attack.His plans were disrupted when his family realised that something was wrong in the early hours of 13 September 2024. After challenging him, a violent struggle followed.The court heard that Juliana was killed by a single shotgun shot to her head but her hands and arms had “slash injuries and bruising as if she had been trying to ward off blows from a knife”. Giselle was killed with a single gunshot to her face. Her body was found underneath a dining table “as if she had been trying to hide there”. Kyle died after being shot twice. His body was found with more than 100 knife wounds.When forensic teams entered the property, they found “blood throughout the flat”, including “handprints in blood, smeared blood and airborne blood”.The sounds of gunfire and a struggle alarmed neighbours, who called the police. CCTV footage shown to the court shows Prosper leaving the block of flats at 5.33am with a bag containing a shotgun with 30 cartridges.After hiding for two hours and believing his plan was thwarted as police swarmed the area, he flagged down officers in a marked car who detained him. They found a knife in his right pocket and he directed the officers to the bush that hid the shotgun.The court heard details of a note outlining Prosper’s plan. In it, he wrote the entire attack would be “one of the biggest events ever” and included a diagram pointing to one of the early years’ classrooms at St Joseph’s and an arrow pointing to a second classroom. Beside the first classroom he had written: “Kill all.”He surveilled St Joseph’s, taking images of staff and students from the school’s website and noting the times of lessons and assembly.While formulating the plot, he accessed disturbing online content that “showed deep alienation from normal life and interest in the darkest sides of humanity, including people being killed or seriously injured”. He also looked up images and manifestos of previous mass school shooters.While in custody, Prosper whispered to a medical practitioner at Bedford prison: “I wish I had killed more,” and said he specifically wanted to kill four-year-olds at the school. He also said that he had wanted to cause “the biggest massacre in the 21st century” purely to be famous.He told her he was initially going to carry out the attack on Thursday 12 September but decided to wait until the following day, Friday 13 September, “so it had a good name on it”.Prosper has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A doctor who assessed Prosper said his diagnosis did not explain his lack of empathy and remorse and said he had “psychopathic traits”.David Bentley KC, defending, said his condition meant that he had highly fixed interests, which fuelled his obsession with school shootings. Bentley added that Prosper had been “severely socially and occupationally impaired from the age of 16”, and retreated into looking at harmful content online.“This is a young man who has gone down, in effect, an internet wormhole,” Bentley said.Prosper is due to be sentenced on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLutonCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The second episode – which refers to Andrew Tate, a misogynistic influencer who recentlytravelled to the USdespite facing charges of rape and people trafficking in Romania – also explores the secret meaning contained in emojis used by teenagers online.‘The younger me would have sat up and nodded’: Adolescence writer Jack Thorne on the insidious appeal of incel cultureRead moreA teenage character explains that the use of a red pill – a reference to a red pill showing the world as it is, from the film The Matrix – “is like ‘I see the truth’. It’s a call to action by the manosphere”. An “exploding red pill” indicates someone is an incel, he says. The character goes on to explain that the 100 emoji is another incel symbol, related to the “80 to 20 rule”, the incel theory that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men.Dr Robert Lawson, an expert on sociolinguistics from Birmingham City University, cautioned of “moral panic” around the use of emojis in teenage online discourse, the vast majority of which were likely to be innocuous, he said. But he added that incel culture used a range of words and acronyms to signify belonging to the community, including include Twot (“that whore over there) and Awalt (“all women are like that”).“There’s an element of, if you want to be a part of this community, you need to learn the lingo,” he said. “There is a need to create new terms that speak to the issues in this community [and] within the manosphere, it’s a virulent strain of anti-feminist and anti-women sentiment.”A study from Dublin City University’s anti-bullying centre last year found that social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts fed and amplified anti-feminist and other extremist content to blank smartphones registered as 16- to 18-year-old boyswithin 23 minutesof use. Research in February last year found young men from generation Z were more likely than baby boomers to believefeminism had done more harm than good.The use of emojis in the manosphere is not new, said Prof Dr Lisa Sugiura, an expert in incel culture from the University of Portsmouth. “[Emojis] can also be used to circumvent content moderation,” she said. “So it’s not necessarily clear to social media platforms if it is being used in a way that is hateful or bullying.”The Online Safety Act, whichcame into law on Monday, willfine social media companies if they fail toprevent children seeing the most harmful content, and minimise exposure to abuse, including misogyny. But while platforms had been told to consider “coded language”, incel emojis will only be seen as harmful if used to incite hatred of women, said a spokesperson from Ofcom, the UK watchdog overseeing the act.Daisy Greenwell, a cofounder ofSmartphone Free Childhood, said public debate prompted by the Netflix show should push the government to take direct action to ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers. The safer phones bill, a private member’s bill from the Labour MP Josh MacAlister backed by the group, waswatered down earlier this monthafter opposition to tougher measures.“Adolescence has really struck a chord, expresses the deep fear that we all have parents that as soon as we give our kid a smartphone we lose control,” she said.“It’s not fair to suggest that this is something that parents can solve. We need better legislation so that all kids are safe, not just those whose parents have got the time to make sure they’re not looking at incel content.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleSmartphonesInternet safetySocial mediaJack ThorneAndrew TateGendernewsShareReuse this content"

A woman in her 20s was pronounced dead and two other pedestrians were taken to hospital. One has potentially life-threatening injuries; the other has minor injuries.The driver, a 26-year-old man, was arrested at the scene and was still in custody on Tuesday afternoon.Police were on the Strand taking statements from witnesses.

He had visited the palace twice before the theft but denied these were reconnaissance trips.He previously told jurors at Oxford crown court he “took advantage of” the gold toilet’s “facilities” while at the country house the day before it was stolen. Asked what it was like, he replied: “Splendid.”The court heard that Jones had worked as a roofer, builder and “right-hand man” for James Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, who had pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property.Another man, Frederick Doe, 36, helped Sheen to sell some of the gold in the following weeks after the robbery and was found guilty on Tuesday of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 39, from west London, was found not guilty of the same charge.The fully functioning toilet, created by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was plumbed in at the time of the heist, so its removal led to flooding and resulted in damage to the 18th century stately home and Unesco world heritage site.The toilet, weighing around 98kg, was fitted in 2016 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where 100,000 people queued to use it. It was moved to Blenheim and into a chamber opposite the room where Churchill was born, for Cattelan’s first solo UK show in more than 20 years.Cattelan created the sculpture – called “America” – to reflect the excesses of the art market and evoke the American dream of opportunity for all.Speaking at the time of the theft, he said he hoped the theft was a prank and asked: “Who’s so stupid to steal a toilet? [The work titled] America was the 1% for the 99%.”Blenheim Palace is the ancestral seat of the Duke of Marlborough. Before the toilet’s installation, the duke’s half-brother, Edward Spencer-Churchill, founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, said the lavatory would not be “the easiest thing to nick”.He told the Times: “Firstly, it’s plumbed in; and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don’t plan to be guarding it.”The heist was carried out at 4.50am in the morning when two stolen vehicles, a VW Golf and an Isuzu truck, entered the palace grounds at speed.Three robbers armed with sledgehammers and a crowbar gained entry to the palace, smashed through a solid wooden door and tore the toilet from its fixings.They carried the toilet out of the palace, rolled it along the ground, and placed it into the boot of the VW.In the following days, Sheen made plans to sell the gold, which is believed to have been moved to different locations and melted down in the hours after the raid.According to Thames Valley police, Doe contacted Sheen and offered to find a buyer for the gold and brokered the deal. During the deal-making, both men referred to the gold bars as “cars”, each worth £26,000.Jones was arrested on 16 October 2019 and police analysed his phone. He had allegedly been searching for newspaper reports about the stolen toilet on 20 September, jurors were told previously.Doe will be sentenced on 19 May. Jones and Sheen will be sentenced at a later date.Det Supt Bruce Riddell, head of Thames Valley police’s specialist operations department, said the convictions were the result of a vast amount of police work and that additional investigations are still trying to recover assets related to previous criminality by Sheen.A serious crime prevention order has already been obtained for Sheen after a previous conviction, which will be in place for five years upon his release from prison.“As part of the investigation a number of other arrests were made but further charges could not be brought and it is clear that there are others who were involved in this crime,” said Riddell.Shan Saunders, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed – but those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.“It has been a complex case to prosecute, involving a nationwide investigation with many lines of inquiry to identify those who were subsequently charged in relation to the theft.“While none of the gold was ever recovered – no doubt having been broken up or melted down and sold on soon after it was stolen – we are confident this prosecution has played a part in disrupting a wider crime and money-laundering network.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

I can’t remember exactly what he said but I remember it was gross and I felt disgusted. Noel said that he needed to go to the bathroom but said it wasn’t to use the toilet; he told me that he was hard at the dinner table because he was so turned on and he unmistakeably implied that he was going to the toilet to do something sexual. I smiled at him but I wanted to cry.”Imogen wrote a draft Tumblr post about her alleged experience when she got home but never published it.Clarke denies the allegations and his lawyer, Philip Williams, said to her: “You’re fantasising here, you’re embellishing.”Imogen replied: “Sadly, that’s exactly what happened.”When asked why she did not leave when Clarke went to the toilet, she said her reaction was not untypical of women in such situations. “I was frozen,” she said.Imogen told the court: “Noel was a producer, he was represented by my agent, he was married with children, he was 20 years older than me so I sat there with a smile on my face like everything’s fine ... and it wasn’t fine.”Asked by Williams about the pair subsequently exchanging friendly messages, including one in 2017 in which she signed off “my love xxx”, Imogen said she regularly used flowery language and by then had “moved on”.But she told the court that she had said to herself that she would speak up if there were ever allegations by other women against him.The court has previously heard how Clarke’s lawyers wrote to her threatening her with prosecution for making allegations against him. Imogen said this also helped her realise the importance “that Noel’s conduct is brought to light”.Joanne Hayes, who worked as a costume assistant, also gave evidence for GNM on Tuesday. She said that when she was alone with Clarke in his trailer on set in 2004 he said something like: “I like girls with long hair. It’s nice to have something to hold on to when I do them from behind.”Hayes, who approached the Guardian after its first article about Clarke and whose story was then published, rejected the suggestion by Williams that she had not told anyone at the time because she ​had exaggerated what happened.“I was making my way in the industry and ​you are only ever as good as your last job, as they say, and I didn’t want this to be part of my experience as far as anyone was concerned wanting to employ me in the future,” she told the court.The Guardian is calling 32 oral witnesses in its defence.The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, warned on Tuesday that one of Clarke’s witnesses could face contempt of court proceedings if he failed to respond to a summons to appear before the court to be cross-examined before the conclusion of the case. Arnold Oceng, who appeared in films alongside Clarke, has not been located, nor responded to a WhatsApp message.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

And the worry is that this doesn’t do the right things to get people into work. It’s whether it could push people who are currently just about surviving into greater poverty or more need.”Sophie Morgan, a TV presenter and disability advocate, who is paraplegic, said she saw no justification for the cuts and said the “scapegoating of disabled people is not only toxic, it could be really fatal.Deep cuts, Pip and ‘right to try’ work: the key changes in UK benefits overhaulRead more“If history has taught us anything, these cuts will have the opposite effect of what the government seems to think they will have. It will push people out of work, it will cause more poverty,” she said.“I don’t think there’s a single disabled person in the UK who won’t be affected by this. But I think everyone should be worried – if the government can treat people with the highest needs in our community this way, what else could they possibly do? It’s a very worrying question.”She added: “There is this terrible misconception that disabled people just take, but actually by taking from us, you prevent us from being able to give – we want to be able to participate in life equally the same as anyone else, and that includes going to work.”The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, on Tuesday announced benefit changes including tightening the eligibility rules for personal independence payments (Pip) and reviewing the assessment process, as well as cuts to health-related universal credit.Charities and disability advocate groups criticised the approach, saying the changes would “drive more disabled people into poverty”.Mikey Erhardt, a campaigner atDisabilityRights UK, said: “After months of rumours, media speculation and spin, it is clear these reforms were not about supporting disabled people into work, but instead simply about making brutal and reckless cuts amounting to £5bn.“Rising claims for Pip reflect not a problem with disabled people but rather reflect successive governments’ failure to do even the bare minimum to create a more equitable society.”Paul Kissack, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “A government that came to office pledging to end the moral scar of food bank use clearly should not be taking steps that could leave disabled people at greater risk of needing to use one.”He said “enormous cuts” risked undermining some of the positive reforms announced by the government, such as the “right to try guarantee” to help people back into work.The disabled activist Dermot Devlin said he was almost in tears as he watched Kendall’s speech in the House of Commons on TV.“I had to turn it off because it was too much. The fact that they were putting it across as good news when in fact anyone who is disabled knows it’s anything but good news, it’s absolutely devastating for our community,” he said.“I don’t know if it will affect me, but we don’t know what the parameters are yet. It might not affect me now but it could next year. I’m just a bit lost for words.”Devlin, who has mucopolysaccharidosis type IV, also known as morquio syndrome, said he relied on Pip to help him cover the costs of the powered vehicle he uses to get around, and the mask he wears to help with his breathing while he sleeps.“Public opinion is getting nasty towards disabled people. But Pip is needed for survival,” he said. “You take Pip away and it’s just going to push so many disabled people, including myself, deeper and deeper into poverty.“I’ve never felt more pushed away from being a member of society.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareDisabilityBenefitsTanni Grey-ThompsonPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Her return to the UK comes after her family confirmed she had been released from a immigration detention centre.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesman said: “We supported a British national who was detained in the USA and were in contact with the local authorities.”Burke was trying to cross into the US state of Washington fromCanadawhen she was refused entry. Canadian authorities told her to go back to the US and fill in new paperwork before returning.However, when she tried to re-enter the US, she was handcuffed and put in a cell before being taken to the Tacoma Northwest detention facility.Her father, Paul Burke, previously said she was being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)“in horrendous conditions”and had not had access to legal representation.Speaking on Tuesday, Burke said she left the detention centre yesterday afternoon.She had been planning to stay with a host family where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation, and was told she should have applied for a working visa instead of a tourist visa.She had previously been staying with a host family in Portland, Oregon under a similar arrangement after spending time sightseeing in New York City, where she first arrived from the UK at the start of the year.The family raised nearly £10,000 online to contribute towards her legal fees, living costs and return flight home, and have promised to donate any surplus to charities in Seattle supporting individuals in similar situations.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationWashington stateCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

A call for evidence attracted 7,000 responses and a final report will make recommendations to ministers in the autumn.While broadly positive about current high academic standards and the “knowledge-rich” curriculum, the review, led by Prof Becky Francis, warned the system was “not working well for all”, particularly children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs.Phillipson said: “I welcome the important progress Becky Francis and her expert review are making to drive forward work to take the curriculum into the modern era and help deliver on the government’s plan for change.“That means keeping what’s working and evolving what’s not. The report is clear on the importance of primary school assessment, which [is] simply non-negotiable if we are going to keep pushing standards up for every child and close the attainment gap.”OnGCSEs, the review panel says it will now look at ways of reducing the overall volume of assessment in response to concerns about the stress caused and its impact on pupils’ wellbeing, without compromising the reliability of results.Students in England typically sit between 24 and 31 exams at the end of secondary school, which is comparable to Singapore but far in excess of most other high-performing countries.The report will also address concerns that the volume of content in GCSEs can lead to “teaching to the test”, but there will be no reduction in the number of subjects pupils study. The panel is concerned about maths and English GCSE resits, which frequently lead to repeated failures, and it is considering “other pathways”.Responding to the interim report, the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said the “soft bigotry of low expectations is back” and warned that qualifications would be “less rigorous and less credible”.On the Ebacc – a suite of highly academic GCSE subjects introduced in 2010 by Gove when he was education secretary as a key part of school performance measures – the review was concerned that it constrained student choice and limited their access to vocational and arts subjects.“The intention behind the Ebacc to improve access to a comprehensive, academic curriculum for all should be acknowledged, but as the review progresses, we will also consider whether this remains the most effective means of achieving this objective,” the report said.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: “NAHT are pleased that the negative impact of the Ebacc, the excessive volume of assessment from GCSEs, the ineffective resit policy and the need for a range of vocational and technical qualifications post 16 are all acknowledged and will be subject to further exploration.”He added however that school leaders would be disappointed by the lack of plans to reduce Sats tests for pupils.Explore more on these topicsCurriculumsSchoolsTeachingGCSEsSatsExamsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is such bollocks. We were in the most terrible position. There was no doubt one or two crooks and cranks, but they were largely credible, which is borne out in the volume of stuff that they ended up delivering.”Use of ‘VIP lane’ to award Covid PPE contracts unlawful, high court rulesRead moreEarlier Agnew cited the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, who was linked to a multi-million pound contract secured through the VIP lane that the inquiry will behearing evidence about in private.Agnew said: “Yes, we got plenty of stuff wrong. Yes, probably some crooks came through the VIP lane. Yes, we’ve got this Baroness Mone woman who perhaps you are going to ask me about.”Richard Wald KC, told Agnew he would not be asked about Mone. Agnew replied: “That’s a relief because the NCA [National Crime Agency] will deal with her.”Agnew added: “I really struggle to understand why this [the VIP lane] is such a point of obsession. We really had nothing, so if there were credible people out there who could help, then we should go with them.”Lady Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, defended the inquiry’s question about the VIP lane. “It doesn’t indicate an obsession. It certainly doesn’t indicate any view on my part. The questions are designed just to explore an area of public concern,” she said.Agnew acknowledged he was “the godparent” of the VIP lane. He compared it to the role Lord Beaverbrook played as armaments minister during the second world war when the Spitfires he had helped to build contributed to winning the Battle of Britain.He said: “In your world, you wouldn’t have had a rogue like Lord Beaverbrook doing something like that. He was a philanderer, he was a bully, he was an egotist.

The administration is expected to appeal the ruling.At issue in the lawsuit, brought by more than two dozen unnamed former USAid employees in federal district court in Maryland, was Musk’s role in overseeing the deletion of the USAid website and the shut down of its headquarters.Chuang wrote in his 68-page opinion that Musk had likely violated the appointments clause of the constitution by effectively acting with the far-reaching powers of an “officer of the United States”, a designation that requires Senate confirmation.“If a president could escape appointments clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president’s priority to agency heads,” Chuang wrote, “the appointments clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.”The Trump administration has said for weeks that the moves to dismantle USAid were carried out by theagency’s leaders– currently secretary of state Marco Rubio and acting administrator Pete Marocco – who were implementing recommendations from Musk.But Chuang rejected that contention with respect to the closure of USAid headquarters and the erasure of its website, saying that the administration provided no evidence that they were formally authorized by a USAid official.“Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants’ sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID’s headquarters and website even though he ‘lacked the authority to make that decision,’” Chuang wrote.The injunction follows six weeks of unprecedented turmoil at USAid, where 5,200 of 6,200 global programs wereabruptly terminated, staff werelocked outof facilities and systems, and employees reportedly received directives todestroy classified documentsusing shredders and “burn bags”.The agency’s workforce has been decimated from over 10,000 to just 611 employees, with Rubio characterizing the remaining programs as “set for absorption” by the state department – what he recently praised as “overdue and historic reform”.USAid’s headquarters became central to the controversy when multiple staffers told the Guardian in February that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials had been conducting extensive“walkthrough” toursto potentially take over the facility while agency employees remained barred entry.Aid workers warn ‘people are dying and they’re going to continue dying’ as funding cuts hitRead morePolitico later reported that CBP had officially taken over the office space and signed a lease agreement, according to a CBP spokesperson. The court order’s 14-day deadline for the administration to confirm USAid could return to its building suggested the space may have already been reallocated.The injunction also prohibits Doge from publishing unredacted personal information of USAid contractors and halts further dismantling actions, including terminations, contract cancellations, and permanent deletion of electronic records.That may already be a serious exposure problem for Musk and the rest of Doge, as an internal email obtained by the Guardian revealed how staff had been instructed to spend the day destroying classified “SECRET” documents – potentially breaking compliance with the Federal Records Act, which prohibits destroying government records before their designated retention period, which is typically two years.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskDonald TrumpUSAidUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history, the nationwide ban passed by 136 votes to 27 after it was submitted to parliament one day earlier.It amends the country’s law on assembly to make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate Hungary’scontentious“child protection” legislation, which bars any “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under the age of 18.The legislation was condemned by Amnesty International, which described it as the latest in a series of discriminatory measures the Hungarian authorities have taken against LGBTQ+ people.“The spurious justification for the passing of this law – that events and assemblies would be ‘harmful to children’ – is based on harmful stereotypes and deeply entrenched discrimination, homophobia and transphobia,” itsaid in a statement.“This law is a full-frontal attack on the LGBTI community and a blatant violation of Hungary’s obligations to prohibit discrimination and guarantee freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” it said, adding that the ban would turn the clock back 30 years inHungaryby undermining hard-won rights.Hadja Lahbib, the EU commissioner for equality, suggested the new law contravened the values of the 27-nation bloc, posting: “Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely. The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community – in Hungary & in all member states.After lawmakers first submitted the bill on Monday, the organisers of Budapest Pride said the law was aimed at turning the LGBTQ+ minority into a “scapegoat” in order to silence critics of Orbán’s government.“This is not child protection, this is fascism,” organisers wrote. Budapest Pride will mark its 30th anniversary this year, bringing together thousands of people to make visible the community’s struggle for freedom, safety and equal rights even as those in power continually seek to dehumanise them, it noted.“The government is trying to restrict peaceful protests with a critical voice by targeting a minority,” it added. “Therefore, as a movement, we will fight for the freedom of all Hungarians to demonstrate.”Organisers said they planned to go ahead with the march in Budapest, despite the law’s stipulation thatthose who attend a prohibited event could face fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (£425).As the vote was held, opposition MPs ignited smoke bombs, filling the parliamentary chamber with thick plumes of colourful smoke.View image in fullscreenOpposition MPs set off flares in the Hungarian parliament.Photograph: Boglárka Bodnár/APAfter the law’s adoption, a spokesperson for Budapest Pride, Jojó Majercsik, told the Associated Press that the organisation had received an outpouring of support.“Many, many people have been mobilised,” Majercsik said. “It’s a new thing, compared with the attacks of the last years, that we’ve received many messages and comments from people saying: ‘Until now I haven’t gone to Pride, I didn’t care about it, but this year I’ll be there and I’ll bring my family.’”Since returning to lead the country in 2010, Orbánhas faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions, including accusations of gradually undermining the rule of law.His government, in turn, has sought to portray itself as a champion of traditional family values, unleashing a crackdown that has drawnparallels with Russiaas it adopts measures such as blocking same-sex couples from adopting children and barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes.Tamás Dombos, a project coordinator at the Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, described Orbán’s assault on minorities as a tactic aimed at distracting voters.“It’s a very common strategy of authoritarian governments not to talk about the real issues that people are affected by: the inflation, the economy, the terrible condition of education and healthcare,” said Dombos.Orbán, he continued, “has been here with us for 15 years lying into people’s faces, letting the country rot basically, and then coming up with these hate campaigns”.The restrictions on Pride come as Orbán is facing anunprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar, in advance of next year’s elections, leading some to suggest the ban was aimed at winning over far-right voters.“It is easy to win votes by restricting the rights of a minority in a conservative society,” Szabolcs Hegyi of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) told Agence France-Presse.He warned, however, that the curtailing of civil liberties, seemingly for political gain, was a slippery slope. “Eventually, you can get to a situation where virtually no one can protest except those who are not critical of the government’s position.”Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánLGBTQ+ rightsEuropeAmnesty InternationalProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Subsequent observations concluded that the phenomenon was due to tiny dust particles in the moon’s thin atmosphere glowing at lunar sunrise and sunset, while some theories suggest the particles levitated.Blue Ghost also captured high-definition imagery of a total eclipse on 14 March, when the Earth blocked the sun from the moon’s horizon.A SpaceX Falcon rocket launched the lander, which is about the size of a hippopotamus, on a 2.8-mile journey on 15 January. Blue Ghost was carrying an array of scientific experiments, including a lunar soil analyzer, a radiation-tolerant computer and an experiment testing the feasibility of using the existing global satellite navigation system to navigate the moon.“Firefly Aerospace is extremely proud to have accomplished this first fully successful commercial moon landing,” Jason Kim, the company’s chief executive, said.“I truly believe Firefly and Blue Ghost’s historic mission will be a new chapter in textbooks and become a beacon of what humanity can achieve.”A separate mission by a private company to land a spacecraft carrying scientific equipment on the moon ended in failure earlier this month when the Athena probe launched by Intuitive Machines toppled upon landing and wasdeclared dead.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTwo images of the sun setting on the moon, with the Earth and Venus in the distance.Photograph: APExplore more on these topicsThe moonSpaceThe sunNasaTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

And the United States’s priorities, our ally, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,” he said.“We cannot and should not look first to others to defend our nation.”Australia is a leader in “over-the-horizon” radar, an advanced system that allows for continuous threat-tracking over a vast area.“The radar system’s long-range surveillance and threat tracking capabilities will detect and deter threats across the North,” Carney’s office said in a statement announcing the deal.The new network will replace an ageing cold war-era North Warning System, which relies on radar stations from Alaska to northern Quebec that are incapable of responding to modern missile threats.Ottawa will also invest an additional C$420m to boost Canada’s year-round military presence in the far north.“Securing Canada is an absolute strategic priority of this government,” Carney said. “We will need to do more.”Funding for enhanced Arctic radar was announced under Trudeau, but the decision to partner with Australia was unveiled on Tuesday.The new reality dawning in Australia: it can no longer rely on the USRead moreCanada made Arctic security a priority before Trump returned to office, amid concern about possible Russian aggression as melting ice caused by climate change increasingly opens the region for resource extraction.But Trump’s repeated questioning of Canadian sovereignty has sparked renewed focus on national defence in Canada, which once viewed its security ties with Washington as iron-clad.Canada’s defence minister, Bill Blair, this month announced plans for three new Arctic military hubs with airstrips and equipment depots.New Canadian prime ministers typically make calling the American president a first priority after taking office, but with the countries fighting a trade war initiated by Trump’s tariffs, it remains unclear when Carney and Trump will speak.Carney said on Tuesday he would have a “comprehensive” discussion with Trump about trade “at the appropriate time”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaArcticMark CarneyWeapons technologyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It is now forbidden for them to die either inside or outside the ring.The change stemmed from a citizens’ initiative which first proposed a total ban, only for the head of the Mexico City government, Clara Brugada, to modify it and introduce the concept of non-violent bullfights.Brugada suggested that the move would allow them to retain the economic activity around bullfighting. Proponents claim the industry supportstens of thousands of jobs.“The spectacle of blood cannot be justified under any concept of art and tradition,” said Brugada. “Some will argue that it is part of traditions and culture, but culture, music and art, even rights, change, evolve, transform. We big cities are obliged to transform at the same time. Animal welfare is a right and a duty for society.”Bullfighting in MexicoRead moreMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, also spoke in support of the initiative.The bullfighting industry rejected the new regulation and said they had not been consulted on it.At a press conference, Salvador Arias, a lawyer from Tauromaquia Mexicana, an organisation that defends bullfighting, said Brugada’s proposal for bloodless bullfights resembled one that wastried and failed in the Balearic Islands in Spain, where it won little interest from fans and was eventually thrown out by a Spanish court.Indeed, animal rights groups are counting on that lack of interest. In astatement, Culture Without Torture regretted that the ban was not total, but added that “in practice, we doubt that the proposed events will take place, since what fans of bullfighting truly want to see is blood”.Explore more on these topicsMexicoBullfightingAmericasAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both had valid tourist visas for the US and have now returned to Germany.According to Sielaff’s fiancee, Lennon Tyler, he was detained for two weeks after incorrectly answering a question about where he lived owing to his poor grasp of English.

The FBI is probing at least three other incidents of Molotov cocktails hurled at Tesla facilities since January, including one in Kansas City,Missouri, that took place on the same night as the alleged arson inNevada.InLas Vegas, in the middle of the night on Tuesday, a cluster of Tesla vehicles were set on fire as they sat in a lot at a Tesla collision center, according to the Las Vegas metropolitan police department. Security cameras caught a person dressed in all black tossing what appeared to be Molotov cocktails into the vehicles at approximately 2.45am.‘Tesla is a good target’: Elon Musk’s car business is focus of fury for political roleRead more“Upon arrival, officers discovered several vehicles on fire, as well as the word ‘resist’ spraypainted on the front doors of the business,” said Dori Koren, the assistant sheriff with the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, during a press conference on Tuesday. “At least fiveTeslavehicles were damaged, to include at least two of which were engulfed in flames.”Police said the Las Vegas suspect also fired three rounds of ammunition into the Tesla vehicles parked at the collision center. The sheriff said the incident was a “targeted attack” against the Tesla facility and that there was no threat to the general public.Spencer Evans, a special agent with the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, said at the press conference that the Tesla fires were initially being investigated for arson, but now are being considered for possible terrorism.“Was this terrorism, was it something else?” Evans said. “It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think – you know, the writing on the wall, the potential political agenda, there’s an act of violence. So, none of those factors are lost on us.”Elon Musk, the CEO of the electric vehicle maker, called the Las Vegas Tesla fires an act of “terrorism” in apost on X, the social media platform he owns. On Monday, in alonger post, he lamented the backlash and blamed the “woke” left. “My companies make great products that people love and I’ve never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me? Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,” he wrote. Musk and Tesla did not return requests for comment.On Tuesday, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, spoke to Fox News about Tesla showrooms bearing the brunt of Molotov cocktail attacks. “If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re going to come after you,” Bondi said.Muskpostedthe Fox News clip to X, which gathered more than 8m views within hours.The Las Vegas firebombing is the latest attack on a Tesla facility that appears to be in protest of Musk, who is also a senior adviser toDonald Trump. Musk is the head of the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), the new name of the US Digital Service, that has been working to overhaul the federal government with massive budget cuts and the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees.Along with Nevada, the Guardian has trackedthree other incidents at Tesla showroomsinvolving Molotov cocktails, including in Oregon, Colorado and Missouri, all of which are under FBI investigation. Another incident in South Carolina, where a suspect threw Molotovs at a Tesla charging station, is being investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this case, against Tesla facilities and vehicles and their owners,” Evans, the FBI agent, said. “That is absolutely unacceptable.”Trump said last week that he would designate the violence against Tesla facilities as domestic terrorism. The pronouncement came during a press conference where the president wasshowcasing Tesla vehiclesin front of the White House, with Musk alongside him.

According toVariety, pro-Palestinian protesters held signs that read “Heroes Fight Like Palestinians,” “Viva Viva Palestina” and “No Other Land Won Oscar,” referring to the documentary on Israeli incursions onto Palestinian land in the West Bank thatwon the awardfor best documentary this month.Avideoposted to X by Variety reporter Katcy Stephan shows protesters chanting “shame on Gal Gadot”. Another showed multiple protestershandcuffedby police. The crowd also shouted: “Up up with liberation, down down with occupation” and “not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crime.” Variety reported that nearly two dozen protesters gathered for each side.Wish it away: will the live-action Snow White be a new low for Disney?Read moreThe demonstrations delayed the ceremony by about 15 minutes. Protesters could still be heard as the proceedings got underway, and police were called after a pro-Palestinian protester stole an Israeli flag.Gadot, who stars as the Evil Queen in Disney’s live-actionSnow White, served in the Israeli military and has vocally supported Israel since the 7 October terrorist attacks and subsequent invasion of Gaza, both on social media and in an impassioned speech before the Anti-Defamation League’s annual summit on 4 March. “Never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews,” she said in her speech.View image in fullscreenGal Gadot.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking toVarietyahead of Tuesday’s ceremony, Gadot described how she became more direct with her politics after the Hamas-led attack on Israeli citizens on 7 October 2023. “When people were abducted from their homes, from their beds, men, women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors, were going through the horrors of what happened that day, I could not be silent,” she said. “I was shocked by the amount of hate, by the amount of how much people think they know when they actually have no idea, and also by how the media is not fair many times. So I had to speak up.”“I am all about humanity,” she continued, “and I felt like I had to advocate for the hostages.” As for criticism of her stances, she added: “when your compass is clear, your conscience is clean. I know what I’m advocating for, and I know what I wish for the world.”Gadot steered clear of the issue during her ceremony, instead thanking Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins and Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel, and referring to herself as “just a girl from a town in Israel”.‘It’s controversial and polarising’: is Disney’s new Snow White a poisoned apple?Read moreThe demonstrations precede the opening weekend for Snow White, which has faced its own fair share of controversy in the weeks leading up to its release. Speculation of a rift between Gadot and co-star Rachel Zegler, who is vocally pro-Palestine, flared after Disneyscaled backlast weekend’s world premiere, limiting interviews to in-house, talent-friendly press. Zegler has also received flak for publiclycriticizingthe original 1937 version of Snow White, and wishing on Instagram that Donald Trump and his voters “know no peace” after the November election. She sinceapologized.Gadot is also not the only Disney star to face criticism for their stance on Israel-Palestine. Last month, several dozen pro-Palestinian protestersgatheredoutside the Hollywood premiere of Captain America: Brave New World, calling for a boycott of the film over the inclusion of Israeli superhero Ruth Bat-Seraph, aka Sabra, played by Israeli actor Shira Haas.They held signs with such slogans as “Disney supports genocide.”In a joint letter, some Palestinian cultural groups complained: “By reviving this racist character in any form, Marvel is promoting Israel’s brutal oppression of Palestinians.”Explore more on these topicsGal GadotIsrael-Gaza warProtestPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

Some threats enter our union in less than a second as an encrypted message, for instance, ordering an assassination of a rival drugdealer. Some threats enter in a few days, like a bus full of migrants, paid by the Russians.”At the launch of the report at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague, the Polish undersecretary of state for internal affairs, Maciej Duszczyk, said a recent cyber-attack on a hospital which interrupted medical care for several hours was linked to a state actor.He also said migrant-smuggling incidents on the border with Belarus were running to 150 to 170 a day and involved state actors working with criminal gangs in the Middle East and Turkey.Europol’s assessment of the threat posed by criminal gangs is conducted every four years.Poland’s police chief Marek Borón warned that, even if a peace deal is struck, the Russian invasion of Ukraine would have a lasting impact, with a potential “increase in the black market in weapons and ammunition and attempts by Russia criminal-speaking groups to exert influence”.On Monday,prosecutors in Lithuaniaattributed blame for an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last summer to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, which is also suspected of being behind fires in other supermarkets and shopping centres.In response, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the prosecutors had “confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services”.Two Ukrainian suspects have been arrested – one in Lithuania, the other in Poland – over the attack.Europol found that criminal networks “increasingly operate as proxies in service of hybrid threat actors” in a cooperation that has mutual benefits.This “shadow alliance” allows Russia to use criminal networks in an ad hoc fashion, “leveraging each other’s resources, expertise, and protection to achieve their objectives”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parker Posey’s viral White Lotus accent is a gift to us allThe actor’s lorazepam-fueled North Carolinian line delivery in the comedy drama series has taken the internet by stormStuart HeritageTue 18 Mar 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 17.17 EDTShareEvery season ofThe White Lotushas its thing: a moment that takes off and becomes its own monster until long after the end credits roll on the finale. Season one was the suitcase poop scene, an effect so bizarrely groundbreaking that other showrunners wound uppublicly musingon how much it must have cost. Season two’s thing was Jennifer Coolidge saying, “These gays, they’re trying to murder me,” which you will see replayed three times a minute whenever you look at anyone’s Instagram stories.Checking out early: who is going to die in this season of The White Lotus?Read moreIt might be too early to definitively state what season three’s thing is – The White Lotus always goes from a standing start to a nutso finale, and we still have three episodes left for things to really ramp up – but there are already a couple of contenders. For a while, it looked like it might have been Jason Isaacs’ penis, until he forcefullyshut down the conversationlast week. And that leaves the single most spectacular thing about the season so far: Parker Posey’s accent.For the newcomers, onThe White LotusPosey plays Victoria Ratliff, a wealthy North Carolina matriarch who is frequently spaced out on lorazepam. Unlike her onscreen husband Jason Isaacs, whose accent frequently veers towards Australia in times of great drama, Posey’s accent is resolute. She groans out all her lines through her downturned mouth, forcing many more syllables out of words than anyone ever thought possible (the verbal origami she deployed transforming the word “society” into the astonishingly drawn-out “sohsoiietay” this week deserves particular attention). It’s incredible. In Parker’s hand, every line becomes an obstacle course.What’s equally fascinating is watching the reaction to it unfold in real time. At first the accent seemed to confuse viewers, with Twitter users calling it“perplexing”or – worse – attempting to describe it withgifs of Jennifer Coolidge looking baffled. But then Parker went on the offensive.On the Today show earlier this month, she delivered a masterclass on the funniest words that a wealthy North Carolinian woman can say in south-east Asia, including “tsunami” and “Buddhism”. Last week, while promoting the show, Parker claimed that her accent had received the seal of approval from actual North Carolinians, albeit North Carolinians fancy enough to run into her during Paris fashion week. “There were these people from North Carolina at the hotel,” she said, “and they were like, ‘We just have to say, ‘We’re from North Carolina. We think you’re doing a great job. We love the accent. It’s dead on. You’ve got that part down.’”And now the accent has transcended all forms of traditional criticism. Parker’s White Lotus co-star Patrick Schwarzenegger went viral for doinghis own spot-on impressionof her during an interview that was directly followed by thebizarre sightof two women yelling “No! Tsunami! No!” in tortured southern accents while dousing each other with hairspray.This has been all the encouragement that TikTok needed. The platform is now deluged withrankingsof Posey’s line readings, primarily from her Today show appearance, of which “Piper, no” seems to be the clear winner. Influencers have started to doVictoria Ratliff cosplay videos. Clips have surfaced of Parkerforcingher interviewers to yell “Piper, no!” at her. The official White Lotus account has even got in on the act, postingsupercutsof all the times her character said the word “lorazepam”.This is where we all live now. The actual plot of The White Lotus –guessing who will be killed by whom and how– has taken a back seat to the verbal contortions of Parker Posey. We now live in a world where the word “understand” has become the four-syllable behemoth “understayund”, where “normal” is now pronounced “norramhul” and where “don’t” has ballooned into the two-word phrase “doh went”.In truth, this might pass. Virality of this strength often lives hard and dies young. And, as previously mentioned, the show is only just getting going. A fortnight from now every episode of The White Lotus will be such a carnival whirlwind of unending insanity that we might forget the simple pleasures of watching a beloved character actor take the word “guru” and kick seven bells out of it. But I hope not. Parker Posey’s White Lotus accent is a thing of true beauty, and it deserves to be remembered forever. If you don’t get that by now, I can’t help you understayund.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the Barnett twins among the Southend amusement arcadesTue 18 Mar 2025 12.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 19.00 EDTShareJack and George Barnett arrange to meet me at the Hope Hotel, an 18th-century pub in their native Southend. With Talking Heads on the jukebox and pints already flowing at midday, it feels like we’ve stepped back into the good-timeEssexseaside town of old. The twins arrive, Jack in a dark grey tweed and black fleece, George in knitwear and leather jacket. They suggest going outside so we don’t have to shout over 1980s hits, but if anything the sonic interference of Southend – all amusement arcades and revving motors – is worse.It turns out this chimes with the creation of Crooked Wing, the fifth album from their bandThese New Puritans. Jack was living on an industrial estate in Tottenham, London, between factories and evangelical churches. “I think some of the loudness,” he says, “comes from trying to compete with all the machinery and religious ecstasy.”Jack broke off working on the album to travel with a Brazilian circus – its aerialist sings on the recordWith its melancholy, exultation and occasional blasts of menacing drums, Crooked Wing is instantly recognisable as a These New Puritans record, but the band are now going to places they have never been before in their two-decade avant-pop career.The album begins with a 10-year-old member of Southend Boys’ Choir singing “I am buried / I am deep underground”, over the sound of the organ in St Mary’s and All Saints Church in Stambridge, a village outside Southend where the Barnetts’ grandfather was once organist. The locale soon shifts to the Peloponnese on Bells, the first song Jack wrote for the album, which stemmed from a particularly fruitful field recording of a Greek orthodox church.Pop singerCaroline Polachek– a fan of the band – is on Industrial Love Song, a duet imagining two cranes serenading each other on a building site, which launched last week with a surreal video directed by Harley Weir with creative direction from George: the protagonist is a middle ages knight covered in a translucent goo reminiscent of Thames mud. Other tracks were recorded across the estuary in Ramsgate, where co-producer Graham Sutton lives. “It’s sleepier than Southend, and probably a bit less edgy,” says Jack. “But it does have the largest Wetherspoon’s in the world.”George was born two minutes before Jack and has the slightly frustrated air of an older brother who is aware of the thinness of his seniority. During the interview, the 37-year-olds put on a united front, constantly checking with one another if what they say is OK to put on the record. But occasionally there is a scrap over who gets to tell a story. George to Jack: “It doesn’t matter. That’s irrelevant.” Jack to George: “Just wait a second. Let me fucking talk.”Jack is the singer, multi-instrumentalist and principal songwriter, George is the drummer and percussionist, but also in charge of visuals, artwork and stage direction. While Jack takes after their organist grandfather, George is more like their steelworking amateur boxer grandad on the other side, and on the face of it their lifestyles could not be more different.George is a successful model for clients including Gucci, and has lived in east London for years with his wife, Pixie Geldof. The couple have a child but, given his partner’s experiences growing up in the world of celebrity, he is reluctant to go into detail. Geldof is “amazing,” he simply says. “I adore her.”Jack is now back in Southend and has a regime for writing songs, but is also restless. While working on Crooked Wing, he broke off to travel with a Brazilian circus, accompanying his then-girlfriend, an accomplished aerialist who sings on the record. He also spent time living in Athens.View image in fullscreenFlower power … the lineup in 2007 with Thomas Hein, centre.Photograph: Avalon/Getty ImagesI first saw These New Puritans playing upstairs at the Grand Hotel in 2005, a large, now defunct pub in Leigh-on-Sea, close to Southend, where the band (and I) grew up. By then they were already steeped in local musical lore. Their father, a quick-witted builder born in London, would sink pints at the Grand with Lee Brilleaux, singer with Dr Feelgood, whose guitarist Wilko Johnson taught their mum to play. She even stitched togetherDr Feelgood’s white suits – though, George says, “the sweat took the pink lining through the suit and turned them pink, and so their manager refused to pay”.After years playing in various bands, the brothers enlisted their friend Thomas Hein, and later their cousin Sophie Sleigh-Johnson. A Fall song inspired their name and their scratchy sound fitted with the 00s post-punk revival, so they were quickly subsumed into a vibrant Southend scene that also included the Horrors. Their dad drove them to gigs in his work van. “All his tools were still in the back,” says Jack. “It almost felt like doing a heist.”In 2008 they recorded Beat Pyramid, a frenetic album bristling with electronics and ideas. But instead of riding the wave of a period now known as “indie sleaze”, the band recoiled from being “subtly channelled into areas that aren’t the most interesting”, Jack says. “And so from that point on, I decided that, whatever the cost, we would just pursue the music to the bitter end.”The result was 2010’s acclaimed albumHidden, which provided the blueprint for future These New Puritans records, fusing the propulsive battle-rap-meets-Beefheart rhythms of Beat Pyramid with the pointillism of Steve Reich and choral arrangements of Benjamin Britten, who loved the east of England coastline as much as Jack.Jack learned to write stave notation at the age of 21 for Hidden and the band later performed the album live with the Britten Sinfonia, London Children’s Choir – and their mate Rory smashing melons with a hammer. To a UK music press still searching for the next Liam and Noel, it was a befuddling about-turn, but to the brothers it made perfect sense. “It was closer to what it was like when me and George were making music when we were seven or eight,” says Jack, “on an old four-track in the loft with one microphone and a pair of bongos and an acoustic guitar.”Hidden set in motion an astonishing – though slowly gestated – run of records whose fans included Elton John, Björk and Massive Attack. With its wide-eyed Edenic feeling, Crooked Wing nestles back into the same territory as the band’s masterpiece, 2013’s Field of Reeds – an album that riffed on the intensity of Jack’s internal world as well as Essex’s beguiling islands – rather than the slick, propulsive, Berlin-penned Inside the Rose, which came out in 2019. There’s more space between the notes again, and the organ influence is greater, while Jack’s piano playing sounds more accomplished and natural.View image in fullscreenScratchy post punk … live in 2010.Photograph: Jordi Vidal/RedfernsSince Hidden, the way of working has been set: music written by Jack is then sent to George, a process George describes as “finding a diamond in the rough”. Once the shape of the music has been agreed, Jack writes out the notation like a film score. The Barnetts are now the only constant Puritans after Sleigh-Johnson left to become a writer and artist and Hein retrained as a neuroscientist (though he returned for a percussion cameo for this record). The band expand to make each album, with additional musicians sought, booked and recorded as quickly as possible so as not to run up too large a bill. Jack lays down vocals outside the studio, improvising in a trancelike state, sometimes in hotel rooms.“All of life was sent into the mincer” for the lyrics this time around, he says. The Ukraine war was a background influence: “Maybe in the back of my mind, it makes you realise life can be harsh and brutal, but you do your best to build a little edifice of beauty around it.”How have they steered this ambitious artistic project through the turbulent economic headwinds of the 21st century? “It’s always a battle,” Jack says. “It’s just the way it is for musicians now.” When making the album Inside the Rose, he was existing on one euro a day: his top tips are to live on tinned food and “get fruit at the end of the day at the market”. He also composes music for adverts: clothes, cars, perfume, food. “It makes a nice change from working on stuff that is yours. A palate cleanser.”George says the modelling industry isn’t what it once was, but his earnings have contributed to projects such asWe Want War’s music video in 2009, with its slo-mo aquatic acrobatics.View image in fullscreen‘It’s always a battle’ … George and Jack Barnett.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianPart of the reason it has taken six years for Crooked Wing to appear is because the Barnetts wanted to make the full album before securing a label to release it. “So sometimes we have to stop,” says Jack. “Oh, we want to do this session. Well, we have to wait until we have enough money to do it. So you have to be prepared to take a massive financial hit.” Luckily Domino, home to Arctic Monkeys and Wet Leg, snapped up the finished album: a series of songs that seemingly sit outside of time, sounding like both the future and the past.While Jack’s songwriting prowess is obvious, the band is a complete collaboration. Jack gives the example of album opener Waiting, with George paring it back to just an organ and that choirboy’s voice. “That completely transformed it,” Jack says. “It’s almost like I’m up close looking at all the cells and the bacteria – and George is looking at the whole body.”Crooked Wing will be released on 23 May by Domino.

The inventor ofQuasimodoandJean Valjeanis so universal that we absorb his myths even if we have never picked up one of his books. Yet how much do most of us know about Hugo himself, behind the books, the films, the musicals? By dedicating an exhibition to this versatile creator’s visual art, which started with a few caricatures and developed into sublime and surreal masterpieces, the Royal Academy does something unexpectedly moving. It takes you into the secret heart of a man we tend to think of only as a classic.For instance we discover that Hugo campaigned against the death penalty nearly two centuries ago. His 1854 drawing Ecce Lex (Behold the Law) is a macabre inky portrait of a hanged corpse, part of his doomed campaign to save a condemned murderer calledJohn Tapner. Hugo opposed capital punishment on principle, but a few years later gave permission for this drawing to be made into a print protesting the execution of American anti-slavery activistJohn Brown. If there was a liberal cause, Hugo threw his huge heart into it.View image in fullscreenLace and Spectres, 1855-56.Photograph: Maisons de Victor Hugo/Roger-ViolletOne of the first drawings you encounter in this sensitively curated show is his sketch of the council chamber in the town hall of Thionville in the north-east of France, after it was left in ruins by the invading Prussian army in 1871. Thus, in his late 60s, he added war artist to his vocations of author and campaigner, and recorded the violence of the Franco-Prussian war. In fact, this disaster for France improved his own life. It led to the fall of the dictator Louis Napoleon, whom Hugo had defied, choosing political exile on Guernsey, where he created some of his most haunting art.That was his public life. Hugo’s art, however, takes you under his skin, without rules or any audience except himself, absolutely free and dauntingly creative. You can feel the isolation and soul-searching in his 1850 sketch Causeway, which dwells on nothing more than a bleak rocky causeway, perhaps his road to exile. In a drawing beside it he ponders the woody morass of a soaking breakwater in Jersey – the first Channel Island to which he fled.Sketch?Drawing? It’s hard to define exactly what these are. Hugo uses a mixture of ink, charcoal, graphite and wash to create his murky paper visions. Sometimes he works on a tiny scale: The Abandoned Park, a silhouette-like image of trees beside a mirroring lake, is just 4.4cm tall and 3.5cm across. The miniaturisation adds to the ghostliness. Yet he can also take drawing to staggering largeness, as in the final depiction of a Guernsey lighthouse with a frail staircase spiralling up to a mystical, hopeful light.View image in fullscreenMushroom, 1850.Photograph: CC0 Paris Musées / Maisons de Victor HugoAt times Hugo is just the writer doodling – using up spare ink, he said – yet his doodles develop. A symmetrical ink stain, like a Rorschach blot, has little faces drawn into it. Other frolics that Hugo called “taches”, or stains, are boldly abstract. Sometimes they form themselves into cosmic visions of planets or unreal landscapes but others remain free and formless.Out of this wild freedom a theme emerges: architecture. This should not be a surprise because after all the real hero of his novel Notre-Dame de Paris is not Quasimodo but Notre-Dame itself – a tottering, unloved old pile of stone when Hugo wrote it. So as well as Dickens, he resembles those Victorian champions of the gothicRuskinandPugin. But he’s Ruskin on a lot of beaujolais, his imagination drunk on gothic turrets and spires; castles on hilltops or by lakes; fairytale castles and nightmare castles; real ones and dreamed ones.When he visited the town of Vianden, in today’s Luxembourg, its castle fascinated him so much he lived in it for three months. He depicts it as shadowy and unreal, like a design for a 30s horror movie. In a second drawing the castle is a floating phantasm above a rickety array of wooden houses: not so much Dracula’s castle as Kafka’s.View image in fullscreenOctopus, 1866–69.Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale de FranceWhen Hugo lived on Guernsey he turned his house into a gothic retreat with a Romantic interior full of fantastical touches. It is evoked here with spooky photographs and a battered mirror whose wooden frame he painted with colourful birds. His fireplace, which he sketched, was emblazoned with a huge H, as if he were a medieval lord.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hugo was a Romantic yet he lived on until 1885, doing the art we see here into old age – and it is timeless, eternally contemporary. Uninterested in artistic fashion – his living came from writing – he followed his own fancy. Like Goya, whom he often resembles, this makes his art speak directly to us.Here is a portrait of an octopus, which he must have seen from the Guernsey rocks, its flailing tentacles making him, and you, wonder if it has a consciousness. Hugo feels the universal pulse of life. He can empathise with medieval outcasts, hanged men and cephalopods. What an artist. What a soul.Astonishing Things: The Drawings of Victor Hugo is atthe Royal Academy, London, 21 March to 29 JuneExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsRoyal Academy of ArtsVictor HugoDrawingreviewsShareReuse this content"

People have been building in the city for millennia and, in more recent times, bombing it. But if the building before went too deep, or there has been too much exposure to the air by bomb damage in the past, there won’t be much to find. Things were especially bad before 1991, when there was no planning protection for anything but scheduled ancient monuments. “We used to have to beg to get on site,” says Sophie Jackson, archaeologist at Museum of LondonArchaeology(Mola).It’s not that developers are insensitive, says Jackson: “When we did the excavation at Barts hospital, [it] was functioning above us – we were right under the MRI machines. Developers recognise the social value.” It’s just that the stars don’t often align.View image in fullscreenThe Bloomberg site in the City of London in 2016, during the excavation.Photograph: John Stillwell/PABut when Bloomberg, the financial media company, acquired the Bank junction site in 2010, the stars were aligned. Before thisexcavation, I’m afraid, Iconformed to the gender stereotypeand rarely thought aboutthe Roman empire. Since I saw London Museum’s new, unparalleled, internationally seismic collection, I have thought of little else. A total of 14,000 objects, 81,000 fragments of animal bones and 73,000 shards of pottery were recovered from this single site – the largest acquisition the museum has ever had from one place. Some items will be on displayfrom 2026 at what used to be the site of Smithfield meat market.Geography mattered on the Bloomberg site in the heart of the City, close to the Bank of England. TheWalbrook, a lost river of London, had carved a deep valley into the landscape and the Romans constantly tried to reclaim the banks as the city grew and prospered. They did this by packing the ground with rubbish, building on it, then packing it again, three more times, so there is a stratigraphical layer cake of Roman trash going almost all the way back to London’s creation, in AD47 or 48. The river also waterlogged the ground, protecting the material from oxygen: leather, brooches, shoes, writing tablets, wood, animal bones and ceramics were all phenomenally well preserved. There are sandals that look fresher than last year’s Birkenstocks.View image in fullscreenSophie Jackson, archaeologist and director of business development at Mola – the boxes behind contain excavation findings.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSite B2Y10 – to give it its academic name – was previously occupied by Legal and General, which dug deep in the 1950s, to create the biggest post-blitz rebuild in the City. Excavating archaeologists found the third-centuryTemple of Mithras, andoral historiesfrom Londoners who witnessed the find in 1954 recall a magical atmosphere, when the secrets of the ancient past met the regeneration of the postwar present to create a sense of enormous hope and renewal. People queued for hours to see the temple. One woman who was pregnant at the time called her baby Mithra. As significant as that archaeological yield was, it was pretty haphazard – workers on the site were just picking things up and handing them in.View image in fullscreenA magical atmosphere … an exhibition at the Temple of Mithras dig in 1954.Photograph: Robert Hitchman/© MolaThe Legal and General building had huge double basements, except on one side, where they had had to stay shallow for fear of jeopardising a Christopher Wren church on the opposite corner. “We were so excited by that single basement,” Jackson says. “We knew that in the layer underneath, that they hadn’t dug into, a lot of material would have survived.” Across 150 years of previous Roman recoveries inLondon, 19 writing tablets were found in total. In this one find, there were 400, of which 80 have already been deciphered. These are wooden frames, with an inset writing area about “the size of a Ryvita”, which would be filled with black wax, then written on.View image in fullscreenOne of the 400 writing tablets found in the dig.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThe wax has long degraded, but you might get lucky with a heavy-handed scribe and be able to read the indented text on the wood beneath. Or it might be a palimpsest, an original script overwritten at a later date, and you’ll see fragments of numerous messages, obscuring each other. The first tablet they read, dated 8 January AD57, was a financial document – an IOU. “They were amazing bureaucrats, the Romans,” Jackson says. “And it’s nice for Bloomberg, isn’t it?”The team managed to recover the names of 100 Roman Londoners we had never heard of. “One tablet says, ‘Take this to someone’s house, it’s by the house of Catalus.’ It really struck me. These people had their city, as much as we have it as our city,” Jackson says. “There’s a really gossipy one,” says curator Meriel Jeater, “a bloke who’s writing to someone called Titus: ‘Everybody’s talking about you in the market, saying you’ve lent them money. You’ve done a really bad deal; you shouldn’t appear shabby.’”View image in fullscreenRoman writing implements from the site.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianAlan Pipe, Mola’s animal bones specialist, shows me some skeletal remains on which “every tool mark, every nick made by a butcher’s knife” is visible. He could almost recreate a day in the life – or certainly the meals – of a Roman Londoner. Many of the bones are from cows, pigs and sheep; there are others from chickens but fewer. Chickens only appeared in the UK during the iron age, and were not regularly consumeduntil the third century. Hares and other game, as well as fish, give us an overall picture of the diet.You can gauge the skeletal age of the beasts from scores of amazingly preserved mandibles (lower jaws) and how worn the biting surfaces of the teeth are, Pipe explains. If a pig died at a year old, you can infer an amount of animal husbandry and agriculture. He shows me chunks of bone resultant from “splitting and smashing, way beyond what’s necessary for butchery”. This was probably for boiling and grease extraction.View image in fullscreenMola pottery specialist Charlotte Burn holds a small Roman vessel depicting foliage and a face.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianYou can also cross-reference these bones with other items found in the same layer, and archaeologically date the whole lot with associated finds – with ceramics in particular, as the techniques and ingredients evolved quite quickly and distinctively. You can pinpoint an era more precisely from a shard, sometimes, than from a coin, which may still have been in use 40 years after it was minted. Dendrochronology (dating by analysing tree trunk rings) is better still because trees would have been built into a building, so you can pinpoint it to the year. Sure, if some helpful Roman wrote the actual date on to a tablet, that works as well.Mola’s senior finds specialist, Michael Marshall, has 750 pairs of Roman shoes believed to date from the second half of the first century AD. The Claudian invasion (that is, the main Roman invasion in AD43, led by Claudius) brought new Mediterranean styles and materials, such as a dainty flip-flop – the adults’ hobnailed, the children’s not. You can see evidence of a big military presence – the paraphernalia of war, the ceramic leftovers of those catering to thirsty soldiers.View image in fullscreenMore than 700 Roman shoes were found, the leather well preserved in the waterlogged ground.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThere is plenty of evidence of people living very comfortable, good lives in the centre of London in AD50: the shoes are finely made, and there are gradations of material and craft in the pottery, which suggests some people were already considerably wealthier than others. There are a number of face pots (domestic pots with facial features carved into or applied on to them), for example, some of which are very crude, others exquisitely detailed. One depicts a woman with complicated hair and is thought to represent a maenad, a female follower of Bacchus, god of wine, who were associated with divine frenzy. There are a lot of snakes on the ceramics, representing agriculture, hope, rebirth and fertility, and also suggesting cultural cross-pollination with the European continent and people moving between one place and another – almost as if they had invented freedom of movement by the first century AD. There was also slavery – there are shackles in the find, too.View image in fullscreenFaience beads, pendants and copper embellishments for cavalry harnesses.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThen there are anomalies that tell us something about the limits of Roman understanding. Jackson shows me a black, pebble-like object with three indentations on it, in which someone has tried to make a hole, to turn it into a pendant. Finding the material unnaturally unyielding, the Romans decided these were “solidified thunderbolts”, she says. “It’s so interesting to think of Romans doing archaeology themselves.” Not very well, mind; it wasn’t a solidified thunderbolt, it was a neolithic hand-axe made of obsidian.View image in fullscreenAn obsidian axe head from the neolithic period – some Romans thought they were stone thunderbolts.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIt’s a reminder that we modern humans are also capable of misreading the signs. In the 1954 excavation, for example, they found beads that were assumed to have been worn by a woman, but here, those same beads and amulets were found still on their original strings, alongside other material that indicates they were worn by a horse. “It might have been a lady horse,” Marshall allows. Horses wore amulets covered in sexual imagery – such asfist-and-phallusamulets, with a clenched fist gesture at one end and an unmetaphorical phallus at the other, which was thought to ward off the evil eye. Children also wore amulets to ward off plague.As Jackson says, these people had their London as much as we have ours. A trove this size, when it goes on display next year, offers not so much a glimpse of the past as an immersion into it. It’s like falling head-first into the first century – in so much detail you can almost smell it.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsRoman BritainLondonArchaeologyHeritageHistoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On their own dime, Xhloe Rice and Natasha Roland rocked up at the festival in 2022 to try their luck. The US duo’s queer western clown show,And Then the Rodeo Burned Down, went from an audience of seven to winning aFringe First awardand selling out. They repeated both feats with another two-hander in 2023. And another in 2024. This summer, the best friends – who perform as Xhloe and Natasha – will stage all three prize winners in Edinburgh.That is, if they can afford to get there. “We haven’t bought our flight tickets yet,” says Rice, highlighting the grim economic truth behind fringe success. “We have to wait until we make abitmore money.”In the scouts, the boys did archery, knot-tying and camping. The girls? We sold cookies and made friendship braceletsWe meet at Soho theatre in London where the pair are performing their second hit,What If They Ate The Baby?, and their most recent one,A Letter to Lyndon B Johnson or God: Whoever Reads This First. Both shows playfully consider Americana and gender using absurd comedy, distilled dialogue and striking choreography. Each has a light touch yet ambushes your emotions. The former is a melodrama-cum-horror detonating 1950s domestic ideals, with the pair wearing pastel frocks and serving neon green spaghetti. In the latter they portray muddy scouts, in a Boys’ Own caper, venturing into tragedy.The scouts, Ace and Grasshopper, await a visit from the eponymous US president who served from 1963 to 1969. The Beatles’ Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da gives the show its jaunty rhythm but war looms on the horizon. “We don’t say ‘Vietnam’ ever in the show,” points out Roland. “We don’t say ‘1950s’ or ‘housewives’ in Baby … We don’t like to spoon-feed every detail. As writers we usually prefer giving the audience the responsibility to fill in the gaps.”View image in fullscreenMythical boyhood … A Letter to Lyndon B Johnson or God: Whoever Reads This First.Photograph: © JCB VISUALSTalking a mile a minute, Rice and Roland have developed a hive mind and frequently finish each other’s sentences. With A Letter to LBJ, they wanted to explore “mythical boyhood”, says Rice. “We felt like we missed out on something because we were raised girls.” To be a boy, they were taught, “was all about skinning your knees and jumping fences and playing baseball. And you had no troubles. It’s kind of insidious and speaks to the myth of a great former America that doesn’t exist any more and it’s weaponised.” Both were girl scouts. “The boys did archery, knot-tying, camping.” And the girls? “Sold cookies,” says Roland. “Made friendship bracelets,” adds Rice. “But I want to shoot an arrow!” protests Roland.The show was almost a letter to Richard Nixon “but he has a flatly negative connotation”. Johnson intrigued them as he had a more complex legacy. Defined by the conflict in Vietnam, he made considerable achievements in social welfare and civil rights. Ace and Grasshopper start out simply “playing good guys and bad guys” but the theatre-makers delve into grey areas. “America is the good guy – you’re told that as a kid,” says Roland. “Then you hit a certain point where you have your own thoughts and it’s maybe … ‘Oh, we’re not?’”As president, Johnson championed the Kennedy Center, breaking ground for it with a gold-plated spade in 1964 and heralding the government-funded, bipartisan venue as “a living force for the encouragement of art”. Last month, Donald Trump ousted its chair to preside over the board himself and ensure, he declared on social media, “no more drag shows, or other anti-American propaganda”.As fringe theatre-makers, the pair weren’t planning on playing the venerable venue any time soon, but the Kennedy Center is “representative of culture in America” says Rice. What happens at the top “trickles down”, adds Roland. “When you start to govern what artists are allowed to make, that’s dangerous territory.”View image in fullscreenPlaying with fire … And Then the Rodeo Burned Down.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianTo save money and create A Letter to LBJ, the pair moved back into their family homes. Both have fathers who were in the military. “Most of our childhoods were in post 9/11 America – one of the most nationalistic times in recent US history,” says Rice. The friends grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, and became inseparable at school, where Roland was Rice’s tour guide on orientation day. Studying acting at different universities inNew York, they collaborated on a “rogue” production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at Rice’s college. “We did it secretly,” grins Rice. “I was sneaking people in. We lit the whole thing with 100 desk lamps.” “Such a fire hazard,” tuts Roland.The Tank, a nonprofit theatre in Manhattan, became their artistic home. But “we were having a hard time making a name for ourselves in New York. Or just getting eyes on us,” says Roland. They crowdfunded for Edinburgh, saving what they could from daytime teaching jobs (maths for Rice, biking and skateboarding for Roland) and rehearsing Rodeo from 10pm until 2am. The show – a tricksy comedy about a clown, his shadow and a cowboy – had a meta subplot about their fight to get it finished. This was born from bleary rehearsals, where Roland felt: “I want the energy to give to the art I want to make.”As a duo, they’re a “cheap date” for theatres, says Rice. With minimal set and props, “most of our shows fit in a duffel bag”. They thought the majority of artists at the fringe would be in a similar position to them but were surprised by how “a lot of the shows getting recognition or reviews had funding from an arts council or huge companies”.The pair create their own costumes, sound design and choreography. The long-term plan is “to do this, but bigger” says Rice. “And maybe not have to share a room?” Until then, they’re juggling two shows in London and taking all three back to Edinburgh. “We’re going to drink alotof vitamin C,” laughs Roland. After all, it’s not their first rodeo.Xhloe and Natasha are atSoho theatre, London, until 29 March.

While I often wear my curls with pride, it’s nice to switch things up now and again.How I testedView image in fullscreenFringe benefits … hair straighteners at the ready.Photograph: Lise SmithI tested 13 straighteners on clean, dry hair that started off in its usual curly pattern. In its natural state, my shoulder-length hair has a fairly tightType-3 curl(meaning you definitely wouldn’t mistake it for merely wavy). Before testing, I made sure my hair was clean and detangled, and I used the same heat-protection spray with each straightener to help reduce damage and hold the finished style. As my fine hair doesn’t get on well with higher temperatures, I used a medium heat setting where there was a choice.For each straightener, I noted the time taken from a curly standing start to a fully straightened head of hair, the overall ease of use, and how comfortable each tool felt in my hand in terms of weight and grip. After straightening I checked how my hair looked and felt, and then wore the style for a typical working day to test how well the styles lasted with each tool.Final ratings take into account the speed and ease of straightening, how my hair looked and felt afterwards and overall value for money considering the finished result – and how well this lasts through the day. Here are the eight best performers from my tests.If not returned to the manufacturer, the hair straighteners sourced for this article are being donated to the homelessness charityCrisisfor resale.The best hair straighteners in 2025View image in fullscreenThe GHD Platinum Plus halfway through the job.Photograph: Lise SmithBest overall hair straighteners:GHD Platinum PlusView image in fullscreen£199 at GHD£200.76 at John LewisThere’s a reason why GHD’s Platinum Plus straighteners are in their seventh year of supremacy in houses up and down the UK – provided straight hair is what you want, they’re unsurpassed as a styling tool.Why we love itWhen you take the Platinum Plus out of the box, the first thing you’ll notice is the sleek good looks: the floating ceramic plates are a stylish matt black, and the flowing curves of the design ooze sophistication. The Platinum Plus is not just a pretty tool, however – it heats up in seconds and styles hair from curly to straight in minutes.Beneath the shapely casing is GHD’s predictive heat technology, which measures and adjusts the temperature of the tool hundreds of times a second. This is so the plates won’t either overheat or cool down as you style and you won’t have to run them over the hair more than once. Straightening with the Platinum Plus was effortless, and the result was shiny, healthy-looking hair (with no toasted ends).It’s a shame that …the Platinum Plus comes in only two colours, matt black and matt white, although special editions pop up from time to time. It’s also rarely priced below £200, even in sales. Fine or damaged hair may prefer the cooler settings some straighteners offer.Heat settings:one (185C)Cord length: 2.7m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:302gBest budget hair straighteners:Remington Shine Therapy S8500View image in fullscreen£25.99 at Currys£29.99 at BootsIf you’re not in the market for a premium pair of straighteners, there are good options for significantly less than £100 that won’t break the bank or ruin your hair.Why we love itRemington’s slimline straighteners have ceramic-coated floating plates infused with natural oils for added shine; the ones I tested were infused with Moroccan argan oil, but there’s also acoconut version. The design is simple and sleek if a little unglamorous: two plates, two buttons and a gently glowing LCD screen that lets you know the temperature you’ve selected. There are nine temperature settings, from 150C to 230C. I found 180-190C worked perfectly on my fine-ish curly hair.The floating plates moved nicely over my hair without catching, and my hair looked shiny and healthy after straightening. The RRP is a quite reasonable £79.99 but you’ll often find these straighteners reduced to half that price, making Shine Therapy a bargain.It’s a shame that …Remington’s straighteners take a little longer to heat up than others we’ve tested – not a dealbreaker, but the wait was about twice as long as other straighteners in our test.Heat settings:nine (150 to 230C)Cord length: 2.5m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:one hourWeight:368gBest cordless hair straighteners:Dyson CorraleView image in fullscreen£399 at John Lewis£399.99 at BootsIt was initially a shock when Dyson – the company best known for vacuum cleaners and hand dryers – moved into the beauty market more than eight years ago, but its hair drying and styling tools have been runaway successes. The Corrale – Dyson’s cordless straightener – is no exception.Why we love itIt just works so well. The Corrale is named after the flexible manganese copper alloy plates that corral the hair through the tool smoothly and evenly for one-stroke straightening. The adjustable heat control lets you select from three temperatures, 165C, 185C and 210C, and an intelligent heat-control system keeps the temperature even throughout styling, so there’s little risk of scorching damage.A rechargeable lithium-ion battery makes the Corrale fully portable – the tool was originally designed with fashion shoots in mind, and it’s genuinely easy to use anywhere around the house or on the go. The size of the battery means the Corrale feels heavier and chunkier in the hand than some other straighteners, but not unpleasantly so; and the thicker plates grip the hair well for efficient styling without snagging. One battery charge lasted for 30 minutes, which was more than enough to fully straighten my medium-length hair.It’s a shame that …the Corrale charges only from its dock or proprietary cable, so unlike other cordless chargers you can’t charge it with whichever cable you have to hand.Heat settings:three (165C, 185C and 210C)Cord length: cordless, but charging cable is 3.8mAutomatic shut-off time:10 minutesWeight:561gBest hair straighteners for long or thick hair:GHD MaxView image in fullscreen£174 at GHD£174 at John LewisIf you have very long or thick hair you’ll find that standard-width straighteners take a long time to style your hair. With wide-plate straighteners, you can reduce that time and effort.Why we love itGHD’s Max are the best wider straighteners I tested. With its 1.65in styling plates, there’s almost twice the width of standard plates, meaning you can style much larger sections of hair – a godsend if your hair is long, thick or curly. The Max smoothed down my Type-3 curls in minutes.Wider plates mean faster styling, which not only helps you get on with your life but also means less time spent in contact with hair-damaging heat. Like all GHDs, the Max has the one 185C heat setting, which was enough to straighten my hair to a soft and shiny finish with just one pass.It’s a shame that …as it’s designed for long and thick hair, the GHD Max is a bit fiddly to use on shorter sections, such as a fringe or shorter layers. As with the other GHDs here, some hair types may prefer lower temperature settings.Heat settings:one (185C)Cord length: 2.7m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:830gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

First launched in 2009, the Original straightener was relaunched last year with an updated model.Why we love itCloud Nine straighteners have two main differences from their GHD counterparts: the mineral sericite added to the heating plates, sealing moisture into the hair to leave it extra-soft and hydrated; and 11 heat settings, allowing you to select a suitable heat for your hair type and texture. It’s easy to choose a heat with the flat buttons on the handle, and there’s a handy quiz on the website to help you find the right temperature for your hair. The chic matt-black tool feels light in the hand with a nice balance.The Original also has a vibrating Revive mode unique to Cloud Nine, which reduces friction and drag on the hair to minimise damage as you style. The slight buzzing sensation was a little odd at first, but the vibrations seemed to help the straighteners glide over my hair to leave it soft and glossy.It’s a shame that …for an entry-level model (to a premium brand), the price tag is undeniably high – not much lower than GHD’s top-of-the-line Platinum Plus model. If you have very fine or thick hair, the multiple heat settings make the Original worth shelling out for.Heat settings:11 (100-200C)Cord length: 3mAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:440gThe best of the restRevamp Liberate CompactView image in fullscreen£59.99 at Boots£59.99 at AmazonBest for:travelSmall but mighty, this compact straightener has three heat settings, keratin-infused plates for extra conditioning and ionic technology for a glossy finish – that’s a lot of features to pack into a dinky package. It’s hard to say how much difference they make, but I can say from extensive testing that the results feel good, leaving my hair feeling soft and hydrated. The battery takes three hours to charge and lasts for about 30 minutes, enough to fully straighten my hair in one go.The Liberate Compact also comes with a carry bag, a travel adaptor plug and a flight-safe lock, making it an excellent choice for travel. It’s also great to keep handy in a desk drawer for quick hair fixes between work and evenings out.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s ideal for travel and suitable for infrequent home use, but not beefy enough to replace my favourite straighteners day to day.Heat settings:three (160C, 180C and 210C);cord length: cordless;automatic shut-off time:30 minutes;weight:243gNicky Clarke Frizz ControlView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Tesco£39.99 at AmazonBest for:taming frizzy hairIf you don’t mind your hair tool being associated with a daytime TV celebrity, then these ionic straighteners from hairdresser (and This Morning fixture) Nicky Clarke are lovely to use and come at a very good price. The plates are coated with ceramicandtourmaline and glided smoothly over my hair, leaving it soft and shiny. There are five heat settings, from 150C to 230C, so the straighteners are good for various hair textures, including thicker hair.It didn’t make the final cut because…I slightly preferred the way my hair felt after using the Remington Shine Therapy, but there’s very little to choose between the two and these would be a great alternative.Heat settings:five (150-230C);cord length: 2m;automatic shut-off time:60 minutes;weight:360gGHD MiniView image in fullscreen£124 at GHD£124.02 at John LewisBest for:precision styling and quick fixesRocking a pixie cut or French bob? The GHD Mini’s half-inch plates are just the thing for styling shorter hair, easily reaching the roots without the kinking or crimping that can be more noticeable on shorter hair with standard plates. The Mini has the same floating ceramic plates and heat-sensing technology as its bigger brethren, in a slimline package that’s perfect for keeping a textured crop or face-framing fringe sleek and straight. The rounded barrel means you can also create waves and curls if you want to change up your look.It didn’t make the final cut because …the GHD Mini is a good thing in a small package, as long as you have shorter hair. For anything longer than shoulder length you’ll want a full-size tool.Heat settings:one (185C);cord length: 2.7m swivel cord;automatic shut-off time:30 minutes;weight:320gWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Investing in a premium model with smart technology can save you time and reduce the risk of heat damage.’Photograph: Lise SmithHow do hair straighteners work?Whatever the price, brand or extra features, all hair straighteners work in the same way: by using heat to temporarily break the hydrogen bonds in the hair. With these bonds momentarily broken, the hair can be set into a new style that stays in place once the hair cools and the hydrogen bonds reform.Most modern straighteners have heating plates coated in a non-metallic material, such as ceramic and tourmaline, to distribute the heat more gently and evenly than a metal plate and reduce the risk of scorching the hair. A ceramic coating also helps the straighteners glide smoothly over the hair, reducing snagging and giving straightened hair a glossy, healthy-looking finish.How much should you spend?If you heat-style only occasionally, a basic straightener will do the job. If you style more frequently, investing in a premium model with smart technology can save you time and reduce the risk of heat damage. A premium tool is likely to include features such as “floating” plates on tiny springs that keep an even grip on the hair; and heat sensors that adjust the temperature of the straighteners as you style. Premium straighteners may also include ionic technology, using a material that when heated releases negative ions, reducing frizz and adding shine to the hair.How to stop your hair getting damagedMake sure your hair is completely dry before straightening (unless your straightener is a wet-to-dry straightener). Brush your hair and divide it into even sections, then spray with a heat-protection product to keep heat damage to a minimum and help your finished style last longer. Any of these products is better than nothing, but my favourite isGHD’s Bodyguard spray(andRevlon’s Uniq Oneis a good alternative). It’s best to start around the bottom of your head and work your way up to the top, using as few strokes as possible – the best straighteners work in one or two passes over each tress. Finish with a spritz of your favourite hairspray to hold the style in place.If your straightener has adjustable temperature settings, use a lower temperature for fine or damaged hair, 170-190C for most hair types, and up to 200-210C for thick or curly hair. With the right heat settings for your hair type and a protective spray, there’s no reason straightening your hair should be bad for it.Lise Smith is a freelance writer withmore than 15 years of experience covering beauty, lifestyle, parentingand the performing arts.

And don’t say meringues!Billowy meringues may be the most high-profile pal of surplus egg whites, but their circle is far wider and more encompassing than those delicate shells. “My immediate thought is chocolate mousse,” says Oliver Costello, co-owner ofToad Bakeryin south London. “White chocolate is quite good here, because the egg whites take its richness down. If you’ve ever had a pot of Milkybar yoghurt dessert, it’s a bit like that.” It couldn’t be simpler to make, either: “Melt white chocolate in a bain-marie or in bursts in the microwave, and whip some cream to stiff peaks in a separate bowl. Fold the melted chocolate into the cream, then whisk egg whites to stiff peaks and fold those in, too.” Chill for three hours, then grab a spoon and dig in, perhaps accompanied by a little poached or baked rhubarb.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Rosie Healey, ofGloriosain Glasgow, meanwhile, would put her excess egg whites to work in some coconut macarons. “They’re so delicious and easy,” she says, plus they’ll also account for a decent number of whites in one fell swoop. “Whip them up, stir in a load of desiccated coconut, then bake.” Dip the cooked macarons in melted chocolate, put them in the fridge to set and the job’s a good’un.Of course, there are many other sweet solutions – use egg whites to make nougat or Swiss meringue buttercream, or to achieve extra-crunchy granola clusters, say – but let’s not forget the savoury side of things. Fritters, for example, have saved many a weeknight dinner, and can also save surplus egg whites from the trash. “Make a batter, add sweetcorn kernels, then fold in whisked egg whites, lots of coriander and some chopped green chilli,” Healey says. Deep-fry in batches until golden and crisp.Then there’s velveting – a Chinese technique for marinating fish or meat in egg whites, then cooking it in water or oil and adding to the likes of stir-fries and soups. AsYotam Ottolenghiexplains: “The egg white creates a protective barrier that seals in moisture and helps keep the flesh tender, which makes the protein smoother and silkier.” He often adopts the approach with hake (although any meaty fish will do): whisk egg whites, cornflour and rice wine, then toss in the chunks of fish and marinate for half an hour. Drop the fish in boiling water for 20 seconds, then lift out, drain and stir into a pan of caramelised onions, masala paste, chicken stock and coconut milk, along with a big handful of Thai basil. Ken Hom inClassic Chinese Recipes, meanwhile, tosses cubes of chicken breast with egg whites, salt and cornflour. After covering and chilling the meat for 20 minutes, he fries the chicken in oil and serves with a stir-fry of walnuts, garlic, ginger and spring onions.Of course, egg whites hit the happy hour spot, too, because they’re brilliant at adding creaminess to cocktails. “My favourite is an amaretto sour, but a gin sour is always going to be welcome,” Healey says. Take 200ml gin, the juice of two or three limes, some sugar syrup (50:50 sugar to water), and an egg white. “Use two egg whites if you want things super-creamy,” she adds. Give it all a good shake and it’s good to go: “It’s easy-peasy and, if you put some mint in there as well,reallydelicious.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Because our savings had dropped below the ­government threshold for self-funded care, the local authority had agreed to pay the £5,000-a-month cost. However, by the time it ­completed its assessment last May, I’d had to pay a further five months of fees myself.The council sent a backdated payment for those qualifying months to Leicestershire County Care, which was supposed to refund me the £23,000 that I’d paid. It eventually paid me £13,000 but I’ve received nothing more since October. Whenever I contact the company, they always claim the next payment is “imminent” or has been paid when it hasn’t.JH, LeicestershireThis is financial and emotional stress that you could have done without while grieving for your husband. In the latest letter assuring you that the balance would be paid by Christmas Eve (it wasn’t), Leicestershire County Care, which is part of Johnson Care Group, blamed a “significant backlog” for the delay. A further £5,000 was sent to you just after you contacted me in January, but there was no word of the outstanding £5,000. The company operates 12 care homes in Leicestershire, so how many other families were affected, I asked. No answer was forthcoming.Johnson Care’s attitude is startlingly cavalier. It refused to comment other than to say it reviews cases internally and would “communicate the outcome” to you. I tried the council, whose money is being withheld by the firm. It said it would work with Johnson to ensure the funds were transferred. Four weeks passed. Nothing happened. I rattled the cages of council and provider and finally, at the end of February and eight months late, the last instalment arrived.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

In many ways, we have a wonderful marriage: she is my best friend as well as my wife. The issue is our sex life. She has a very low sex drive, whereas mine is high. She won’t ever instigate sex, due to past trauma, and I can no longer toleratealways being the one doing the chasing. As a result,our sex life is pretty dead in the water. I do not want to end our marriage, but I want to be desired.We have tried to talk about this,but nothingever really changes and I am now at the point where I have become less and less attracted to her sexually and we’ve both stopped trying.Last year, I developed an infatuation with someone at work. It lasted fora year and Ispent a lot of time imagining what it would be like to be with her. It has died down only because I have distanced myself from her. But itmade me realise how much I want to have sexwith someone else.I have no ideahow togo about telling my wife that I want to stay married,but sleep with other people– yet I don’t think I could live with the guilt if I had a secret affair.You have reached a point where you need to act. Mismatched levels of desire commonly occur in relationships, but when only one partner is willing to take steps to create more sexual parity, nothing is likely to change short of an ultimatum. You will have to talk seriously to her in a non-blaming, non-confrontational manner and be frank about your feelings. Ask her to seek some help and let her know you are willing to support her journey, whether it is an individual struggle (therapy for her past trauma would probably be very helpful), or a couples issue that needs to be addressed. Start off by doing your best to reassure her about your love for her and your desire to stay married.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

They were originally made to use up old bread, turning simple leftovers into something truly delicious. Here, I’m giving them a very early Easter twist with hot cross buns, which add their own special flavour and soft texture. The saffron syrup brings a lovely warmth and a little touch of something special, making thesetorrijasfeel just right for the season while still keeping that familiar, comforting charm we all love.Hot cross torrijas with saffron syrupFor extra indulgence, mix finely grated orange zest into some mascarpone or similar creamy cheese to serve alongside.Prep15 minSoak 10-15 minCook25 minServes4500ml whole milk50ml double cream100g caster sugar1 cinnamon stick6 hot cross buns, cut in half horizontally50g unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil4 large eggs, beatenFor the syrup150g caster sugar1 pinchsaffron threadsPared zest of½ orangeWarm the milk, cream, sugar and cinnamon in a medium-sized saucepan, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

That limit does not include any interest or other returns earned on your money. It covers all types of Isa you may hold: any cash, stocks and shares, innovative (containing peer-to-peer investments), lifetime or help-to-buyIsas.Lifetime Isas have their own £4,000 annual cap within the £20,000 – if you have used it all, you will have £16,000 left. Help-to-buy Isas are no longer open to new applicants, but you can pay into an existing one until November 2029, and can put in up to £200 a month (£2,400 a year).Junior Isas are available to under-18s and have an annual limit of £9,000.No cash Isa shake-up in spring statement, but Reeves still considering cutsRead moreLook at what you have put in since 6 April 2024. The difference between that and £20,000 is how much you have left to use before the end of 5 April 2025.This will be easy if you have kept a record of your savings and investments – otherwise you will need to track down the information. Remember, you may not have paperwork for everything as so many providers now promote going paperless, so search your email inbox as well as your filing cabinet.Fill up an existing Isa…The quickest and easiest way to use more of your allowance is to put money into an existing account – you will not need to provide any ID to the provider. If it is an account you set up in the current tax year, it should be straightforward – unless it is a fixed-rate cash Isa, which does not allow extra payments.If it is an Isa from a previous tax year and you have not paid into it during this one, you may need to contact your provider before you can put in new money. Although the rules have changed so that banks and building societies no longer have to insist on this, many still do. Nationwide building society, for example, asks savers to complete a renewal form before allowing new payments – this can be done in a branch, on the phone or online, and takes just a couple of minutes. You can start using the Isa again straight away.View image in fullscreenThe £20,000 Isa limit includes the maximum £4,000 you can squirrel away inside a lifetime Isa.Photograph: Louisa Svensson/AlamyOr shop aroundThis tax year, for the first time, you can have more than one of the same type of Isa, so even if you have paid into an account this tax year, it is still worth checking whether it is a good deal.For cash Isas, the best-buy tables change constantly, with the top offers being determined by which providers are after your business at any particular time. Check websites such asThe Private OfficeandMoneyfactsfor up-to-date lists of the best deals.Investment Isas offer returns based on the performance of the funds they contain, but the provider’s charges will have an impact, too. Look for providers that offer access to the funds you want to put your money into, or a set portfolio of funds that appeals to you, and then compare their costs.If you have already opened an investment Isa this year, Sarah Coles, a personal finance expert at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says there are a limited number of reasons to open a second.Some people may have money in a stocks and shares Isa, with high exit fees that they cannot move, but want to open a second account for future investments, she says. “Alternatively, they may want an investment option that’s only available from one provider, and another that’s exclusive to a different provider. Meanwhile, some will want to test a new provider and its administration before moving the rest of their portfolio over.”Use an existingbankFor very last-minute applications, it is worth seeing whether your current account provider – or any other financial company you have a relationship with – is offering a good deal as, again, this could be more straightforward than starting from scratch.You may be able to set it up with just a couple of mouse clicks or a phone call.The main high-street banks do not typically offer the most generous interest rates on cash Isas, but you could open an account with one and then transfer to a better-paying account when you have had time to shop around.If you already have a cash Isa, not all providers will let you open a second Isa with them during the same tax year, even though the rules on this have changed.View image in fullscreenFor very last-minute applications just before the deadline, look at what your bank offers. It might take just a couple of clicks to set an Isa up.Photograph: Network Photographers/AlamyHave a holding positionYou can protect your money from future tax bills, and give yourself time to think about where to invest it, by moving it into the “holding account” or “cash account” of a stocks and shares Isa provider.“If you’re rushing to open an Isa ahead of the end of the tax year, it’s not necessarily the ideal time to be thinking carefully about your investment strategy,” says Coles.“If you already know where you want to invest, or you have decided to opt for a ready-made investment, you can snap it up straight away. However, if you have yet to go through this process, it’s a great idea to divide the decision to open an Isa to protect your allowance, and the choice of where to invest.”Many stocks and shares Isa providers offer a holding account or cash account for money that you plan to use to make new investments. Once your money is in there, you can choose to drip-feed it into investments over a period of time.“This has the added benefit of ensuring you won’t invest your annual allowance at what turns out to be a less-than-ideal moment, and are spreading the timing risk,” says Coles.This may not be the thing to do if you think it will take you a while to get round to investing, though, as you could face a charge from the Isa provider.Aviva, for instance, will charge you on your investments,with a fee of up to 0.4%applied to any cash you are holding ready to put into stocks and shares. Some other providers, including Barclays, will not.Coles says: “If you want to hold cash for a longer period, there’s nothing stopping you getting a cash Isa … and switching into stocks and shares when you’re ready.”Check old IsasWhile you are in the process of checking on your investments, take a look at what is happening to Isas you set up in previous tax years.If they are cash Isas, they may no longer be earning a market-leading rate, or, if you often pay in at this stage during the tax year, you may be about to come off a good fixed-rate.Not all of the best Isa deals accept transfers in, but there are some reasonable interest rates on offer. According to Moneyfacts, at the time of writing, one of the best one-year fixed-rate cash Isa deals was offered by OakNorth Bank, paying 4.45% and allowing transfers in from existing cash Isas, but not any other type. Some Isa providers will allow you to transfer from a stocks and shares Isa to a cash Isa.You can now, in theory, transfer part of your Isa, rather than having to move all of the money at the same time. Lots of providers will let you move part of an Isa from a previous tax year but will insist you move the whole thing if it was opened in the current one.Explore more on these topicsIsasMoney hacksSavingsInvestmentsBanks and building societiesConsumer affairsInvestingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are remains of both humans and animals but also stalactites and stalagmites. These cannot form when the cave is flooded, so you can see when parts of it were submerged and when it was dry.Yet when I’m in a cave, time does not tick. There is no natural light, so the cave looks the same, whether it’s midday or midnight. If you cave dive without the right training, equipment and mindset, it can be a very dangerous place. I have a very meditative focus when I’m down there. I live in the now. I cannot think about anything else but what is happening in the cave. I find that very soothing and relaxing.View image in fullscreen‘When I’m in a cave, time does not tick,’ says Zenato.Photograph: Kewin LorenzenCaves are intrinsically connected with ecosystems and the lives of the people that live around them. They are among the places that suffer the most – out of sight and out of mind. In theBahamas, water flows to the cave from the land above, transferring nutrients but also pollution. In this way, discharges from, say, a factory on the surface can move through limestone to the cave and affect entire seabeds, mangroves and rivers.The closest environment we have to space is in caves. Some of the caves I dive in are hundreds of thousands of years old and the marine life there is unique: animals such as blind crustaceans and fish, which have adapted to live in eternal darkness and very low oxygen environments. These are animals that, to me, seem as alien as can be – yet we spend trillions of dollars exploring space. Why are we going to Mars when these animals are right below our feet?A lot of the work I do involves collecting data for conservation and scientific purposes, and digitally mapping the caves so that people can see where a cave is, relative to the land above. This is very important as part of conservation efforts to limit land development.You need to be an experienced diver to become a cave diver. I have done more than 5,000 cave dives in 80 or 90 different cave systems, and am now a cave explorer, which means I have found virgin caves. I also teach cave diving at the most advanced levels. If I don’t dive in a cave for two or three days, I miss it so much that my husband can tell. He looks at me and says: “you need to go diving”.View image in fullscreenA Caribbean reef shark. ‘Sometimes, sharks hang around because there are lots of nutrients and fish,’ says Zenato.Photograph: Mark Chivers/Getty ImagesSometimes, sharks hang around: you’ll see silkies, lemon or Caribbean reef sharks because there are a lot of nutrients and fish. Nurse sharks also sometimes sleep right at the entrance of the ocean blue holes.I’m obsessed with fish that clean other fish: they remember their clients, much like a hairdresserRead moreI swim right past them – I’m as comfortable with sharks as I am with caves. They live in the ocean, this is their environment and I am just a visitor.I often feel immensely privileged to be able to do what I do, although sometimes, I must admit, I forget how unique the world of the cave is, because it’s so much a part of my daily routine. But then I’ll look at a column of a stalagmite that’s 50ft high and wide enough to park a car on, knowing that it was constructed drip by drip, by an inch-and-a-half a year, and it will blow my mind.Cristina Zenato is a Padi course director and advanced cave diving instructor.

Cultural differences yawn as wide as the Pacific between us. We were not sad to see “thebaby wombat grabber” go.The first mistake made by Montana-based tourist Sam Jones, Online Influencer, was to snatch a joey from its mother at night. Her second mistake was to sway the frightened creature in front of some gormless chucklehead who filmed her – giggling – and to upload the footage to the internet.Her video roared across local social media like measles after an RFK Jr confirmation. Australians united in vim; there were headlines, mass petitions and demands for her deportation.Attacking a young tourist over her treatment of a wombat is hypocritical – and misses the point | Georgie PurcellRead moreLast month, thekilling of up to 10 wombatsin the Victorian town of Venus Bay was crueller and more disgusting but did not obsess the discourse. Was it because Jones created a handy audio-visual to publicise her marsupial-monstering nitwittery that she faced such clamouring scorn?Or did Sam Jones’ most relevant mistake to Australians lie in being a chaotic dickhead … while American?The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, finds himself weeks out from an election navigating – as the modern leader must – the capricious behaviour of the nuclear-armed chaotic dickhead Americans re-elected as their president. Australians may have hoped our image as a floating zoo at the end of the world withcube-shitting mammalsmay have spared us Trump’sMake America Like the Start of the Great Depression Againtariffs policy but, unusually, luck has failed us. Steel and aluminium exports will be hitwith a 25% tariff, beef may be next – while our largest export to the United States turns out to bevaccines and related productsand hahahahaha, dear Christ but doom is certain.Given Annexing Canada is both an active Trump policy and so insane it wasn’t even suggested inProject 2025, Australian leadership must deftly manage an evolving geopolitical economic reality that most closely resembles a bus driver on an eight-day coke bender who has just locked his passengers in the vehicle to joyride through a minefield with a rabbit in his pants. Albanese’s colleague Ed Husiccalled Trump’s tariffs against Australia “a dog act”– he was deployed, one surmises, because he’s minister for science, so Trump’s GOP can’t acknowledge he exists. Resisting temptation to retaliate (with a tariff on “your stupid face”, perhaps?), Albanesedescribed Trump’s move as “unfriendly”. Within 24 hours,he suggestedwombat-botherer Sam Jones go Fafo with some crocodiles. Maybe there was something on his mind.Still, you’d rather be him than Peter Dutton, whose notoriously underdeveloped judgment muscle wasexerted in praisefor Trump as a “big thinker” barely a month and US$4tn-since-wiped-from-US-stock-valuations ago. Beyond Trump’s splatterfest of the world economy andtherefore your super balance(medicate before you look), the overwhelming impact of Trump 2.0 on Australians is evidence of how American we suddenly aren’t.Our two countries share a history as outposts of brutal British imperialism and the legacy of the coloniser’s language, yet at key points in our twinned story, our decisions have diverged.America received entrepreneurial puritans while Australia’s criminal class settler-colonistsbangedby the beach. America chose revolution from Britain, Australiathe slow path of reform. America’s structuralised slavery ended only after violent civil war. Australia’shistorical exploitation of enslaved peoplewas limited and ended through the efforts of a nascent labour movement, if one motivated by racist “they take our jobs” attitudes of the time.The differences weren’t overwhelming when we were both liberal democratic states,fighting togetherfor freedom in the first and second world wars … but does America, like, even do that any more?The new reality dawning in Australia: it can no longer rely on the USRead moreGenerations of migration and cultural reckoning (or non-reckoning) with local Indigenous cultures have since mobilised our societies towards different values that Trump’s extremity underlines. The deep polarisation he cheerleads confronts Australia’s “go along to get along” culture of compromise; his conservative policing of other people’s behaviour meets our “each to their own” tolerant shrug. Rather than the competitive individualism Trump personifies, Australian “mateship” persists as a virtue rooted in deep camaraderie, mutual support and egalitarian friendship, forged in the recognition on this burning, flooding, even-the-baby-wombats-hate-you land; you depend on each other, or you die.So while citizens of this sparser, less-dramatic country stay enthralled by the many US entertainment products we consume, it’s the very visibility of American culture to us that affirms our alienation from it. The internet may “speak American” but in the wake of Americans complaining online about healthcare, struggling through a mismanaged disaster or mourning another mass shooting, Australian pity speaks back in a register between “how can you let this happen?!” and self-satisfied relief.Cultural relationships are timely for Australia to consider. As Trump forsakes old alliances, the world realigns. The EUtightens its bonds, Canadagrows closerto Europe; could we? China seeks outnew spheres of influence. Outer rim figures from the Australian Labor party are suggesting the old Commonwealth relationships are worth re-formalising. In the scenario of nations obliged to choose between authoritarian allies, do we feel more secure with a peace-through-trade partner or a peace-through-rage-tweeting-and-Diet-Coke one?At least you know what you don’t want, baby wombat.It’s narcissistic and reckless, and it’s causing us distress. And everyone wants it gone, before the damage gets worse.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsPeter DuttonUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

At 87 years old, the Canadian-born veteran of salt lake racing this month returned to Lake Gairdner to once again test his mettle against some of the fastest vehicles on dry land in the world.Lake Gairdner is Australia’s home of salt lake racing. Each year the Dry Lakes Racers Australia Speed Week attracts about 230 racers from across Australia and as far afield as the US and UK. To the untrained observer, the range and diversity of vehicles might better resemble a gathering in Wacky Racers: from the high-expense, high-octane “streamline” and “Belly tank” (former B-52 fuel tanks) classes to the more fashionable, vintage hot rods and low-expense, back yard bashed-up postie bikes. There are hundreds of classes of vehicles.View image in fullscreenCompetitors and support crews enter Lake Gairdner in the early morning for the day’s racingThis motley assembly is not in pursuit of monetary gain; the fastest on the salt wins neither cheque nor trophy, only bragging rights in their quest for speed.Once I rolled my car at 250mph and the whole damn thing came apartMarlo TreitTreit and his 20-strong support team are racing the Target 550 – a monstrous 13-metre-long, 4-tonne land speed car with twin supercharged engines. The streamliner is nearly four decades in the making. Sitting in the team’s trackside tent, the sturdy 162cm-tall silver fox of the salt recalls, with astounding clarity, a race in 1959 when, aged 21, he won his first land speed record in a motorcycle he built in his parents’ garage.“I have had over 200 races on salt flats and in that time, I’ve had 20 serious accidents, but luckily walked away with superficial wounds – you know, cuts and bruises.”View image in fullscreenTarget 550 owner and financier Marlo TreitView image in fullscreenModified Commodore Bronze Aussie at the end of a day of racingAs Treit’s racing life evolved, he moved from motorcycles to cars, then on to streamliners.“Once I rolled my car at 250mph [400km/h] and the whole damn thing came apart,” he says. His eyes dart trackside following a streamliner as it hurtles down the 14.5km course. His gaze comes back to me in earnest. “I shouldn’t be alive.”Lake Gairdner is an endorheic salt lake 160km long and 48km wide north-west of Adelaide. When it is full, it is considered the third-largest lake in Australia. But today it is a dry white expanse of salt. In the late 1980s, hot rodders Andy Jenkins and Mike Davidson, inspired by the dry racing events in Utah, went on an exploratory mission to find somewhere to run high-speed races in Australia. Eventually they came across Lake Gairdner – now one of only three dry lake race tracks of its type in the world (the others are in Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, and Bonneville, Utah). Dry Lakes Racers Australia held their first land speed trials in March 1990 and have continued, weather permitting, for the last 34 years.View image in fullscreenMatt ‘the Postie’ Sheppard and fiancee, Laura Hodgson, with his 1974 CT 90 postal bikeI love making things, thinking up silly ideas and making them workMatt SheppardStanding trackside by the racing pits awaiting sequestration to the start line is Matt “the Postie” Sheppard. He is accompanied by his support and fiancee, Laura Hodgson. She holds a broad golfing umbrella aloft to keep him cool in the rising temperatures as he prepares for a record run on his 1974 CT 90 series postal bike.“I love making things, thinking up silly ideas and making them work,” he says.He began racing on Lake Gairdner in 2021 and, like many others in the salt racing community, kept coming back. “The majority of people here are dreamers and tinkerers,” he says.View image in fullscreenA motorcycle rider heads to the start lineSheppard and Hodgson collapse in the shade of their tent, exhausted from the blistering summer sun. But they are both ecstatic. Sheppard achieved a personal best of 127.2km/h and the official speed record for a postal bike of 124.9km/h. (Official records are made by averaging the speed of two runs.)“That’s 44.5% faster than they were claimed to go, coming off the factory floor!”Asked what the future holds for his CT 90 postal bike, Sheppard sits upright. “I’ve been talking with some drag guys about some modifications to increase its RPMs and I reckon that I can get it up to 85mph [137km/h]. If I can manage that, then that would surely be pushing its threshold.”Climbing into the cabin of his Nascar, an American stock racing vehicle, on the final day of racing is Mooroopna man Leo Darveniza. He is accompanied by fellow Wombat team driver and elder Noel Heenan. Darveniza is after a personal best that will deliver him his 175mph [280km/h] licence.View image in fullscreenWombat Nascar team driver Leo Darveniza (right) with fellow driver and support Noel HeenanView image in fullscreenDarveniza pulling away to make his 280km/h licenceDue to the dangers of high-speed salt lake racing, competitors must earn incremental speed licences, proving that they are capable of one level before advancing to the next. For instance, they must demonstrate they can safely and successfully drive at 240km/h before being permitted to drive at 280km/h and so on.Darveniza awaits the go-ahead by race starter Harry De Ree. As the driver sits at the wheel, Heenan leans into the window to give some last-minute advice.Soon though, Dee Ree gives the thumbs up and Darveniza starts to pull away. Heenan, in a support vehicle, races down a parallel track. Before he reaches anywhere near the collection point, at the 4.5km mark, Heenan’s thumb goes into the air as the race caller announces on UHF radio: Darveniza reached a maximum speed of 280km/h.View image in fullscreenRace starter Harry De ReeDarveniza’s run ended in just over a minute. Through the shimmering heat haze in the distance, the racer can be seen coming to a halt, his parachute deployed. “You haven’t really got that much time to think as it’s all over very quickly,” says Darveniza after the run. “It’s all very exhilarating.”He got his new licence.Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletterExplore more on these topicsThe rural networkPhotographyRural AustraliaShareReuse this content"

Then came the cutsThe abrupt halt to US funding threatens to undo decades of advances, dramatically increasing infections and deaths, but some see an opportunity for Africa to lead the responseSupported byAbout this contentKat Lay, Global health correspondentTue 18 Mar 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 09.42 EDTShareThis year the world should have been “talking about the virtual elimination of HIV” in the near future. “Within five years,” says Prof Sharon Lewin, a leading researcher in the field. “Now that’s all very uncertain.”Scientific advances had allowed doctors and campaigners to feel optimistic that the end of HIV as a public health threat was just around the corner.Then came the Trump administration’s abrupt cuts to US aid funding. Now the picture is one of a return to the drugs rationing of decades ago, and of rising infections and deaths.US evangelical groups urge Trump to spare HIV/Aids program from aid cutsRead moreBut experts are also talking about building a new approach that would make health services, particularly those in sub-SaharanAfrica, less vulnerable to the whims of a foreign power.The US hascancelled 83% of its foreign aidcontracts and dismantledUSAid, the agency responsible for coordinating most of them.Many fell under the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) programme, which has been the backbone of global efforts to tackle HIV and Aids, investing more than $110bn (£85bn) since it was founded in 2003 and credited with saving 26 million lives and preventing millions more new infections. In some African countries itcovered almost all HIV spending.View image in fullscreenA poster advertising free HIV/Aids drugs at a public health network in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. USAid funding provided much of the funding in some African countries.Photograph:  /AFP/GettyThere is a risk, says Lewin, director of Melbourne University’s Institute for Infection and Immunity and past president of the International Aids Society, of “dramatic increases in infections, dramatic increases in death and a real loss of decades of advances”.There is no official public list of which contracts have been cancelled, and which remain. It appears that virtually no HIV-prevention programmes funded by the US are still in operation, save a handful principally providing drugs to stop pregnant women passing on the infection to their babies. Countries report disruption to the most basic measures, such ascondom distribution.TimelineEight key dates in the fight against Aids and HIVShow1981.The first reports of a mysterious, deadly illness affecting gay men in the US appear in scientific journals.1983Scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris report the discovery of a virus that could be the cause of Aids – now known as HIV.1987The first antiretroviral (ARV) drug to fight HIV and Aids is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The 1990s will see huge advances in treatment that see deaths plummet for those who can afford the drugs.2001Generic pharmaceutical companies offer to producecheaper forms of ARVsfor developing countries. There are over 20 million people living with HIV in Africa but virtually no access to the drugs.2003The President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) is announced byGeorge W Bush to address HIV and Aidsin hard-hit countries worldwide. It will eventually invest over $110bn (£84bn) and prevent millions of infections and deaths.2007The first cure: doctors announce thatTimothy Ray Brownof San Francisco is free of HIV after undergoing a bone marrow transplant to treat leukaemia.2015The UN sets a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030.2025Sweeping cuts to US aid fundingleave HIV patients worldwide facing a dangerously uncertain future.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Some treatment programmes have been spared, but not those whose focus conflicted with the Trump administration’s war on “gender ideology” or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), such as those working with transgender communities. Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers have been laid off, while worried patients arehoarding drugs or stretching supplies, according to UNAids surveillance. UNAids itself has lost more than half of its funding.Even programmes that have survived the cull have faced turmoil since February, with instructions to stop work rescinded but withno certaintythat funding will continue.View image in fullscreenPeople wait for HIV tests at an MSF clinic in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province. The country could face 500,000 deaths over the next 10 years after US funding cuts.Photograph: AFP/GettyIn only one example, the Elizabeth Glaser Paediatric Aids Foundation says it has had tohalt HIV treatment for 85,000 people in Eswatini, including more than 2,000 children, and tests for thousands of pregnant women and babies to prevent transmission and begin life-saving medication.Access to drugs represents an “immediate crisis”, Lewin says. “If people with HIV stop the medications, then not only do they get sick themselves, which is tragic, but they also then become infectious to others.”As clinics on the frontline of treating the disease scrabble to secure access to basic drugs, scientists at this month’s Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in San Francisco were hearing that HIV might soon bepreventable with a once-a-year injection.Quick GuideHIV and Aids around the world: in numbersShow630,000The number of people who died from Aids-related illnesses in 2023 – more than one every minute. Since the epidemic began, a total of 42.3 million people have died.1.3 millionThe number of new infections in 2023, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls accounted for 44% of these.39.9 millionThe number of people around the world living with HIV. Of these, 30.7 million are accessing antiretroviral therapy.51%The percentage by which the death rate has fallen in just over a decade. The risk of an HIV-positive mother passing the virus on to her baby is now less than 1%.$19.8bnThe amount of funding available for Aids response in low and middle-income countries by the end of 2023. Of this, 59% came from domestic sources. International funding dropped by 7.9% between 2020 and 2023.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The drug lenacapavir was alreadygenerating huge excitementin the field, after trial results showed that a six-monthly jab could prevent HIV.New resultsfrom the manufacturer Gilead suggest that a tweak to the formula and how it is given could see its protective effects last even longer.Nevertheless, Lewin says, the mood at the meeting, packed with many of the world’s leading HIV specialists, was “dire”.As well as programme cancellations, there are “huge concerns around science and what’s going to happen to the [US]National Institutes of Health, [whose] funding of science has been so significant on every level”, she says.Some scientists in receipt of US funding have been told to remove their names from DEI-linked research, she says, even though DEI is fundamental to the HIV response.View image in fullscreenA nurse in Nairobi dispensing antiretroviral drugs used to treat children with HIV, whose parents died of the disease. Worried patients are now stockpiling medication.Photograph: Reuters“I don’t mean that in a sort of touchy-feely way, I mean that’s what we need to do: you need to actually get those treatments to these diverse communities.”In 2022,55% of all new HIV infectionswere within “key populations”, such as gay men, other men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, prisoners and people who inject drugs.Prof Linda-Gail Bekker, of South Africa’s Desmond Tutu Health Foundation, has seen US funding for threetrials of potential HIV vaccinesinvolving eight countries cancelled and only reinstated after anappeal to the US supreme court.“We’re running around like chickens without heads to at least get one going, because the vaccines are sitting in the fridge and will expire,” she says.Sheled the lenacapavir trialthat showed it offered 100% protection to young women in sub-Saharan Africa, but now worries about HIV/Aids prevention “falling off the radar completely”.The global community had been making headway towards theUnited Nations’ goal of ending Aids by 2030, she says, with a five-year plan to use “amazing new innovative tools and scale them up”, which would have led to “less dependence on foreign aid and more self-reliance” as new infections fell and attention shifted to maintaining treatment for people with HIV.“All of that is hugely at risk now because, without these funds, our governments will have to step up but they will concentrate on treatment,” she says. “We know they will do that, because that is what we did for the first 30 years.”US shutdown of HIV/Aids funding ‘could lead to 500,000 deaths in South Africa’Read moreEfforts to control Aids were entering “the last mile”, which was always likely to be more expensive, she says. “The people who were happy to come into health facilities, they would have come into health facilities.”It would be difficult to rely on government funding to reach the remaining groups, she says, not only because of fewer resources but also because in some countries it means targeting groups whose existence is illegal and unrecognised, such as sex workers or sexual minorities, and young girls may be reluctant to use government clinics if they are not supposed to be sexually active.“I feel like the odds are very stacked against us,” says Bekker, adding: “We’re obviously going to have to re-programme ourselves [and] formulate a different plan.”Pepfarhad pledged fundingto the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria,to deploy 10m doses of lenacapavirin low-income countries. While the Global Fund has promised to maintain its commitment, it might receive fewer than the planned number of doses, Bekker fears.“Six months ago, I was saying the best thing we can do with lenacapavir is offer it to everybody in a choice environment. [Now] I think we’re gonna have to say who needs [injectable] prep,” she says, “and the rest have to do the best they can.“How do we make that decision? And what does that look like? It is back to sort of rationing.“When we started ARVs [antiretroviral drugs] way back in 2000,” Bekker recalls, “you would go, ‘you get treatment; you don’t, you don’t, you don’t’.“It feels terrible … but you have to get over that. You have to say it will be infection-saving for some people. And we’ve got to make it count.”View image in fullscreenVolunteers for an HIV vaccine trial in Bukakata, Uganda. Experts fear that the huge progress made in finding a prophylactic vaccine will be undone due to the cuts.Photograph: GettyFor Beatriz Grinsztejn, president of the International Aids Society, the disruption is critical and threatens many vulnerable people. But, she adds, it could present “an important opportunity for ownership – otherwise we are always left in the hands of others”.She worries about the impact of cuts to funding on younger scientists, with their potential loss from the research field “a major threat for the next generation”. But, she adds, the HIV community is “powerful and very resilient”.There have already been calls for new ways of doing things. It is “time for African leadership”, members of the African-led HIV Control Working Groupwrite in the Lancet Global Health. There are now plans forNigeria to produce HIV drugs and tests domestically.Christine Stegling, deputy director of UNAids, says it began “a concerted effort” last year to develop plans with countries about how their HIV programmes could become more sustainable domestically “but with a longer timeframe … now we are trying to do some kind of fast-tracking”.‘Disruptive, unfair and cruel’: jobs lost and treatment stopped as USAid freeze hits HIV care in ZimbabweRead moreGovernments are determined, she says, but it will require fiscal changes either in taxation or by restructuring debt.The goal of ending Aids by 2030 is still achievable, Stegling believes. “I think we have a very short window of opportunity now, in the next two, three months, to continue telling people that we can do it.“I keep on reminding people, ‘look, we need to get back to that same energy that we had when people were telling us treatment can’t be available in the global south, right?’ And we didn’t accept it. We made it happen.“We have national governments now who are also very adamant, because they can see what can happen, and they want to make it happen for their own populations.”The Bill Gates Foundation, which contributes funding towards the independent journalism produced on the Guardian’s Global development site, is also among the donors to the Global Fund.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthAids and HIVAidDrugsUS foreign policyAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

She brought her younger daughter toSan Franciscoand, though undocumented, found work at a childcare facility and eventually married a US citizen.Because of extended delays in visa processing, her green card application remains in limbo after three years, but she’s never been particularly afraid of her immigration status. That is untilDonald Trumpwon re-election last November, fueled in part by a promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in US history.Jenny – the Guardian is using an alias to protect her identity – said she had been afraid to go to work, buy groceries or even meet her friends outside. Her husband, she said, urged her not to leave the house unless absolutely necessary until her visa is approved. Many other Chinese immigrants in her community share her fears, she said.“People are very scared,” Jenny said. “My husband and I are very scared. So many policies have changed and so many more are coming from White House that might have an impact on us.”On the campaign trail, Trump said he would prioritize deporting Chinese nationals of military age, suggesting without proof that they are building an army in the US. Immigrant rights advocates say Trump’s targeted rhetoric has instilled an unprecedented level of fear and anxiety in Chinese communities, both among newly arrived migrants and undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for decades.Two months into his return to office, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have already stepped up arrests across the country, conducted raids in major cities, detaining people at restaurants, local businesses and other public spaces. Ice operations have also occurred in sanctuary cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenAsylum seekers from China, Columbia and the Middle East wait near the border wall in Jacumba, California, on 4 November 2023.Photograph: Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesRoughly 390,000 undocumented Chinese immigrants live in the US, according to the Migration Policy Institute, with more than a quarter residing in California. Nearly38,000 of themare thought to have final removal orders, according to Ice data from November.Jose Ng, the immigrants-rights program manager at Chinese for Affirmative Action, said there was a lot of fear among undocumented Chinese immigrants where he works in the Bay Area, especially those with final removal orders, a ruling that formalizes an individual’s deportation from the US. The organization operates a rapid response hotline for emergency immigration situations. Over the past six weeks, Ng said the service has received an uptick of frantic calls, up to 40 per night.“We have people reporting Ice activity and presence in their neighborhood,” he said. “We have people sending us information about Ice pickups.”Chinese for Affirmative Action, Ng said, works closely with ethnic media to inform undocumented Chinese immigrants about their rights and the latest immigration policy updates. It also organizes “know your rights” clinics with community members and conducts training on Ice protocols.That prospect has become increasingly likely. In the past eight months, Ice has sentfive charter flightsto China carrying hundreds of Chinese migrants. Experts say deportations have increased as the Chinese government said it is willing to repatriate confirmed Chinese nationals – a more cooperative stance than it has taken in the past. Many undocumented Chinese people, Ng said, have lived in the US for decades but have had no viable way of obtaining legal immigration status. They are worried about being deported to a homeland they have not set foot on in years.The GOP’s anti-Chinese stance on immigration, experts said, is partially a reaction to the influx of Chinese migrants at the southern border over the past few years. In 2023, more than 35,000 Chinese migrants traversed the dangerous Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama and entered the US from Mexico – 10 times higher than the previous year’s figure. (Crossings have dropped significantly since then due to stricter enforcement from US and Mexican authorities.)View image in fullscreenPeople from China warm themselves near a fire after crossing the US-Mexico border in Campo, California, on 6 March 2024.Photograph: John Moore/Getty ImagesThe Darién Gap has not historically been a popular route for Chinese people who, in the past, have largely entered the US on tourist visas then overstayed, say experts. But as China’s economy faltered, and visas and other legal paths to immigration in the US became prohibitively difficult to obtain, more migrants have turned to border crossing as an alternative. The social media platform WeChat, which provides detailed instructions on crossing the Darién Gap and finding boarding houses, is also responsible for the influx of Chinese migrants at the southern border, said Connie Chung Joe, chief executive officer of the civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice SouthernCalifornia.“There’s a whole system set up for Chinese migrants who are mostly going through San Diego,” she said.The Trump administration said the crackdowns would first target violent criminals. But across the country, reports of Ice agents rounding up migrants and people with permits are causing concern in immigrant communities. Fewer than half of the roughly 8,200 people arrested from 20 January through 2 February have criminal convictions, according to an analysis ofgovernment datafrom ProPublica and the Texas Tribune.Chung Joe said Trump’s deportation campaign had caused “a lot of concern and anxiety” in Chinese enclaves in Los Angeles such as Monterey Park and Alhambra.‘They worship death’: Trump ‘border czar’ reveals extremist views in interviewRead moreFrank Hwu, an Alhambra-based lawyer who has represented thousands of Chinese undocumented immigrants, said that in the past, Chinese migrants were primarily single men and young adults seeking better financial opportunities in the US. The more recent arrivals have come together as a family. “They have young children and grandparents,” Hwu said.Martin Kim, director of immigration advocacy at Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California, said it was unlikely that Trump has the authority or resources to fulfill his hardline promises on immigration, given the astronomical cost of mass deportations. (TheAmerican Immigration Councilestimated the cost of removing 1 million people a year to be about $88bn.)Despite the administration’s fearmongering tactics, Kim said undocumented people should not hesitate to seek legal advice about their rights and how to deal with Ice.“It’s important to note that fear is exactly what this flurry of policy changes is meant to inflict,” Kim said. “There is a difference between what he’s indicated he wants to do and what he’s able to do.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsChinaSan FranciscoCaliforniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authorities say the $20bn (£15.4bn) investment will yield an estimated 60,000 jobs and help finance education for millions of children in a country where two-thirds of the population live on less than £2 a day.On the Guinean presidency’s YouTube account,several high-budget videosproclaim Simandou 2040 – as the megaproject has been christened – a “bridge to prosperity”. Given its superior ore grade and production capacity, industry observers have even called it “Pilbara killer” on the grounds that it will eventually displace Australia’s Pilbara region as the world’s largest iron producer.View image in fullscreenAn image from a promotional video for the Simandou 2040 project.Photograph: Apip GuinéeIn January, American rail technology providers Wabtec signed a $248m deal to bring in locomotives for the dual-track railway to connect the proposed mine to the Atlantic.But while reports in Guinea suggest that the first beam has been laid, key sections of the railway are not ready and other supporting infrastructure projects are far from completion, casting doubt on October’s proposed start date for production.Other concerns common to mining projects – around financing, safety and the environment – are also at play.AfterGuinea’s September 2021 coup, the ownership structure for the megaproject became more complex. Two of the site’s four mining blocks are owned by a consortium consisting of the Anglo-Australian mining organisation Rio Tinto, a Chinese holding company and the Guinean state. The other two are being developed by a Singapore-based consortium.Many in civil society and the opposition allege that details of the financing for the deal have been shrouded in secrecy. “There is no transparency in the Simandou project,” said Mamoudou Diallo, an activist and journalist who claims only a few members of the ruling junta are aware of key project details.In 2007, Guinea joined the Extractive Industries Transparency International (EITI) as part of a commitment to improve good governance in the sector. But while the country has made substantial progress in publishing data on revenues received and paid, recent contracts relating to the Simandou mining concession have not yet been made public, said Joanne Jones, the communications and strategy director at EITI. “We strongly urge publication of contracts associated with the project,” she added.Last July, two people died as the army quelled a protest by local people in Beyla, a district at the heart of the project, who claimed subcontractors weren’t recruiting fairly. On Wednesday,Reuters reportedthat six local workers were killed between June 2023 and November 2024 in accidents on the project. In all, the report said, there had been more than 40 undisclosed accidents since construction on the megaproject began. The government told the news agency it was investigating the deaths.Authorities have spoken about how there will be lower carbon emissions in steelmaking owing to higher quality of the iron ore. But in villages like Diala and Diarakendou, local people say solid waste from the construction is polluting the area and claim the companies are not acknowledging their complaints.“There are many villages that I travelled through where the impacts are visible,” said Diallo, who has done investigative work in some of these communities. “Citizens are even complaining that evacuation canals have been drained towards fields, in particular rice fields and water sources.”The Guinean ministry of environment and sustainable development was approached for comment.Bright Simons, the vice-president of research at the Imani Centre for Policy and Education in the Ghanian capital, Accra, said the involvement of two consortiums had complicated the timeframe for opening the site.“Production this year is out of the question,” he said, owing to the need for each consortium to coordinate on infrastructure development. Simons added that in particular he was yet to see a full commitment to accelerating funding for the rail element of the project.On social media, some Guineans joke about the launch date and recruitment of influencers to endorse the project. And among the Guinean opposition, fanfare around Simandou 2040 is seen as an attempt to generate campaign footage in the run-up to as yet unannounced elections that the junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, isexpected to contest.“Apparently the 2025 timeline for Simandou production is a political timeline,” Simons said. “The companies were told by Doumbouya to start this year or face consequences. The plan is thus to play along with the messaging and do some show activities from mid-year. But serious analysts don’t expect credible production to begin before 2028.”Explore more on these topicsGuineaMining (Business)AfricaMining (Environment)featuresShareReuse this content"

I have now spent years testing the theory ...Elle HuntTue 18 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTShareIsaw the light at 22. Since my teens, I had been dyeing my naturally mousy hair very dark brown. Shades such as “mahogany” and “praline” were unforgiving against my pale skin, but that wasn’t important to me. As a teenager, I was desperate to be taken seriously and thought of as smart, maybe even intimidating. I wanted to be brunette to signal that I had chosen books over looks.Then, one day, shortly after I started my first job, it dawned on me: I didn’t have to do all that. It took two sessions with a professional to lighten my defiantly darkened hair, but I felt lighter at once. It was as if the bleach had seeped through to my brain, lifting not just my locks but my disposition.The angst and earnestness of adolescence now seemed distant and hard to understand. Why had I ever felt like that, I wondered, smiling bemusedly, like Gwyneth Paltrow, when I could have been feeling likethis. It is no coincidence that fairytales make so much of “flaxen hair”: I felt both charmed by the world and charming, as if I might coax songbirds to do my bidding.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to signal I had chosen books over looks’ … Hunt on her 19th birthday.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntFor the first few weeks, out in public, I could feel people’s eyes on me, not because I was any more attractive – I didn’t kid myself – but because Ifeltmore attractive and perhaps more visible. I moved confidently through the world, my honeyed head held high.The so-called “halo effect” proved real, and aptly named. As a brunette, my most disagreeable traits – such as my tendency towards pedantry, debating and generally bringing down the vibe – had been obvious. Being blond softened those harsh edges, as though my every word and deed was implicitly tagged withlol– just kidding.It wasn’t just that I was having more fun. Iwasmore fun, if not fun for the first time.The difference was so marked, I could only assume that life got better the lighter your hair got. So, over the next decade, I dedicated time, money and effort into testing the hypothesis.In the years since my scalp was first blessed with bleach, I’ve been in and out of salons, chasing my perfect shade: honey blond, sandy blond, dirty blond, golden blond, strawberry blond and very nearly platinum. Some looks did me no favours, evoking a scarecrow’s straw-like tresses. But despite ups and downs along the road, my holy grail was never in question: to be, if not the fairest of them all, indisputably fair – and make it seem effortless, even when it was anything but.It was a small price to pay, or so I thought. As with every fairytale, there was a dark side. But it took years to wake up to it.View image in fullscreenIs being blond really a ‘cheat code to life’?Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianYou may be thinking (at least if you are a brunette) that I must be exaggerating – that there is no way that life as a blonde can be so different, so much better. But, as Joanna Pitman sets out in her eye-openingcultural history On Blondes, they have held our attention for centuries, for better and worse.Only 2% of the adult population globally is said to be naturally fair. Yet blond (and white – the two terms aren’t interchangeable, though they are often used as such) women have been disproportionately the focus of mythology, culture and even politics. Likewise, blond is the most popular shade of dye.Pitman tried it herself, bleaching her light brown hair – and, like me, instantly “felt younger and, strangely, more positive”. The effect was such that the associated upkeep started to seem not just worth it, but an investment. “After a while I wondered whether I could afford not to be blonde,” Pitman writes.The benefits don’t seem to distinguish between bottle blondes and natural-born. Studies have shown that blond (and, again, white) womenreceive more male attentionthan brunettes.That may not be your idea of fun – but blondes also have more funds.A 2008 studyfound blond female door-to-door fundraisers solicited more and larger contributions than their brunette counterparts.In an experimentreported on in 2012, waitresses wearing blond wigs received more and larger tips (though only from men). The so-called “blonde wage premium” has been shown to be equivalent to the return from an extra year of education. But a chunk of it, I would guess, goes back into the blond upkeep.View image in fullscreenDiana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.Photograph: Tim Rooke/ShutterstockFair hair doesn’t justlookexpensive. Regular salon visits are required to maintain the “natural” illusion and lightening is typically one of the most costly services on offer. (Diana, Princess of Wales, was reportedly spending £3,600 a year in the mid-90s – the equivalent of £7,200 a year or £600 a month today.) It is also time-intensive, taking as long as five hours in the chair every three months. Then there is the purple shampoo for banishing “brassy tones”, and the masks, moisturisers and treatments needed to protect against or alleviate the damage done by bleach.If anything, the faff further demonstrates the blond advantage: you wouldn’t put yourself through it without a payoff. On TikTok it has been termed “blond privilege” as users compare how much better they are treated with lighter hair – like finding “a cheat code to life”, as one woman put it.“It is like a superpower,” rhapsodises my friend Ingrid. (That is not her name, but it might as well be: her long, light, creamy blonde hair once led her to be mistaken for a local at Oslo airport.)Ingrid started dyeing her hair as a teenager. “My life changed in a dramatic way,” she says. “People looked at me differently. People were so nice to me, people fancied me.” She likens it to the positive reinforcement and approval that people report after weight loss.Now Ingrid is committed – to the quarterly dyes, the long stints in the chair, the Olaplex shampoo and other pricey products. After 15 years, she says, her artificial blond feels more than just natural: “It feels like me.” “Blonde” is, after all, a famously seductive identity – which is why we pursue it at great expense, against nature and sometimes even good sense.As a stylist and image consultant, Francesca Cairns advises clients on shades (for clothing, makeup and hair) that best suit them. In most cases – Cairns estimates 70% – her recommendation is that they dye their hair darker.View image in fullscreenFrancesca Cairns’s computer-generated image of Hunt’s ideal hair colour.“Sometimes I get comments like: do you not like people going blond? But some dye their hair blond simply because it is fashionable, without considering if it is actually going to suit their complexion or features,” Cairns says.Her recommendation for me, which she demonstrates with a digitally altered image, is a mid-auburn brown. I think I look both healthier and upsettingly ruddy, as if I’ve just returned from horse-riding.Lightness isn’t the only concern in finding your optimum shade, says Cairns: tone (whether warm, cool or neutral) and overall harmony are also relevant, as well as practical concerns such as budget. But those can get pushed aside by the cultural tide shifting towards ever-fairer hair, Cairns says. “Even I did it when I was younger: I put a lot of blond highlights in my hair, and looked really washed out.”Sometimes clients tell her that they are reluctant to go darker, “because their husband likes them blond”, Cairns says. “So it is a society thing, where you are maybe doing it for other people, so that they think you’re more fun or whatever, rather than for yourself.”Celebrities – who have stylists and colourists on speed dial, and areoften wearing wigs – also give a false impression of what is possible, Cairns adds. “We all want to try it and experiment, but you find a lot of people do end up going back to a darker shade.” Cairns calls it “blond blindness” – where, by lightening already-bleached strands over time, you can find yourself blonder than you realise or want.The day we speak, the Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown hasjust debuted a striking blondlook at the Screen Actors Guild awards. Online, commentators speculate that Brown is renewing her bid to play Britney Spears in a biopic or seeking a more mature image, post-child stardom. The Daily Mail just says she looks old. (Brown later addressed the critical scrutiny of her appearance, calling it bullying.)View image in fullscreenNew look … Millie Bobby Brown at the Screen Actors Guild awards in Los Angeles earlier this year.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesThat is the double-edged sword of blondness, as with many beauty standards: they are precisely calibrated, the rewards (such as they are) predicated on the “correct” performance. As per these unspoken rules, the “wrong” shade of blond – or inches of regrowth, or visible damage – risks drawing the wrong kind of attention, marking someone out as more “blond bombsite” than blond bombshell.“It is very much a class performance,” says Jennifer Berdahl, a sociology professor at the University of British Columbia who studies women and work. Her research suggests that even the purported advantages of being a blond woman – more money, attention, opportunities – are inextricable from the disadvantages. Though there is, of course, no truth to the airhead stereotype (a 2016 studyconfirmedblondes are no more likely to be unintelligent), Berdahl has found that they might enjoy more success because of the association with stupidity, not despite it.As rare as it is, still, for women to hold top roles in business, academia and government, those who do are disproportionately likely to be blond. Inher unpublished 2016 paper, Berdahl put it at 48% of female S&P 500 chief executives and 35% of female US senators. (Male leaders, however, were no more likely to be blond.) To Berdahl, the finding presented a paradox: why would having blond hair – associated with youth, innocence, even lack of intelligence – be advantageous for leadership? What she found was that a woman was seen as equally competent and independent, whether she had blond or brown hair – but, with lighter hair, she was perceived as significantly more attractive and warmer, and generally “more acceptable” as a leader.It may go unacknowledged through discussion of celebrities’ bleach makeovers, best “lightening” products and how to achieve “the perfect blond” – but the preferential treatment of blondness is rooted in racial privilege. As Pitman writes, the centuries-long focus on blond is inextricable from its association with whiteness and racial purity, and “some of the most grotesque racially motivated barbarism ever perpetrated”. By bleaching their hair, “even white women can whiten themselves” and access the associated benefits, says Berdahl. She points to the prevalence ofbright-yellow-blond women on Fox News and in Trump’s White House, signalling a “subtle, but very powerful, form of racial bias”.But the cult of blond is so established – not to mention beloved – that many aren’t prepared to reckon with the fact of “blond privilege” beyond a jokey TikTok trend (or humblebrag). In 2023, the US academic Tressie McMillan Cottom, who is Black, was banned from the platform after her video positing “blond as a social status” provoked the criticism of other users. The outsized angry reaction, Cottomwrote in the New York Times, was proof of widespread reluctance to grapple with “the culture, economics and politics of blondness”, and its invisible work in securing, and protecting, power.Indeed, Berdahl’s findings on fair-haired chief executives were widely interpreted as “a prescription for how to get ahead, like: ‘I’m gonna go dye my hair blond!’” she says. “I would prefer to see people becoming aware of this bias, just like any other bias – and correcting for it.”View image in fullscreenHunt with her new hair colour.Photograph: Courtesy of Ellle HuntIn 2023, Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love, actually did correct for it – and in the most drastic way possible. Frustrated by her “fancy blond lady hair”, and the gendered expectation to maintain the look into her 50s and beyond, Gilbert let loose with the clippers and shaved her head.For years she had fantasised about “not having to deal with hair any more”, Gilbert told Oldster magazine. What moved her to act was the realisation “that if I were a 54-year-old man, I would’ve buzzed my hair off years earlier, and my life would be simpler and less expensive”.Reading about Gilbert’s experienceclarified my own mounting ambivalence about being blond. Since 2019, when I left my job to go freelance, I had been extending the time between hair appointments and letting more of my natural ashy roots show, by dint of needing to economise and the post-pandemic effect of simply caring less. I had been asking my hairdresser, Katie, for the lowest-maintenance blond possible: we had even given up bleach. When only the lower third of my strands could be considered unequivocally blond, I wondered what I was hanging on to.You might say the spell was broken.The morning after the photo shoot for this article, I had a hair appointment. Instead of again requesting a “natural-looking” blond, I showed Katie the picture of Francesca Cairns’s suggested shade of brown.The appointment was painless, and unbelievably quick. I didn’t quite recognise myself when I looked in the mirror – but I noticed my eyes first.“Look, I’m a brunette!” I declared to the first friend I saw.She seemed confused. “I would have said you already were.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But behind closed doors are people who dream of work, wheels, security and the simple freedom to choose what they eatSonia LambertTue 18 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 06.09 EDTShareMuhammad is from Afghanistan and has a lot to think about today. He has good news – he’s received his asylum decision and he can stay in the UK. But that has brought up a new problem: he will have to leave the budget hotel inYorkshirewhere he has been living for months – and he has nowhere else to live.Still, Muhammad has offered to introduce me to some of the other people who live here. I work part-time for the Refugee Council, which means I sometimes visit asylum hotels. They are strange, sad places that are misunderstood, targeted by protesters and even – for instance, last summer – physically attacked. This one is next to an overgrown riverbank. Many of the guests here are from war zones – you might recognise the names of their home towns from maps on the news. In most cases, they are not allowed to work.Outside the automatic doors, two menfrom east Africa smoke cigarettes, shivering in the cold. Inside, people sit at wood-effect tables in a dining area. A young man, injured in a roadside bomb, picks his way across the room on crutches.“They are all genuine,” Muhammad says. “All the people here, everyone is suffering.” But from a distance, many don’t see it like this. Muhammad has been here for only three months but has already noticed the gap between the people in the hotel and the local community. “They think that immigrants are somehow criminals. This must be what someone is telling them.” He’d like more people to understand the reasons why people claim asylum.Muhammad’s asylum decision didn’t take long – he feels bad for the other Afghans he knows, many of whom have been waiting much longer.When women in Afghanistan were banned from attending university, Muhammad began teaching secret classes at home for his sister and her friends in English and biology. “I wanted to hold myself accountable, to feel I did something,” he says.The authorities found out, and he was arrested last summer and held for seven days. It was his second time in prison – the first was for attending a protest against the education ban. “We were tortured, things happened in the prison,” he says. “The PTSD is something I will live with all my life because of what happened to me back at home.”View image in fullscreen‘We could see waves getting bigger, we were about to sink’: a small-boat crossing.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PABefore his second arrest, Muhammad had started applying for postgraduate courses abroad, and was given a place to study for a master’s degree in the UK. So when he was released, he came to this country and claimed asylum.Most days, Muhammad makes the hour-and-a-half-long trip from the hotel to his university, where he’s still trying to attend classes – but not today. He has assignments due, but he can’t focus. The new problem is that he has received an eviction letter. He’s trying to work out his options. “Maybe I will become homeless as well,” he says, calmly.Two young Eritreans are sitting nearby. Leul and Ledo are Pentecostal Christians. In Eritrea, which is a dictatorship, their religion is banned and followers are imprisoned or killed.This is one reason to escape; another is that teenagers are rounded up and forced to fight in the army. “Most Eritreans are out of their country because of the government,” says Leul. He left with his mother when his father was imprisoned due to their religion. In neighbouring Ethiopia, his mother was caught selling “small things” on the street and beaten by the police because she was “illegal”. “I haven’t heard from her for a long time,” he says.Leul travelled for two years to get to the UK. His journey, through multiple countries, sounds horrifying. “In Libya, it’s crazy,” he says.This hotel is supposed to be for adults, but teenagers under 18 turn up here regularly. If they are lucky, they are collected by a social worker after a few weeks and taken into care. Others spend months or even years trying to prove their age. Some give up or turn 18 before their real age is accepted. It’s a surreal, stressful and bewildering process forhundreds of young peopleescaping from war zones every year.Leul says he was 17 when he arrived, butHome Officeofficials didn’t believe him, and he is now 18 anyway. He has been in the hotel for 11 months. “Here, it’s like a modern prison … We don’t do anything – no work, no learning, just sit in the hotel,” he says. He seems crushed and has been prescribed medication. “I can’t live in my country and I can’t live in another country.” He says if his family were here, they wouldn’t allow him to be as low as this, “but I don’t have family, that’s why it’s happening to me like this”. At least he and Ledo have found a local church – they go to services twice a week and the congregation are “very kind”.My colleague Caroline also works for the Refugee Council and is in the hotel today with Amy, a medical student on a placement. They are giving advice on accessing healthcare. A crowd gathers around them, Muhammad and some other volunteers from the hotel are helping. There are dental problems and minor injuries, sometimes gunshot wounds, people who have fallen from moving vehicles and mental health issues. It’s very busy. People have arrived in flip-flops, or without a coat, and need help to get clothes.Aziz also volunteers for the Refugee Council, and lives in the hotel. He’s writing a PhD thesis on applied machine learning and AI – he normally goes to a library to work.People talk about missing their families. The strain and uncertainty of waiting, without anything to do, affects all of themAziz tells me he is from a minority group in Afghanistan, the Hazara. He explains that Hazara people are “especially targeted under the Taliban – at the mosque, education, on the bus, they even targeted maternity hospitals”.His house in Kabul was near the graveyard, and “all the people they have killed are buried in one place”. One of his friends was killed at a Hazara demonstration against discrimination: “He had just completed his study, but he lost his life.”Aziz is clear: “We would not escape just for a happy life or a comfortable life. But there is no hope.”Spread across several tables, a larger group of Afghan men are having lunch served on paper plates – rubbery scrambled egg, dry rice and something watery and yellow made with lentils. They are grateful to be fed, but dream of the freedom to choose what to eat – they are not allowed food in their rooms.There are about 20 Afghans in this hotel – all fled persecution under the Taliban. “There was a huge regime change,” Muhammad says. “Everyone knows what happens when a regime changes. Someone’s father worked in the army, someone’s brother is an interpreter – my family is directly on their list.” The men nod – one was in the Afghan national army and shows me an ID card. “Even people who worked with Nato, they are still waiting for a decision.”What do they think about our new government’s promise to “smash the gangs”? The idea gets a cautiously positive reaction, with an important addition. “If there’s an alternative way to come, that will be better,” Aziz suggests. “Smugglers don’t care about others, the only thing they care about is themselves.”View image in fullscreenThe Bibby Stockholm barge in Portland, Dorset, courted controversy for its use as an asylum hotel.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianAfghans were the top nationality to cross the Channel last year, and many of those around the table came in a small boat. Muhammad interprets for one of the men, who says: “We have seen death with our own eyes.” They describe being crammed together, people crying or losing consciousness, their clothes drenched with seawater and petrol from the boat. “We could see waves getting bigger, we were about to sink,” says one young man. Another says he nearly died twice – once in a bomb blast in Afghanistan, and again crossing the Channel.I ask why they didn’t stay in France, or elsewhere. They say that they were not “given the option” to stay, or that they were homeless and sleeping on the streets. Someone mentions being able to speak English and having friends or relatives here. But the fact is that many more people do stop somewhere else, and at least two-thirds of all refugeesremain in a neighbouring country.People talk about missing their families. The strain and uncertainty of waiting, without anything to do, affects all of them. “Everyone is behaving strange. If they spend six months, their behaviour changes,” one of the men tells me. Since arriving, he has started self-harming. “Just the thoughts, the thoughts,” he says.Sometimes people are refugees twice over. Abdullah is a Palestinian refugee, born in Lebanon. He grew up in a camp for Palestinians, rented by the UN from the Lebanese government. He says they have no rights there to work or own a house, so live in slums.There are undercover Palestinian organisations that operate in the camps, and it’s hard to survive without them – they provide badly needed medicine and offer work opportunities. But when the recent war broke out, “they sent me a military order, saying I have to fight with them”. If he didn’t obey, he would be in danger. The organisation is related to Hezbollah, he explains, and “the Lebanese government can’t do anything about it”.He doesn’t know any other Palestinian refugees in the UK. He says this hotel is OK as something temporary. “I couldn’t even think, when I first came here. I was really struggling inside.”Waqar, also from Afghanistan, has been here a bit longer. He had his asylum claim refused and has lodged an appeal. He is bewildered by the decision letter. “They said you are able to escape your country, and you survived, so we are not sure that they will kill you! This is a strange reason,” he says. Poor decision-making is a big problem, and leaves people (including Afghans who are afraid to return) completely stranded. The Home Office admits that onlyhalf of decisions meet its own quality checks– and almost half of the challenges are successful.Waqar plays cricket with a local club. “Whenever I mention I’m an asylum seeker, I get hate,” he says. “Some of the media influence the thoughts of the people. They say, oh, asylum seekers have done this or that, and have taken the jobs.”View image in fullscreenPolice clash with anti-migration protesters outside a Holiday Inn being used as an asylum hotel in Rotherham last year.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThere are many other refugees in this hotel – from Sudan, Iran, central Africa, Yemen and elsewhere – all with their own dramatic stories. There are also Syrians – delighted by the fall of the Assad regime, but still struggling with the impact of so much death and displacement. They have been told that theirasylum claims have been pausedand are wondering what will happen to them next.As dusk falls, the Afghans sometimes play cricket in the empty hotel car park (no one has a car, and they couldn’t apply for a licence even if they did). Table tennis is popular – a table is unfolded from a side room, and a crowd gathers to watch and cheer. A Sudanese boy and a young Eritrean dart at the ball and enjoy the applause – for a short while, smiles break out.I ask the men what would help. Most would like to be allowed to learn English sooner – they have to wait six months to start formal classes, although two teachers from a local college sometimes come in to lead them in a chorus of Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. But mainly, people suggest a quicker, more efficient asylum process and the chance to work, perhaps after six months.If they can work, Waqar says, “people will engage, and pay their taxes. It’s good for the economy.” Muhammad suggests some kind of training, to help them integrate.Sadly, some of the men are nervous about going outside – Aziz says he doesn’t walk around at night because he was told by a shopkeeper that he might get stabbed. One man says his Afghan friend, now in this hotel, was attacked last summer at the time of the riots and spent two weeks in hospital. Leul remembers how frightening it was then, when the security guards at the hotel told them they couldn’t leave the building.Nobody loves asylum hotels. They are expensive and isolating; the system works mostly for the benefit ofshareholders. But experiments with barges and barracks have shown that worse accommodation causes greater harm and cancost even more. It’s better to focus on making faster and better decisions, and to help people rebuild their lives in communities.Just 7% of recent immigrants to the UK came through the asylum system, so it seems strange that this group attracts so much attention. And the media obsession with counting migrants obscures a simple, more hopeful truth. Given half a chance, the people in this hotel have a lot to offer, and will become care workers, academics, drivers, shopkeepers – like anyone else, except that they once escaped from danger, as people have throughout history. “This is not invading a country – this is finding a safe place for their lives. It’s a different thing,” says Muhammad.Some names have been changedDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But as much as I couldn’t stand her rants, I was forced to accept her as she wasByDidier EribonTue 18 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 07.22 EDTShareWhen I reconnected with my mother after years of near total absence, years in which we barely spoke, I was struck with compassion for this old woman suffering from so much pain. I even felt a tenderness towards her. This was despite everything that had driven us apart and continued to divide us. Her obsessive racism dismayed me, but in order to avoid always being in conflict, I would only protest half-heartedly when she launched into one of her habitual diatribes (herself the daughter of an immigrant, a traveller from Andalucía) against “foreigners”, who came to “our home” instead of staying “where they came from” (“It doesn’t even feel like home here any more”, “They take everything and there’s nothing left for us”), against “Arabs”, or “Blacks”, or “Chinese”, all of whom she complained about endlessly. (The language she used was often considerably cruder than this.)It was in part so I would no longer have to listen to this kind of talk that I had stopped seeing her and had fled both my family and this milieu. Nothing had changed after all this time: on this point, as on many others, she was the same as before. And yet, if I wished to spend time with her – and I did wish to, or at least it was something I felt I should do – I was going to have to accept her as she was. Nothing about her was going to change! And when I did dare to give expression to my annoyance, she would reply in a firm, almost aggressive tone: “I can say what I want in my own home. You can’t tell me what to do.” I had no choice but to try to understand her, to understand how and why she had become this way, and to put aside my spontaneous reactions of dismay.My mother had been abâtarde, an unloved, illegitimate child, abandoned by her mother. At the age of 14 she had become a domestic worker, sent to clean the homes of middle-class families. She went on working as a cleaning lady, then a factory worker, spending her entire life in exhausting, back-breaking work, the victim of a violent and unjust social order. She had always felt herself the subject of scorn; she had experienced endless amounts of humiliation. How, then, is it possible that she would allow herself to express at every possible moment her hatred of other stigmatised people?My mother’s vehemence while watching television and hurling abuse at those she saw on the screen meant, I think, nothing other than this: eternally inferior, she allowed herself, through these expressions of abhorrence, the only feeling of superiority that was socially available to her – the sadly distinctive dignity of not belonging to categories so stigmatised that even someone like her could ostracise and insult them. It was as if, in feeling herself endowed with a capacity to humiliate – even if it was only fictively, for herself alone, in speaking to the television – she was avenged for having always been among the humiliated.Her verbal vehemence in these circumstances was not only painful for me to hear, but it was also difficult to understand. Why all this hatred? What slights, what wrongs had any of those people she railed against done to her? What pleasure could she take in this pointless, unjustifiable spitefulness? And if she was so angry, why was this anger not directed against other individuals, groups or institutions, ones that bore more responsibility for the difficulties she experienced in her life than did these groups? And since, in these moments, I was the only person to hear her, why was she saying all this to me, what irresistible need did she fulfil in manifesting her exasperation in this way in front of her television?My mother’s racism frequently went beyond the limits of what I was willing to put up with in order not to fall out with her. But in truth I did not ever fall out with her. Just like the background noise of the television, this was an unpleasant circumstance that I was required to put up with while I spent time with her.Here is one example: my brother, who was living in Africa at the time, came to stay with her for a few days, along with his new partner, a woman from Guinea. As was usual, my brother and my mother spent their time together arguing. Each time he would arrive at my mother’s, things would become tense, and arguments, including regular shouting matches, became one of the major modes of their interactions. The same thing used to happen any time he ended up in the same room with my father or my older brother: the situation would immediately become tense, and they would sometimes come to blows.My brother is bad-tempered and irascible; most importantly, he has interiorised to such a degree the idea that men shouldn’t have to perform any kind of domestic labour that on this occasion he had asked my mother: “Where’s the laundry you did this morning?” She had replied: “It’s still in the machine.” He blew up. “Why couldn’t you take it out and hang it up to dry?” His partner, who was pregnant, was there resting on the sofa. That is when my mother pointed at her and made this ghastly reply: “What about her? You couldn’t tell her to do it? The world is really upside down now if white people have to work for Black people.”When my mother recounted this scene to me over the telephone, her voice still quivering with indignation, yet proud of how she had reacted (she wanted to show me that she didn’t let herself be pushed around, a theme that frequently recurred in the anecdotes she would tell me in which she was always playing a role that enhanced her status), I was so dumbstruck that I thought at first she must be exaggerating. “You didn’t really say that did you?” Indeed, she had. She insisted on it, repeating the odious sentence to me two or three times – she really had said it. So I said to her: “Maman, you can’t say things like that.” To which she replied: “I’m someone who has a hard time walking, and there she is lying on the sofa, lounging like a princess, and I’m the one who’s supposed to hang up the laundry?” I responded: “But instead of insulting his wife, you should have told that idiot of a son of yours to take his own laundry out of the machine.”It is hard for me to find the words to describe how despondent all these conversations left me. My brother, so attached to the demands of a conventionally defined masculinity, unable to let go of them for even a brief second; my mother, old and physically diminished, but finding no other way of opposing the stupidity of his ableist and masculinist stance than through the stupidity of her own racism.From the time I became a student I had set up my life so that I would no longer have to be confronted by these kinds of statements, ones I had heard day in and day out during my childhood and my adolescence. Yet here they were again, more violent than they had ever been, and I couldn’t avoid them. My mother was a racist old woman, and I had no choice but to accept her as such.Icould add 10, 20 or 100 more conversations such as the ones I have just described. Even when my mother was trying to convince me that she was not racist, she was being racist. One day, speaking about her newest grandchild (the son of my brother and of his wife whom my mother had insulted a few years earlier), she said: “He’s Black, but I think of him the same way as I think of my other grandchildren; I don’t treat him differently.” Or there was the time when she needed to find a new doctor closer to home once she had moved back to Reims. I asked her: “Did you like your new doctor?” “Yes, I was shocked when I opened the door because, well, you know, he was Black … But I liked him fine.” “But maman, I didn’t ask you if he was Black or white; I asked if you liked him.” She responded in that half-stubborn, half-mocking tone of a little old lady that she found it convenient to adopt whenever she didn’t feel like arguing but also didn’t want to concede any ground: “Yes, yes, yes, I just said I liked him fine. But still … it seemed a little strange to me.”Once when she was still able to travel and she was on her way to visit my brother in the south ofFrance, she needed to switch from one train station to another in Paris. She got on the commuter train going in the wrong direction and found herself in the suburbs. That meant getting off the train and asking directions of the travellers waiting on the platform, who explained what she needed to do. “I was a little worried,” she said to me, “because there were only Black people, but they were all very nice.” I then asked her: “But maman, why wouldn’t they have been nice to you?” She replied: “Oh, you know, what with everything you see on TV!” Watching television all day also meant absorbing a stream of biased images that nourished and reinforced her already hostile disposition towards a world she barely knew (Parisian commuter trains, and the people who lived in the towns on the outskirts of Paris).Still, I have to admit that, in spite of all these unpleasant episodes, watching television also served as a way of spending time together without having to find new topics of conversation once we had covered the usual health issues, family matters, a few memories, a few anecdotes (either new ones or ones repeated for the hundredth time). The two of us could sit there without talking or simply trading a few words about the images passing on the screen in front of us (a science documentary, or a historical or geographical one, or one about animals, or a retrospective look at this or that variety show artist). After all, being together, being right next to each other, without saying anything, is also one of the privileged ways of relating to those we are close to, because it requires a heightened degree of intimacy or of closeness. There was no need for me to make any attempt to keep the conversation going. We were fine like that.My mother read the regional newspaper on a daily basis. She devoured all the local news, read all the different sections, including health and beauty, cooking, advice, interior design, gardening and home improvements (even if she had no garden and made no improvements), and travel (even though she hadn’t taken any trips in years). Still, we probably all read pages in the newspaper that have no immediate usefulness for us. She was a subscriber, and what she called “my newspaper” was delivered to her postbox. There came a time when she decided the subscription was too expensive for her and so she asked to be sent the newspaper only every other day. I offered to pay for her subscription, since it was so important to her that she be able to read “her” newspaper every morning, but she absolutely refused. “It’s not something you should be paying for.” I insisted, but she would not reconsider.She also read cheesy novels, printed in big type, romances. The covers always had sensual (heterosexual) scenes on them, where a handsome young man embraced an equally young and beautiful woman, suggesting that the plot would be more than simply sentimental. When, out of curiosity, I picked one of these volumes up off the coffee table in front of her sofa, my mother said, with a forced laugh, as if worried I was going to judge her somehow: “Leave that be, it’s not a book for you … I know it’s nonsense … But I enjoy that kind of thing.”There was a day when, looking in a small fake antique wooden cabinet (a style she liked) for a document she had asked me to find, I saw, in the middle of a row of these novels that she so enjoyed, and that she kept once she finished reading them, a few old books of mine that I must have left behind with some other belongings when I moved out of the family apartment at the age of 19. There was Camus’s The Strangeralongside Sartre’s The Wordsin the Gallimard paperback editions, and also two volumes from the Maspero pocketbook collection that contained Marx and Engels’s writings on syndicalism. “Hey, those belong to me!” I exclaimed. She looked at them, and replied: “Huh, well of course. I mean obviously I don’t read that kind of stuff.” And when I added: “Can I take them?” she looked at me with amusement and said: “Sure, they’re yours. What am I going to do with them?”View image in fullscreenA derelict house near a former lace factory in northern France.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianJuxtaposed in the way they were, those books in her apartment – hers from today, mine from long ago – existed in direct opposition to each other. The two volumes of Marx and Engels left behind in the apartment in the low-income housing complex in Reims, where we lived while I was a teenager, with their very plain covers, one red, the other purple, had been printed in January 1972. I had bought them shortly before leaving my family to move into a small room in the centre of town, the first step in my “flight”, one that would quickly lead me to Paris. Despite their slightly faded colours, these volumes shone rather brightly as symbols of the gap that had already formed. Lying there on the table, they represented the cultural distance that had started to grow between us and that would turn into an ever-greater social distance in the years that followed.My mother had a very strong feeling of the cultural illegitimacy of the kinds of things she read and of her own taste for this kind of literature, a feeling that she expressed, before I had said the slightest thing on the topic, by declaring to me that the books she read weren’t my kind of books, and that she knew quite well that they were “nonsense” or, conversely, by telling me that those volumes by Marx and Engels were not for her.The volumes I found in that cabinet so many years later and that I put on the table next to the ones my mother was reading represented this impassable paradox: she was the one who had worked in a factory; I was the one interested in the history of the workers’ movement, in the theory of syndicalism.Each time I came to see her at her home, before she was admitted to the nursing home, I could tell that she had hardly any interest in politics, or in what politics meant to me. What she did react to were human-interest stories found in the popular press, or sensational news items. “Did you see? Something really bad happened,” she told me in a shaky voice just after she opened the door one day on my arrival. “No, what?” I asked. “You didn’t hear? The bus of tourists that flipped over in a ditch. People died.”Her day was punctuated by the news bulletins brought to her on television: sensational stories, traffic accidents, celebrity gossip. The local newspaper also provided plenty of occasions for her to get riled up, to become indignant, and sometimes (more rarely) to rejoice. Small local stories about a burglary, an assault or a crime committed in town, episodes of extreme bad weather, all took on more importance in her eyes than anything that might be taking place in some far-off country. Even things happening in nearby nations held no interest for her.My mother always voted. Or almost always. When she abstained, it was not out of indifference, but as a deliberate and collective gesture of defiance and rejection. Speaking to me one day about Muizon, the village she was then living in, she said: “I’m not voting tomorrow. No one goes to vote here, everyone abstains. We’re sick of it all.”This refusal to participate – a phenomenon that has only increased since then – is a way of expressing an opinion: not only that you do not recognise yourself in any of the candidates that you have to choose from, but also that you do not recognise yourself as part of the electoral process itself. So you choose not to play the game; you stay on the sidelines. Was it because of her age, which is to say the generation she was part of (she was 15 when women gained the right to vote), that this withdrawal was never a permanent one for her? In any case, she did vote again in the next election.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron … my mother voted for him even though he stood for everything she had risen up against.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersSince she no longer had any attachment to collective frameworks for working out a political position, since she had so few contacts with the external world, she would choose between candidates based on varying kinds of criteria that were sometimes difficult to understand. She voted for Jean-Marie Le Pen, because she wanted to “teach them a lesson”, at a moment when voting for the National Front started to take root and to thrive in the heart of what used to be the “working class”. Then she voted for the extremely reactionary Nicolas Sarkozy against the socialist Ségolène Royal (whom she particularly detested), then for Sarkozy again against the socialist François Hollande (I am not absolutely sure of that one), and finally, in the first round, for Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, even though he stood for everything she had risen up against 20 or 30 years earlier. (When she worked in a factory she could always be counted on to follow a call to strike, or to take part in a work stoppage, or an assembly in front of the factory.) Her response for this, when I objected, was disconcerting: “I know all that, but he’s young.” Or, even more absurdly: “Yes, but he’s handsome.” This was a choice she soon bitterly regretted, ranting about this neoliberal and authoritarian political figure soon after his election, when he had barely had time to announce the first of his measures to cut the social welfare system, making clear that she should have voted for Marine Le Pen, and that she would do so the next time around.It has to be said that as she got older, she arrived at a point where any and everything that sounded “leftish” or that had to do with the “left” was utterly detestable to her. As a rule, she was prepared to vote for almost anyone as long as they were opposed to the left.One man she was very taken with, another former factory worker, was even further to the right than she was. He seemed authentically fascist to me when he showed up one day in the middle of one of my visits to my mother and let out: “Nothing works in this country any more … What we need is a new Hitler.” I turned to look at him. He was smiling contentedly. He seemed happy with what he had said. Is it really what he thought, or was he trying to get under the skin of a leftist, Parisian intellectual – which is what I was for him, someone who represented everything he despised: Paris, elites, the “system”, the left? I pretended I hadn’t understood what he had said and asked my mother some unrelated question – “What time is your nurse coming tomorrow?” or some other banal question that served the purpose of changing the topic of the conversation when I could no longer bear remarks that were racist or politically painful for me.Was not what I was witnessing there, in real time, in front of me, in her home, the spectacle of the disintegration of a social class, and of the “class consciousness” that she was supposed to embody – and that, in fact, she had embodied in the past? There I was in my mother’s living room, and because it was my mother’s living room, I was with a woman who was racist and a man who was a neo-fascist or even pro-Nazi, both of them former factory workers, people who had, in the past, represented voters of the left, the social base of leftist parties.My mother’s interest in politics did not seem to go beyond this electoral dimension to which she attached so much importance. As a younger woman, she lived in a politicised world, given that everyone in her family – her brother and his wife, my father, his brothers and sisters – claimed to be leftists. Moreover, as part of the left, they thought of themselves as belonging to a world of workers in the economic and class-based meaning of the word, but also in the political sense. “We, the workers” was a political category, a way of naming how you saw yourself politically. In the 1960s, people spoke disparagingly of Harold Wilson and the Labourite left in the UK, who wanted merely to reform the system (but whose project, it must be said, would appear to today’s mainstream media, in the UK, in France and across Europe, as radical and extremist). In the 1970s, people would repeat over and over: “For us it’s theProgramme commun!” by which they meant the electoral agreement that the Communist party had signed with the Socialist party, despite the great mistrust in which the Socialists were held. (It was understood that they were always ready and willing to betray the working class.)View image in fullscreenA demonstration organised by Communist unions in Paris, May 1968.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesStill, my mother couldn’t help feeing a certain mistrust for unions as well, or at least for union activists. “They just like telling everyone else what to do,” while knowing that “they don’t risk anything themselves”, and that “other people take the risks for them”. Or else: “They’re just doing it to get ahead at work.” And it is true that there is no shortage of examples of highly active union delegates who ended up being neutralised by way of a promotion within the workplace. “He sold out.” “They bought him off,” as people used to say. It happened to one of my uncles, who was thereafter judged quite severely by everyone else in the family, even if the judgment might be slightly softened by way of a few understanding comments. Yes, he was a “traitor” who “went over to the boss’s side”, but given that he was looking to better his situation, were you going to throw the first stone?The factory where my mother worked in the 1970s and 1980s employed 1,700 men and women as workers, 500 of whom belonged to the union closest in those days to the powerful Communist party. There were others who supported or belonged to other unions. This represented a considerable strength, when people were mobilised for the long term, and they could be mobilised whenever the occasion called for it. A strike broke out in 1977 to obtain a guaranteed bonus, improvements in working conditions, and the rehiring of two workers who had been fired for distributing political tracts at the factory gate. The atmosphere between employers and the workers’ unions in the region had become tense since a Communist mayor had been elected in Reims at the beginning of the year. Massive numbers of workers went out on strike, with a picket line in front of the factory’s locked gates. One night some members of a private militia (part of a small rightwing union from another factory with ties to the bosses) drove by in a car and fired some shots at the union members who were there. One of them died.My mother had a strong memory of this dramatic moment. She was one of the strikers, even though she wasn’t present at the moment of the shooting. Workers were intensely engaged at the time, and the forces of repression did whatever they could to break their will. After this murder, there were stoppages and protests in solidarity all over town, and thousands of people attended the funeral of the worker who had been killed.Ten years later, the factory was not doing well; it would soon go under. The number of people who worked there was declining. This was also the case in the other large glassworks in town, as in most of the factories throughout the region. This meant there were layoffs or, as in the case of my mother, people given early retirement; there were workers who were partially unemployed, and others fully unemployed and looking for work. Then the factory closed. That was quite a while ago, but the buildings are still there: empty, abandoned, run down. They provide evidence of these kinds of workplaces that seemed straight out of the 19th century, of the violence of capitalism, of the hardship of these kinds of employment. But they also serve as examples of the kinds of spaces of organised resistance that existed.Where are those workers now? For the most part, they have died. What about their children and grandchildren? Most likely, when they aren’t stuck in long periods of unemployment, they work in temporary, precarious forms of employment. They will be employed in various positions having to do with logistics, in the warehouses in which a new working class is forming, one in which people work in exhausting conditions and under permanent surveillance. Where are the CGT union cards? What happened to the collective strength that one saw in my mother’s generation?The resistible rise of Marine Le PenRead moreI went to visit the factory again shortly before my mother’s death. The outside walls were covered in graffiti and posters for the National Front. Inside was a picture of desolation. The windows were broken, the ground was covered with broken bottles and shards of glass. There were orange-red rubber washers everywhere, the ones that would have been used on the jars to which workers attached the circles of metal that held the covers in place.In the midst of this scene of ruin I reflected on what my mother’s existence had been, on the world she had belonged to. I thought of the oppressive heat that would assault all the bodies working there – from the manufacturing furnaces – filling these spaces that were now empty and windswept; I thought of the infernal noise, as well, of the harshness of all of these kinds of jobs, of the danger caused by the dust from the materials in use, of all the workplace injuries, many of them extremely serious ones. I thought of those days gone by. Then I thought of the nursing home awaiting her, the one I was about to help her move into. There it is, I said to myself: that’s what the life of a working-class woman was, and that’s what her old age is.Translated by Michael Lucey.

There will be more limited closures around four other colonies, according to a court order formalising the agreement.Conservationists and the fishing industry had been at loggerheads for years over how much commercial fishing contributed to the African penguin population’s precipitous decline and to what extent fishing restrictions would arrest the fall.View image in fullscreenConservationists from SANCCOB and BirdLife South Africa celebrating the victory outside the high court in Pretoria.Photograph: Peyton Joe Basson & Ayanda KaniseAfrican penguins arethreatened with extinction by 2035if their population continues falling at the current rate of 7.9% a year. There are now fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs. A century ago there were 1 million.Nicky Stander, head of conservation at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) said: “Today’s order is a significant step forward in our fight to save the African Penguin from extinction … However, while we celebrate today’s success, we remain acutely aware that our journey is far from over. The threats facing the African Penguin are complex and ongoing.”Two fishing industry groups, the South African PelagicFishingIndustry Association and the Eastern and Southern Cape Pelagic Association, welcomed the “middle of the road compromise”, which will apply for 10 years, subject to review after six years.They said: “The perception that the fishing industry (or that fishing near to breeding sites) is the primary cause of the decline in the penguin population is a false one … We are especially pleased that this settlement will now allow scarce resources to be used constructively to scientifically determine the principal factors causing the decline in the penguin population and to ameliorate those where possible.”Decoy tactics: can fake concrete penguins help save the real thing?Read moreSouth Africa’s environment minister, Dion George, said: “This agreement is a testament to what can be achieved when industries and conservationists unite for a common cause. It delivers on the DFFE’s vision of protecting our penguins and preserving our biodiversity, while ensuring the sustainability of our fishing industry.”Two NGOs – BirdLife South Africa and SANCCOB – hadtaken George’s predecessor, Barbara Creecy, to courtin May 2024, arguing she had failed to implement “biologically meaningful [fishing] closures” around the six penguin colonies, which are home to 76% of the bird’s population. George hadsought an out-of-court settlementafter taking office in July.“It is good to hear that the island closures have been agreed at last,” said Bob Furness, a University of Glasgow emeritus professor, who was part of an independent panel that in 2023 recommended the fishing closures but said the conservation benefits would be “small”.“These alone may not be sufficient if penguins continue to be under pressure from many factors and in particular if sardine total stock biomass remains vulnerable to overexploitation at low stock abundances.”Other factors affecting the penguin population include the climate crisis, land predators and noise pollution from ship-to-ship refuelling near Gqeberha.The fishing closures now needed to be monitored, said Phil Trathan, a visiting professor at Southampton University, who was also part of the expert panel: “It is now critical that the focus now turn to examining the industrial fisheries for sardine and anchovy.”The environment ministry did not answer questions about whether it was considering further sardine fishing control measures.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaSeascape: the state of our oceansEndangered speciesBirdsFishingConservationWildlifeMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

I was fishing,” a fisherman told HCH television.Five people were rescued from the sea.Martínez, who between 2006 and 2010 was the Honduras’s first Black congressman, had recorded a string of records as well asa Tiny Desk concert for US National Public Radio. He was described by the Guardian in 2017 as “the finest living exponent of the lilting, soulful music ofthe Garifuna people”.“We’re devastated,” his nephew Ángel Aparicio Fernández, also a musician who played with his uncle, told the AP. “He was the family’s pillar.”Martínez was a member of Los Gatos Bravos before forming his own group Lita Ariran. His first album “Garifuna Soul” took him to Europe, the United States and other parts of the world.“He was the greatest model fromHondurasof Garifuna music on a worldwide stage,” his nephew said.“It is very traumatic, not just for Garifuna, but the world, because he was someone who brought people together from all walks of life,” said Ubafu Topsey, a Garifuna activist from Belize.Describing Martínez as a visionary and a “Bob Marley type of person”, she added: “The beautiful thing about Aurelio is that he didn’t want to do things just for himself… He came from such humble beginnings and he never forgot where he came from. He spoke and wrote about the reality of our lives and how to be determined to overcome and to be consistent with how our history”.Freda Sideroff, the Garifuna Queen Mother, said Martínez was a cultural ambassador who would take his place among other Garifuna heroes.“His death is going to have a deep impact on the Garifuna community because we are still quite a small community and it feels intimate to us,” she said. She added that he has left an enduring legacy as a Garifuna musician and as someone who was proud of “understanding and being connected to Africa”.The Garifuna people are descendants of enslaved Africans and Indigenous Kalinago and Arawak people. Ejected in 1796 by British colonial forces from their homeland on St Vincent and Grenadines, their descendants settled across the coast of Central America and around the world.Dramatic video uploaded to social media by the national police showed officers and other rescue workers carrying survivors on to a rocky coastline, some in stretchers, as a nearby boat shone a bright light amid the darkness.The injured passengers included a 40-year-old French citizen, who will be transferred to hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland, said Maj Wilmer Guerrero of the fire department.Fifteen passengers were onboard the plane, along with two pilots and a flight attendant, police said.The crash, which happened about a kilometer from the coast, was caused by an “apparent mechanical failure” on the British-made Jetstream 41, the statement added.The Honduran president, Xiomara Castro, said she had “immediately activated” an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters and others to assist the victims of the accident.Agence France-Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasPlane crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

It is now forbidden for them to die either inside or outside the ring.The change stemmed from a citizens’ initiative which first proposed a total ban, only for the head of the Mexico City government, Clara Brugada, to modify it and introduce the concept of non-violent bullfights.Brugada suggested that the move would allow them to retain the economic activity around bullfighting. Proponents claim the industry supportstens of thousands of jobs.“The spectacle of blood cannot be justified under any concept of art and tradition,” said Brugada. “Some will argue that it is part of traditions and culture, but culture, music and art, even rights, change, evolve, transform. We big cities are obliged to transform at the same time. Animal welfare is a right and a duty for society.”Bullfighting in MexicoRead moreMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, also spoke in support of the initiative.The bullfighting industry rejected the new regulation and said they had not been consulted on it.At a press conference, Salvador Arias, a lawyer from Tauromaquia Mexicana, an organisation that defends bullfighting, said Brugada’s proposal for bloodless bullfights resembled one that wastried and failed in the Balearic Islands in Spain, where it won little interest from fans and was eventually thrown out by a Spanish court.Indeed, animal rights groups are counting on that lack of interest. In astatement, Culture Without Torture regretted that the ban was not total, but added that “in practice, we doubt that the proposed events will take place, since what fans of bullfighting truly want to see is blood”.Explore more on these topicsMexicoBullfightingAmericasAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of them subsequently appeared in a cinematic three-minute propaganda video shared by the Central American country’s authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards.White House’s defense for not recalling deportations ‘one heck of a stretch’, says judgeRead moreThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused the deported detainees – who now face at least a year inside the Salvadorian jail – of being “heinous monsters” who were part of “one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet Earth” – the Venezuelan crime groupTren de Aragua. Leavitt claimed their “extraction” and removal to El Salvador meant they would “no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People”.But Toczylowski rejected that portrayal of her client, calling claims that he was involved in the gang “completely baseless”.In fact, she said he was an LGBTQ+ artist who had fled political persecution in an increasingly repressiveVenezuelaand crossed into the US from the Mexican border city of Tijuana last year. There, he passed a “credible fear interview” used by asylum officers to determine whether asylum seekers have reasonable grounds to request protection in the US.View image in fullscreenThe mega prison in San Salvador where deportees from the US were taken.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesColleagues who had spent time with the Venezuelan man in detention described him as “a very sweet [and] normal guy” with no criminal history. Toczylowski said he appeared to have been wrongly identified as a gang member by immigration enforcement officials as a result of “some benign tattoos that are not gang related”.“We’re all in just absolute shock that this has happened,” Toczylowski said. “We feel like if it could happen to him, who’s next? And that’s really frightening.”Toczylowski declined to name her client or give further details of his life out of fears for his safety. But the families of other Venezuelans transported from the US to El Salvador have begun speaking out to challenge the Trump administration’s portrayal of their loved ones as terrorists and gangsters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think it’s designed to be part of their effort to end asylum in the United States.

In January, the odds stood at less than 1%.For the last two years, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has used acontroversial carbon levyand Trudeau, a deeply unpopular outgoing prime minister, to propel his Tories to what promised to be one of the most lopsided political wins in recent memory. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a commanding majority of seats. For more than a year and a half, the Conservatives’ win probabilities stood at more than 99%.Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead moreAs recently as January, for example, the most sympathetic polling firm had Trudeau’s party trailing the Conservatives by 20 points. Others had the gap as high as 27 points.But Trudeau’s resignation days later, andDonald Trump’s threatsto take over Canada, changed everything.In a recent columnfor the Walrus magazine on the “stunning Conservative collapse”, Fournier warned the Tories, whose odds of winning stood at 15%, were “suddenly at risk of blowing one of the largest polling leads in modern Canadian history”.Virtually all Canadian polling companies have shown a sharp trend towards the Liberals, at the expense of the Conservative party and the leftwing New Democratic party. If current polling predictions are reflected in the results of the upcoming federal election, the NDP would collapse and lose party status in the House of Commons.“This shift would be among the biggest we’ve seen in such a short period of time in Canadian history,” said Éric Grenier, a political analyst atthe Writ. Unlike other notable shifts in public sentiment, he says, the result is heavily skewed by threats from Donald Trump.“It isn’t just a question of a leadership honeymoon … But that adds a level of volatility to the public opinion environment that makes things unpredictable.”For Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear after losing the easy political targets of Trudeau and the carbon tax.While the Conservative leader’s combative politics have served him well as opposition leader, that same strategy appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.Poilievre this week held an event with an “Axe the Tax” sign – days after Carney had dismantled the consumer-facing carbon tax.The political columnist Robyn Urbackposted on social mediathat the Conservatives “are still waging the election campaign they never got to have”.In more grim data points for the Tories, polling from the Angus Reid Institute released on Monday found Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre on all questions relating to the ongoing trade war and the future of Canada’s economy.“More bluntly, 41% now view Carney as best suited to be prime minister compared to 29% for Poilievre,” the company said in its new release. “At least measurement, with Trudeau sitting in the PM chair, Poilievre led the Liberal leader by 19 points on this question.”If the polling holds, “what was a tired, discardable brand just three months ago would be on its way to a fourth term, this time with a majority”.The firm notes the profound effect Trump has had on Canadian politics. After staring down a US-led trade war and giving impassioned speeches about the need to fight for Canada’s independence, Trudeau left with the approval of 47% of Canadians – a 25-point jump compared with an all-time low of 22% just weeks before he announced his resignation.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyJustin TrudeauDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Tom Homan,Donald Trump’s “border czar”, has previouslystatedthat families with mixed immigration statuses“can be deported together”, leaving parents to decide whether they want to depart the country as a family, or leave their children in the US.In this case, the parentsopted to remain togetherwith their children, rather than have their family be split up.The Texas Civil Rights Projectsaidthat officials presented the parents with “an impossible choice” between either leaving their children in US government custody “and never see them again” or being deported together.The complaint alleges that on the morning of 3 February 2025, the family was traveling from the Rio Grande valley to Houston to get emergency treatment at theTexaschildren’s hospital for their daughter, as they had done several times before.On the way there, the family passed through an immigration checkpoint, one that they had previously crossed several times without incident, the complaint states.As they had done previous times, they presented officers with a letter from the hospital detailing their daughter’s brain tumor treatment, the necessity of continuing her care at the Texas children’s hospital, and a request that the parents be permitted to travel to oversee care for their daughter.The parents also said that they showed officers the children’s birth certificates, proving that they are US citizens, and a letter from their immigration attorney regarding their visa applications.But this was insufficient. Instead of allowing them to proceed, the complaint states that the officers “detained the entire family” for over 24 hours and “eventually forced the entire family, including US citizens, to Mexico”, where the daughter “cannot receive appropriate treatment”.The complaint adds that the family’s 15-year-old son, who is also a US citizen, as well as their one child who is not a US citizen, both have a heart disorder known as long QT syndrome, which they claim was known to CBP’s medical team.“It was clear to CBP’s medical team that they had custody of three children with complex medical needs, one of whom was complaining of urgent and serious symptoms, two of whom were US citizens,” the complaint reads.And still, the family alleges that CBP didn’t transfer any of the children, in particular the 10-year-old girl, to a hospital or medical care facility “to obtain pediatric medical review”.“Instead of granting her that care, CBP forced a child who was still recovering from brain surgery to sleep in a hot, dirty, brightly lit cell,” the complaint alleges.It also alleges that the children were inappropriately searched, including pat-downs of sensitive parts of their bodies, and that parents were denied adequate access to their attorney.In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for CBP said that “the facts as reported are inaccurate.”Canadian actor detained at US border in ‘inhumane conditions’ for nearly two weeksRead more“When someone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences as outlined by the expedited removal process for individuals with removal orders,” the statement added. “For privacy reasons, we cannot comment on the specifics of this case.”The Texas CivilRights Projectis urging homeland security’s office for civil rights and civil liberties to “open an immediate investigation” and is also calling on the department to immediately grant humanitarian parole to the parents and the child who is not a US citizen so “that the family can be together” while the daughter receives the medical treatment she needs.The complaint states that the family is currently in Mexico, fearing for their safety, and they cannot access the medical care they require.The couple’s oldest child, who is also a US citizen and was not traveling with the family on that day, currently remains in the US.The complaint notes that the parents are “valued members of their community” in Texas, “dedicated members of their local church”, and people who “work hard” and have no criminal records.The mother toldNBC Newsthat since the family was deported, the 10-year-old girl hasn’t received the follow-up care she needs.The girl still has swelling on her brain, the mother said, which is affecting her speech and mobility on one side.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS-Mexico borderMexicoLaw (US)US healthcareAmericasTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Wang, who is oftendescribed as China’s answer to the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, started the business as a battery maker in 1995, before starting car manufacturing in 2003.Charging speeds of 1,000 kW – or 1 megawatt (MW) – would be twice as fast as Tesla’s superchargers, which offer up to 500 kW. Fast-charging technology has been seen as key to increasing EV adoption.The news underlines the intense competition for the already struggling Tesla, whose stock has plunged following Musk’s championing of hard-right causes in Europe and the slashing of the US federal workforce as part of his work with the Trump administration.Besides missing sales targets, Tesla faces heightened investor pressure to produce autonomous vehicles, which Musk has promised but failed to deliver for about a decade. It is also facing increased competition with more affordable EV models, including those produced by BYD and other Chinese companies.Tesla’s share price slumped by 5.5% on Tuesday, adding to a 4.8% decline on Monday. Its valuation has fallen by 44% during 2025 so far, with investors worried about declining sales, and the possible hit to Tesla’s reputation from Musk’s close alignment with Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company did not specify the timeframe, nor say how much it would invest in building such facilities. To date, BYD owners have largely relied on other automakers’ charging facilities or public charging run by third-party operators.“In order to completely solve our users’ charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,” Wang said. “This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.”The new charging architecture will be initially available in two new EVs, the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV, priced from 270,000 yuan ($37,330).Tesla has offered its superchargers in China since 2014, and BYD’s smaller Chinese peers, such as Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng and Zeekr, have also been investing extensively and building charging facilities for years.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTeslaChinaAutomotive industryAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2016 Duterte had become the “first president elected with social media”, she said, seizing on the ubiquity of Facebook in thePhilippinesto, as her reporting has documented, mobilise online mobs and spread disinformation. Now, she said, the same tactics were being used to undermine democracy around the world, particularly in the US.“I joke all the time that the Philippines went from hell to purgatory…My only worry is that the west and America is at the stage we were at in 2016, when you’re descending to hell,” she said. “To watch this deja vu twice, it’s like a bad punishment for me.”As a cofounder of the Rappler news site, Ressa was at the forefront ofexposing the propagandaspread by online trolls during Duterte’s time in power, alongside his government’s alleged abuses of power and growing authoritarianism.Social media bosses are ‘the largest dictators’, says Nobel peace prize winnerRead moreRessa, who in 2021 wasawardedthe Nobel peace prize in recognition of her determination to uphold freedom of expression, spoke to the Guardian from Berlin, where she was participating in a “people’s court” that has this week put social media on trial, examining how it interacts with polarisation, radicalisation and misinformation.The week-longSocial Media Tribunal, which has no legal powers, will hear testimonies from sources that range from a Facebook whistleblower to a Rohingya campaigner and victims of cyberstalking and sextortion before handing down its “judgment” on Friday.Backed by the rights groupCinema for Peaceand Ukraine’sCenter for Civil Liberties, and created under the patronage of Benjamin Ferencz, who until his death in 2023 was the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials, the initiative aims to ramp up pressure for international accountability. In 2023, the same campaigners were behinda similar“people’s court” that put the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on trial for the crime of aggression after his invasion of Ukraine.View image in fullscreenMaria Ressa received the Nobel peace prize alongside Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, in December 2021 at Oslo city hall, Norway. The Norwegian Nobel committee cited their fight for freedom of expression.Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/APThe tribunal in Berlin was opened on Monday by Ressa, who cited a whistleblower on how, more than a decade ago, the Philippines wasalleged to have beenused as a “petri dish” to test out the interplay between social media and tactics of mass manipulation. “If it worked in our country, they went to the west, specifically targeting America,” said Ressa.As falsehoods, many of them laced with fear, hate and outrage,began hurtlingacross social media in the Philippines, Ressa travelled to Silicon Valley to sound the alarm. “I felt like Cassandra and Sisyphus combined,” she said. “And I think people just kind of thought, ‘oh that’s interesting, that’s never going to happen here.’”Years later, the world watched as the 2024 US presidential elections played out againsta similar backdrop, giving rise to an ecosystem that continues to prop up the Trump administration. Ressa, who last yeardescribed“tech bros” such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk as “the largest dictators” said the US was now staring down “the greatest challenge democracy will face”.She said: “Because when you give the broligarchy state power – ie the most powerful country in the world at this moment in time – who knows what will happen?”What she did know was that time was of the essence. “What we learned in the Philippines is that you are at your greatest power when the attacks begin. If you are silent, you give consent. If you are silent, you give up your rights,” she said. “This is that moment where you have to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice for the truth? Because if you don’t, if you bury your head in the sand like an ostrich, you will lose your rights.”She pointed to the Philippines to highlight what was at stake. As Rappler refused to back down from publishing stories about Duterte’s administration, Ressa fended off a barrage of hate – at one point the messages soared to 98 an hour, she said – and faced 10 criminal charges. Two years after Duterte left office, she haswon most of the casesbut two charges remain, forcing her to request court permission each time she wants to leave the country.Duterte’s arrest last week laid bare a nation still divided: while supporterstook to the streetsin his strongholds, others continue to grapple with the painful fallout of a years-longanti-drug campaignthat saw thousands of people – many of them men in poorer, urban areas – gunned down in the streets.“In 2016, when the drug war began, I was like ‘Oh my god, this is going to affect a generation of Filipinos’. And it has,” she said. “So yes, he’s arrested but there’s so much damage that now needs to get rebuilt.”She cast it as a sort of cautionary tale for the US and west, one that pointed to how the free rein of technology could pave the way for populism to be tipped into authoritarianism. “If you do not protect your rights today, what’s destroyed takes a hell of a long time to rebuild.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaRodrigo DuterteMaria RessaFacebookPhilippinesPress freedomAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He accused VOA of being “radical” and “anti-Trump”.The order would “ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda” the White House said in a statement. USAGM employed roughly 3,500 people and had an $886m budget in 2024, according to the agency’s latest report to Congress.The attempt to close down RFA was “a reward to dictators and despots”, its president, Bay Fang, said, “including the Chinese Communist party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space.“Today’s notice not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA’s reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America’s adversaries at our own expense.”RFA’s unionsaid in a statementthat the move would “hand a victory to the Chinese Communist party, which harbors a particular disdain for free media and truth” and would “embolden Kim Jong-un’s totalitarian regime in Pyongyang, where information control reaches unprecedented levels”.The union said it intends to challenge the decision, adding that a termination of its service would “betray the very principles upon which America stands”.At VOA, which was set up during the second world war to counter Nazi propaganda,Trump’s decision has seen almost 1,300 staff placed on administrative leave, according to VOA director Mike Abramowitz.Veteran VOA correspondent Brian Padden said it was “particularly galling” that Elon Musk had accused VOA of anti-American propaganda to justify the shutdown.“In the course of my reporting, I have been shot at, roughed up, and even nearly decapitated by an exploding helicopter in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, I was harassed by pro-Russian activists or militants in Ukraine who accused me and my VOA TV crew of being agents of pro-American propaganda,” he said in a social media post.“Both Musk and the Russian militants are wrong. VOA does not do propaganda. VOA reports the news, which includes the perspective of both proponents and critics of the president.”Patsy Widakuswara, VOA’s White House bureau chief, said in a statement on social media: “I do not know a single VOA journalist who is not fiercely protective of our charter and the editorial independence it provides, especially those of us born in countries where there is no such concept.”South-east Asia is still reeling from cuts to USAid, which had provided funding to a range of media organisations, includinglocal journalists covering atrocitiesin war-torn Myanmar.Former Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen, an authoritarian who handed power to his son in 2023, also weighed in publicly to praise the Trump administration decision, describing the cuts as a “major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world”.On the ground in Phnom Penh, not all Cambodian journalists agree.Sun Narin, who has worked as a contractor for VOA in Cambodia for eight years, described the decision as “dark time for us and journalism in Cambodia”.“I feel hopeless,” he said. “The situation of our press has been getting worse and worse since the shutdown of a few independent media outlets. VOA is now the only long-term outlet that dares to broadcast critical information to the public. So people have no more choices.”Explore more on these topicsMediaChinaDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Blobfish do not have a swim bladder, a full skeleton, muscles or scales. Instead, their bodies are made up of blobby tissue with a lower density than water that allows them to float above the seafloor.The species is believed to be able to live to 130 years old, is slow growing and slow moving, says Konrad Kurta, a spokesperson from the Mountains to SeaConservationTrust that runs the annual competition.Blob-headed fish and amphibious mouse among 27 new species found in ‘thrilling’ Peru expeditionRead more“It sort of sits there and waits for prey to come very close and practically walk into its mouth before it eats them,” he says. It is also a “dedicated parent” with females laying up to 100,000 eggs in a single nest, which they protect until they hatch.The fish found fame over a decade ago after acrew member on a New Zealand research vesselsnapped a photograph of the rarely seen animal. Its distinctive appearance was quickly adopted into meme culture.The pressure of the water forces their shape into that of a regular – albeit bulbous – fish but out of the depths they can resemble “a failed medical experiment”, Kurta said.“Regrettably, when it is pulled up … that sudden decompression causes it to become all disfigured,” Kurta says.View image in fullscreenThe longfin eel came third in the New Zealand fish of the year contest.Photograph: Lorna DooganLittle is known about their conservation status due to a lack of research, but their populations and habitat are considered vulnerable to deep-sea trawling.“Blobfish are fairly frequently pulled up from thebottom-trawling of orange roughy,” Kurta said.TheMountains to Sea Conservation Trustlaunched the Fish of the Year competition in 2020, inspired by the highly popularBird of the Year. This year saw the highest number of votes cast in its competition – 5,583 in 2025, compared with 1,021 last year.The blobfish won on 1,286 votes, pipping the orange roughy by 300 votes, despite the latter having powerful backers including Greenpeace, Forest & Bird and the Environmental Law Initiative.“We are very pleased for the blobfish,” said Aaron Packard, a spokesperson for Environmental Law Initiative. “From an ecosystem perspective, a win for blobfish is a win for orange roughy.”New Zealand is responsible for about 80% of the global orange roughy catch. Environmental watchdogs regularly call for a halt on fishing the species due to the destructive effects of bottom trawling on ecosystems and vulnerabilities in fish populations.Other contenders in the competition included themysterious longfin eel– known as tuna in Māori language – apygmy pipehorse, a critically endangered mud-fish, sharks and rays.“We have a dizzying variety of native marine and freshwater fish,” Kurta says, adding roughly 85% are considered vulnerable.“That [these fish] exist is often the first step to getting people invested and interested in what’s happening below the waterline.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandFishAsia PacificFishingAnimalsConservationMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history, the nationwide ban passed by 136 votes to 27 after it was submitted to parliament one day earlier.It amends the country’s law on assembly to make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate Hungary’scontentious“child protection” legislation, which bars any “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under the age of 18.The legislation was condemned by Amnesty International, which described it as the latest in a series of discriminatory measures the Hungarian authorities have taken against LGBTQ+ people.“The spurious justification for the passing of this law – that events and assemblies would be ‘harmful to children’ – is based on harmful stereotypes and deeply entrenched discrimination, homophobia and transphobia,” itsaid in a statement.“This law is a full-frontal attack on the LGBTI community and a blatant violation of Hungary’s obligations to prohibit discrimination and guarantee freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” it said, adding that the ban would turn the clock back 30 years inHungaryby undermining hard-won rights.Hadja Lahbib, the EU commissioner for equality, suggested the new law contravened the values of the 27-nation bloc, posting: “Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely. The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community – in Hungary & in all member states.After lawmakers first submitted the bill on Monday, the organisers of Budapest Pride said the law was aimed at turning the LGBTQ+ minority into a “scapegoat” in order to silence critics of Orbán’s government.“This is not child protection, this is fascism,” organisers wrote. Budapest Pride will mark its 30th anniversary this year, bringing together thousands of people to make visible the community’s struggle for freedom, safety and equal rights even as those in power continually seek to dehumanise them, it noted.“The government is trying to restrict peaceful protests with a critical voice by targeting a minority,” it added. “Therefore, as a movement, we will fight for the freedom of all Hungarians to demonstrate.”Organisers said they planned to go ahead with the march in Budapest, despite the law’s stipulation thatthose who attend a prohibited event could face fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (£425).As the vote was held, opposition MPs ignited smoke bombs, filling the parliamentary chamber with thick plumes of colourful smoke.View image in fullscreenOpposition MPs set off flares in the Hungarian parliament.Photograph: Boglárka Bodnár/APAfter the law’s adoption, a spokesperson for Budapest Pride, Jojó Majercsik, told the Associated Press that the organisation had received an outpouring of support.“Many, many people have been mobilised,” Majercsik said. “It’s a new thing, compared with the attacks of the last years, that we’ve received many messages and comments from people saying: ‘Until now I haven’t gone to Pride, I didn’t care about it, but this year I’ll be there and I’ll bring my family.’”Since returning to lead the country in 2010, Orbánhas faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions, including accusations of gradually undermining the rule of law.His government, in turn, has sought to portray itself as a champion of traditional family values, unleashing a crackdown that has drawnparallels with Russiaas it adopts measures such as blocking same-sex couples from adopting children and barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes.Tamás Dombos, a project coordinator at the Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, described Orbán’s assault on minorities as a tactic aimed at distracting voters.“It’s a very common strategy of authoritarian governments not to talk about the real issues that people are affected by: the inflation, the economy, the terrible condition of education and healthcare,” said Dombos.Orbán, he continued, “has been here with us for 15 years lying into people’s faces, letting the country rot basically, and then coming up with these hate campaigns”.The restrictions on Pride come as Orbán is facing anunprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar, in advance of next year’s elections, leading some to suggest the ban was aimed at winning over far-right voters.“It is easy to win votes by restricting the rights of a minority in a conservative society,” Szabolcs Hegyi of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) told Agence France-Presse.He warned, however, that the curtailing of civil liberties, seemingly for political gain, was a slippery slope. “Eventually, you can get to a situation where virtually no one can protest except those who are not critical of the government’s position.”Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánLGBTQ+ rightsEuropeAmnesty InternationalProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

If the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, doesn’t approve an overdue budget for 2025 by 31 March, the government will be automatically dissolved and the country will hold early elections.For many in Israel, the overnight bombardment ofGaza, the deadliest since the early months of the war in 2023, was a clear sign Netanyahu had made a political decision about the future of the conflict.Campaigners for hostages still held in Hamas captivity attacked it as an immense betrayal. Ayala Metzger, whose father-in-law Yoram Metzger was kidnapped to Gaza and killed in Hamas captivity, challenged Smotrich in parliament on Tuesday.“There are deals on the table, and you are choosing to continue sacrificing more hostages and soldiers,” Metzger shouted at him in parliament, the Times of Israelreported. He ordered security to remove her, saying: “We paid [a price] too. Let’s not have a competition.”Nor did criticism come only from the left, or the families most directly traumatised by the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that began the war.Retired Maj Gen Amos Yadlin, former head of Israel’s military intelligence directorate, said that restarting the war while hostages were still in Gaza would undermine the military’s effectiveness in operations there and damage morale.“A responsible Israeli leader, who has no internal political consideration, would bring all the hostages back in one group, up front, [in return] for ending the war, and then will take care of the second goal of the war to dismantle Hamas,” he said in a briefing to journalists on Tuesday.“When Israeli reservists came [to serve] in October 2023, their main motivation was to bring back the hostages. Now someone has to convince them that the ground operation will bring back the hostages [alive], not bring them back dead. This is a tough job,” he added.Those cracks in morale have already started showing. The military announced on Tuesday it had dismissed a combat navigator from the reserves who said he would not report for duty in protest at the government’s conduct, the Haaretz newspaper reported. The air force said it was an isolated case, but some senior officials are concerned that others will follow suit.Netanyahu’sresistanceto a state commission of inquiry into failings on 7 October has added to anger inside Israel and fuelled critics who say he is managing the war for political rather than patriotic ends.The prime minister has always strongly rejected these accusations, arguing from the early days of the war that military pressure was the best way to bring hostages home – even though most of those who are back have returned in ceasefire deals – and that only the “total destruction” of Hamas would ensure Israel’s future security.His office blamed the militant group for the collapse in the ceasefire, saying it launched the strikes because the group “repeatedly” refused to release hostages, and rejected proposals from US envoy Steve Witkoff.The deal, always fragile and violated repeatedly by both parties, had slid into limbo this month after a deadline for the end of the first phase passed without any progress to a second phase.Netanyahu delayed starting negotiations on that second phase as scheduled in February, pushing instead to draw out the first stage. Yadlin said that had undermined Israel’s longer-term position.“I think Hamas would have broken [the] negotiations anyway, by a very, very tough position. But legitimacy is important, and if you sign an agreement you have to negotiate.”Regardless of motivation, the political dividends of restarting the war were clear almost immediately. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right party leader who quit his cabinet post in January over the ceasefire deal, announced his return to government within hours.He hailed the overnight attacks as “the right moral, ethical and justified step”, in a statement that suggested he expected them to be the start of a wider campaign. That was confirmed by foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who told visiting members of the US lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committeethat the overnight bombing was not part of a “one-day attack”.Evacuation orders issued for parts of Gaza suggested that Israel was preparing for a ground war, even if no decision has yet been made on sending troops in. Israel’s new chief of defence staff,Eyal Zamir, approved Gaza attack plans on his first dayin command earlier this month, Israeli media reported.The latest attack brought a chorus of condemnation from around the world, with close allies including the UK, the United Nations and humanitarian groups among those warning of the catastrophic consequences for over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.However, Saar said Washington was told about the strikes in advance and backed them. The US is Israel’s main supplier of weapons and its diplomatic protector in international forums such as the United Nations.Donald Trump has previously warned there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas didn’t release all the hostages. If he is onboard with a new phase of fighting, there may be little that Netanyahu’s domestic or international critics can do to quiet the guns.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

And I want to promise you – and them – this is only the beginning,” Netanyahu told viewers.Earlier, Israel’s defence minister raised the prospect of many weeks or even months of war inGaza.“Hamas must understand that the rules of the game have changed,” Israel Katz told reporters during a visit to an airbase, adding that “the gates of hell will open and it will face the full might of the IDF in the air, at sea and on land” if hostages were not freed.The Israeli army has issued evacuation orders covering the northernmost and eastern parts of Gaza, suggesting renewed ground attacks could be launched soon.View image in fullscreenA woman mourns next to the body of a person killed in Israeli airstrikes, at al-Maadani hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APPalestinian health authorities reported 404 deaths in the strikes, which Israeli military officials said targeted Hamas military commanders and political officials. More than 600 were reported injured. Air attacks and artillery fire were reported to be continuing across much of Gaza during the afternoon and into the evening.Aid officials in Gaza said hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were on the move to comply with the Israeli evacuation orders. “There is no resilience. People … are in a very weak state, physically and psychologically,” one aid official in Gaza told the Guardian.In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before carrying out the strikes.View image in fullscreenGrieving relatives mourn Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAttacks were reported in northern Gaza and in the central cities of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. One strike was reported to have killed 17 members of a family in Rafah. The dead included five children, their parents, and a man and his three children, medics at the hospital that received the bodies said.World leaders express outrage at Israel’s renewed bombing of Gaza civiliansRead moreWitnesses said patients lay on the floor of the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, some screaming, and a young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. At al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, survivors held rushed funeral rites for dozens of body bags lining the yard. Mothers sobbed over the bloodied bodies of children, as warplanes hummed in the sky. Doctors struggled to treat the flow of wounded.Casualties included senior Hamas officials, including the most senior political leader in Gaza and ministers, as well as many women and children, Palestinian officials said.Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said Israel had launched strikes after discovering Hamas was planning new raids to capture or kill Israeli civilians or soldiers and because Hamas had refused to release more of the 59 hostages held in Gaza, thus breaking the ceasefire agreement that came into effect in January.“Hamas could have chosen a different path. It could have chosen to release all the hostages but instead chose refusal, terror, and war,” Shoshani said in a statement.Netanyahu’s office said Hamas had rejected proposals from Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for an extension of the pause in hostilities.Hamas said hostage releases were due only during a scheduled second phase that Israel agreed in January but has since refused to discuss or implement.The first phase of the ceasefire agreed in January involved 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead Israelis returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Under the scheduled second phase of the ceasefire, there would have been a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of all hostages and a definitive end to hostilities. With the backing of the US, Israel has been pushing instead for thereturn of all remaining hostagesin exchange for further prisoner releases and a 30- to 60-day truce, in line with Witkoff’s proposal.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather possessions after an airstrike that hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEarlier this month, Israelblocked deliveries of aid from entering Gazaand cut off remaining electricity supplies in an effort to pressure Hamas.Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said the international community faced “a moral test”.“Either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,” Nunu said.The strikes come at a tense moment in Israeli domestic politics. Netanyahu said on Sunday he wouldfire Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, a controversial move that immediately prompted accusations of authoritarianism and plans for protests on Wednesday. Critics accuse Netanyahu of using war to reinforce the support of far-right allies for his coalition government and so maintain his own grip on power.Thousands of people took part in a protest in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night against Netanyahu’s plans to dismiss Bar, along with Gali Baharav-Miara, Israel’s attorney general, who is a fierce critic of the prime minister.Much of Gaza lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on 7 October 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages.The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins. Ninety per cent of houses are damaged or destroyed, and much of the population is displaced. Roads, hospitals, schools, sanitation systems and much else have been reduced to rubble.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But we find the lack of aid – it’s now been 15 days since aid got into Gaza – unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying.“We would urge Israel to get back to the amount of trucks we were seeing – way beyond 600 – so Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support that they need at this time.”Netanyahu is already facing the threat of arrest should he travel to the UK, with Lammy having previously said the British government would act on an arrest warrant issued last November by the international criminal court.Despite that arrest warrant, the government continues to sell some weapons to Israel, including engine parts for F-35 jets.Starmer’s backing for Israelhas caused upset among Labour MPs in the past, with many still upset about an interview he did in 2023 when he suggested the Israeli prime minister had the right to withhold power and water from Gaza.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyKeir StarmerForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The way [they] operate is to create this external threat and accuse those who raise their voices of being anti-democratic,” said Ora Peled Nakash, a former senior officer in Israel’s navy and an organiser of the protests.Groups representing Israeli hostages currently or formerly held byHamasin Gaza are also planning demonstrations this week, and issued statements calling for an immediate ceasefire deal.Ayelet Svatitzky, whose brother Nadav Popplewellwas killed in captivity in Gaza, said hostages still held by Hamas could be saved.Netanyahu will never accept peace. Where will his perpetual war lead next? | Simon TisdallRead more“They can still be brought home. And those who did not survive deserve to be returned and buried with dignity … We must return to the ceasefire and negotiations, and secure their release. A deal is the only way to bring them all back. Please, do not let other families suffer the same fate as mine,” Svatitzky said.The new wave of attacks in Gaza was launched amid acute political tensions in Israel.Netanyahu needs support from rightwing allies to win crucial votes in Israel’s parliament in coming days and weeks, or risk losing power. These allies have fiercely opposed a permanent end to hostilities in Gaza. The far-right former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, whoresignedin protest at the ceasefire agreed with Hamas by Netanyahu in January, rejoined the government on Tuesday.Netanyahu is also on trial for corruption and, if found guilty, could face prison. Also on Tuesday, a court approved Netanyahu’s request not to appear at a hearing “due to the renewal of the war”, Israeli media reported.The protests this week were planned when Netanyahuannounced a move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet since 2021, after an increasingly acrimonious dispute between the men over responsibility for the failures that allowed the surpriseHamasattack on 7 October 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza.Shin Bet recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the attack but also criticised Netanyahu, saying government policies were among its causes. The agency is currently investigating Netanyahu’s aides for potential national security offences, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly accepting payments from Qatar, which financially supported Hamas in Gaza for several years.Netanyahu has not accepted responsibility for any failures around the 2023 attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted, though he was prime minister at the time and has been in power for a total of 17 years. More than 48,900, mostly civilians, have died in Israel’s ensuing military offensive.Fifty-nine hostages are still in Gaza, of whom more than half are thought to be dead. Successive polls have shown Israelis overwhelmingly in favour of a ceasefire in Gaza to bring back the hostages still there, though support for a war until “total victory” over Hamas remains strong. Some relatives of hostages have backed the new strikes in Gaza.“The past weeks have proven … Hamas will never return all the hostages willingly. Only massive military pressure, a complete blockade including cutting off electricity and water, and occupation of territories that will lead to Hamas’s collapse, will cause them to beg for a ceasefire and a deal that will return all the hostages together, in one stage,” the Tikva Forum of Hostages’ Families said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasPalestinian territoriesGazaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Egypt, which also has a diplomatic relationship with Israel and helped mediate the truce, called the bombing a “flagrant violation” of the ceasefire that took effect in mid-January.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said Palestinians inGazawere being subjected to an “intolerable level of suffering”, while Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said resuming the war would fuel “hell on Earth”.The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “airstrikes and shelling, which killed hundreds, are horrifying. This nightmare must end immediately.”Türk added that the strikes would “add tragedy on to tragedy”, while calling for an immediate end to the violence, the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas militants and all those arbitrarily detained – a reference to Palestinian detainees held by Israel.“The last 18 months of violence have made abundantly clear that there is no military path out of this crisis,” he said, calling for a political settlement in line with international law. “Israel’s resort to yet more military force will only heap further misery upon a Palestinian population already suffering catastrophic conditions.”Separately, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory, Muhannad Hadi, described Israel’s renewed assault as “unconscionable”.While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is fightingallegations of war crimes and crimes against humanityat the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”. The Israeli government is separately disputingallegations of genocide.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Monday – before the strikes began – that Israel had committed “a breach of international law” by blocking aid into Gaza, in a significant hardening of the British position. “Israel quite rightly must defend its own security but we find the lack of aid … unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying,” he told parliament.On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the reported civilian casualties from the overnight Israeli strikes were “appalling”. “We want to see this ceasefire agreement re-established as soon as possible,” they added.The EU’s aid commissioner, Hadja Lahbib, said the “renewed escalation in Gaza is devastating. Civilians have endured unimaginable suffering. This must stop.”Reuters cited two security sources in Egypt as saying that Egyptian mediators were surprised by the overnight airstrikes as negotiations a day earlier had been calm and they had not been notified. Mediators were now engaged in intense contacts to salvage the ceasefire and return to talks, they said.0:55Deaths reported in Gaza as Israeli military resumes strikes – videoQatar and Saudi Arabia – two powerful gulf monarchies in the region – both condemned Israel for the strikes.Fearing ethnic cleansing under the Israeli-backed plan by Donald Trump, the US president, to forcibly expel the remaining Palestinians from the ruins of Gaza, Arab nations have proposedan alternative plan to rebuild it. However, they have no way to enforce such a scheme on the occupied territory without Israeli agreement.Turkey, a staunch supporter of Palestine and Hamas, described Israel’s attacks on Gaza as a “new phase in its policy of genocide” against Palestinians.A spokesperson for the European Commission said the EU deplored the restart of hostilities in Gaza. “We want Hamas to release all its hostages and we ask Israel to show restraint and to re-establish free humanitarian access to Gaza,” said the spokesperson, adding that negotiations were the only way to find a solution.The head of the European Council, António Costa, said he was shocked and saddened by the news from Gaza: “Violence must stop and the terms of the ceasefire agreement must be respected. All hostages and detainees must be released, and humanitarian aid must be resumed immediately,” he wrote on X.France said it condemned the Israeli strikes, which it said were “jeopardising efforts to free the hostages and threatening the lives of the civilian population in Gaza”. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, also said on Tuesday that the deadly new series of Israeli airstrikes threatened a permanent end to hostility.Germany, one of Israel’s closest allies in Europe, said it felt a “great concern” after the strikes on Monday night. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: “The images of burning tents in refugee camps are shocking. Fleeing children and internally displaced persons must never be used as leverage in negotiations.”Israel, which consulted the US in advance of the action, said the strikes were targeted at mid-level Hamas commanders, officials and infrastructure.A former French ambassador to the US and Israel, Gérard Araud, said that what was happening in Gaza should incite “horror, indignation and condemnation”.In posts on social media, the French diplomat said the operation launched by Israel did not respond to any identifiable military objective “other than to inflict suffering on the civilian population until Hamas capitulates, which it will not”.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Just before 2.30am local time, Israel launched airstrikes on dozens of targets across Gaza. War planes hit sites across the territory, from Gaza City in the north to Khan Younis in the south. At least 330 people have been reported dead so far, Gaza’s health ministry said, and Benjamin Netanyahu’s office appeared to suggest that the two-month-old ceasefire is now over: “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” it said.You can follow the latest hereat the Guardian’s live blog. Today’s newsletter explains what’s happened overnight, and why. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesUK politics| Keir Starmerwill unveil drastic cuts to disability benefits on Tuesday, despite deep opposition from Labour MPs and poverty campaigners, and warnings from economists against making kneejerk savings to hit fiscal targets. The changes are expected to affect some of the UK’s most severely disabled people.UK news| Lucy Letby has called for thepublic inquiry into her crimes to be halted, arguing there is now “overwhelming and compelling” evidence undermining her baby murder convictions. Lawyers for the former nurse took the extraordinary step of writing to Lady Justice Thirlwall on Monday to say that the inquiry – due to end on Wednesday – should be suspended immediately.Space| Two Nasa astronauts “stranded” aboard the International Space Station (ISS) since last summerwere finally on their way back to Earth on a SpaceX vessel on Tuesday, more than nine months after the failure of Boeing’s pioneering Starliner capsule scuppered their originally scheduled week-long mission.Finance| The hedge fund manager Crispin Odeywill be bannedfrom the City and hit with a £1.8m fine by the UK’s financial watchdog for deliberately attempting to “frustrate” a disciplinary process into sexual harassment allegations.Second world war| The last surviving Battle of Britain pilot, John “Paddy” Hemingway,has died aged 105. The Royal Air Force (RAF) said Hemingway, a member of “the Few” who took to the skies during the second world war, died peacefully on Monday.In depth: ‘They unleashed the fire of hell again on Gaza’View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman at the site of an Israeli strike on a tent camp in Khan Younis.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersSince the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired in early February, many Palestinians have been braced for a return to war at any time. Instead of moving on to a planned second phase,Israelcut off aid shipments into the territory and pressed Hamas to accept a plan that would extend the first phase and bring the release of more hostages, a move Hamas was unwilling to take without steps towards the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.Two days ago, talks in Doha failed again to reach an agreement. One key question now is whether the airstrikes unleashed overnight herald a full-scale return to hostilities, with Israeli ground troops operating inGazaagain and Hamas responding, or are an attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu to force Hamas to accept Israel’s terms – but the very hostile language from Israel suggests that the latter is now unlikely.Here’s what else we know.What kind of damage has been done?The first explosions were heard in north-west Gaza, as many ate their pre-dawn meals during the holy month of Ramadan. The airstrikes hit Gaza City in the north, Deir al-Balah in the centre, and Khan Younis and Rafah in the south. Israel said that it had hit “terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation”.Witnesses and photographs taken at Gaza’s hospitals suggested that many civilians, including children, were among the dead, with piles of bodies stacked up under white plastic sheets. AFP quoted Ramez Alammarin, 25, who described carrying children to a hospital near Gaza City. “They unleashed the fire of hell again on Gaza,” he said. “Bodies and limbs are on the ground, and the wounded cannot find any doctor to treat them. They bombed a building in the area and there are still martyrs and wounded under the rubble … fear and terror. Death is better than life.”The European hospital in Rafah said that 17 members of one family, including 12 women and children, were killed there. Mahmoud Abu Wafah, Gaza’s deputy interior minister and the highest-ranking Hamas security official in the territory, was reported to be among the dead.The toll, recently reported at 330, is likely to rise, since it does not include all those taken to smaller health centres or those yet to be found by rescuers.Is the ceasefire over?By one very clear measure, yes: while Israel has carried out some drone strikes against suspected militants in recent weeks, the overnight airstrikes are on an entirely different scale.The statement from Benjamin Netanyahu’s office referring to plans to act with “increasing military strength” also appears to point in a clear direction. And the White House, which was consulted before the new attack, said: “Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”Hamas, meanwhile, accused Israel of treachery for overturning the ceasefire, and said that Netanyahu is using the war as a “lifeboat” to ensure his own political survival amid domestic crises. But it has not yet said specifically that it is resuming the war. One official, Taher Nunu, said: “The international community faces a moral test: either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza.”There is also a question about whether the airstrikes are a prequel to a return of Israeli ground forces. The Associated Press quoted one Israeli official who said that there was a plan to expand the operation beyond air attacks.What does the attack mean for the hostages?Fewer than half of the 59 hostages left in Gaza are thought to still be alive. Some of those released so far have urged the Israeli government to press ahead with the ceasefire to ensure the return of those still being held in Gaza.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing families of the captives, this morning accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire, saying it “chose to give up on the hostages”.“We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” it said in a statement.The issue was expected to surface again today and tomorrow during demonstrations planned in response to the news thatNetanyahu wants to fireRonen Bar, the head of the internal security agency Shin Bet. Bar was a key player in negotiations to free the remaining hostages until he was replaced in that role last month, and one opposition leader in Israel, Yair Golan, this morning accused Netanyahu of ordering the renewed attacks to deflect attention from Bar’s planned removal.Netanyahu has sought to blame Hamas’ refusal to release the remaining hostages without moving to a second phase for the resumption of strikes in Gaza; Donald Trump recently said that unless Hamas immediately released all remaining hostages, “not a single Hamas member will be safe”. He also appeared to threaten civilians in Gaza.But Hamas has been reluctant to give up its sole remaining source of leverage without a move to the second phase of talks. It said last week that it was ready to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and the bodies of four others, but US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff rejected that offer and said that Hamas had privately made unrealistic demands.Now Hamas is threatening the last living hostages in captivity, saying: “Netanyahu’s decision to resume war is a decision to sacrifice the occupation’s prisoners and impose a death sentence on them.” If that happens, there would appear to be very little hope of an end to the war before Israel is satisfied that Hamas has been completely eliminated – and before many more Palestinian civilians are killed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Namely:how is this different from life under the Tories?Kendall tried to accentuate the positive.Labourwould fix the mess of a social security system it had inherited from the Conservatives, getting rid of perverse benefit incentives and toxic fit-for-work tests, and bring in more safeguards for vulnerable claimants. There would be increases to the basic rate of universal credit.Unlike a year ago, whenRishi Sunak announcedthe Tories’ own proposals to cut the soaring disability benefits bill, Kendall was careful not to invoke culture war stereotypes. There was no suggestion that this was all the fault of snowflakes and benefit scroungers, or of mental health culture “going too far”.Had reform of a system everyone knew was not working been the extent of the changes made by Labour, you suspect all would have gone well. Overshadowing it all, however, was Kendall’s confirmation of the bad news: a £5bn-a-year reduction in disability benefit spending by the end of the decade.This shattering cut was just a single line in Kendall’s speech, crowded out by earnest promises to rescue disabled claimants from the benefits trap. But it will have big repercussions: financial ones for many claimants and political ones for ministers. We knew it was coming but it was a shock anyway. A Labour government, really?Within minutes of Kendall sitting down, campaigners and backbenchers were delivering their verdict. Scope said Labour had just proposed the “biggest cuts to disability benefit on record” – dispiritingly, more severe than the ex-Tory chancellor George Osborne had attempted at the height of austerity.Kendall’s challenge had been to square the circle between Labour’s competing ambitions: delivering social justice and tackling poverty on the one hand, and sticking to self-imposed fiscal restraints on the other. For all the talk of moral missions and unleashing claimant potential, it was not obvious she succeeded.Disability charities called the plans “immoral and devastating”. The mental health charity Mind said they would exacerbate the mental health crisis. Child Poverty Action group said the reforms would undermine Labour’s child poverty strategy. Foodbanks said it would undermine Labour’s manifesto promises to cut food bank use.Politically, it felt like a re-run of the corrosive internal Labour rows over the refusal to abolish the two-child benefit cap, or the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment. If campaigners had been relatively restrained in their criticism of government up to now – Labour had to be better than the last lot – it felt that accord was unravelling.For some of the UK’s poorest citizens this will be the kind of brutal cut to incomes Labour has spent the last 14 years denouncing in opposition. Although existing claimants will be partly protected, between 800,000 and 1.2 million people on personal independence payments would lose support of between £4,200 and £6,300 a year by 2029-30, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank.The £3-a-week rise in the standard rate of universal credit was largely welcomed. It is hardly generous given that the pandemic uplift to universal credit was £20 a week but it at least recognised that much of the increase in disability claims in recent years has been from people unable to survive on the meagre level of general benefits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you are ill and disabled and under 22 you won’t be able to claim incapacity benefit at all. “The irony,” said Resolution’s Louise Murphy, “is that the main beneficiaries [of the plans] are those without health problems or a disability”.It is not all bad news. The system reforms – redesigning the way people claim benefits and move on and off benefits, such as the “right to try” guarantee enabling claimants to test returning work without fear of losing benefits – shows a government that understands that poor benefit design is a bug not a feature.How is this different from life under the Tories? The shadow welfare secretary, Helen Whately, was on hand to remind us that bleakness is relative. Why would you only reduce spending by a mere £5bn, she asked. “The fact is, £5bn just doesn’t cut it.” Things may be bad but under the last lot they could be a lot, lot worse.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityLiz KendallLabourHouse of CommonsWelfareanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the social security system that we inherited from the Conservatives is failing the very people that it is supposed to help and is holding our country back.”In a sign of the growing pushback which ministers now face, Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, warned against “balancing the books on the backs of sick and disabled people”.Kendall’s changes amount to the biggest shake-up of Britain’s welfare system since universal credit was introduced over a decade ago, and come after years of unsuccessful attempts to bring down the numbers of people claiming long-term sickness benefits.Britain is unique among European countries in not having cut those numbers to pre-pandemic levels. Kendall told the Commons on Tuesday that spending on working-age sickness and disability benefits was up £20bn since the pandemic, and was forecast to rise by a further £18bn by the end of this parliament to £70bn a year.View image in fullscreenTerry Jermy, the Labour MP for South West Norfolk, said: ‘I really dispute this idea that it’s too easy to claim Pip.’Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianMuch of Kendall’s package of measures is aimed at reducing incentives to stay out of work. The work and pensions secretary is scrapping the system of giving higher incapacity payments for those unable to work than to those who can, in a bid to make sure as many people as possible are looking for work.There will also be a new “right to work” scheme for those on incapacity benefits so they can try to return to work without risking losing their entitlements.People under the age of 22 wanting the health top-up to universal credit will no longer qualify under plans being consulted on, with the savings being reinvested in work and training schemes to help get them into the workplace.But the most financially significant decision is Kendall’s plan to introduce drastically tighter limits for who can claim personal independence payments (Pips), which are intended to help people with their quality of life and are not connected to employment. The Pip savings will help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stick to her fiscal rules when she announces her spring statement next week.Under the new system, people who cannot cook a simple meal for themselves but can heat food up in a microwave would not be eligible for the payments unless they have other needs to be taken into account. Needing assistance to wash their hair or their body below the waist would also be judged as insufficient to claim the payments, which are currently worth up to £185 a week.Ministers will not lay out where exactly the £5bn savings are coming from until next week, though officials indicated most would come from reduced Pip spending. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the plan would see between 800,000 and 1.2 million people losing support of between £4,200 and £6,300 a year by 2029-30.Louise Murphy, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Around 1 million people are potentially at risk of losing support from tighter restrictions on Pip, while young people and those who fall ill in the future will lose support from a huge scaling back of incapacity benefits.“While it includes some sensible reforms, too many of the proposals have been driven by the need for short-term savings to meet fiscal rules, rather than long-term reform. The result risks being a major income shock for millions of low-income households.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These reforms will only serve to deepen the nation’s mental health crisis.”Anela Anwar, a member of the End ChildPovertycoalition, said: “The proposed cuts … would deepen child poverty and call into question the government’s commitment to reduce this.“At a time when the government is developing a strategy to reduce child poverty – it is shocking that it is also proposing to make significant cuts to family incomes.”Quick GuideWhat mental health and benefits support is available?ShowMental health support• Mind runs a support line on 0300 102 1234 as a safe and confidential place to talk openly.

The potential rebels include several who were first elected last year who have so far remained overwhelmingly loyal to the government.Neil Duncan-Jordan, the newly elected MP for Poole, said: “There is a genuine concern that tightening the eligibility criteria for Pip will plunge more disabled people into poverty.Benefitsare already far from generous, so this is going to feel particularly cruel.”Terry Jermy,who beat Liz Trussin South West Norfolk last year, did not say how he intended to vote, but said: “I am disappointed that there are things in there that will make more difficulties for disabled people, particularly in relation to Pip.”Jermy, who helped his father claim Pip for 10 years after he had a stroke, added: “I really dispute this idea that it’s too easy to claim Pip.”Another new Labour MP said: “I don’t blame Liz [Kendall] for any of this but the reality is this will make a considerable number of my constituents a lot poorer. And that’s not what we came here to do.”One of their colleagues added: “There is plenty I like about this package. I’m still not going to vote for it.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareDisabilityBenefitsLiz KendallMental healthUniversal creditPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

A call for evidence attracted 7,000 responses and a final report will make recommendations to ministers in the autumn.While broadly positive about current high academic standards and the “knowledge-rich” curriculum, the review, led by Prof Becky Francis, warned the system was “not working well for all”, particularly children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs.Phillipson said: “I welcome the important progress Becky Francis and her expert review are making to drive forward work to take the curriculum into the modern era and help deliver on the government’s plan for change.“That means keeping what’s working and evolving what’s not. The report is clear on the importance of primary school assessment, which [is] simply non-negotiable if we are going to keep pushing standards up for every child and close the attainment gap.”OnGCSEs, the review panel says it will now look at ways of reducing the overall volume of assessment in response to concerns about the stress caused and its impact on pupils’ wellbeing, without compromising the reliability of results.Students in England typically sit between 24 and 31 exams at the end of secondary school, which is comparable to Singapore but far in excess of most other high-performing countries.The report will also address concerns that the volume of content in GCSEs can lead to “teaching to the test”, but there will be no reduction in the number of subjects pupils study. The panel is concerned about maths and English GCSE resits, which frequently lead to repeated failures, and it is considering “other pathways”.Responding to the interim report, the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said the “soft bigotry of low expectations is back” and warned that qualifications would be “less rigorous and less credible”.On the Ebacc – a suite of highly academic GCSE subjects introduced in 2010 by Gove when he was education secretary as a key part of school performance measures – the review was concerned that it constrained student choice and limited their access to vocational and arts subjects.“The intention behind the Ebacc to improve access to a comprehensive, academic curriculum for all should be acknowledged, but as the review progresses, we will also consider whether this remains the most effective means of achieving this objective,” the report said.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: “NAHT are pleased that the negative impact of the Ebacc, the excessive volume of assessment from GCSEs, the ineffective resit policy and the need for a range of vocational and technical qualifications post 16 are all acknowledged and will be subject to further exploration.”He added however that school leaders would be disappointed by the lack of plans to reduce Sats tests for pupils.Explore more on these topicsCurriculumsSchoolsTeachingGCSEsSatsExamsnewsShareReuse this content"

And the worry is that this doesn’t do the right things to get people into work. It’s whether it could push people who are currently just about surviving into greater poverty or more need.”Sophie Morgan, a TV presenter and disability advocate, who is paraplegic, said she saw no justification for the cuts and said the “scapegoating of disabled people is not only toxic, it could be really fatal.Deep cuts, Pip and ‘right to try’ work: the key changes in UK benefits overhaulRead more“If history has taught us anything, these cuts will have the opposite effect of what the government seems to think they will have. It will push people out of work, it will cause more poverty,” she said.“I don’t think there’s a single disabled person in the UK who won’t be affected by this. But I think everyone should be worried – if the government can treat people with the highest needs in our community this way, what else could they possibly do? It’s a very worrying question.”She added: “There is this terrible misconception that disabled people just take, but actually by taking from us, you prevent us from being able to give – we want to be able to participate in life equally the same as anyone else, and that includes going to work.”The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, on Tuesday announced benefit changes including tightening the eligibility rules for personal independence payments (Pip) and reviewing the assessment process, as well as cuts to health-related universal credit.Charities and disability advocate groups criticised the approach, saying the changes would “drive more disabled people into poverty”.Mikey Erhardt, a campaigner atDisabilityRights UK, said: “After months of rumours, media speculation and spin, it is clear these reforms were not about supporting disabled people into work, but instead simply about making brutal and reckless cuts amounting to £5bn.“Rising claims for Pip reflect not a problem with disabled people but rather reflect successive governments’ failure to do even the bare minimum to create a more equitable society.”Paul Kissack, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “A government that came to office pledging to end the moral scar of food bank use clearly should not be taking steps that could leave disabled people at greater risk of needing to use one.”He said “enormous cuts” risked undermining some of the positive reforms announced by the government, such as the “right to try guarantee” to help people back into work.The disabled activist Dermot Devlin said he was almost in tears as he watched Kendall’s speech in the House of Commons on TV.“I had to turn it off because it was too much. The fact that they were putting it across as good news when in fact anyone who is disabled knows it’s anything but good news, it’s absolutely devastating for our community,” he said.“I don’t know if it will affect me, but we don’t know what the parameters are yet. It might not affect me now but it could next year. I’m just a bit lost for words.”Devlin, who has mucopolysaccharidosis type IV, also known as morquio syndrome, said he relied on Pip to help him cover the costs of the powered vehicle he uses to get around, and the mask he wears to help with his breathing while he sleeps.“Public opinion is getting nasty towards disabled people. But Pip is needed for survival,” he said. “You take Pip away and it’s just going to push so many disabled people, including myself, deeper and deeper into poverty.“I’ve never felt more pushed away from being a member of society.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareDisabilityBenefitsTanni Grey-ThompsonPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

A key part of the role involves protecting and conserving the Town Moor – 1,000 acres of green space and an area bigger than New York’s Central Park on which the Freemen sublet grazing land to farmers with the proceeds going to charity.During his initiation ceremony, during which he will be presented with a scroll, Howe must hold a musket and bible and sign an oath. He will also need to present the city’s mayor with a silver coin, minted before 1910.Given that Newcastle United’s Saudi Arabian owners are contemplating building a new stadium on Leazes Park, a part of the Town Moor, close to St James’ Park, Howe could soon find himself experiencing a conflict of interests. He will be invited to attend quarterly meetings of the the Town Moor joint working group.In the 1990s assorted pressure groups strongly opposed the club’s previous, ultimately shelved, plan to construct a new ground on Leazes Park.View image in fullscreenCouncillor Karen Kilgour says ‘what Eddie [Howe] has achieved is nothing short of extraordinary’.Photograph: Steve Brock/PAAs guardians of Newcastle’s green spaces, the Freemen – some hereditary and others, such as Howe, honorary after performing the “highest service” for Newcastle – remain an influential, if slightly mysterious body, proud of their medieval heritage. These days they are no longer expected to carry arms but change has come slowly. It was not until 2009 that women were granted the right to “freelage”, an honour previously restricted to male heirs of Freemen.In April 2010 the first 10 hereditary female “Freemen” were sworn in. They included professor Ruth Plummer, director of the Sir Bobby Robson cancer trials research centre at Newcastle’s Freeman hospital.Other honorary Freemen of Newcastle have included Nelson Mandela, who was honoured for his “services to the cause of freedom” at a time when he was in prison in South Africa.Dan Burn, the Blyth-born scorer of Newcastle’s first goal in the 2-1 win against Liverpool, has been nominated to receive the freedom of Northumberland.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

Detectives are working with prosecutors and state social workers “to determine what charges he may face and whether he can be held on those charges”, according to the statement.The 13-year-old was expected to be booked into juvenile detention. The statement said detectives were searching for the other boys.Scott Dwight Habermehl, 63, was riding to his job at Sandia National Laboratories early in the morning last May when he was hit by a car that swerved into the bike lane, according to police.The crash was recorded from inside the car and circulated on social media. In the recording, a voice believed to be the 13-year-old can be heard saying he is about to hit the bicyclist, according to law enforcement. The car appears to accelerate and a voice believed to be the 15-year-old’s says: “Just bump him, bruh.”The driver asks: “Like bump him?”A passenger says: “Yeah, just bump him. Go like … 15 … 20.”Loud sounds can then be heard in the recording, including “metal flexing”, according to law enforcement.A middle school principal was among those reporting the video to police after a student flagged it.The Associated Press doesn’t typically name people under 18 accused of a crime.Asimilar caseinvolving teenage boys who allegedly recorded themselves planning to hit a bicyclist who ended up dying happened inLas Vegasin 2023.Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Because I have a voice, and he is afraid of what I’ll tell the American people,” she said.She also expresses her concerns that Trump’s removal of “opposition voices” in the FTC will prevent his administration from being held accountable for its actions.“The administration clearly fears the accountability that opposition voices would provide if the president orders Chairman Ferguson to treat the most powerful corporations and their executives – like those that flanked the President at his inauguration – with kid gloves,” the statement continues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both are set to close, amid widespread cuts at the agency.Workers inside the two offices told the Guardian these cuts would undermine the ongoing goals of manned missions to the moon and Mars – and raise questions over conflicts of interest for Musk, who remains CEO of SpaceX, the rocket and satellite giant, while leading the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has led the charge to cut back the federal government underDonald Trump.Democrats train fire on Musk as unelected billionaire dips in popularityRead moreThe US president has nominated the billionaire Jared Isaacman, a SpaceXinvestorand close ally of Musk, to become Nasa’s next administrator.With a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, whicharrived at the International Space Station early on Sunday, due to fly a pair of US astronautsstuck there for more than nine monthshome on Tuesday, the cuts have fueled fears that Musk’s power over Nasa is on the rise.“Musk wants to go to Mars. They need no detractors,” said one senior Nasa official. “The most independent and unbiased views on this come from these offices, not centers or directorates who don’t care as long as there is money flowing in.”.Nasa announced last week it was shutting down the two offices.About 20 employees are affected by the cuts, with their last day scheduled for 10 April. Typically fired federal workers are provided 60 days’ notice, but Nasa says this was cut to 30 due to the “urgent need” to comply with an executive order signed by Trump.Nasa’s acting administrator, Janet Petro, was appointed by Trump in January. Soon after, PetronamedMichael Altenhofen, a longtime SpaceX employee, as senior adviser,further incitingconcerns about the conflicts of interest between the agency and Musk as SpaceX receives lucrative federal contracts.When Petro had dinner with Musk last year,she saidthe encounter was “one of the most fascinating conversations of my entire life”.The two shuttered offices are “extremely critical”, according to the senior official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Officials working for Trump and Musk are “hurting Nasa long term”, they said. “We’re all pissed off because we really care about this agency, and have spent years working in various parts of the agencies, at centers and other directorates, to bring that knowledge to [leaders in] the A-suite.”View image in fullscreenIn this image released by Nasa, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company’s Dragon spacecraft is launched on a mission to the International Space Station on Friday.Photograph: Aubrey Gemignani/Nasa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe “cruelty and callousness” of those executing the cuts “is just astounding”, the official added, claiming that fired employees had been blocked from consideration for realignment to different agencies and any associated awards and bonuses.Another terminated employee, at Nasa’s office of technology, policy and Strategy, argued that closing the offices was a shortsighted decision. “We’re missing out on the longer-term vision for moon to Mars exploration by cutting these offices, and probably increasing the costs of these missions dramatically, without this analysis and more strategic tech development,” they said.The cuts announced last week took the agency’s rank and file by surprise, according to the employee. “These offices brought a lot in terms of efficiency,” they said. “They had very low overhead[s] because they weren’t building anything. It was just the cost of a handful of employees that were making major impacts to cost savings by thinking about how to streamline tech investments, and from an overall strategic picture what science should be focusing on.”SpaceX is Nasa’s largest private contractor. The agencysaysit has spent more than $15bn on work undertaken by SpaceX over the years, and it keeps coming: In February, Nasa awarded the firm a contract ofup to $300mfor its Pandora mission launch, and a$100mcontract to launch its Near Earth Object surveyor mission.Critics have accused Nasa of preferential treatment towards Musk’s business empire. “Simultaneously awarding his private companies with billions of dollars in federal contracts raises grave questions as to whether you and your agencies are enabling corrupt favoritism to benefit Mr Musk,” the US senators Adam Schiff and Tammy Duckworth wrote to Nasa last month.Nasa has confirmed an employee affiliated with Doge has been embedded within the agency.“Given Doge’s destructive seizure of power throughout the federal government and the unique conflicts-of-interest that Elon Musk possesses with Nasa, Doge’s presence at the agency creates an unprecedented threat from within Nasa’s own house,” three members of Congresswroteto the agency in February.A spokesperson for Nasa said: “To optimize our workforce, and in compliance with an executive order, Nasa is beginning its phased approach to a reduction in force, known as a RIF. A small number of individuals received notification March 10 they are a part of Nasa’s RIF.”Nasa is working on a “broader reorganization plan”, the spokesperson added, as part of Trump’s blitz on the federal government.Explore more on these topicsNasaTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskSpaceXSpaceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Graphics byLucy SwanandPaul ScrutonTue 18 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 11.44 EDTShareProspects for the US economy have cooled significantly in a matter of months. After outperforming its international peers last year, warning lights are flashing on a dashboard of economic indicators as analysts warn that Donald Trump’s erratic approach is hitting the world’s largest economy.Fears of aUS recession this year are growing, in what is being called a “Trumpcession”, amida sharp decline in business and consumer confidenceas the president threatens punitive import tariffs on US allies and enemies alike.Most economists reckon a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output – can be avoided. But it is clear there are storm clouds gathering within the president’s first 100 days back in the White House.GDPUS growth in gross domestic product (GDP) had outpaced international peers in recent years, and since the Covid pandemic in particular – helped by the Biden administration pumping billions of dollars into the economy through theInflationReduction Act. The former president did not get much credit, though, as voters felt the squeeze from the period of high inflation triggered by the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.Chart on GDP per capitaThis week, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’sGDPNow, which measures GDP economic growth in real time, suggested the US economy would contract at an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter. However, this widely followed indicator can be volatile, and it is heavily influenced by the US trade deficit, which soared in January.Chart on GDPNowTrade balanceThe US goods trade gap surged to $153.3bn in January. This was driven by record import volumes, an increase of $36.2bn to $329.5bn in total, as US businesses rushed to bring shipments into the country to avoid potential tariffs.Chart on the balance of tradeUS gold importsA significant driver of the import rise was inbound shipments of “finished metal shapes”, which include bars of gold. The trend is also attributed to traders rushing to get ahead of potential US tariffs. A widening trade deficit would normally weigh on a country’s GDP, because imports are subtracted from the measurement. But because gold bought to sit in a vault is not consumed or used in production, it is excluded.Chart showing the US imports of gold barsThis means the Atlanta Fed is likely to be overestimating the hit to first-quarter GDP. Still, there are other signs that theUS economyis cooling.InflationTrump had promised to “bring prices down, starting on day one” and “cut energy costs in half within 12 months after taking office”.Official figures show the headline annual rate as measured by the consumer price index was 2.8% in February, after an unexpected rise to 3% in January from 2.9% in December. Energy costs are down by 0.2% on an annual basis.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)said on Mondaythat Trump’s trade wars risked stoking inflation. It increased its US inflation forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, up from a previous estimate of 2.1% made in December.Chart on US inflationEmploymentThe US jobs market has boomed in recent years, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% in early 2023, the lowest level since the year of the first moon landing in 1969. The rate has ticked higher in recent months, but remains historically low at 4.1%. This has been spurred by rapid growth in the numbers of jobs being added to the economy.Wage growth has also strengthened, and has remained above inflation since early 2023, helping households to rebuild some of their purchasing power lost during the recent rise in living costs.Chart on the monthly change in employeesStocksThe US stock market has powered to record highs in recent years. Tech stocks and the “magnificent seven” – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – have led the charge in particular, buoyed up by investors betting on the growth of artificial intelligence.The Biden administration oversaw a strong stock market performance, helped by the economic recovery from the pandemic. However, Wall Street surged after Trump’s election victory in November, amid investor expectations for tax cuts that could increase company profits. Markets have been rattled in Trump’s first 100 days amid concerns over his erratic approach to the economy and the threat of tariffs hitting growth and stoking inflation.Chart on US stock marketsThe US dollarThe US dollar had been rising sharply against other leading currencies, reflecting the strength of the economy and investor concerns that Trump’s policies could stoke inflation. Tariffs pushing up the price of imported goods, driving up inflation, could force the US Federal Reserve to hold back from cutting interest rates.With inflation having fallen back, the Fed cut its benchmark rate last year by a whole percentage point – from a range between 5.25% and 5% to between 4.25% and 4.5%. Higher inflation could limit its capacity for further rate cuts.A dramatically slowing economy could force the central bank to take action to lower borrowing costs. This has led to a pullback in the dollar in recent weeks.Washington has long held a “strong dollar” policy in the view that it supports the purchasing power of US consumers, helping to keep inflation low. The dollar is also used as the currency of choice for world trade and underpins the financial system. The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has said this approach is not changing. But Trump has argued that a weaker dollar would benefit US manufacturing by making exports cheaper for overseas buyers.Chart on the dollarPrices of inputs for manufactured productsBusiness surveys have shown a marked increase in input costs for US manufacturers, providing an early warning sign for growth and inflation. The price gauge on the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) shows raw material costs rose sharply at the start of this year, in the first signs of supplier difficulties and discussions about who will pay for tariffs. The rise in input costs could dent US manufacturing output, and is likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for finished goods.Chart on prices of inputs for manufactured productsConsumer spendingUS consumer spending unexpectedly dropped in January for the first time in almost two years, with a fall of 0.2%, the biggest decrease in nearly four years. Cold temperatures in some parts of the country, as well as wildfires in California, were likely to have hit spending. However, some analysts warn consumer sentiment has taken a knock amid mounting concern over the strength of the economy.Chart on US consumer spendingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyGlobal economyStock marketsGoldInflationInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has the backing of investors including the venture capital firms Sequoia, Thrive and Advent International.Following the acquisition, Wiz will retain its brand and operate independently ofGoogle, mirroring the way Microsoft operates LinkedIn, according to sources familiar with the deal.Wiz will also continue to work with, and be available across, all major cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.View image in fullscreenAssaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, in October 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettySundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said: “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers.”When Wiz rejected Alphabet’s $23bn offer, Assaf Rappaport, the startup’s chief executive, said he was “flattered” by the offer but wanted to focus on growth with an eye to floating on the stock market instead.“This is an exciting moment for our company, but an even more important one for customers and partners,” Rappaport said on Tuesday.Dan Ives, an analyst at the US broker and investment manager Wedbush, said: “Wiz has become a household name for chief information officers as the Israeli cybersecurity player has a strong cloud cybersecurity platform and customer base that is going after a $1trn market opportunity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wedbush estimated that Google could drive it to a $1bn-plus business over the coming years “given the company’s massive installed base and go-to-market strategy globally”.Alphabet’s previous biggest deal was its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012, which it sold two years later for $2.9bn.Three years ago Alphabet paid $5.4bn to acquire the cybersecurity company Mandiant, to bolster its Google Cloud product. Other deals include paying$1.65bn for YouTube in 2006, and buying the UK AI startupDeepMind for about £400m in 2014.Alphabet is keen to diversify its business away from its dependence on search-related advertising. The company hopes that Wiz will help it to increase its global market share of the cloud market from 12%, a distant third behind Microsoft Azure at 21% and Amazon Web Services, which has almost a third.Ives said: “While this deal is expected to see further regulatory scrutiny across the board, we view this as a strategic move by Google to further bolster its cloud security offering and value proposition to enterprises as the company doubles down on its cloud and AI initiatives moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsAlphabetGoogleMergers and acquisitionsTechnology sectorTechnology startupsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Wang, who is oftendescribed as China’s answer to the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, started the business as a battery maker in 1995, before starting car manufacturing in 2003.Charging speeds of 1,000 kW – or 1 megawatt (MW) – would be twice as fast as Tesla’s superchargers, which offer up to 500 kW. Fast-charging technology has been seen as key to increasing EV adoption.The news underlines the intense competition for the already struggling Tesla, whose stock has plunged following Musk’s championing of hard-right causes in Europe and the slashing of the US federal workforce as part of his work with the Trump administration.Besides missing sales targets, Tesla faces heightened investor pressure to produce autonomous vehicles, which Musk has promised but failed to deliver for about a decade. It is also facing increased competition with more affordable EV models, including those produced by BYD and other Chinese companies.Tesla’s share price slumped by 5.5% on Tuesday, adding to a 4.8% decline on Monday. Its valuation has fallen by 44% during 2025 so far, with investors worried about declining sales, and the possible hit to Tesla’s reputation from Musk’s close alignment with Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company did not specify the timeframe, nor say how much it would invest in building such facilities. To date, BYD owners have largely relied on other automakers’ charging facilities or public charging run by third-party operators.“In order to completely solve our users’ charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,” Wang said. “This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.”The new charging architecture will be initially available in two new EVs, the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV, priced from 270,000 yuan ($37,330).Tesla has offered its superchargers in China since 2014, and BYD’s smaller Chinese peers, such as Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng and Zeekr, have also been investing extensively and building charging facilities for years.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTeslaChinaAutomotive industryAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

So why are they putting on a fire sale?San Francisco have been in four of the last six NFC championships. But every NFL team must rebuild at some point for a future that could take a while to arriveDoug FarrarTue 18 Mar 2025 07.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 09.55 EDTShareAs unpalatable as it may be to fans, there are times whenNFLteams must rejig their roster to cast off contracts which could get in the way of future success. TheSan Francisco 49ers, whohave appeared in four of the last six NFC Championshipgames, and two of the last six Super Bowls, appear to be doing exactly that.While most other teams were trying to make themselves better in free agency when the league year began last week, the 49ers were having quite the fire sale. They had already traded receiver Deebo Samuel to the Washington Commanders for a future fifth-round pick, but that was just the beginning.In free agency, general manager John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan watched calmly as the following starters walked out the door: fullback Kyle Juszczyk, offensive guard Aaron Banks, edge-rusher Leonard Floyd, linebacker Dre Greenlaw, cornerback Charvarius Ward, and safety Talanoa Hufanga.Bengals to keep top Burrow targets Chase and Higgins on reported $276m extensionsRead moreThe team turned around and re-signed Juszczyk, a nine-time Pro Bowler, to an easily escapable two-year, $8m contract. But everyone else on the list was gone, and the team also lost important role-players like offensive tackle Jaylon Moore and defensive tackle Maliek Collins.The 49ers also traded running back Jordan Mason, who performed quite admirably during Christian McCaffrey’s absence through injury last season, to the Minnesota Vikings for a sixth-round draft pick in 2026.There were no incoming saviors, as the 49ers were spending very little in this free agency cycle – no surprise there. Former Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Luke Farrell, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson, and former New England Patriots quarterback bust Mac Jones were the primary names, and none of those guys project as franchise-definers.Why did this drastic remodel happen? Why did a team that finished 6-11 in 2024 after all those recent successes seem to throw 2025 in the tank too?First, there’s the fact that a lot of the castoffs were injured in 2024. Greenlaw played in just two games last season as he recovered from the torn achilles tendon he suffered in San Francisco’s Super Bowl LVIII loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Hufanga (who signed with the Denver Broncos alongside Greenlaw) was limited to seven games, and Ward played just 12 games last season, as he was affected not only by knee and hamstring injuries, but also bythe death of his one-year-old daughterAmani Joy last October. Ward understandably wanted a change of scenery, and both Greenlaw and Hufanga were going to get more money in the Mile High City. And Samuel’s highly physical style means 2021 is the only time he has played a full season.The Lynch/Shanahan duo has done this kind of thing before. The 49ers finished the 2020 season with a 6-10 record after putting a league-high 18 different players on injured reserve. In the 2021 free agency space, San Franciscojettisoned a ton of players, and outside of the six-year, $138m contract given to future Hall of Fame left tackle Trent Williams,there was little of starting consequencewhen it came to additions.A much healthier 49ers team finished 10-7 in 2021, and narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship game.There’s also the matter of Brock Purdy’s impending second contract. The quarterback, as you may have been reminded a few dozen times, was the last pick in the 2022 draft and has defied all expectations to become a solidNFLstarter. 2025 marks the final year of Purdy’s cheap rookie contract, and at some point in the near future, the 49ers will have to re-sign him at a rate that will probably exceed $35-40m per year overall, including guaranteed money that will affect the team’s salary cap greatly, no matter how it’s structured.In late February at the scouting combine, Lynch explained why the teardown was coming.“I think since Kyle and I have been here, we’ve certainly been a top-five … I believe, the No 2 cash-spending team,” Lynch said. “In the last four years going into the fifth year, I think we’re the fourth-highest cash-spending team. At some point, you have to reset a little bit, or at least recalibrate. You can’t just keep pressing the pedal. I think there is some good that can come out of it. We need to get younger.”This, by the way, was a response to a reporter’s question about the possibility of trading Brandon Aiyuk – the team’s best remaining wide receiver – who signed a four-year, $120m contract extension with $45m guaranteed just last year. Aiyuk also missed 10 games in 2024 with a torn ACL and MCL in his right knee.“That typically happens with really good players,” Lynch said regarding the Aiyuk situation. “I remember two years ago, having similar conversations. You get calls, and you always listen to calls.”The 49ers will unquestionably get younger, but will they get better as they did in 2021? Pushing all that cash out the window in the short termleaves the franchise with no room to move– they have $86m in dead cap money in 2025 and $21.5m in 2026.Next year isn’t that much more expansive, because it’s pretty expensive.Per OverTheCap.com, with those dead salary cap liabilities in 2026, the 49ers will have nearly $65m in available cash to spend – but remember, this is before whatever contract Purdy receives factors in. They’ll also have large salary cap liabilities with Williams at age 37, McCaffrey at age 29, Aiyuk at age 28, George Kittle at age 32, Fred Warner at age 29 and Nick Bosa at age 28. That’s not to say that any or all of those players will be gasping for air in a professional sense, but nobody’s getting any younger here.At least the Trey Lance albatross is out of the building, as well. In 2021, the 49ers traded their first-round picks in 2021, 2022, and 2023, and a 2022 third-round pick to the Miami Dolphins to move up from 12th to third in the draft so that they could select Lance, the North Dakota State quarterback. Lance did nothing of note for San Francisco, and after a short stint as Dak Prescott’s backup with the Dallas Cowboys, he is a free agent. The 49ers’ drafts in those three seasons from 2021 to 2023didn’t do a lot to reinforce the roster, which is in part why the franchise is where it is now.So, this may be a longer rebuild than either Lynch or Shanahan has experienced before, and both men have been running the team since 2017. Owners’ and fans’ patience is short in the NFL, and Lynch and Shanahan made mistakes along the way. This iteration of the 49ers is running out of road, and it’s time to build a new highway.Explore more on these topicsSan Francisco 49ersNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 163‑page complaint, filed in the US district court for the southern district of New York, lists 12 current and former players as plaintiffs, including Djokovic, Pospisil, Nick Kyrgios and Sorana Cirstea.Jack Draper emerging as a talent that can compete for the biggest prizesRead moreIt alleges that the governing bodies have systematically suppressed competition, manipulated prize‑money structures and imposed restrictive ranking systems that prevent players from seeking alternative earnings. The lawsuit also accuses the ITIA of violating player rights through invasive anti-doping and anti-corruption practices.In a statement announcing the lawsuit, the PTPA described the legal action as a necessary step after years of failed attempts to push for reform. “Following years of good-faith efforts to reform professional tennis, the PTPA has taken decisive legal action,” it said. “The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades.”The lawsuit, acopy of whichhas been obtained by the Guardian, argues that the governing bodies function as a “cartel”, enforcing a rigid economic system that keeps players’ earnings artificially low. It highlights an example from Indian Wells, where the billionaire tournament owner Larry Ellison was blocked from increasing prize money because of ATP and WTA regulations. The plaintiffs contend that this system prevents tournaments from competing for talent and forces players into unfair contracts.“Tennis is broken,” Ahmad Nassar, the PTPA executive director, said in a statement. “Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.”The ranking system is another major point of contention. Players earn ranking points only by competing in ATP- and WTA-sanctioned events, which the PTPA argues forces them into an unsustainable schedule of 45 weeks per year. Additionally, the governing bodies impose non-compete clauses and fines for players who participate in alternative tournaments.Beyond financial issues, the lawsuit also highlights concerns about player welfare. The PTPA claims that the governing bodies have disregarded player health by forcing athletes to compete in extreme heat and late at night,citing recent incidents at the Australian Openand US Open.The International Tennis Integrity Agency, which oversees the sport’s anti-doping and anti-corruption investigations, is accused of operating with little accountability, subjecting players to intrusive searches of their personal devices, repeated drug tests and lengthy interrogations without legal representation. The lawsuit suggests that these measures are used as a tool of control rather than genuine efforts to maintain integrity in the sport.Pospisil, a former Wimbledon doubles champion, emphasised that the lawsuit is not just about money but about fundamental fairness and dignity. “I’m one of the more fortunate players, and I’ve still had to sleep in my car when travelling to matches early in my career,” he said. “Imagine an NFL player being told he had to sleep in his car at an away game. It’s absurd. No other major sport treats its athletes this way.”The PTPA was founded in 2019 to represent players independently from the ATP and WTA, which also serve as the governing bodies for men’s and women’s professional tennis. The lawsuit alleges that the ATP has actively sought to suppress the PTPA, including by introducing rules that penalise players who affiliate with the organisation. One such rule change removes eligibility for pension benefits and player council participation for those aligned with “adverse organisations” such as the PTPA.Djokovic has been vocal about the need for a fairer system, arguing that players deserve a larger share of the sport’s multibillion-dollar revenue. “We need a system where players have a voice and can negotiate for their rights like athletes in other major sports,” he said in a recent interview.The lawsuit draws parallels to historic legal battles in other sports, including Major League Baseball’s reserve clause case and the National Basketball Association’s fight for free agency. If successful, it could force major structural changes in professional tennis, including the restructuring of revenue-sharing models and ranking systems. It could also pave the way for greater player autonomy, similar to what has been achieved in leagues like the NFL and NBA.A protracted legal battle is expected, with potential ramifications that could reshape the professional game.In a forceful statement, the ATP said: “While ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.“We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA’s claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position.“ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game – towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans.”The WTA echoed the ATP, saying: “The PTPA’s action is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course.The WTA is fully committed to continuing to develop and evolve the structure and operations of professional women’s tennis, listening closely as always to the views of our players.“Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole.”The ITF said : “We can confirm we have received a letter detailing the PTPA’s legal action and will take the appropriate time to consider our response.” The ITIA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsTennisNovak DjokovicUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trusty picked up what Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers called a “slight calf knock” before the Scottish side’s Old Firm match against Rangers on Sunday. The injury did not keep him out of training but did render him unavailable for the game itself. Robinson was not thought to be injured, having started and played all 90 minutes in Fulham’s 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend.The moves leave the US shorthanded in defense entering the tournament, with Robinson being the only regular left-back in the squad. In his absence, Marlon Fossey and Joe Scally are the only players who have consistently played outside back for the US, though Tim Weah has played there on occasion for Juventus. Trusty’s absence will be slightly less impactful, as Pochettino still has four recognized center-backs in the squad.MLS talking points: How Lionel Messi got revenge while Diego Luna got noticedRead moreMcGlynn has a chance to make his first appearance for the US outside a January camp, where he has received each of his three caps including two earlier this year. In a friendly against Venezuela that month, McGlynn scored a goal and added an assist. Arfsten and Gutiérrez each also impressed in that January camp, appearing in friendly wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. All are considered to be some of MLS’s most promising young American players.The US, who have won three consecutive Concacaf Nations League titles, play Panama on Thursday at Inglewood, California, then face Mexico or Canada on Sunday in the title game or third-place match.Explore more on these topicsUSAMLSNations LeagueUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Women’s tennis, in some ways, was built on the success of its child prodigies – Chris Evert, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters – who audaciously stormed towards the top in their youth, demanding attention.Those days are long gone. Between the improved depth, physicality and professionalism at the lower levels, possibly a more sparse talent pool and the WTA’s age eligibility rules restricting the number of tournaments a child can contest, it is increasingly more difficult to flit up the rankings so early.Jack Draper dismantles Holger Rune to claim Indian Wells titleRead moreFor those reasons, the first three months of the season have been fascinating.Mirra Andreeva continued to defy trendsand patterns on Sunday by winning the biggest title of her career at Indian Wells at 17 years old.It is difficult to overstate the significance of this achievement. A few weeks after winning her first WTA 1000 title in Dubai last month, Andreeva triumphed in California by outplaying andoutsmarting Iga Swiatekand Aryna Sabalenka, the two best players in the world, in consecutive three-set matches to win the title. She is now on a 12-match winning streak and has risen to No 6 with a bullet.Before Andreeva, two players under 18 had beaten the top two in a WTA event: Steffi Graf and Serena Williams. The other teenager in the top 100, meanwhile, is the 18-year-old Australian Maya Joint, at No 80.Despite her youth, it still feels like Andreeva has not missed any steps in her development and her recent form is right on schedule. Two years ago, Andreeva broke through, defeating two top 20 players en-route to the fourth round of the 2023 Madrid Open. Since then, she has rapidly risen up the rankings, reaching the French Open semi-finals and breaking into the top 20 last year. The obstacles she has faced and the tough lessons learned on her path have been just as important in her growth. She has endured plenty of difficult losses that sharpened her game and strengthened her character.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva has made significant offensive improvements as she grows into an adult.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APFrom the moment she emerged on the tour, it was clear Andreeva was blessed with a unique improvisational game. She possesses a large variety of shots, intelligent point construction and the ability to time the ball sweetly and redirect pace, particularly with her wicked two-handed backhand. Her game was sometimes underpowered against the top players, but as she continues to grow into an adult and gain physical strength, she has made significant offensive improvements. Her increased ball speed and weight of shot this year have allowed her to trade from the baseline with the best players as equals.That growth was particularly on show in the final stages of her title run. Against Swiatek, Andreeva was spectacular in horrendous windy conditions, overpowering the Pole from the baseline as she lasered down-the-line backhand winners from all parts of the court. The added pace on her first serve was astonishing; the 126mph ace she struck in the first-set tiebreak is one of the fastest women’s serves of all time. After trailing by a set against Sabalenka, Andreeva expertly soaked up the world No 1’s enormous strokes, again serving well and dragging the Belarusian into uncomfortable parts of the court with her drop shots and low slices. At such a young age, Andreeva’s game is already complete.The momentum Andreeva has built has much to do with her blossoming partnership with the 1994 Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martínez, who Andreeva has frequently bantered with during her on-court interviews. Aside from being a quality coach – she helpedGarbiñe Muguruza to a Wimbledon titlein 2017 – she seems an enjoyable person to work with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The next challenge for Andreeva and Jack Draper is simply to move on. The Miami Open main draw began on Tuesday with Naomi Osaka in action. While Emma Raducanu plays her first match against the 19-year-old Japanese wildcard Sayaka Ishii on Wednesday, Andreeva and the other seeded players have received a first-round bye.In the men’s draw, which will showcase Novak Djokovic’s return to Miami for the first time since 2019, Draper will begin his pursuit of the “Sunshine Double” against either Jakub Mensik or Roberto Bautista Agut in round two.The reality of being a top player and consistently making deep runs in the biggest events is that they have less time to reflect on those successes.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It comes with the territory for Mauricio Pochettino, what with his territory these days being the United States and the job of managing the men’s national team. For a World Cup. That the US will largely host next year. And yet Pochettino felt the dial turn a little further on the Friday before last when he watched a clip ofDonald Trump hosting Gianni Infantinoat the White House.“Can the US win?” Trump asked his presidential counterpart at Fifa. To which, for a man as obsequious as Infantino, there was only one reply. Pochettino smiles. “Gianni said yes, but I was disappointed with this answer,” he says. “He should say: ‘You need to ask your great coach, Pochettino.’ Because for sure, he can give a better opinion.”Gianni Infantino and Donald Trump have taken the 2026 World Cup for themselves | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreThe Argentinian has never liked people encroaching into his areas of expertise. It is a part of his self-belief. How would he have dealt with the question? Perhaps with a greater degree of expectation management because Pochettino knows the US are some way short of the elite. There remains work to do to develop the sport in the country.But Pochettino is nothing if not a romantic, someone to see the possibilities and afterwalking away from Chelseaat the end of last season, he found the stars aligning, seducing him. He remembered a line from Daniel Levy, his former chairman at Tottenham. “Daniel always told me that football was about timing,” Pochettino says, and this was perfect – a once in a lifetime opportunity opening up before him. He signed a one-campaign contractwith US Soccer in August. A return to club management could wait.The timing would be wrong for Pochettino with regard to the England job, which wasvacated by Gareth Southgateafter Euro 2024 and occupied at the time by Lee Carsley on an interim basis.Pochettino was linked to the positionand not only because John McDermott, with whom he worked productively at Spurs, was overseeing the appointment as the Football Association’s technical director.The way Pochettino tells it, he was “never involved” in the process that ended with the FA turning toThomas Tuchel in mid-October. “The decision [of the FA] to start the search for a coach was after we signed with the US,” Pochettino says.Would he have considered England? Pochettino’s instinctive reaction is to say yes because, well, that is just him. He normally wants to be in these kind of conversations. But as an Argentinian, he feels his nationality might have been a problem. “For sure, the history [between the nations] is there and that can be controversial … an Argentine guy defending the flag of England,” Pochettino says. “I love England. This is like my home now. But I was never put in that position so it’s not a situation we need to analyse.”View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino took the job to experience a different culture. He says the US was ‘always a mystery’ to him.Photograph: Kevin Kolczynski/APPochettino has checked in with the US at a seismic moment for the game in the country, the most exciting and potentially transformative since it hosted the 1994 World Cup, which led to the formation of Major League Soccer in 1996.Pochettino The 53-year-old says the US was “always a mystery” to him and was drawn to experiencing a different culture, taking in new things such as an NFL game, which he did when he watched the Los Angeles Rams at the SoFi Stadium. Also, to get his head around counterintuitive stuff such assome of his players having not played football until they were 12. The need to adapt is one of Pochettino’s buzz phrases.The bigger picture shows US Soccer primed to move all of its national teams into a purpose-built training centre in Atlanta in April 2026. According to Pochettino, that will be when people see “football is going to be a serious sport [in the US] because it has a home”.He adds: “When you go to the US now [for camps and matches], one time you go to Los Angeles, then it’s New York, Chicago, Miami, Orlando or St Louis. Where is the centre for football? If you look at the training centres of the NFL and baseball, you say: ‘Wow.’ With football, it is: ‘Where is the team going to train? We need to ask the colleges and universities.’“We have Lionel Messi in the MLS and he is helping a lot. But creating the new training centre in Atlanta is as important an impact as having a Messi. In five or 10 years, for sure the US can be No 1 in the world.”USA’s Tim Ream: ‘I don’t have many more of these camps left. I don’t take it for granted’Read morePochettino returns on several occasions to something that has been said for years – the potential for the game in the US is extraordinary. “For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host,” he says.“And then it’s a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win. The players know it’s going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it’s welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver.”Pochettino’s American employers seem more relaxed than his previous set at Chelsea.When he was hiredby Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali in the summer of 2023, the club were reeling from a 12th-placed Premier League finish and there were members of staff who feared they had further to fall.Pochettino would guide Chelsea to sixth and strong runs in the domestic cups, the form consistently good after Christmas. He helped to improve the performance of plenty of players while dealing with numerous injuries; impositions from above, too. Whose idea was it to recruit a specialist set-piece coach from outside Pochettino’s tightly knit circle?At various points during the season, he did not sound as if he was loving the job and from the outside looking in, it was possible to see it as a doomed professional relationship. To repeat: Pochettino demands control and authority in his areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We can be proud of the way we finished.”After eight seasons with Southampton, Spurs and Chelsea, Pochettino will always be connected to the Premier League. He has watched with interest as Pep Guardiola has struggled at Manchester City. There has been a bit of competitive tension between the pair in the past; Guardiola’s “Harry Kane team” comment about Pochettino’s Spurs went down very badly. But the respect has usually been there and never more so than now.“I am 100% convinced that Guardiola today is a much, much better coach,” Pochettino says. “It is difficult for him to be better but now he is because he is suffering things that sometimes [only] we suffered in the beginning. When you start your career as a coach it is not easy sometimes to find the right project. If before he was one of the best of the best, he is much, much better. He is a real manager now.”As for Spurs, where Pochettino managed for five and a half years, doing pretty much everything apart from winning a trophy, the love affair endures; the sense of unfinished business. “In the bottom of my heart, I still feel the same – I would like one day to come back,” he says. “Not because of my ego. It’s because my feeling is I would like one day to win with Tottenham.View image in fullscreenOne of Mauricio Pochettino’s high points at Tottenham was beating Ajax in the 2019 Champions League semi-final.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“We were so close and it was so painful. The problem was that this type of journey creates a lot of friction for different reasons and I made mistakes. But the good thing is when you are clever, you learn from them.“It’s like when a relationship finishes … I feel empty, I feel so disappointed. With everyone but also with myself because I didn’t manage well [enough]. Tottenham is now a club with an expectation to win. That is why I would like one day to come back. It’s six years since we left and it’s always going to be a special club for me.”What kind of host will Donald Trump be for the World Cup and Olympics?Read morePochettino is preoccupied with the adventure at hand; the journey, and that applies on a literal level, too. The travel is a big factor. “They still didn’t give me …come se dice? The green card,” he says, after being asked whether he enjoys celebrity status in the US. “The last time in Los Angeles we were waiting one hour and a half in the queue. I am not complaining but I cannot feel this status. I will feel it if one day they give me the green card.”The vast majority of Pochettino’s squad play for European clubs, most of them in the top leagues, but mitigating the distances to them, together with the relatively small number of contact hours, is prominent among the challenges. He says he is leaning on new technologies in his working strategy.Pochettino has won five of his six matches, losing to Mexico in Guadalajara, and has two in the Concacaf Nations League finals this week – against Panama on Thursday, then Mexico or Canada on Sunday, both in at SoFi Stadium. As always, he is pushing to create the right connections, the right energy. The pressure will only continue to rise. Pochettino relishes the heat.Explore more on these topicsMauricio PochettinoUSATottenham HotspurUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

You could just see ­looking around that people were tuned in and really want to buy into that.”Tuchel, who is preparing for the qualifying ties at Wembley against Albania on Friday and Latvia on ­Monday, made the point that there would be only 24 days of training before theWorld Cup. As such, it was even more important to ­create a spirit of “brother­hood” – one in which every­body pushed one another and, as Burn put it, no one was “afraid to speak up if something is not right or should change”.The Newcastle defender said: “For that initial meeting, it was more pro­bably about a mentality and how he wanted us to act around each other. He said he’d spoken to players from previous tournaments and from other countries about what the difference was between when they went out in early rounds and what happened when they won it. And a lot of it was about interactions.“In the NBA [Tuchel said], the best teams historically are normally the teams who are high-fiving each other, picking each other up and have a lot of those interactions. Knowing that we do a lot of that at Newcastle and speak about it, I think they can keep people switched on, give people little bits to keep motivation levels high. That’s something that we’ll probably look into and implement.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel has taken inspiration from the NBA in his early England team-building talks.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PABurn is living the dream, following up his England selection – which Tuchel told him about last Thursday night – with a goalscoring, man-of-the-match performance in theCarabao Cup final winagainst Liverpool on Sunday. Burn said he had sought to park the ­England news to focus on the final with Newcastle and he did something similar with the celebrations of his club’s first domestic trophy in 70 years as his attention turned to the internationals.Burn’s boyhood hero, the former Newcastle captain Alan Shearer, told him that he should simply retire now. “I said ‘I’ve gotEnglandtomorrow’,” Burn said. “It was getting a bit rowdy [at the Newcastle team hotel afterwards] and I was just ready to go to sleep!“Sunday hasn’t sunk in and I don’t think it will for a long time. I still feel pretty numb about it all. I really want to feel something but my focus is completely on what I can do here for England.“I’ve had so many messages. I’ve had the same phone number since I was 16 so I’ll probably have to change that at some point. It was stressing me out not replying to everyone so I sat for about two hours [on Monday night] just texting everyone back.”Burn’s story has been well told. The release by Newcastle when he was a boy, not being able to make local and county teams, playing youth football for Blyth Town and Blyth Spartans. He cut his teeth in the professional game at Darlington, for whom he played in League Two and the Conference. He was released by Fulham at 24. He became a Premier League regular at Brighton only in 2019-20.View image in fullscreen‘Sunday hasn’t sunk in’: Dan Burn headed to St George’s Park the day after Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/Shutterstock“I have been doubted a lot throughout my career,” the 32-year-old said. “Not many people who watched me play at Darlington would think I’d be sat here doing a press conference with England. I feel like I just really had this chip on my shoulder that I want to prove people wrong.“When you have been passed over for so many international breaks, you accept that the time has passed. But the new manager has taken that chance on me and I just want to grasp that opportunity. It’s similar to when I went to Newcastle [in January 2022]. I thought that opportunity had passed me by but I’ve managed to do that.”Tuchel had joked last Friday that Burn was very tall but easily overlooked. Did Burn smile at that? “Yeah, a little bit but it’s probably the story of my career,” he said. “Visually on the pitch, if I do make a mistake, I feel it is probably magnified just by how it looks. I was surprised how tall the gaffer was. I obviously remember him from Chelsea but I never noticed that!”Quick GuideEngland squadShowGoalkeepers:Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton), James Trafford (Burnley).Defenders:Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Levi Colwill (Chelsea), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Tino Livramento (Newcastle United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Kyle Walker (Milan, on loan from Manchester City).Midfielders:Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), Curtis Jones (Liverpool), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa).Forward:Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa, on loan from Manchester United), Dominic Solanke (Tottenham Hotspur).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tuchel oversaw training with his full squad on Tuesday afternoon, three under-21 players also joining in – Taylor Harwood-­Bellis, Adam Wharton and Liam Delap. Burn wants to go step-by-step, to get on for his first cap at some point but, ­having ended one decades-long trophy drought, he wondered whether the same could happen with England.“I see a lot of similarities between Newcastle and England in that respect. From speaking to him [Tuchel] last night, I’ve got confidence that everything will be done to try to finally bring the trophy home.”Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could have been worse for the hosts but for Maria-Luisa Grohs’s save to deny Lindsey Heaps from the penalty spot.Grohs was making her first start for Bayern since receiving a cancer diagnosis last November, and she dived low to her left to save Heaps’s effort just before half-time. The visitors had taken the lead in the 35th minute when Chawinga broke clear and fired into the far corner.Bayern threatened through Pernille Harder and Klara Bühl, while at the other end Grohs stuck out a leg to keep out a Kadidiatou Diani effort and saved again from Heaps.

A key part of the role involves protecting and conserving the Town Moor – 1,000 acres of green space and an area bigger than New York’s Central Park on which the Freemen sublet grazing land to farmers with the proceeds going to charity.During his initiation ceremony, during which he will be presented with a scroll, Howe must hold a musket and bible and sign an oath. He will also need to present the city’s mayor with a silver coin, minted before 1910.Given that Newcastle United’s Saudi Arabian owners are contemplating building a new stadium on Leazes Park, a part of the Town Moor, close to St James’ Park, Howe could soon find himself experiencing a conflict of interests. He will be invited to attend quarterly meetings of the the Town Moor joint working group.In the 1990s assorted pressure groups strongly opposed the club’s previous, ultimately shelved, plan to construct a new ground on Leazes Park.View image in fullscreenCouncillor Karen Kilgour says ‘what Eddie [Howe] has achieved is nothing short of extraordinary’.Photograph: Steve Brock/PAAs guardians of Newcastle’s green spaces, the Freemen – some hereditary and others, such as Howe, honorary after performing the “highest service” for Newcastle – remain an influential, if slightly mysterious body, proud of their medieval heritage. These days they are no longer expected to carry arms but change has come slowly. It was not until 2009 that women were granted the right to “freelage”, an honour previously restricted to male heirs of Freemen.In April 2010 the first 10 hereditary female “Freemen” were sworn in. They included professor Ruth Plummer, director of the Sir Bobby Robson cancer trials research centre at Newcastle’s Freeman hospital.Other honorary Freemen of Newcastle have included Nelson Mandela, who was honoured for his “services to the cause of freedom” at a time when he was in prison in South Africa.Dan Burn, the Blyth-born scorer of Newcastle’s first goal in the 2-1 win against Liverpool, has been nominated to receive the freedom of Northumberland.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

I thought: ‘Just get the blood off and keep going.’“I was arguing with the doctor for 30 seconds, saying I wanted to play. The doctor saw the injury, but I couldn’t see it. I couldn’t feel pain. The blood, for sure. But I thought it was a little cut. My ear was like this [dangling]. But it was not painful.”Although Michael Oliver sent off Roberts only after being advised to check the pitchside monitors, the goalkeeper subsequentlyreceived a six-match banfor the high kick, and was also subjected to online abuse.Mateta said he had no hard feelings against him, and that Roberts had contacted him after the game to apologise. “Liam contacted me and texted me while I was in hospital and I told him: ‘It is OK, it is football,’” Mateta said. “He apologised. He was worried.”“I don’t think he woke up and thought I want to cut the head of JP. There is a lot of pressure. He wanted to do good, too much emotion makes you do crazy things.

This led to an unprecedented wait while the video assistant referee, Timothy Wood, made three checks before the Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez’s first-half goal was disallowed for offside.SAOT ain’t slow: how does the World Cup’s AI-assisted offside system work?Read morePlans to introduce SAOT in thePremier Leagueafter the international break have been put back as a result. The FA has confirmed it will hold another trial in three of the FA Cup quarter-finals and continue to use it in the semi-finals and final. Preston have been drawn at home against Aston Villa in the quarter-finals and, as a Championship club, do not have the capacity to operate the system.Premier League sources indicated they would like to implement SAOT this season, but that would need the support of the clubs. The earliest it could be introduced is the weekend of 5-6 April, although some clubs are questioning whether a significant change should be brought in with eight games remaining.The clubs voted unanimously to introduce SAOT last April and it was scheduled to be brought in last October but in-stadiumtesting revealed problemswith its accuracy that were not resolved until last month.The Premier League’s chief football officer, Tony Scholes, admitted to having “severe doubts” over the viability of SAOT last month and a number of concerns remain. Given the controversy surrounding VAR there is some reluctance at the league to invite more criticism.It has been claimed that SAOT reduces the waiting time for decisions to 30 seconds because the lines are drawn automatically, so there was some embarrassment that one of the first trials should lead to the longest VAR check in English football.The FA had warned before the trial that marginal offside decisions in crowded goalmouths could prove too tight for the new technology to detect. Kerkez’s goal was initially awarded by referee Sam Barrott only to be ruled out following a series of checks. Firstly VAR Wood and assistant VAR Darren England, in the video room at Stockley Park, checked for handball by Kerkez. Despite the ball striking Kerkez’s arm they decided he had not handled deliberately. Then they checked for handball by Huijsen and again gave the all-clear. Wood and England then began a check for offside, but SAOT did not work, leading to the record stoppage. At Bournemouth, after the all-clear regarding a possible handball, an offside check began but SAOT did not work. As frustration mounted over the delay, home fans sang “It’s not football any more” and “This is embarrassing”, and Wolves supporters did not celebrate when the goal was disallowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I parked in front of our house, entered the yard and my wife greets me crying, shouting: ‘Petko, Petko, they announced on TV that you have died!’“I could not understand what she was telling me and what had happened. Then two of my friends called me. Being buried alive is quite stressful, really.” He also saw a lighter side, though. “When I heard the terrible news, I poured myself a small brandy,” he said.Arda’s players and those of their opponents, Levski Sofia, had stood by the centre circle with their heads bowed on Sunday, after being in receipt of erroneous information as to Ganchev’s mortal status.Club officials were made aware of their mistake and posted an apology on Facebook before the match had finished.“The management of PFC Arda would like to express a huge apology to the former Arda player Petko Ganchev and his relatives after the club received wrong information about his death,” the club wrote. “We wish Petko Ganchev many more years of good health and to enjoy the success of Arda.”Ganchev said Arda’s sporting director, Ivaylo Petkov, had phoned him to apologise, and he attempted to retain perspective on a situation he described as “not easy at all” to deal with.“So many people called me – relatives, friends, acquaintances and not so big acquaintances,” Ganchev said. “The situation was not pleasant, but in the end we have to be positive.“Look, sometimes such things happen. It is normal to spread a rumour here in the village, but they announced it in front of the whole football audience of Bulgaria.” The match ended 1-1.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballBulgarianewsShareReuse this content"

The Adelaide United midfieldercame out in 2021and said that despite his club’s and coaches’ support his openness about his sexuality had brought him a lot of pressure and negativity.“There’s multiple, multiple, multiple death threats that come my way daily still,” Cavallo’s said on Fifpro’s Footballers Unfiltered podcast. “In the world of football, being an openly gay player is a very toxic place. It’s something not everyone would be able to handle and go through.“We’re a very, very long way off acceptance in this space. So, these are factors that people will consider in their coming out and they might not be out now, but coming out brings all this attention, it brings all this pressure, brings all this negativity that will affect their game in the long run.”Cavallo has receivedhomophobic abuse from crowdswhen playing for Adelaide and been vocal about the problem on social media. “It’s difficult to say to people: ‘Absolutely, come out, be yourself,’” he said. “But it also comes with a mountain of downsides as well that I don’t think people realise.”Cavallo said having a support network around him had helped him “put up a wall” to protect him from abuse. He also said he wished he had come out earlier, rather than waited until he was 21, because he felt himself living a lie.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s no shame in losing to this PSG sideByGet French Football NewsEric DevinTue 18 Mar 2025 08.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 22.42 EDTSharePSG’s meetings withMarseillehave produced one-way traffic in recent years and, based on their encounter at the weekend, we’re likely to see more of the same in the near future. PSG’s 3-1 win at the Parc des Princes on Sunday night was their seventh straight victory against Marseille in the league. The dominance has been near total in the last decade; Marseille have only won one of their last 25 league matches against PSG.Despite sitting fairly comfortably in second place, spurred on by several flashy additions in the form of Amine Gouiri, Adrien Rabiot and Mason Greenwood, Roberto de Zerbi’s side were no match for their opponents. If anything, Marseille required several fine stops from their goalkeeper Geronímo Rullí to keep the margin between the teams respectable.Of course, critics will use this as a stick with which to beatLigue 1— if PSG can do this to the second-placed side in the league, especially after a challenging and tiring tie against Liverpool in the Champions League, what hope does the rest of the league have? After all, Marseille are now 19 points behind the leaders, who remain unbeaten after 26 matches. But does that really tell the story of the season? One could argue, in fact, that PSG’s strength is a rising tide that is lifting all boats.PSG needed to move away from the superstar era to progress in Europe while dominating domestically. When the team was built on a haphazard set of attacking stars, they would fall short in Europe when the chips were down. They were also vulnerable in France as well, liable to have an off-night in the Coupe de France or lose their way if they suffered an extended injury to a key player. But the current vintage is made of sterner stuff, even while the teams below them are going from strength to strength.The other French clubs in Europe this season have largely acquitted themselves well, showing just how good PSG have been. Lille finished in the top eight in the Champions League group and were narrowly beaten by Borussia Dortmund in the last 16;Monacobeat Barcelona in the group stage and will have regrets about their elimination by Benfica; and Brest, darlings of the competition, were only eliminated by the capital side themselves.View image in fullscreenLyon are still flying the flag for France in the Europa League.Photograph: Pauline FIGUET/SPP/REX/ShutterstockLyon have hardly put a foot wrong in their European sojourn. They thrashed Steaua Bucharest 7-1 on aggregate in the last 16 of the Europa League to set up a quarter-final against Manchester United, all while bringing along a deep cadre of young players and handling their domestic obligations impressively. The suspension of Paulo Fonseca may yet hold them back but, if their recent form is anything to go by, his lengthy ban seems to lit a proverbial fire under his players.With Marseille likely to replace Lens in Europe next season, ​a club with more resources will replace one operating on a shoestring (witness the sales of Elye Wahi, Kevin Danso and Brice Samba from last year’s impressive side). So, while critics will ​argue that PSG’s unbeaten run shows how weak Ligue 1 is, the truth is that, with competition for European places more closely fought, the quality of the teams ​c​hasing the leaders is also increasing.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowLigue 1 resultsLyon 4-2 Le HavreBrest 0-0 ReimsStrasbourg 2-1 ToulousePSG 3-1 MarseilleNantes 1-0 LilleAngers 0-2 MonacoLens 1-0 RennesNice 1-1 AuxerreWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsMika Biereth was hardly the splashiest signing in France in January. In terms of moving the news needle, the forward’s move from Sturm Graz to Monaco ranked below PSG signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Rennes splashing the cash on Thiago Almada or even Amine Gouri moving to Marseille, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore his form. He has scored 11 goals in just two months, helping to take Monaco up to third in the table.One reason why Lyon have come on so strongly in the second half of the season is Georges Mikautadze. The Georgia international – who was born in France and spent some of his youth at the Lyon academy – was one of the breakout players at the Euros last summer so much was expected of him when he joined Lyon for €20m, but his start to the season was middling at best. He failed to nail down a starting spot ahead of Alexandre Lacazette and was even left on the bench in some matches. Since the appointment of Paulo Fonseca, though, Mikautadze has sprung to life. He turned the match around for Lyon against Le Havre on Sunday, with two assists and a goal in 13 minutes. In the equivalent of just over full matches of playing time under Fonseca, Mikautadze has five goals and five assists. If Lacazette does depart this summer, Lyon’s attacking future is in good hands.Finally, Strasbourg could join the aforementioned teams in Europe next season. Despite missing the influential winger Dilane Bakwa and captain Habib Diarra, they extended their unbeaten run to six games with a 2-1 win over Toulouse on Sunday, withAndrey Santos scoring a stunning winner. Santos (and goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic) are likely to return to their parent club Chelsea next season, but Strasbourg have more than enough young talent on the pitch – and on the sidelines in the form of the excellent manager Liam Rosenior – to turn some heads next season in Europe.PosTeamPGDPts1PSG2648682Marseille2620493Monaco2619474Nice2619475Lyon2617456Lille2612447Strasbourg268438Lens262399Brest26-23710Toulouse2643411Auxerre26-23212Rennes26-22913Nantes26-142714Angers26-162715Reims26-142316St Etienne26-302317Le Havre26-292118Montpellier26-4015This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballMonacoMarseilleLyonStrasbourgParis Saint-GermainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I said I’d obviously love to come and join and train with the boys, so, yeah, found out Sunday late afternoon and I was just smiling from ear to ear.”Despite his initial snub, Gibbs-White has praised Tuchel’s approachsince taking over from Gareth Southgatein January. “He’s been incredible,” he said. “I think he’s done it with most of the players.

The incident was referred for a bunker review at the time but the punishment was not increased beyond the 10 minutes in the sin-bin.The Breakdown | My team of the Six Nations: from Lions in waiting to France’s new King LouisRead moreHe will, however, now face an independent disciplinary hearing on Thursday after being accused for striking an opponent with “any part of the arm, shoulder, head or knee”.The Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, was baffled by the decision not to send off Mauvaka midway through the first half of his side’s 35-16 defeat. France led 10-0 at the time but Scotland cut the deficit to 16-13 before half-time.Townsend said after the game: “It clearly was a non-tackle incident, it was after the whistle. So, if there was head contact and that was intentional, it shouldn’t be anything to do with the force that was involved.“I feel sorry for Ben White here, because he did nothing. He was first of all pushed to the ground, and a push is nothing in rugby, and then he got collided in the head, so I don’t know how it wasn’t raised to a red card.”Explore more on these topicsFrance rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Scotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He died duringSuper Bowlweek.Colbert was seen with Manzano hours before he died in a Kenner hotel room. She has already faced property crime charges related to the case.Reporter found dead had sedative in system also seized from suspect’s homeRead moreKeith Conley, the Kenner police chief, announced during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon that a male accomplice who they believe was “working hand in hand” with Colbert has also been arrested.A warrant for the alleged accomplice was issued and he was found in Hollywood,Florida, on Friday. He is currently facing the same initial charges as Colbert, but police could not confirm whether he could potentially also be facing murder charges.Kenner police previously told reporters that Colbert is a career criminal known for allegedly drugging victims and theft.An initialtoxicology screeningshowed that Manzano had a benzodiazepine in his body at the time of his death in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner on 5 February, four days before the Super Bowl. The drug had not been prescribed to either Manzano or Colbert.Dr Gerry Cvitanovich, the Jefferson parish coroner, said during the press conference that the preliminary autopsy findings have the cause of death listed as the “combined toxic effects” of Xanax and alcohol along with positional asphyxia, as Manzano was found face-down in a pillow.“Given the uncertain circumstances of this case, we feel that the most appropriate manner of death is ‘undetermined,’” Cvitanovich said. He emphasized that the current classification of death could change, and an undetermined classification would not “get in the way” of the prosecution.Previous victim of woman linked to death of journalist says he tried to warn publicRead moreAuthorities arrested Colbert on various criminal counts after they said surveillance video captured her entering Manzano’s hotel room with him the last time he was seen alive. Police also allege Colbert was caught with a credit card and cell phone belonging to the reporter just days after his death.Colbert was convicted of fraud and theft by a New Orleans jury last November. It was Colbert’s fifth felony conviction inLouisiana, according to court records.“There’s a lot of pieces to this puzzle, we understand that this is going to be a circumstantial case,” Conley said. “I feel very confident in our detectives and the other agencies involved.”Explore more on these topicsUS crimeLouisianaSuper Bowl LIXNew OrleansSuper BowlFloridaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

She averaged 28.5 points in two postseason games inthe new three-on-three basketball league, including 39 points in the semis.“Last year was hard, man,” Gray said after struggling with injuries. “It was rough. Even when I came back [during theWNBAseason], I still wasn’t 100%. I just put the work in. And then I talk after winning. I don’t talk before then. So I had a little chip on my shoulder.”Each player on the championship-winning club received $50,000 – part of Unrivaled’s goal of compensating its participants more than almost any other professional women’s sports league. Unrivaled, founded by Napheesa Collier and fellow WNBA star Breanna Stewart, has the highest average salary for players of any pro women’s sports league, with many earning six-figures in a season that lasts for just two months.Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 tournament was everything the NBA All-Star Game wants to beRead moreBrittney Sykes had 21 points for Rose on Monday and drew an and-1 on the last play of the game that set up her game-winning free throw.Unrivaled games are played with three seven-minute quarters and an untimed fourth. Teams play to a “winning score” determined by adding 11 points to the squad that is leading after three quarters.Monday’s target score was 62, and Sykes went to the line with the Rose leading 61-54. Gray finished with 18 points and eight assists. Azura Stevens added 19 points and 18 rebounds. Rhyne Howard led Vinyl with 22 points and six rebounds. Rose played the game without one of their best players. Angel Reese was sidelined for the playoffs because of a hand injury.Six teams of 36 of the best players in the WNBA played during the eight-week regular season. Unrivaled commissioner Micky Lawler said she was pleased with the league’s inaugural campaign. She said next season will likely continue with six teams, but expects the league could expand to other markets beyond Miami in the future. More than 20 players are already under contract for the next two seasons, according to Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell.“We’re going to look at areas of improvement that we could make within what we delivered this season,” Lawler said. “Starting a league is hard, and running it is also hard. And so we had to stay focused on delivering this, here, now. And then we can start to think beyond.”The league brought plenty of stars to Miami. Olympic gold medalist and WNBA champ A’ja Wilson, Miami Heat great Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union, tennis star Frances Tiafoe and broadcaster Robin Roberts were all in attendance to watch Monday’s final.Leading up to its launch, Unrivaled raised more than $35m from various sources and dozens of individual investors, including Stephen Curry, Dawn Staley, Geno Auriemma and Coco Gauff.Explore more on these topicsBasketballWNBAUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has the backing of investors including the venture capital firms Sequoia, Thrive and Advent International.Following the acquisition, Wiz will retain its brand and operate independently ofGoogle, mirroring the way Microsoft operates LinkedIn, according to sources familiar with the deal.Wiz will also continue to work with, and be available across, all major cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.View image in fullscreenAssaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, in October 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettySundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said: “Together, Google Cloud and Wiz will turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds. Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers.”When Wiz rejected Alphabet’s $23bn offer, Assaf Rappaport, the startup’s chief executive, said he was “flattered” by the offer but wanted to focus on growth with an eye to floating on the stock market instead.“This is an exciting moment for our company, but an even more important one for customers and partners,” Rappaport said on Tuesday.Dan Ives, an analyst at the US broker and investment manager Wedbush, said: “Wiz has become a household name for chief information officers as the Israeli cybersecurity player has a strong cloud cybersecurity platform and customer base that is going after a $1trn market opportunity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wedbush estimated that Google could drive it to a $1bn-plus business over the coming years “given the company’s massive installed base and go-to-market strategy globally”.Alphabet’s previous biggest deal was its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012, which it sold two years later for $2.9bn.Three years ago Alphabet paid $5.4bn to acquire the cybersecurity company Mandiant, to bolster its Google Cloud product. Other deals include paying$1.65bn for YouTube in 2006, and buying the UK AI startupDeepMind for about £400m in 2014.Alphabet is keen to diversify its business away from its dependence on search-related advertising. The company hopes that Wiz will help it to increase its global market share of the cloud market from 12%, a distant third behind Microsoft Azure at 21% and Amazon Web Services, which has almost a third.Ives said: “While this deal is expected to see further regulatory scrutiny across the board, we view this as a strategic move by Google to further bolster its cloud security offering and value proposition to enterprises as the company doubles down on its cloud and AI initiatives moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsAlphabetGoogleMergers and acquisitionsTechnology sectorTechnology startupsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

For the writing, the headlines, the quotes, the summaries. And, sometimes, even for the irony.” He added that journalists’ roles would be limited to “asking questions [into an AI tool] and reading the answers”.LA Times to display AI-generated political rating on opinion piecesRead moreThe experiment comes as news organisations around the world grapple with how AI should be deployed. Earlier this month, the Guardianreportedthat BBC News was to use AI to give the public more personalised content.The front page of the first edition of Il Foglio AI carries a story referring to the US president, Donald Trump, describing the “paradox of Italian Trumpians” and how they rail against “cancel culture” yet either turn a blind eye, or worse, “celebrate” when “their idol in the US behaves like the despot of a banana republic”.The front page also features a column headlined “Putin, the 10 betrayals”, with the article highlighting “20 years of broken promises, torn-up agreements and words betrayed” by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.In a rare upbeat story about the Italian economy, another article points to the latest report from Istat, the national statistics agency, on the redistribution of income, which shows the country “is changing, and not for the worse” with salary increases for about 750,000 workers being among the positive effects of income tax reforms.On page 2 is a story about “situationships” and how young Europeans are fleeing steady relationships.The articles were structured, straightforward and clear, with no obvious grammatical errors.However, none of the articles published in the news pages directly quote any human beings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was also a testing ground to show how AI could work “in practice”, he said, while seeing what the impact would be on producing a daily newspaper with the technology and the questions “we are forced to ask ourselves, not only from a journalistic nature”.“It is just another [Il] Foglio made with intelligence, don’t call it artificial,” Cerasa said.This article was amended on 18 March 2025.

Wang, who is oftendescribed as China’s answer to the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, started the business as a battery maker in 1995, before starting car manufacturing in 2003.Charging speeds of 1,000 kW – or 1 megawatt (MW) – would be twice as fast as Tesla’s superchargers, which offer up to 500 kW. Fast-charging technology has been seen as key to increasing EV adoption.The news underlines the intense competition for the already struggling Tesla, whose stock has plunged following Musk’s championing of hard-right causes in Europe and the slashing of the US federal workforce as part of his work with the Trump administration.Besides missing sales targets, Tesla faces heightened investor pressure to produce autonomous vehicles, which Musk has promised but failed to deliver for about a decade. It is also facing increased competition with more affordable EV models, including those produced by BYD and other Chinese companies.Tesla’s share price slumped by 5.5% on Tuesday, adding to a 4.8% decline on Monday. Its valuation has fallen by 44% during 2025 so far, with investors worried about declining sales, and the possible hit to Tesla’s reputation from Musk’s close alignment with Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company did not specify the timeframe, nor say how much it would invest in building such facilities. To date, BYD owners have largely relied on other automakers’ charging facilities or public charging run by third-party operators.“In order to completely solve our users’ charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,” Wang said. “This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.”The new charging architecture will be initially available in two new EVs, the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV, priced from 270,000 yuan ($37,330).Tesla has offered its superchargers in China since 2014, and BYD’s smaller Chinese peers, such as Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng and Zeekr, have also been investing extensively and building charging facilities for years.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTeslaChinaAutomotive industryAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They also urged the government to support the “moral and economic rights” of the creative community in music, dance, drama and opera.The 35 signatories of the statement include the chief executives of the Sadler’s Wells dance theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Leeds Playhouse.“We join with many in the creative community in expressing our concern about the government’s plans to diminish creative copyright by giving an exemption to AI companies,” said the statement. “Our community of highly skilled creative workers depend on a fragile ecosystem of freelance creatives, many of whom rely on copyright to sustain their practice, and most of whom have spent many decades honing their craft.”Why are creatives fighting UK government AI proposals on copyright?Read moreThe performing arts bosses added that they embraced advances in technology and were “participants” in innovation, but stated the government’s plans risked undermining their ability to participate in the development and deployment of AI.The statement asked ministers to assert a creative professional’s automatic right to their work, instead of pushing ahead with a proposal to give AI companies access to creative work unless the copyright holders opt out of the process. Critics of the opt out plan have described it as unfair and impractical.The performing arts bosses also asked that the government impose transparency duties on AI companies, detailing what copyrighted material was ingested into their models and how they acquired. The government has proposed transparency requirements in its copyright consultation.“The sheer wonderment of world-class music, drama, dance and opera is essential to the joy of being human. We urge the government to support the human creative endeavour at its heart,” said the performing arts leaders.The government proposals have met with a wave of criticism from leading figures in the UK’s creative industries, includingSir Paul McCartney,Kate BushandRichard Osman.Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools like the ChatGPT chatbot, are trained on a vast amount of data in order to generate their responses. The main source for this material is on the open web, which contains a vast array of data from the contents of Wikipedia to newspaper articles andonline book archives.A government spokesperson said the status quo in the relationship between AI and copyright was “holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential — and that cannot continue”. The government has said its new approach “protects the interests of both AI developers and rights holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive”.Explore more on these topicsArts policyArtificial intelligence (AI)DanceOperaTheatreClassical musicRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some threats enter our union in less than a second as an encrypted message, for instance, ordering an assassination of a rival drugdealer. Some threats enter in a few days, like a bus full of migrants, paid by the Russians.”At the launch of the report at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague, the Polish undersecretary of state for internal affairs, Maciej Duszczyk, said a recent cyber-attack on a hospital which interrupted medical care for several hours was linked to a state actor.He also said migrant-smuggling incidents on the border with Belarus were running to 150 to 170 a day and involved state actors working with criminal gangs in the Middle East and Turkey.Europol’s assessment of the threat posed by criminal gangs is conducted every four years.Poland’s police chief Marek Borón warned that, even if a peace deal is struck, the Russian invasion of Ukraine would have a lasting impact, with a potential “increase in the black market in weapons and ammunition and attempts by Russia criminal-speaking groups to exert influence”.On Monday,prosecutors in Lithuaniaattributed blame for an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last summer to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, which is also suspected of being behind fires in other supermarkets and shopping centres.In response, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the prosecutors had “confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services”.Two Ukrainian suspects have been arrested – one in Lithuania, the other in Poland – over the attack.Europol found that criminal networks “increasingly operate as proxies in service of hybrid threat actors” in a cooperation that has mutual benefits.This “shadow alliance” allows Russia to use criminal networks in an ad hoc fashion, “leveraging each other’s resources, expertise, and protection to achieve their objectives”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The looks you can achieve with a straightener have become more versatile as well: one twist of a modern, curved-edge straightener can create styles from ultra-smooth strands to structured ringlets and soft, beachy waves. There’s a wide range of styling possibilities with just one tool.I put a selection of 13hair straightenersto the test – from budget tools to premium models – and here’s what I found.At a glanceBest overall hair straighteners:GHD Platinum Plus£199 at GHDBest budget hair straighteners:Remington Shine Therapy S8500£29.99 at BootsBest cordless hair straighteners:Dyson Corrale£399.99 at BootsBest hair straighteners for long or thick hair:GHD Max£174 at John LewisBest premium hair straighteners:Cloud Nine New Original£219 at Look FantasticWhy you should trust meAs a longtime owner of naturally curly hair, my locks bear the scars of living through the poker-straight 2000s. Fortunately, I’ve been a beauty and lifestyle journalist for more than 10 years, which has allowed me to get my hands (and hair) on much better kit than I used to own as a curly haired student. While I often wear my curls with pride, it’s nice to switch things up now and again.How I testedView image in fullscreenFringe benefits … hair straighteners at the ready.Photograph: Lise SmithI tested 13 straighteners on clean, dry hair that started off in its usual curly pattern. In its natural state, my shoulder-length hair has a fairly tightType-3 curl(meaning you definitely wouldn’t mistake it for merely wavy). Before testing, I made sure my hair was clean and detangled, and I used the same heat-protection spray with each straightener to help reduce damage and hold the finished style. As my fine hair doesn’t get on well with higher temperatures, I used a medium heat setting where there was a choice.For each straightener, I noted the time taken from a curly standing start to a fully straightened head of hair, the overall ease of use, and how comfortable each tool felt in my hand in terms of weight and grip. After straightening I checked how my hair looked and felt, and then wore the style for a typical working day to test how well the styles lasted with each tool.Final ratings take into account the speed and ease of straightening, how my hair looked and felt afterwards and overall value for money considering the finished result – and how well this lasts through the day. Here are the eight best performers from my tests.If not returned to the manufacturer, the hair straighteners sourced for this article are being donated to the homelessness charityCrisisfor resale.The best hair straighteners in 2025View image in fullscreenThe GHD Platinum Plus halfway through the job.Photograph: Lise SmithBest overall hair straighteners:GHD Platinum PlusView image in fullscreen£199 at GHD£200.76 at John LewisThere’s a reason why GHD’s Platinum Plus straighteners are in their seventh year of supremacy in houses up and down the UK – provided straight hair is what you want, they’re unsurpassed as a styling tool.Why we love itWhen you take the Platinum Plus out of the box, the first thing you’ll notice is the sleek good looks: the floating ceramic plates are a stylish matt black, and the flowing curves of the design ooze sophistication. The Platinum Plus is not just a pretty tool, however – it heats up in seconds and styles hair from curly to straight in minutes.Beneath the shapely casing is GHD’s predictive heat technology, which measures and adjusts the temperature of the tool hundreds of times a second. This is so the plates won’t either overheat or cool down as you style and you won’t have to run them over the hair more than once. Straightening with the Platinum Plus was effortless, and the result was shiny, healthy-looking hair (with no toasted ends).It’s a shame that …the Platinum Plus comes in only two colours, matt black and matt white, although special editions pop up from time to time. It’s also rarely priced below £200, even in sales. Fine or damaged hair may prefer the cooler settings some straighteners offer.Heat settings:one (185C)Cord length: 2.7m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:302gBest budget hair straighteners:Remington Shine Therapy S8500View image in fullscreen£25.99 at Currys£29.99 at BootsIf you’re not in the market for a premium pair of straighteners, there are good options for significantly less than £100 that won’t break the bank or ruin your hair.Why we love itRemington’s slimline straighteners have ceramic-coated floating plates infused with natural oils for added shine; the ones I tested were infused with Moroccan argan oil, but there’s also acoconut version. The design is simple and sleek if a little unglamorous: two plates, two buttons and a gently glowing LCD screen that lets you know the temperature you’ve selected. There are nine temperature settings, from 150C to 230C. I found 180-190C worked perfectly on my fine-ish curly hair.The floating plates moved nicely over my hair without catching, and my hair looked shiny and healthy after straightening. The RRP is a quite reasonable £79.99 but you’ll often find these straighteners reduced to half that price, making Shine Therapy a bargain.It’s a shame that …Remington’s straighteners take a little longer to heat up than others we’ve tested – not a dealbreaker, but the wait was about twice as long as other straighteners in our test.Heat settings:nine (150 to 230C)Cord length: 2.5m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:one hourWeight:368gBest cordless hair straighteners:Dyson CorraleView image in fullscreen£399 at John Lewis£399.99 at BootsIt was initially a shock when Dyson – the company best known for vacuum cleaners and hand dryers – moved into the beauty market more than eight years ago, but its hair drying and styling tools have been runaway successes. The Corrale – Dyson’s cordless straightener – is no exception.Why we love itIt just works so well. The Corrale is named after the flexible manganese copper alloy plates that corral the hair through the tool smoothly and evenly for one-stroke straightening. The adjustable heat control lets you select from three temperatures, 165C, 185C and 210C, and an intelligent heat-control system keeps the temperature even throughout styling, so there’s little risk of scorching damage.A rechargeable lithium-ion battery makes the Corrale fully portable – the tool was originally designed with fashion shoots in mind, and it’s genuinely easy to use anywhere around the house or on the go. The size of the battery means the Corrale feels heavier and chunkier in the hand than some other straighteners, but not unpleasantly so; and the thicker plates grip the hair well for efficient styling without snagging. One battery charge lasted for 30 minutes, which was more than enough to fully straighten my medium-length hair.It’s a shame that …the Corrale charges only from its dock or proprietary cable, so unlike other cordless chargers you can’t charge it with whichever cable you have to hand.Heat settings:three (165C, 185C and 210C)Cord length: cordless, but charging cable is 3.8mAutomatic shut-off time:10 minutesWeight:561gBest hair straighteners for long or thick hair:GHD MaxView image in fullscreen£174 at GHD£174 at John LewisIf you have very long or thick hair you’ll find that standard-width straighteners take a long time to style your hair. With wide-plate straighteners, you can reduce that time and effort.Why we love itGHD’s Max are the best wider straighteners I tested. With its 1.65in styling plates, there’s almost twice the width of standard plates, meaning you can style much larger sections of hair – a godsend if your hair is long, thick or curly. The Max smoothed down my Type-3 curls in minutes.Wider plates mean faster styling, which not only helps you get on with your life but also means less time spent in contact with hair-damaging heat. Like all GHDs, the Max has the one 185C heat setting, which was enough to straighten my hair to a soft and shiny finish with just one pass.It’s a shame that …as it’s designed for long and thick hair, the GHD Max is a bit fiddly to use on shorter sections, such as a fringe or shorter layers. As with the other GHDs here, some hair types may prefer lower temperature settings.Heat settings:one (185C)Cord length: 2.7m swivel cordAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:830gskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

First launched in 2009, the Original straightener was relaunched last year with an updated model.Why we love itCloud Nine straighteners have two main differences from their GHD counterparts: the mineral sericite added to the heating plates, sealing moisture into the hair to leave it extra-soft and hydrated; and 11 heat settings, allowing you to select a suitable heat for your hair type and texture. It’s easy to choose a heat with the flat buttons on the handle, and there’s a handy quiz on the website to help you find the right temperature for your hair. The chic matt-black tool feels light in the hand with a nice balance.The Original also has a vibrating Revive mode unique to Cloud Nine, which reduces friction and drag on the hair to minimise damage as you style. The slight buzzing sensation was a little odd at first, but the vibrations seemed to help the straighteners glide over my hair to leave it soft and glossy.It’s a shame that …for an entry-level model (to a premium brand), the price tag is undeniably high – not much lower than GHD’s top-of-the-line Platinum Plus model. If you have very fine or thick hair, the multiple heat settings make the Original worth shelling out for.Heat settings:11 (100-200C)Cord length: 3mAutomatic shut-off time:30 minutesWeight:440gThe best of the restRevamp Liberate CompactView image in fullscreen£59.99 at Boots£59.99 at AmazonBest for:travelSmall but mighty, this compact straightener has three heat settings, keratin-infused plates for extra conditioning and ionic technology for a glossy finish – that’s a lot of features to pack into a dinky package. It’s hard to say how much difference they make, but I can say from extensive testing that the results feel good, leaving my hair feeling soft and hydrated. The battery takes three hours to charge and lasts for about 30 minutes, enough to fully straighten my hair in one go.The Liberate Compact also comes with a carry bag, a travel adaptor plug and a flight-safe lock, making it an excellent choice for travel. It’s also great to keep handy in a desk drawer for quick hair fixes between work and evenings out.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s ideal for travel and suitable for infrequent home use, but not beefy enough to replace my favourite straighteners day to day.Heat settings:three (160C, 180C and 210C);cord length: cordless;automatic shut-off time:30 minutes;weight:243gNicky Clarke Frizz ControlView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Tesco£39.99 at AmazonBest for:taming frizzy hairIf you don’t mind your hair tool being associated with a daytime TV celebrity, then these ionic straighteners from hairdresser (and This Morning fixture) Nicky Clarke are lovely to use and come at a very good price. The plates are coated with ceramicandtourmaline and glided smoothly over my hair, leaving it soft and shiny. There are five heat settings, from 150C to 230C, so the straighteners are good for various hair textures, including thicker hair.It didn’t make the final cut because…I slightly preferred the way my hair felt after using the Remington Shine Therapy, but there’s very little to choose between the two and these would be a great alternative.Heat settings:five (150-230C);cord length: 2m;automatic shut-off time:60 minutes;weight:360gGHD MiniView image in fullscreen£124 at GHD£124.02 at John LewisBest for:precision styling and quick fixesRocking a pixie cut or French bob? The GHD Mini’s half-inch plates are just the thing for styling shorter hair, easily reaching the roots without the kinking or crimping that can be more noticeable on shorter hair with standard plates. The Mini has the same floating ceramic plates and heat-sensing technology as its bigger brethren, in a slimline package that’s perfect for keeping a textured crop or face-framing fringe sleek and straight. The rounded barrel means you can also create waves and curls if you want to change up your look.It didn’t make the final cut because …the GHD Mini is a good thing in a small package, as long as you have shorter hair. For anything longer than shoulder length you’ll want a full-size tool.Heat settings:one (185C);cord length: 2.7m swivel cord;automatic shut-off time:30 minutes;weight:320gWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Investing in a premium model with smart technology can save you time and reduce the risk of heat damage.’Photograph: Lise SmithHow do hair straighteners work?Whatever the price, brand or extra features, all hair straighteners work in the same way: by using heat to temporarily break the hydrogen bonds in the hair. With these bonds momentarily broken, the hair can be set into a new style that stays in place once the hair cools and the hydrogen bonds reform.Most modern straighteners have heating plates coated in a non-metallic material, such as ceramic and tourmaline, to distribute the heat more gently and evenly than a metal plate and reduce the risk of scorching the hair. A ceramic coating also helps the straighteners glide smoothly over the hair, reducing snagging and giving straightened hair a glossy, healthy-looking finish.How much should you spend?If you heat-style only occasionally, a basic straightener will do the job. If you style more frequently, investing in a premium model with smart technology can save you time and reduce the risk of heat damage. A premium tool is likely to include features such as “floating” plates on tiny springs that keep an even grip on the hair; and heat sensors that adjust the temperature of the straighteners as you style. Premium straighteners may also include ionic technology, using a material that when heated releases negative ions, reducing frizz and adding shine to the hair.How to stop your hair getting damagedMake sure your hair is completely dry before straightening (unless your straightener is a wet-to-dry straightener). Brush your hair and divide it into even sections, then spray with a heat-protection product to keep heat damage to a minimum and help your finished style last longer. Any of these products is better than nothing, but my favourite isGHD’s Bodyguard spray(andRevlon’s Uniq Oneis a good alternative). It’s best to start around the bottom of your head and work your way up to the top, using as few strokes as possible – the best straighteners work in one or two passes over each tress. Finish with a spritz of your favourite hairspray to hold the style in place.If your straightener has adjustable temperature settings, use a lower temperature for fine or damaged hair, 170-190C for most hair types, and up to 200-210C for thick or curly hair. With the right heat settings for your hair type and a protective spray, there’s no reason straightening your hair should be bad for it.Lise Smith is a freelance writer withmore than 15 years of experience covering beauty, lifestyle, parentingand the performing arts.

In this week’s edition:Elon Musksuffers the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Apple beats itself up over Siri, and Meta goes after one of its own over a tell-all book.Musk took a beating last week, as didTeslaMy colleague Nick Robins-Earlyreports:The past 10 days have marked several of the most significant setbacks for Musk in months. Tesla, arguably his marquee company, continued to fall in value as investors worried about the threat of trade war and possible recession – as well as declining profits. Escalating protests against the company over the billionaire’s role in the government also grew in number and intensity across the US, coupled withrising cases of vandalism and social stigma against his cars. SpaceX has also struggled, with one of its rockets dramatically exploding in midflight last week and then an announcement that it was delaying a rescue mission to retrieve “stranded” astronauts. The company tried again two days later.Adding to Musk’s headaches, his social media platform, X, experienced widespread outages throughout the day on Monday. During a Fox Business interview, he claimed that it was the result of a “massive cyberattack” that the company had traced to the area of Ukraine.Musk is also dealing with increasing pushback over his role at Doge. Multiple outlets reported that the “first buddy”, as he’s christened himself, got into a heated exchange with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, during a White House meeting last week, which ended with Donald Trump appearing to rein in Musk’s power to make staffing decisions at government agencies with a Truth social post. A federal judge in California also issued a preliminary injunction on Thursday to reinstate thousands of the workers that Doge mass fired. Meanwhile, polling this week from Quinnipiac University shows that despite Musk repeatedly declaring that the public loves what Doge is doing, astrong majority of people disapprove of his initiative.To shore up Musk’s fortune,Tesla held a sales event on the lawn of the White House.Donald Trumpbrowsed several of the company’s vehicles and eventually announced he would purchase one and label vandalism against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside a Tesla service center in New Orleans on 14 March.Photograph: Chris Granger/APThe scene was a striking use of the presidency to endorse the business of the commander-in-chief’s biggest financial backer. However, the display also gave the impression that Musk needed Trump to reverse his string of losses and quell the backlash against him.Methinks the CEO doth protest too much. It’s unclear if the maneuver will work. Republicans buy far fewer electric cars than Democrats, and Democrats newly hate Musk, per recent polls and automotive industry consumer data compiled bythe New York Times. As one analyst told the paper: “When you make your product unattractive to half the market, I promise you, you won’t increase your sales.”Tesla’s stock has fallen 37% since the start of 2025. Given so much decline and more on the horizon with Trump’s tariffs and plummeting consumer sentiment, would the company’s board have a fiduciary duty to remove him? In theory and in #Resistance fanfiction, maybe, but in practice, there’s little chance. Will shareholders sue? They have in the past, taking legal issue with his enormous $56bn pay package, and a judge found in their favor twice. However, that pay package was the result of a fundamental truth about Tesla: Elon Musk is synonymous with the company. To serve on the board, to buy its shares, and now even purchase one of the company’s cars is to believe in him. The Cybertruck is as much a Maga emblem as a red hat.In other Elon Musk newsHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk‘Deeply uncomfortable’: UK Starlink users switch off over Musk’s political machinationsElon Musk targeted me over Tesla protests.

If an explosive internal meeting is any indication, they’ll be waiting a lot longer.Last week, Apple’s senior director, Robby Walker, told the Siri team that their failures had been ugly and embarrassing, according toBloomberg, in whose pages this saga has primarily played out. For a company that touts its designs as so very beautiful, harmonious and superior, it’s hard to think of a more insulting assessment.Apple had trumpeted the Siri upgrades at last year’s company conference for software developers. The team had reportedly been cranking deliver new features this spring, only to see their work shelved and executives raise the possibility of scrapping it entirely.What arrived instead was a public humiliation: the announcement of an indefinite delay on any major changes to Siri. Senior leaders at Apple including software chief Craig Federighi worried that the AI features didn’t work as advertised or even function in a basic manner when they tried it out. Some members of Apple’s AI division think the work on Siri’s new features should be scuttled like a defunct warship and restarted under new leadership, according to Bloomberg. The company has taken down an ad for Siri’s AI enhancements released in 2024.Since the inception of Siri, Apple’s iPhone homunculus has won infamy as an inept digital assistant. I still can’t cajole her into controlling Spotify accurately or consistently, a problem that has persisted since I owned an iPhone 6. With the advent and proliferation of generative AI, Siri’s problems have been thrown into glaring relief. She can’t compete with ChatGPT’s multiple functions. Compounding Apple’s problems are the baffling, wrong and viral summaries of notifications by Apple Intelligence, a suite of featuresannounced in September alongside the iPhone 16. Meanwhile, Amazon has revamped its line of smart devices with a refreshed Alexa two weeks ago, courtesy of Anthropic’s Claude AI modelsFalling short on AI has mushroomed into a full-blown catastrophe for a company that prides itself on releasing products later than competitors but with more intuitive designs and thoughtful features. I’d consider switching to a Pixel if I wasn’t some 15 years deep into the Apple software ecosystem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

InCareless People,Sarah Wynn-Williams writes that Joel Kaplan sexually harassed her, Sheryl Sandberg ordered her to share a bed aboard a private plane, andMark Zuckerbergwas willing to make censorship concessions to re-enter the Chinese market, though nothing came of his genuflection.The book describes Meta’s leadership as “callously indifferent to the price others would pay for their own enrichment”.With juicy details, it offers to personalize and personify the motives behind the company’s headline-making public moves, rendering them legible and knowable.“The people nefariously guiding the technology” ranks among the most appealing kinds of news stories about tech. And the book comes exactly at a time when people are thirsty to read more about figures such as Kaplan and Zuckerberg, who have embraced a starring role in the second Trump administration. Top that off with a profile of Sandberg that runs counter to her public narrative.For its part, Meta describes the book’s serious allegations as outright false and has taken the extraordinary step of obtaining a legal order toquash Wynn-Williams’ ability to publicize her book. Meta’s lawyer demanded the ability to revise the book, saying her account was full of “overheated and potentially defamatory allegations”, per NBC. It’s a far cry from the response to The Ugly Truth, a 2021 bestseller by two New York Times reporters, which Meta did not take legal action against.Is everything in Wynn-Williams’ book true? Judge for yourself the answer she gaveBusiness Insiderwhen asked if she had it factchecked:The accusation of a failure to factcheck comes directly from a Meta spokesperson, Andy Stone, the company’s best attack dog on X and Threads.

At a time when the games industry is racked with layoffs and studio closures, the barrage of dispiriting headlines can be numbing. But the shutdown of Monolith cut through the noise, sparking fresh shock and outrage at the industry’s slash and burn approach to cost cutting. There are numerous reasons for this, but among them was a pervading belief that Monolith would be around forever. “I don’t think I ever really considered the possibility that it would shut down one day,” says Garrett Price, one of Monolith’s seven founding members.True to its name, Monolith was a singular presence. Founded in 1994, it was a prolific developer whose games displayed visual flair, mechanical inventiveness and a knack for synthesising pop-cultural themes. Most excitingly, you could never really predict what the studio would do next. While it primarily produced first-person shooters, there were forays into platformers, dungeon crawlers and open-world games. And even the core FPS titles differed wildly in theme and style, inspired by everything from 60s spy films to Japanese horror.View image in fullscreenWent toe-to-toe with Quake … Blood.Photograph: Monolith Productions/GOG“Monolith didn’t really have a true identity, and we honestly didn’t really care,” Price explains. “We pretty much just made whatever we wanted to make… We didn’t spend a lot of time trying to figure out what genre would sell the best or what theme would be the most accessible to the mass market. We just tried to make what we thought was cool.”Monolith emerged from the edutainment software company Edmark, where several of the company’s founders were previously employed. “On my interview day, I remember this bald chap walking past me on the stairs wearing aWolfenstein 3DT-shirt. I figured this would be a great place to work,” says Toby Gladwell, Monolith co-founder and software engineer. He recalls that his co-founders were emboldened by the recent release of Doom, the demonic first-person shooter that catapulted its creators, id Software, to rockstar status and transformed perceptions of the PC as a gaming platform. “We realised quickly that this was our calling. We simply had to make the best games of all time.”However, Monolith’s initial project bore little resemblance to id Software’s classic. Claw was a 2D, Mario-style platformer about a pirate cat. It was meant to be Monolith’s debut title, but in a quirk of fate, the company acquired another developer in late 1996 – Q Studios – which was deep into production on a Doom-like first-person shooter called Blood. Monolith opted to prioritise Blood’s completion over Claw – a decision that would have huge ramifications.Released in March 1997, Blood puts players in the role of Caleb, a gunslinging servant to the demon Tchernobog who is is betrayed and murdered by his fiendish master. “Those early games, especially Blood and Claw, have a very hand-crafted feel to them and were very much DIY endeavours,” Price says. A 2.5D shooter released as games were pivoting hard into full 3D rendering, Blood was in some ways behind the times. But its gritty visual style, creative weapons such as flare guns and voodoo dolls, and innovative addition of alternate fire modes for weapons, helped it stand toe-to-toe with more technologically advanced games such as Quake.View image in fullscreenAnime-inspired … Shogo: Mobile Armour Division.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsThe success of Blood sent Monolith into a frenzy of FPS development. Between 1998 and 2003, it designed seven new games in the genre including Blood 2; the anime-inspired shooter Shogo: Mobile Armour Division, which alternated between on-foot combat and city-flattening battles inside Gundam-style mechs; and two licensed tie-in games, Aliens Versus Predator 2, and Tron 2.0.“Our studio culture was born from a deep-seated conviction that we could accomplish anything we put our minds to,” Gladwell says. “We talked games, we played games together, both competitively and to analyse. There weren’t significant boundaries, given that we were all new to building a company – other than a strong desire to build games that would stand alongside the giants of the time.”The lack of boundaries also applied to the practical side of game design. “This was still a fledgling industry when we got started. The more specific roles you see today, such as world builder or environment artist were far more nebulous. Everyone pitched in. This helped give us a broader spread of opinion and feedback, because everyone was contributing to design,” Gladwell says. “Much of my own time at Monolith was spent in the energy vortex between design, art, audio and engineering.”View image in fullscreenA gloriously colourful pastiche of 60s espionage fiction … The Operative: No One Lives Forever.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsThe brightest star of Monolith’s early years, The Operative: No One Lives Forever, or NOLF as it is affectionately known, saw players don the orange catsuit of Cate Archer in a gloriously colourful pastiche of 60s espionage fiction. Its wide-ranging adventure transported players to Morocco, Germany, the tropics and even into space, with each level introducing new ideas, weapons and gadgets. Released in 2000, It was also one of the only shooters of its time with a female protagonist – and her portrayal holds up surprisingly well for a game that owes a significant debt to Austin Powers.Monolith’s vintage year, however, came in 2005, during which it released three games. Alongside The Matrix Online, a massively multiplayer adaptation of the 1999 sci-fi action movie, Monolith released a second game partly inspired by the same film: Fear. The culmination of Monolith’s mastery of the FPS, Fear combines the espionage themes of NOLF, the stylised ultraviolence of Blood and the Japanese borrowings of Shogo – though this time it looked to J-horror films, particularlyRingu,for inspiration. It bound these elements together with dynamic slow-motion combat and state-of-the-art enemy AI design, pitching the player against an army of clones that could seemingly work together tactically to outfox the player. The result is one of the best first-person shooters ever made.Fear is arguably Monolith’s best game. Yet despite its title, it isn’t the scariest. One month after Fear launched, Monolith released Condemned: Criminal Origins. A dark and gritty detective thriller inspired by films such as Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs, Condemned likewise blended horror and battles against eerily human enemies. But the foes you face in Condemned are crazed vagrants who attack the player with steel pipes and wooden planks, these tooth-and-nail duels interspersed with grisly crime-scene investigations.View image in fullscreenArguably Monolith’s finest … Alma from Fear.Photograph: Sierra GamesBy far Monolith’s most unsettling game, Condemned’s atmosphere of dread is thicker and more convincing than anything in Fear. A level set in a mannequin-filled department store has become infamous for its paranoia-inducing qualities. “Their studio had a real talent for permanently altering your imagination by turning everyday locations into memorable levels,” says Cameron Martin, senior producer at New Blood Interactive, publisher of retro shooters including Dusk, partly inspired by Monolith’s work. “After playing their games, you’ll never look at empty office buildings or crusty subway stations the same way again.”Fear and Condemned would be the last truly original games the studio would make. By 2005, Monolith had been acquired by Warner Bros, and after providing Fear and Condemned with decent if lesser sequels, Monolith became a servant of Warner Bros’ media licences.Yet even in this role, Monolith’s inventive, capricious personality shines through, as in 2012’s bizarre multiplayer shooter Gotham City Imposters, where players assumed the roles of random Gotham citizens pretending to be Batman and the Joker. The highlight of the studio’s latter years, however, was Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. An open-world game in the Assassin’s Creed mould, Shadow of Mordor featured the remarkable Nemesis AI system, which reorganised Sauron’s faceless army of orcs into a scheming political hierarchy, filled with recognisable personalities players would repeatedly encounter in tit-for-tat blood feuds.View image in fullscreenHighlight of Monolith’s later years … Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsNemesis was a potentially genre-defining concept, an idea dozens of other games would borrow from and riff on. But we will never know what its influence could have been. Warner Bros patented the system in 2021, and the only game to feature it since is Monolith’s final release, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War. Monolith was working on a Wonder Woman game that would also have featured the system, but this project was cancelled alongside Monolith’s closure.When a game studio closes, it can be difficult to gauge what is lost. Drive, perhaps, is what ultimately defines Monolith’s legacy. Between its foundation in 1994 and Shadow of War’s publication in 2017, Monolith created 23 games, one for every year of its existence up to that point. Which makes it more shocking that Monolith closed with nothing to show for its last eight years of existence.That such a dependable studio failed to release another game in almost a decade should raise serious questions about modern industry practices and how studios are increasingly subject to the whims of executives, investors, and venture capitalists. The demand that every release be bigger and better looking, appealing to the widest audience, and poised to serve players for years, is transforming the industry into a zero-sum game – a game that some studios aren’t allowed to finish, let alone win or lose.Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesMMORPGWarner BrosShooting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fueled by unbridled techno-optimism and edgy cultural capital, Doge seems less like a government agency and more like another one ofElon Musk’s shaky startups. While bewildered pundits includingFareed Zakariastruggle to diagnose and process the new technocracy in DC,our new Doge overlordsare infinitely familiar to my classmates and me: they might as well be guys we knew from school.Trump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianismRead moreThis is the new generation of young technocrats who helped lift Trump into office: they are the crypto-obsessed love-children of Musk andDonald Trump, of Silicon Valley and the Heritage Foundation, of “effective altruism” and “effective accelerationism”. Meanwhile, graduates who lean left are simply out of luck: outside of academia, it can feel nearly impossible to find a progressive job in tech.Progressive Data Jobs, a major hub for jobs in this space, currently lists 96 open positions across all experience levels. By contrast, the careers portal at Goldman Sachs alone boasts 1,943 open jobs.That’s because, for decades, the progressive movement worldwide has failed to organize technical talent for its own interests.For decades, the progressive movement worldwide has failed to organize technical talent for its own interestsUpon graduation, an average science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) student often faces a binary choice between industry and academia: BlackRock or grad school. Sure, there’s a handful of research non-profits out there, likeRadical Dataor the inactiveAlgorithmic Justice League; but they mostly focus on advocacy instead of governance. While there is excellent progressive work in data science being done by organizations such asOpenSecrets,Split Ticket, ProPublica’sData Store, and even Twitter accounts such asStats for Lefties, there is no systematic effort by progressives to recruit technical talent at scale.Meanwhile, financial and tech industries begin targeting Stem students with aggressive recruitment tactics as early as freshman year: over time, these industries become theonlycareers students can imagine outside of grad school. It’s no wonder thatStem students are more conservativethan humanities and social science students, even thoughscientiststend to be more liberal. There are really only two things you can do with a Stem degree: stay in the ivory tower, or – toparaphrase Audre Lorde– go build the master’s house.In an interview with Ross Douthat, the tech investorMarc Andreessenclaims that the left alienated Silicon Valley because “companies are being hijacked as engines of social change”: gone are the days of the agitprop1984 Apple ads, or the naive “coding for good” movements of the 2010s. Afterthe term “Stem” was coined in 2001, the next two decades saw the further division of science and the humanities into twoopposing, irreconcilablesystems of knowledge at the institutional level. While educational policy-makers obsess over Stem enrollments, funding and research as metrics to assess an education’s worth, students were incentivized to concentrate on one discipline, all while a liberal arts education diminished in appeal and practical utility.This made a generation of Stem students into technical ideologues. Starting from high school olympiads, they learn to worship technical capability above all else – and value the acquisition of technical skills above everything else. In college, they are never taught problem-solving frameworks outside those offered by programming or economics courses: game theory,homo economicus,Pareto efficiency. Crucially, these approaches always attempt to simplify the world instead of tackling society’s complexities head on: simplifying, as animpulse, has given rise to neoliberal, Silicon Valley-funded social movements such as “effective altruism” that do nothing to tackle crucial inequalities. Without alternative paradigms, these theories become real and universal ways to see the world and solve its problems.This made a generation of Stem students into technical ideologuesAnd so, empowered by Trump and Musk, it is the rightist technocrats whogetto change the world today. With flashy tech stacks and a blind confidence to code up a solution to any and every problem, they set out to fix our government once and for all, armed with only three principles – simplify, automate, optimize. And soDoge runs the government as if solving an optimization problem: cut employees, retain key workers, minimize losses, simplify the structure. But already, Doge is reinstating fired federal workers who wereworking on crucial issues. Classic tech bro blunder: what else did they expect from trying to solve the problems of society without even bothering to understand their nuances?As the technocrat right rises into power, a luddite left also emerges in America – a narrowing base of grassroots organizers, local politicians, activists, academics and non-profits, that increasingly disaffiliate from technology with fear and distrust. As technical industries become more explicitly aligned with the agendas of the new American right in the post-Covid years, there has been little effort from progressive political organizations to recruit self-starting hackers and radical technologists, who exist in abundance on the decentralized internet. Did anyone even try to scoop up the workers who walked out of Google in 2018? Now, in 2025, we realize that a generation of politically naive engineers have already built asingularmatrix of algorithmic oppression and universal surveillance that we cannot opt out of. Today’s progressives not only do not understand technology; worse, we have completely ceded technological power to the right.There’s nothing elitist about college or university. We should reject that idea | Carlo Invernizzi-AccettiRead moreThe dearth of efforts to recruit technical talent on the left essentially create a failure of imagination. Talented young engineers fail to imagine how their skills can be used to challenge existing power structures, and movements fail to imagine how technology can be used as a tactic to seize power. As Justin Joque argued inRevolutionary Mathematics, progressive movements need technical people who “understand the current metaphysics of capitalism – not in order to de-reify them, but rather to understand how they can be replaced”. One wonders whethermore sophisticated data scientistscould have made past Democratic campaigns more effective, or whether a collaboration between engineers and progressive thinkers could have led to more online platforms such asBluesky.In order to hack and dismantle the technocrat right, American progressives must teach the engineers to dream again. Today’s engineers may be hard at work building the master’s house, but with the right organization and renewed senses of purpose, they, too, can learn to turn the master’s tools against him.Jaye Chen is a writer based in New York CityExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionUS educationTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskDemocratsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The second episode – which refers to Andrew Tate, a misogynistic influencer who recentlytravelled to the USdespite facing charges of rape and people trafficking in Romania – also explores the secret meaning contained in emojis used by teenagers online.‘The younger me would have sat up and nodded’: Adolescence writer Jack Thorne on the insidious appeal of incel cultureRead moreA teenage character explains that the use of a red pill – a reference to a red pill showing the world as it is, from the film The Matrix – “is like ‘I see the truth’. It’s a call to action by the manosphere”. An “exploding red pill” indicates someone is an incel, he says. The character goes on to explain that the 100 emoji is another incel symbol, related to the “80 to 20 rule”, the incel theory that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men.Dr Robert Lawson, an expert on sociolinguistics from Birmingham City University, cautioned of “moral panic” around the use of emojis in teenage online discourse, the vast majority of which were likely to be innocuous, he said. But he added that incel culture used a range of words and acronyms to signify belonging to the community, including include Twot (“that whore over there) and Awalt (“all women are like that”).“There’s an element of, if you want to be a part of this community, you need to learn the lingo,” he said. “There is a need to create new terms that speak to the issues in this community [and] within the manosphere, it’s a virulent strain of anti-feminist and anti-women sentiment.”A study from Dublin City University’s anti-bullying centre last year found that social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts fed and amplified anti-feminist and other extremist content to blank smartphones registered as 16- to 18-year-old boyswithin 23 minutesof use. Research in February last year found young men from generation Z were more likely than baby boomers to believefeminism had done more harm than good.The use of emojis in the manosphere is not new, said Prof Dr Lisa Sugiura, an expert in incel culture from the University of Portsmouth. “[Emojis] can also be used to circumvent content moderation,” she said. “So it’s not necessarily clear to social media platforms if it is being used in a way that is hateful or bullying.”The Online Safety Act, whichcame into law on Monday, willfine social media companies if they fail toprevent children seeing the most harmful content, and minimise exposure to abuse, including misogyny. But while platforms had been told to consider “coded language”, incel emojis will only be seen as harmful if used to incite hatred of women, said a spokesperson from Ofcom, the UK watchdog overseeing the act.Daisy Greenwell, a cofounder ofSmartphone Free Childhood, said public debate prompted by the Netflix show should push the government to take direct action to ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers. The safer phones bill, a private member’s bill from the Labour MP Josh MacAlister backed by the group, waswatered down earlier this monthafter opposition to tougher measures.“Adolescence has really struck a chord, expresses the deep fear that we all have parents that as soon as we give our kid a smartphone we lose control,” she said.“It’s not fair to suggest that this is something that parents can solve. We need better legislation so that all kids are safe, not just those whose parents have got the time to make sure they’re not looking at incel content.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleSmartphonesInternet safetySocial mediaJack ThorneAndrew TateGendernewsShareReuse this content"

This was one of the deadliest days since the early months of the conflict, sparked by the lethal Hamas raid of 7 October 2023. Israel says it was attacking “terror targets”, but health authorities in Gaza say that 174 children and 89 women were amongthe more than 400 dead. Evacuation orders issued by the military suggest that a renewed ground offensive may be on its way for traumatised and repeatedly displaced Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu warnedthat it was “only the beginning”and the military issued new evacuation orders to traumatised and repeatedly displaced Palestinians. Families of the remaining Israeli hostages are terrified and angry too,attackingthe government for choosing to give up on them.Horror is piling upon horror. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since the war began, and the numbers grew even during the ceasefire, many due to Israel’s blocking of aid. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, belatedly acknowledged that as a breach of international law on Monday – only for the prime minister’s spokesperson torebuke him. A UN report last weeksaidthat Israel’s attacks on women’s healthcare in Gaza amounted to “genocidal acts”, and that security forces had used sexual violence as a weapon of war to “dominate and destroy the Palestinian people”. A previous UN commission found that “relentless and deliberate attacks” onmedical personneland facilitiesamounted to war crimes.Building on the ceasefire always looked difficult. Negotiations never seriously began for the second phase that was supposed to bring about a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, and the total withdrawal of Israeli forces – never mind consideration of the hypothetical third phase, Gaza’s reconstruction.Mr Netanyahu, who blames Hamas’s intransigence in refusing to release all the hostages now for the end of the ceasefire, iskept in power by endless conflict. The Israeli prime minister was due to testify in his corruption trial on Tuesday butcancelled, citing the renewed offensive. He needs support to pass a budget by the end of the month or his government will be dissolved. Resuming air strikes hasbrought backone of his far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and should prevent the other, Bezalel Smotrich, from jumping ship. Israelis challenging, as authoritarian, his attempts todismiss his internal security agency chief, Ronen Bar, can be accused of undermining the patriotic cause. Yet most Israeliswantedto move to the second phase of the ceasefire, according to a recent survey. The testimony of returned hostages has refocused attention on the plight of those still held.The renewed attack has been widely and rightly condemned in Europe and the Arab world. But Israel, which was undeterred by Joe Biden’s feeble scoldings, is now dealing with a US president who told it to pause for a beat but is happy to give it the green light to resume and urge it to go further. Donald Trump has repeatedly promotedthe forced displacement of Palestinians– another war crime. The US and Israel have reportedlycontacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somalilandabout resettling uprooted Palestinians. These plans are no more tolerable for being far-fetched. The Arabpeace planwas a clear statement that there is a better alternative. But for Israel’s right, which will not tolerate Palestinian aspirations to statehood, the destruction of hope is not merely a result of this war, but the goal. It must not succeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

By contrast, the careers portal at Goldman Sachs alone boasts 1,943 open jobs.That’s because, for decades, the progressive movement worldwide has failed to organize technical talent for its own interests.For decades, the progressive movement worldwide has failed to organize technical talent for its own interestsUpon graduation, an average science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) student often faces a binary choice between industry and academia: BlackRock or grad school. Sure, there’s a handful of research non-profits out there, likeRadical Dataor the inactiveAlgorithmic Justice League; but they mostly focus on advocacy instead of governance. While there is excellent progressive work in data science being done by organizations such asOpenSecrets,Split Ticket, ProPublica’sData Store, and even Twitter accounts such asStats for Lefties, there is no systematic effort by progressives to recruit technical talent at scale.Meanwhile, financial and tech industries begin targeting Stem students with aggressive recruitment tactics as early as freshman year: over time, these industries become theonlycareers students can imagine outside of grad school. It’s no wonder thatStem students are more conservativethan humanities and social science students, even thoughscientiststend to be more liberal. There are really only two things you can do with a Stem degree: stay in the ivory tower, or – toparaphrase Audre Lorde– go build the master’s house.In an interview with Ross Douthat, the tech investorMarc Andreessenclaims that the left alienated Silicon Valley because “companies are being hijacked as engines of social change”: gone are the days of the agitprop1984 Apple ads, or the naive “coding for good” movements of the 2010s. Afterthe term “Stem” was coined in 2001, the next two decades saw the further division of science and the humanities into twoopposing, irreconcilablesystems of knowledge at the institutional level. While educational policy-makers obsess over Stem enrollments, funding and research as metrics to assess an education’s worth, students were incentivized to concentrate on one discipline, all while a liberal arts education diminished in appeal and practical utility.This made a generation of Stem students into technical ideologues. Starting from high school olympiads, they learn to worship technical capability above all else – and value the acquisition of technical skills above everything else. In college, they are never taught problem-solving frameworks outside those offered by programming or economics courses: game theory,homo economicus,Pareto efficiency. Crucially, these approaches always attempt to simplify the world instead of tackling society’s complexities head on: simplifying, as animpulse, has given rise to neoliberal, Silicon Valley-funded social movements such as “effective altruism” that do nothing to tackle crucial inequalities. Without alternative paradigms, these theories become real and universal ways to see the world and solve its problems.This made a generation of Stem students into technical ideologuesAnd so, empowered by Trump and Musk, it is the rightist technocrats whogetto change the world today. With flashy tech stacks and a blind confidence to code up a solution to any and every problem, they set out to fix our government once and for all, armed with only three principles – simplify, automate, optimize. And soDoge runs the government as if solving an optimization problem: cut employees, retain key workers, minimize losses, simplify the structure. But already, Doge is reinstating fired federal workers who wereworking on crucial issues. Classic tech bro blunder: what else did they expect from trying to solve the problems of society without even bothering to understand their nuances?As the technocrat right rises into power, a luddite left also emerges in America – a narrowing base of grassroots organizers, local politicians, activists, academics and non-profits, that increasingly disaffiliate from technology with fear and distrust. As technical industries become more explicitly aligned with the agendas of the new American right in the post-Covid years, there has been little effort from progressive political organizations to recruit self-starting hackers and radical technologists, who exist in abundance on the decentralized internet. Did anyone even try to scoop up the workers who walked out of Google in 2018? Now, in 2025, we realize that a generation of politically naive engineers have already built asingularmatrix of algorithmic oppression and universal surveillance that we cannot opt out of. Today’s progressives not only do not understand technology; worse, we have completely ceded technological power to the right.There’s nothing elitist about college or university. We should reject that idea | Carlo Invernizzi-AccettiRead moreThe dearth of efforts to recruit technical talent on the left essentially create a failure of imagination. Talented young engineers fail to imagine how their skills can be used to challenge existing power structures, and movements fail to imagine how technology can be used as a tactic to seize power. As Justin Joque argued inRevolutionary Mathematics, progressive movements need technical people who “understand the current metaphysics of capitalism – not in order to de-reify them, but rather to understand how they can be replaced”. One wonders whethermore sophisticated data scientistscould have made past Democratic campaigns more effective, or whether a collaboration between engineers and progressive thinkers could have led to more online platforms such asBluesky.In order to hack and dismantle the technocrat right, American progressives must teach the engineers to dream again. Today’s engineers may be hard at work building the master’s house, but with the right organization and renewed senses of purpose, they, too, can learn to turn the master’s tools against him.Jaye Chen is a writer based in New York CityExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionUS educationTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskDemocratsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Where will his perpetual war lead next?Simon TisdallIsrael, backed by a capricious Donald Trump, never intended to honour the ceasefire. These airstrikes mark a dire new phase in the conflictTue 18 Mar 2025 11.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 11.55 EDTShareThe first and last rule of Benjamin Netanyahu’s doctrine of perpetual warfare is brutally to the point: peace cannot and must not be allowed to last. As indiscriminate, deadly fire once again descends upon the defenceless people of Gaza, unleashed on the orders of Israel’s bellicose prime minister, an anguished cry is heard. Is the precious two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas definitively over? To which comes the dismaying answer: it barely matters. This truce, now shattering into a million pieces, was but a brief, deceptive pause ina war that never stops.It doesn’t stop because Netanyahu is sustained in office by the unceasing state of national emergency that he and his supporters have nurtured and prolonged since the 7 October 2023 terrorist attacks. The war doesn’t stop because Netanyahu’s overarching aim – the destruction of Palestinian hopes of nationhood – is doomed to fail. It does not stop because those, inside Israel and abroad, whocriticise Israeli government actionsface being dismissed and abused for supposedly acting not in good faith and out of alarm at the human toll, but from antisemitic motives.Most of all, perhaps, the war that the terrorists triggered 18 months ago continues, and threatens once more to expand, because Netanyahu and his far-right Jewish nationalist and ultra-religious partners have found in it a vehicle to pursue the larger goal of a greater Israel. They and theirviolent settler alliesuse it as an excuse to expand land grabs and intimidate Palestinian residents in the occupied West Bank. New areas of Syria’s Golan Heights have been seized. Resettlement of Gaza itself is another stated objective.Perpetual warfare can only be sustained if the other “side” continues to fight. So degraded are Hamas’s forces, it almost seems unable to do so any longer. The lack of an immediate armed response to the Israeli strikes that began on Monday night speaks to relative weakness. And yet Hamas is not vanquished. Each time ahostage was handed over, its black-hooded fighters made a great show of militant defiance. As long as any credible, agreed “day after” plan is lacking – and absent a ground invasion and full-scale, long-term occupation – Hamas will remain in effective charge in Gaza. And so the war goes on.Netanyahudid not want the ceasefire in the first placeand has constantly sought a breakdown he could blame on others. He only consented to stop shooting on 19 January under pressure from Donald Trump and his ubiquitous envoy, Steve Witkoff. Due to be inaugurated the following day, Trump was imperiously demanding an end to the conflict his predecessor, Joe Biden, failed to halt. Loth to rain on Trump’s parade, and eager to win favour, Netanyahu agreed, fingers crossed tightly behind his back.Yet even then, with more than 48,000 Palestinians dead, tens of thousands injured or traumatised and most of Gaza’s 2 million population homeless, Netanyahu was not ready to stop. He knew that far-right cabinet ministers would not tolerate peace for long. One, Itamar Ben-Gvir, hadalready resigned in protest. Others were threatening to do so, thereby potentially collapsing his government. He knew, though for him this has been a secondary consideration throughout, that many Israeli hostages remained in captivity – 59 at the last count, alive and dead.0:55Deaths reported in Gaza as Israeli military resumes strikes – videoNetanyahu never seriously intended to honour the second phase of the ceasefire, which was supposed to begin on 1 March and which calls for full Israeli military withdrawal. Heblocked humanitarian aid; he cut water and electricity supplies; he delayed second-phase implementation and obstructed talks to get it back on track. He waged war by other means. And when these provocations failed, he insisted, in breach of the ceasefire deal, that Hamas unilaterally liberate more hostages while offering only limited prisoner releases and a temporary truce extension in return.Perpetual warfare, even when undeclared, is difficult to justify and Netanyahu, indicted for war crimes by the international criminal court and widely condemned in Europe and the Arab world, is desperately short of backers. His predicament has worsened of late. Accused of a growing authoritarianism, he is embroiled in a row over hisbid to sack the Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar. A new corruption scandal involving Qatari money also swirls around him. In this context, a Gaza “distraction” may be considered timely.“Netanyahu is waging a holding action on every possible front – against early elections, against a state commission of inquiry [into the 7 October attacks], against a deal that would bring back the 59 remaining hostages, living and dead,”wrote Haaretz’s Amos Harel. “The prime minister is acting like someone who has nothing left to lose. Intensifying the battle to the point of chaos serves him.”With more than 400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, killed so far, and with Israel threatening continuing and expanding strikes,cries of anger, horror and dismayfrom the Palestinians, the UN, international aid agencies and foreign governments echo like ghostly laments across the devastated Gazan wasteland. They are as familiar as they are futile and disregarded.A far from chastened White House, proudly confirming complicity in the Israeli strikes, appears keen they continue. The January ceasefire process appears dead. Trump’s absurd plan for a Gaza Riviera is nowhere to be seen or heard now. Thwarted, he hits back vicariously, egging on Netanyahu. Yet it would be naive not to see a broader, schematic Trump connection. In recent days, he has rattled sabres in Iran’s face, demanding Tehran resume talks on curtailing its nuclear programme or face military action. At the same time, he launched huge airstrikes on Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.‘Ceasefire’ is a hollow word for Palestinians – the killings, displacements and denial of aid continue | Nesrine MalikRead moreIn Trump’s simplistic, zero-sum world, it’s all the same deal. “As President Trump has made clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran – all those who seek to terrorise not just Israel but the US – will see a price to pay, and all hell will break loose,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.Is Yemen an early warning? Is Trump moving to defend Israel against Iranian attack – a possibility relentlessly rehearsed by Netanyahu to justify his unending state of war? Or is Trump actually preparing the ground for an Israeli-US strike going the other way, as many in Tehran believe?Like some previous US presidents, and oblivious as ever to history, Trump believes he can remake the Middle East almost by an act of imperial will. But unlike Barack Obama, who dreamed in Cairo in 2009 of a democratic renaissance, Trump is remodelling by diktat, backed by the use or threat of brute force. Palestine is the benighted place in which Trump’s messiah complex and Netanyahu’s doctrine of perpetual war collide. Where next?

Most of us did not vote forDonald Trump(half of us didn’t even vote in the 2024 election). But he feels he has a mandate to take a wrecking ball to the constitution.Like most bullies, the regime can be constrained only if everyone stands up to the bullying – including you.First, if you are considering a trip to the United States, please reconsider. Why reward Trump’s America with your tourist dollars?Spending by non-Americans in the United States is a significant source of tax revenue and a major “export” of this nation. There’s no reason for you to indirectly support Trump’s economy.Trump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianismRead moreMany international travelersconcerned about Trump’s authoritarianism have already canceled trips to the United States. You might do so, too.Last week, the US president threatened a 200% tariff on European wine and alcohol after calling the European Union “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World”.Why reward this bellicose rhetoric? Many Europeans are already skipping trips to Disney World and music festivals.Travel fromChina, a frequent target of Trump’s contempt, is down 11%. Chinese travelers are choosing to vacation in Australia and New Zealand instead of visiting US national parks.Our dear neighbors north of the border, who have long been themajor sourceof international travel to the United States, are deciding to visit Europe and Mexico instead.In response to Trump’s repeated desire to make Canada a“51st state”, Canada’s former prime minister Justin Trudeau has urged Canadians not to vacation in the US.An informal boycott by Canadian travelers has begun. The number of Canadians returning by car from visits to the United States already fellby 23%in February, and air travel by Canadians returning from the United States was down 13% relative to last year, according toStatistics Canada.Overall, it’s expected that international travel to the United States will drop at least 5% this year.Although we have loved (and profited from) your visits, I urge you to join many of your compatriots and at least for now decide not to come to the United States.Second, if you are thinking about coming to the United States on a student or even on an H-1B visa, which allows highly skilled foreign citizens to live and work here, you might also reconsider.Perhaps wait a few years until, hopefully, the Trump regime has ended.It is not entirely safe for you to be here, in any event.Dr Rasha Alawieh, 34, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University’s medical school, who has been in the United States legally on an H-1B visa, was just deported without explanation, and even though a court order had blocked her expulsion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When she tried to return from that trip to the United States, she was detained by US customs and immigration officials and put on a flight to Paris, presumably on her way to Lebanon.Lebanon is not even on a draft list of nations from which theTrump administrationis considering banning entry to the United States.Even if there’s a shortage in the US of skilled workers in your specialty, you could be deported at any time, for any or no reason.Likewise, if you are considering coming to the US on a student visa, you might consider the risk at this time. A Columbia University graduate student, Mahmoud Khalil, wasarrested and detained for no reasonother than that he peacefully protested against Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza.The administration of Brown University has advised foreign students, ahead of spring break, to “consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the US Department of State”.It is not just the risk. It’s also the circumstances. If you care about democracy, this is not the time to come here on a student or H-1B visa because the Trump regime is riding roughshod over our rights.On Sunday, it deported hundreds of Venezuelan nationals from the United States to a prison in El Salvador. This was done even though a federal judge blocked Trump’s use of the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act – which had only been used in times of war – and ordered planes carrying some of the Venezuelans to turn back to the United States.On Sunday night, Trump told reporters that the Venezuelans he deported were “bad people”.But no one can take Trump’s word that these were “bad” people. Trump routinely uses the term “bad people” to refer to people who oppose or criticize him.Whatever your reason for wanting to come to the United States – as a visitor, a student, or an H-1B skilled worker – you might want to reconsider your plans.Deciding not to come would send a signal that you’re justifiably worried about your safety and security here and you are as repulsed by the Trump regime’s attacks on democracy as are most of us Americans.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Has the great dealmaker been building up … the wrong nation?Tue 18 Mar 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTShareNaturally I assumed the feeling would pass, but one whole week after the US president turned the lawn of the White House into acrappy car dealership, I keep finding myself feeling … optimistic. I know, I know. But if anything, I find myself feeling a little bit more optimistic every day – and sometimes a lot more. Not for America, which keeps electing him, but for the rest of the world. It really would take a heart of stone for governments from Beijing to Delhi to Warsaw to look at the clip of this old guy trying to sell his friend’s electric cars and not think: “Ooooooooh, that is very, very bad vibes. Still, it’s good for us!”In China they have ironically nicknamed Trump “the nation builder”, meaning he is doing an incredible, bigly impressive job of bolstering the Chinese nation. Not to be disrespectful to that ancient golf bore holding the little piece of paper listing hiscar salesman talking pointsand gibbering “everything is computer”… but can this guy even organise an oligarchy? He’s certainly making his precious stock market run, stricken, in the direction of the nearest bathroom.As for Trump’s genius henchmogul Elon Musk, Tesla’s share price has halved over the past three months, with the FT reporting today that hedge fund short sellers have made$16.2bn betting against it. Last week a JP Morgan noteattempted to contextualisetheir grimly downgraded outlook for the firm: “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly.” Listen, I’ll take their expert word for it. But I feel like even I can think of something similar in the history of the social media industry. Last year the entrepreneur and professorScott Galloway observed of Xsince Musk’s purchase of it: “No company over $1bn in revenue has ever lost 60% of its revenues in a 12 month period in a non-war period. I don’t think that’s ever happened. Twitter is literally the worst-performing business in history since a change in ownership.”Admittedly, as is now clear, X was a political project for Musk, so perhaps that was a strategic haemorrhaging of value. It certainly bought him a keyboard army, albeit one that doesn’t appear to have a whole lot better to do all day than suck anonymously up to him. Indeed, for having the temerity to post this article on X, I expect a number of rape and death threats from Maga folk who are now, like some cowboy-booted modern take on the poor East Germans, being told to buy one type of car. Even worse, it’s one of the electric type, that until very recently they were formally required to dismiss as soyboymobiles. So look, I understand: mandated ideological 180s are very upsetting. And in any case, I always threaten to rape and kill people when I’m winning an argument.In the weeks after the Trump administration got under way, the pace at which it was smashing, cutting, or walking away from things at first seemed discombobulating, frightening – even tragic. And it remains so for many Americans. But here outside the US, the alternative view is that it has saved many years, potentially decades, of the various factions of the rest of the world dithering away while thinking “Maybe we should get it together? Then again, how would we get it together? We should probably get it together … ” Thanks to the Nation Builder™, everyone is simplyhavingto get it together, and fast. Defence is obviously the toughest issue, and suggesting otherwise is a level of facetiousness to which even this column couldn’t aspire. But it’s not undoable, mainly because it can’t be. Meanwhile, stripping out the various moral dimensions, where is the money really going to flow? Towards countries like the one building factories where they make batteries that cancharge a car in five minutes(sorry, Elon) and are so big you have to fly over them – or the one where the leader turned the seat of power into a garage forecourt?Sometimes you don’t need to be steeped in every economic and geopolitical detail to get a macrotrends gut feeling. Let’s face it, all that the White House lawn spectacle lacked was one of those flailing inflatable tube men that entice/terrify potential customers. And I felt something similar again yesterday, watching the White House press secretary reveal herself as one of those countless modern idiots who have only heard of one war in history (the second world one) – and who don’t even understand that. Yesterday,Karoline Leavitt could be found declaring: “It’s only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now.” Bless! Taking a slightly longer look into history, I think America owed France a favour before it was the other way around. But getting lost in these stoopid yesteryear arguments is not really something winners do, is it? Anyone speaking at the superpower podium should at least give the impression of having bigger fish to fry.On a local level, I’ve no idea whether the UK will be one of the nations Trump accidentally ends up building. On recent form, and with our proven propensity for taking dumb decisions and electing limited or actively awful leaders, you wouldn’t put a whole load of money on it. But opportunities in a world that America has chosen to put in flux are openly presenting themselves. I can’t help feeling that fortune will favour those who are blithely pushing on with it, not plaintively pushing cars literally in their own back yard.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsTeslaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Roberts sees himself as a cautious conservative committed to protecting our institutions, but it increasingly looks as if history will view him very differently – as a deeply flawed chief justice who paved the way for the US to become an authoritarian state.Roberts can’t possibly want to be viewed that way. But it is inarguable that several decisions he played a huge role in – most notably Citizens United and last year’s startling ruling that gave presidentsfar-reaching immunity from prosecution– helped lay the groundwork forDonald Trump’s increasingly authoritarian presidency. How could Roberts not realize that the immunity decision he authored would embolden Trump to violate law after law and act like an authoritarian?Ever since Roberts became chief justice in 2005, two of his main objectives have been clear: to boost corporate America and to help Republicans consolidate power. Roberts didn’t seem to mind that several of his key court rulings, especially Citizens United, were turning the US into aplutocracy, with the rich and corporations having huge, undue power. But he must feel very uncomfortable that second-term Trump is quickly transforming the US into an authoritarian state, as Trump andElon Musksteamroll the constitution and federal law while the president seeks retribution against perceived enemies and fails to fully comply with several judicial decisions.Stocks tank and egg prices soar under Trump | Lloyd GreenRead moreCitizens United and several rulings that flowed from it – rulings that let corporations and wealthy individuals spend unlimited money on political campaigns – have played a key role in enabling Trump, in a mere few weeks, to create the most authoritarian presidency in US history. Thanks to those rulings, Musk was able to give more than$250mto help elect Trump and with that money, seemingly purchase unprecedented power by becoming Trump’s unelected chief operating officer and hatchet man.Citizens United was dangerously myopic. Not only did it fail to see that income inequality was rapidly worsening, but also failed to foresee that super-rich individuals would someday give gargantuan amounts – like Musk’s $250m-plus and Miriam Adelson’s$100m– that would go far to overwhelm the voices of average Americans. What’s more, having the world’s richest man at his side has supercharged Trump’s ability to act in authoritarian ways. Republicans in Congress have grown terrified of opposing Trump, whether on hisstabbing Ukraine in the back, his wholesale firings of federal employees or his trashing agencies that Congress funded, because they know that Musk can singlehandedly bankroll a primary challenge against them (and use his X account, with more than 200 million followers, to pummel them and sic the mob on them).Last July, in another dangerously myopic decision, Roberts shocked the legal world with his broadpresidential immunity ruling. In that case,Trump v United States, Roberts was so eager not to hamstring a president’s powers that his majority decision gave huge immunity to presidents when they take actions that would normally be seen as breaking the law. Roberts even laid out a roadmap for presidents to pretty much do whatever they want without having to fear prosecution – just consult with your attorney general before taking an action to ensure it is viewed as an official action and therefore qualifies for immunity, no matter how much it violates the law.Citizens United has played a key role in enabling Trump to create the most authoritarian presidency in US historyRoberts’ immunity ruling – which clashed with the desire of the framers of the constitution to constrain undue executive power, like George III’s – is blowing up in the chief justice’s face. The ruling gave presidents a bright green light to flout myriad laws, and Trump seems delighted to speed through that light by, for instance, failing to comply withseveral judges’ rulings. If Roberts wasn’t so short-sighted, he might have realized that it was perilous to issue an expansive immunity ruling just months before the authoritarian-minded Trump might win a second term.There are other Roberts decisions that have helped fuel authoritarianism. InRucho v Common Cause, he wrote that the court couldn’t do anything aboutegregious, anti-majoritarian gerrymandersthat might, for instance, let parties that receive less than 50% of the vote control state legislatures. Last year, Roberts led the way in preventing Colorado from kicking Trump off the ballot. In doing so he blatantly ignored the 14th amendment’s specific language that says no one should hold any civil office of the United States if they“shall have engaged in insurrection”, as Trump did in orchestrating the January 6 assault on the Capitol.Hopefully, Roberts realizes that some Roberts court rulings have helped Trump feel unbound and emboldened the president tofancy himself as kingand invoke Napoleon’s I-can-do-anything-I-want statement: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.”Crucially for Roberts and the nation, it might not be too late for the chief justice to do something meaningful to rescue his legacy, and our democracy. But doing something might not be easy because of the rightwing’s 6-3 supreme court supermajority and because Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas seem eager to serve as Trump’s lap dogs.In a hopeful sign, Roberts recently showed some discomfort with Trump’s riding roughshod over the constitution and Congress’s spending powers: he voted toblock Trump from halting $2bnin foreign aid.View image in fullscreen‘There are four important things that Roberts should seek to do as soon as possible to limit Trump’s headlong rush to authoritarianism.’Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAThat was promising, but there are four far more important things that Roberts should seek to do as soon as possible to limit Trump’s headlong rush to authoritarianism.First, Roberts should lead the court in ruling that Trump egregiously violates the constitution and Congress’s Article I spending powers whenever he suddenly freezes spending that Congress has approved and whenever he shuts down agencies, like the Agency for International Development (USAid), that Congress created.Second, Roberts has hinted he would overturn a unanimous 1935 ruling,Humphrey’s Executor, which says that presidents can’t fire members of congressionally created independent agencies. Opponents of that ruling want to give Trump the power to fire anyone in any agency – not just the National Labor Relations Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he fired board members, but even inspectors general who investigate agency fraud and abuses. By now Roberts should realize it would be a big mistake to overturn Humphrey’s Executor because that would speed up Trump’s efforts to build a top-down, you-had-better-listen-to-me authoritarian state. Letting Trump fire agency officials and inspectors general at will would mean that they’d be replaced by partisan yes men who would do whatever Trump wants. Trump might, for instance, order agencies like the NLRB or EEOC to bring charges against corporations he views as enemies.Third, Roberts needs to rein in Citizens United. Let’s hope that by now, even Roberts can see that Citizens United and its progeny have seriously undermined our democracy, that allowing billionaires to pour as much as they want into campaigns is anathema for democracy. Roberts should rush to invite several cases in which states have enacted limits on out-of-control campaign contributions, and then he should get the court to craft some sane campaign contribution limits to prevent the super-rich from warping and dominating our political system.Lastly, Roberts needs to find a way to limit last year’s alarmingly broad immunity decision, which many legal commentators say was poorly reasoned and did a terrible job explaining which presidential actions are immune from prosecution and which aren’t. Roberts’ immunity decision has evidently made Trump feel he needn’t worry about being prosecuted if he were to violate federal law by, perhaps, taking a bribe to pardon certain criminals.This is a very dangerous time for America’s democracy. Taking these actions would go far to rein in Trump’s authoritarian tendencies and make him think twice before violating the law. Not only that: these actions might make history look more kindly upon the myopic chief justice.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplaceExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionJohn RobertsDonald TrumpElon MuskLaw (US)Trump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s howJan-Werner MüllerTo begin with, universities should not be intimidated by the claim that public opinion is turning against them. That’s not necessarily trueTue 18 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 06.04 EDTShareLess than two months in office, theTrump administrationhas conclusively demonstrated two things: if it declares you an enemy, it will come after you; and when it comes after you, it will test the limits of legality.JD Vance alreadyprofessed years agothat professors are the enemy in his view. And the president himself is encouraging his underlings to adopt the strategy familiar from his decades in business: do something illegal and see if anyone sues. It is crucial that university leaders see the measures takenagainst Columbianot as an isolated incident, but as a test for how far the education system can be subjugated. In other words, it is not an isolated problem for one place but a collective challenge that requires a collective response.As citizens in Hungary, India, Turkey and plenty of other countries have learned the hard way in recent years, aspiring autocrats do not subscribe to the cliche of the “ivory tower”. They consider universities highly relevant. After all, universities, like courts and free media organizations, are sources of authority that might rival the leader’s. They also recognize that students can be effective in mobilizing – just think about what has beenhappening in Serbiarecently. Thus, authoritarians seek not merely to destroy the independence of institutions of higher learning; they also try to turn the rest of society against students.The Trump administration claims to be concerned about antisemitism; its supporters claim that universities are condoning “pro-genocidal campus quad glampers” (of course, the administration could prove its credentials for defending Jews much more easily if it sanctioned the president’s special adviser and supposed Doger-in-chief for his tweets and gestures, which are widely considered antisemitic).The fact that Columbia was punished mere days after a supposedly “comprehensive review” started,showsthat the method is unlikely to be fair and thorough. The Department of Education under Linda McMahon seems to be going after speech the government dislikes, with a view to intimidating all institutions. A blueprint for “reining in American universities” lays out the logic: according to a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, “to scare universities straight, McMahon should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”How we respond? To begin with, universities should not be intimidated by the claim that public opinion is turning against them.Surveysthat show a growing polarisation in public attitudes towards universities only demonstrate the effectiveness of decades of rightwing agitation. It is not a given that conservatives are inherently against universities. In other democracies, even voters of far-right parties are generallynot anti-universities, even if they can be mobilized against bogeymen like “gender ideology”.Universities must defend their truth-seeking and educational missions. They can point to obvious benefits, including economic ones. As the social scientist Adam Przeworski recentlypointed out, “every dollar spent in publicly funded research yields $8.30 after eight years”. But universities must also insist that one cannot pick and chose research, as in: say medical research OK, but climate research not. They must not allow governments to dictate which departments are legitimate and which should be placed in “receivership”, a demand by the Trump administration on Columbia (Orbán – a “model”, according to Vance – showed the way by simply prohibiting gender studies).Universities must avoid the trap of “we’ll sacrifice humanities if you leave us the hard sciences”. Humanities (and social sciences) are, after all, disciplines: its practitioners are disciplined by professional standards in what the former NYU president John Sexton calls “transparent, testable processes”. This is also why universities are governed by norms ofacademic freedom, not free speech; the latter is not subject to such processes.Critics assert that “professional standards” is a euphemism for leftist group-think. No academic would deny that there can be blind spots; but the case is not proved by saying that certain subjects have few professors who identify as Republicans. For the explanation might primarily be the trajectory of the Republican party, which has positioned itself as the anti-science and anti-critical-thinking party (not to mention that it is the party that tolerates prominent members with theories about “Jewish space lasers”).Practices in academia are not identical to those in courts, law firms, and hospitals – but there are overlaps in what it means to be a professional. Since aspiring autocrats will attack any source of independent judgment, professions should stand up for each other.To be sure, many universities have recently committed to “institutional neutrality”, which is to say: institutions of higher learning should not comment of all kinds of issues of the day. A university should be, according toa seminal statement of the principle, a home for critics, not itself be the critic.There is value to this idea, under two conditions: critics remain free to speak their minds (something that cannot be taken for granted, given the Trump administration’s intimidation tactics), and universities remain free to defend their core mission. After all, they can hardly be neutral about their own existence.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton University.Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsNew YorkAcademicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Though we will take steps to ensure our survival, the silence from London is deafeningTue 18 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 09.13 EDTShareDavid Lammythought he was reassuring Canadians. During his visit to Canada – for a meeting of G7 foreign ministers– he was asked about Donald Trump’s claims that the country shouldbecome the 51st stateof the US. The UK foreign secretary stressed that Canada is a “proud [and] sovereign nation”, and – in his view – would remain so. When pressed further, he invoked Canada’s shared history and monarch with the UK, and our work together during the second world war.Canadians are already well aware of that shared history, and how Britain has long benefited from its Commonwealth. My 96-year-old father just missed the age of enlistment in support of Britain in the 1940s but his two brothers, young boys from the Canadian prairies, lost their lives as RAF bombers. One of them is buried in the beautiful Commonwealth war cemetery in Harrogate.King Charles retains a role. Constitutionally, he remainshead of state. So was it too much to ask that Mr Lammy might add a few words – something like “we support Canada in its efforts to remain a strong, sovereign country”? Or, leaning in a bit further, a hint that the UK is “concerned” (a nice diplomatic word) about efforts to undermine our territorial integrity?It’s commonly said that politics is too often about words and not deeds. And yet words matter too, especially in the era of President Trump. Over recent years, we have seen his utterances initially dismissed as crazy – nothing to worry about, mere provocations or opening gambits in a negotiation. But over time, with every reiteration of the provocation – Barack Obama may not be American, Trump really won the 2020 election, the EU was set up to “screw” the US – those currying favour with Trump repeat the charge, diffuse it to various audiences (a process described as “sanewashing”), and ultimately enable him to act on the underlying logic of his words.So it is with Trump’s suggestion that Canada “only works”as a US state, and that Canada and the US are divided by an artificial line. How beautiful the geography would be if that border disappeared!Here inCanada, Trump’s first mention of annexing our country was thought to be a joke. Once upon a time, Canada’s G7 allies might have been forgiven for the same reaction. But no longer. If Trump is to be taken seriously but not literally, then the underpinnings of his predatory approach to international affairs need be acknowledged and factored into the foreign policy of all nation states.There are many scenarios activelyunder discussion in Canada– some more extreme than others. The US may not be about to invade us with military force, but it could undertake various actions to challenge our sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. That could start with the hollowing out of our economy to move production and wealth to the US, but extend to revising existing agreements on North American water resources (something Trump raised in discussions with the outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau), coercive deals for access to key resources, and subverting longstanding mechanisms for security and defence cooperation. There could also be challenges to Canada’s control over its Arctic region and interventions in our democratic processes. In a recentsurvey on foreign interference, Canadian respondents put the US second on the list of countries most likely to interfere in our upcoming election, ahead of Russia and India.At last week’s G7 meeting, Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio,took “sanewashing” to new heightsby presenting a two-sided debate about Canada’s sovereign status: “There’s a disagreement between the president’s position and the position of the Canadian government.” We can agree to disagree on this matter, he suggested, but work together on a “bunch of other things”.Let’s be clear on the heart of this difference of opinion. The governments of Canada and the US are disagreeing not only on the wording of a G7 communique on Ukraine (though they did so behind closed doors), or whether the G7 should act against “shadow fleets”circumventing sanctionsagainst Russia (an initiative that Canada pushed but failed to see emerge as a firm G7 commitment). The disagreement is about whether Canada works as a sovereign country. While Rubio insisted this wasn’t the focus of the G7 meeting, the audacity of the Trump administration’s predatory posture on territorial integrity, whether with respect to Greenland, Panama or Canada, demands a clear response.Lammy echoed Rubio’s line that there are areas where G7 allies disagree but argued that the UK’s goal isto find unityin a troubled world. This presumably explains why he expressed “regret” and “disappointment” about the trade war, but wouldn’t condemn US tariffs, and why – unlike Germany’s foreign minister and theEU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy– he would not be drawn on the US administration’s threats to Canadian sovereignty.Having studied and taught international relations at one of Britain’s finest universities, I’m not naive about the UK’s national interests or the imperative to nurture its “special relationship” with the US (by the way, Canada has long thought it had one of those too). But again, words matter. They need to be spoken in public, not just behind diplomatic closed doors, with an eye to multiple audiences.Surrendering to the “sanewashing” about Canada’s sovereignty is not in the UK’s interest, either in the current context of tariff wars, longer-term challenges to transatlantic economic and security cooperation, or broader global stability.Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, who visited the UK on Monday, has underscored that Canadians aren’t necessarily looking for our allies to “say nice things” about us. As “masters in our own house”, he saidon the day he was sworn in, we must take our own steps to ensure our survival. Canadians are becoming acutely aware that, given ourparticular geographyand history of interdependence with the US, we stand alone in this new predatory world. But as with the members of our second world war generation, we have long memories: we will remember who stood with us at a time of great consequence for our country, with both their words and their deeds.Jennifer Welsh is the director of the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill University, MontrealExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionG7Donald TrumpMark CarneycommentShareReuse this content"

But let’s build relationships with those whose values we shareAna Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and criticTue 18 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 06.04 EDTShareSlovenia is a small country and not just in physical size or because it has a population of 2.1 million. It has no real geopolitical status: it doesn’t shape the foreign policy or economy of other nations, but it is shaped by them. There is a prevailing belief inSlovenia, therefore, that we should focus on our soft power. Exceptional Slovenians will pull the country out of anonymity, putting the country on the map or securing recognition through their merit, this view holds.This is why the achievements of basketball players Goran Dragić andLuka Dončić, professional cyclistTadej Pogačar’s Tour de France victories, the two-time Olympic gold medallist Janja Garnbret,Laibach’s notoriety and Katarina Čas’s film roles are all framed as national opportunities.But none of these Slovenian-born figures, however impressive, generate as much excitement as the former Melanija Knavs, now Melania Trump. When Donald Trump’s return to power made Melania thefirst lady again, the media response in Slovenia was predictable: state-run outlets largely downplayed the connection, but commercial media wasted no time promoting it as an opportunity.Slovenia’s largest commercial television network, Pop TV (nomen est omen),aired an interviewwith Ivo Boscarol, a wealthy Slovenian businessman who attended theinauguration celebrationsin Washington. His argument? The Slovenian government had missed a golden opportunity to use Melania’s presence in the White House to improve its ties with the US.Now, as much as I enjoy cringing at Pop TV, I do take its influence seriously. It’s the most watched channel in Slovenia, meaning many Slovenians are likely absorbing and internalising this narrative. Some media commentators have even suggested that Melania might be a golden ticket in case “everything goes wrong”. I wonder if Trump’s rejection of the transatlantic alliance in favour of Vladimir Putin and his threat to launch a trade war on the EU mean that has already happened.The problem with this thinking, however, is that it is not grounded in any reality. There is nothing whatsoever inMelania’s memoirto indicate that she has any interest in fostering a political or economic relationship between her adopted country and Slovenia. On the contrary, the few times she mentioned Slovenia during her first stint as Flotus, it was typically a reference to its “totalitarian past”, perhaps playing into the American fear and loathing of communism and socialism.Melania grew up in the small town ofSevnicaand she left to pursue a modelling career before Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. She has typically kept quiet about her Slovenian heritage, even though much of her family still lives here, and she supposedly speaks Slovene with her son. In her speeches, she has consistently framed the US as the ideal, the place to be, while Slovenia is, well, a place to forget. Perhaps that’s why she has never seen fit to visit Slovenia during her tenure as first lady.Melania Trump doesn’t want to play the role of first lady – but she doesn’t mind making $28m | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBut let’s entertain the hypothetical for a moment. What if Melania’s positiondidpresent a unique opportunity for Slovenia? It’s hard to imagine, given that very little is known about her personal political views – except that sheopposed her husband’s stanceon abortion, a rare divergence. Still, her decision to marry a problematic public figure and then remain married to a leader displaying authoritarian tendencies speaks volumes. There is a certain complicity in that choice: a tacit approval of Trump’s idea that humiliating Volodymyr Zelenskyy or making Ukraine surrender to Russia’s demands is the basis for peace; of his renaming the Gulf of Mexico as theGulf of America; of his plan to rebuild Gaza but perhaps not for Palestinians; a nod tohis gender essentialism, demonisation of immigrants, climate denial; and even, ironically, abortion bans.So Melania could become Slovenia’s best opportunity to obtain a special relationship with a fascist regime in the making. Is that the opportunity Slovenia wants? I’m not naive – rightwing ideologies have supporters in Slovenia, and they no doubt look up to Trump. But funnily enough, I am more afraid of the neoliberal politicians in power, and the business elites of our country who see any connection – no matter how toxic – as a potential win. I would really like to know whether we are in danger of relations between Slovenia and the US being – as our hopeful prime ministerwished on Xafter Trump’s inauguration – “further strengthened”.For now, Slovenia is fortunate that Melania has yet to show any real interest in using her position to strengthen ties with the country of her birth. There is no diplomatic gambit to be made, no grand strategic move to consider. Any celebration of Melania in the White House will pass, if it hasn’t already, and with it – luckily – Slovenia’s fleeting hope of leveraging her for political gain. Perhaps our next global celebrity will offer a more constructive opportunity. Until then, Slovenia may be better served by focusing on building relationships based on shared values and long-term interests – rather than relying on the whims of problematic individuals.Ana Schnabl is a Slovenian novelist, editor and criticExplore more on these topicsMelania TrumpOpinionSloveniaEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Cultural differences yawn as wide as the Pacific between us. We were not sad to see “thebaby wombat grabber” go.The first mistake made by Montana-based tourist Sam Jones, Online Influencer, was to snatch a joey from its mother at night. Her second mistake was to sway the frightened creature in front of some gormless chucklehead who filmed her – giggling – and to upload the footage to the internet.Her video roared across local social media like measles after an RFK Jr confirmation. Australians united in vim; there were headlines, mass petitions and demands for her deportation.Attacking a young tourist over her treatment of a wombat is hypocritical – and misses the point | Georgie PurcellRead moreLast month, thekilling of up to 10 wombatsin the Victorian town of Venus Bay was crueller and more disgusting but did not obsess the discourse. Was it because Jones created a handy audio-visual to publicise her marsupial-monstering nitwittery that she faced such clamouring scorn?Or did Sam Jones’ most relevant mistake to Australians lie in being a chaotic dickhead … while American?The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, finds himself weeks out from an election navigating – as the modern leader must – the capricious behaviour of the nuclear-armed chaotic dickhead Americans re-elected as their president. Australians may have hoped our image as a floating zoo at the end of the world withcube-shitting mammalsmay have spared us Trump’sMake America Like the Start of the Great Depression Againtariffs policy but, unusually, luck has failed us. Steel and aluminium exports will be hitwith a 25% tariff, beef may be next – while our largest export to the United States turns out to bevaccines and related productsand hahahahaha, dear Christ but doom is certain.Given Annexing Canada is both an active Trump policy and so insane it wasn’t even suggested inProject 2025, Australian leadership must deftly manage an evolving geopolitical economic reality that most closely resembles a bus driver on an eight-day coke bender who has just locked his passengers in the vehicle to joyride through a minefield with a rabbit in his pants. Albanese’s colleague Ed Husiccalled Trump’s tariffs against Australia “a dog act”– he was deployed, one surmises, because he’s minister for science, so Trump’s GOP can’t acknowledge he exists. Resisting temptation to retaliate (with a tariff on “your stupid face”, perhaps?), Albanesedescribed Trump’s move as “unfriendly”. Within 24 hours,he suggestedwombat-botherer Sam Jones go Fafo with some crocodiles. Maybe there was something on his mind.Still, you’d rather be him than Peter Dutton, whose notoriously underdeveloped judgment muscle wasexerted in praisefor Trump as a “big thinker” barely a month and US$4tn-since-wiped-from-US-stock-valuations ago. Beyond Trump’s splatterfest of the world economy andtherefore your super balance(medicate before you look), the overwhelming impact of Trump 2.0 on Australians is evidence of how American we suddenly aren’t.Our two countries share a history as outposts of brutal British imperialism and the legacy of the coloniser’s language, yet at key points in our twinned story, our decisions have diverged.America received entrepreneurial puritans while Australia’s criminal class settler-colonistsbangedby the beach. America chose revolution from Britain, Australiathe slow path of reform. America’s structuralised slavery ended only after violent civil war. Australia’shistorical exploitation of enslaved peoplewas limited and ended through the efforts of a nascent labour movement, if one motivated by racist “they take our jobs” attitudes of the time.The differences weren’t overwhelming when we were both liberal democratic states,fighting togetherfor freedom in the first and second world wars … but does America, like, even do that any more?The new reality dawning in Australia: it can no longer rely on the USRead moreGenerations of migration and cultural reckoning (or non-reckoning) with local Indigenous cultures have since mobilised our societies towards different values that Trump’s extremity underlines. The deep polarisation he cheerleads confronts Australia’s “go along to get along” culture of compromise; his conservative policing of other people’s behaviour meets our “each to their own” tolerant shrug. Rather than the competitive individualism Trump personifies, Australian “mateship” persists as a virtue rooted in deep camaraderie, mutual support and egalitarian friendship, forged in the recognition on this burning, flooding, even-the-baby-wombats-hate-you land; you depend on each other, or you die.So while citizens of this sparser, less-dramatic country stay enthralled by the many US entertainment products we consume, it’s the very visibility of American culture to us that affirms our alienation from it. The internet may “speak American” but in the wake of Americans complaining online about healthcare, struggling through a mismanaged disaster or mourning another mass shooting, Australian pity speaks back in a register between “how can you let this happen?!” and self-satisfied relief.Cultural relationships are timely for Australia to consider. As Trump forsakes old alliances, the world realigns. The EUtightens its bonds, Canadagrows closerto Europe; could we? China seeks outnew spheres of influence. Outer rim figures from the Australian Labor party are suggesting the old Commonwealth relationships are worth re-formalising. In the scenario of nations obliged to choose between authoritarian allies, do we feel more secure with a peace-through-trade partner or a peace-through-rage-tweeting-and-Diet-Coke one?At least you know what you don’t want, baby wombat.It’s narcissistic and reckless, and it’s causing us distress. And everyone wants it gone, before the damage gets worse.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsPeter DuttonUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It seems likely that disabled people and those unable to work will be pushed even further into hardship.I am a single father and get personal independence payments (Pip). I have mental health issues and was diagnosed with autism towards the end of the Covid pandemic. I also receive universal credit, getting the limited capability for work-related activity element, which, we now know, will be cut for new claimants and frozen for existing ones like me. As inflation continues to rise, the freeze will mean that my income falls and I’m left struggling even harder to make ends meet. I already live on the edge of existence with the amount of money I have to survive on after paying unavoidable expenses. Every day is a new challenge – not knowing what food I can afford to buy, and is also more expensive in the local shops I have to use because I can’t afford to travel to larger supermarkets.In our family, there are no Christmas or birthday treats, no fun days out or the occasional takeaway, no newspapers or magazines, no TV or streaming subscriptions. If it is not an absolute necessity in order to survive then we can’t even consider spending on it. Every single penny in cost increases in recent times, from food to medicine or utility bills, is a penny that has to be found from elsewhere.But after years of cutting back there is just no way I will be able to cut back any further if the proposed changes to disability benefits go ahead. And ifLabouris so ready to cut social security, might there be even more of this to come?The uncertainty around the future and what lies ahead leaves me suffering from so much anxiety that I am barely able to focus on living. I spend most of my time worrying about how we will survive.Things have been difficult like this for a while. During the pandemic, living on a basic income, I couldn’t afford to cover everyday costs like school meals, school uniform, household bills and broadband. I was unable to replace much of my daughter’s school uniform throughout secondary school, and at the start of lockdown we did not have an internet connection at home – something that was essential for my daughter’s schooling. Covering the cost of broadband meant making enormous sacrifices. I have since been forced to switch off the heating at home and I have drastically reduced the amount of electricity we use by not turning on lights unless absolutely necessary and limiting myself to one cup of coffee each morning.My own health, both physically and mentally, has worsened over the years because I have neglected myself to make sure my daughter is as well cared-for as possible. Diet is a very important part of one of my health issues, but fresh, healthy, nourishing food is more expensive to buy, leaving me in a cycle of ill health and poverty.The changes to benefits andthe cuts announced todayare going to be another kick in the teeth for many, including me. I’m relieved that the freeze to my Pip payment that I was expecting has not been announced. But the changes that have been confirmed are still extremely dangerous. These announcements will push people’s stress and anxiety levels up, further worsening health issues for those needing to claim. Tightening the eligibility to make a claim will not do anything positive to help those in need.I’m anxious about thechanges to the assessment process, and that there will be big delays in getting people assessed for Pip, leaving people being wrongly assessed due to the shortage of fully trained staff and medical assessors who can properly understand how physical and mental health issues affect many people in different ways. There is already a shortage of qualified support workers and work coaches to spend the time needed to assess people in a way that does not make claimants feel as if they do not deserve the help and support they need with respect and dignity.I was one of a group of parents living in poverty who met with members of the government in Downing Street last year to push for changes to this broken system. I worry now that our pleas for change have been ignored. The governmentshould be helpingto support people with disabilities and those living on low incomes, as was promised in the lead-up to the last election. There must be other ways of bringing the government’s costs down.Today’s measures will take many years to implement, leaving those claiming disability benefits with even more uncertainty about their future and how they will be able to survive safely. The system is already difficult to understand and negotiate. But today’s announcements simply make things tougher for everyone at a time when they need help the most.Brian takes part inChanging Realities, a collaboration between almost 200 parents and carers on a low income, researchers at the University of York and Child Poverty Action GroupExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionDisabilityLabourPovertycommentShareReuse this content"

Even after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt, those observing Palestinian-Israeli affairs knew the ceasefire never really meant Israel ceased its fire on the besieged coastal territory.Between 22 January and 11 March, at least 700 Palestinians were either killed by the Israeli military or their bodies were retrieved from areas medics could not previously access,according toministry of health in Gaza as reported by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In the past two months, Israel has also reneged on the terms of the truce,refusing to allow tents and trailersfor people to seek shelter from the freezing cold that led to the death of several people, mainlybabies, health officials say.The ceasefire also stipulated that Israel would allow heavy machinery to enter Gaza to begin the process of removing the rubble. It did not do so, and the United Nations says it will take350 yearsto clear the destroyed homes and infrastructure and begin rebuilding if Israel does not lift the current blockade.Another stipulation – a rather important and urgent one – was allowing more aid to flow into Gaza. Although more trucks did enter during the initial phase of the agreement, Israeli authorities made it impossible for aid groups to make a dent in the dire humanitarian situation. On 2 March, hours after the first phase of its ceasefire deal expired, Israelblocked the entryof all aid shipments to Gaza, while simultaneously carrying out drone attacks, according to a BBC report.Even before Israel made this decision, it had already been systematically restricting the entry of everything from scalpels and scissors to generators,toys and spices. But with the complete halt of food, fuel and other necessities, humanitarian organisations feared Gaza was “facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity”, according to a UN report, with Médecins Sans Frontières accusing Israel of using aid as a “bargaining chip” with which to negotiate.The so-called truce was a political manoeuvre, a pause that allowed Israel to reset the clock on its war while maintaining the core elements of its siege and occupation. Israel continued its war on Gaza through an ongoing choking blockade, aerial attacks, and the killing and abuse of Palestinian prisoners. In the West Banka parallel warrages on, with Israeli forces raiding Palestinian homes, carrying out assassinations anddetainingpeople in the thousands.This is a pattern we have seen before: an overwhelming Israeli assault, a mounting civilian death toll, global outrage leading to calls for a ceasefire, and then a brief de-escalation. But during that time, Israel fortifies its military positions, re-arms, and sets the stage for the next round of violence. For instance, in2008-09’s Operation Cast Lead, and after a six-month ceasefire, Israel launched a devastating 23-day assault on Gaza, claiming Hamas had violated the truce. However,reportsindicated that Israel had planned the attack months in advance, using the ceasefire to prepare militarily.Israel often agrees to ceasefires when international scrutiny mounts. By doing so, it presents itself as the reasonable party while shifting blame on to Palestinians when violence resumes. By engaging in ceasefire talks without addressing occupation and the siege,Israelensures that the status quo remains unchanged, preventing any long-term resolution. A real ceasefire would require an end to Israel’s ongoing occupation and the suffocating siege on Gaza – not just a temporary pause in violence. Until then, any so-called truce remains an illusion.WhatGazaneeds is not another fleeting truce, but a fundamental shift in international policy – one that stops treating Israel’s actions as above reproach and starts holding it accountable for its violations of human rights and international law. Anything less will ensure that this cycle of violence continues, with devastating consequences for the people of Gaza and the Palestinian people overall.Dalia Hatuqa is an independent journalist specialising in Palestinian-Israeli affairsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our obsession with getting enough shut-eye stems, I suspect, from the fact that so many of us feeltiredallthetime.Akin to their cursed revival oflow-rise jeans, the TikTok generation have repackaged a perennial preoccupation and given it their own spin: sleepmaxxing. Co-opting its name from another online phenomenon (looksmaxxing), the term refers to any number of hacks that purport to improve sleep.What is sleepmaxxing?On social media, sleepmaxxing encompasses a wide variety of sleep tips and tricks, including but not limited to: taping your mouth shut to forcibly breathe through your nose, using nasal dilators to widen the nostrils, and taking supplements such as magnesium and melatonin.Using red lights rather than regular lights in the bedroom supposedly boosts melatonin production, a claim conveniently made by a company that sells sleep lights.As wearable smartwatches and fitness trackers have grown in popularity, so has an interest inmonitoring one’s own sleep. Smart trackers now provide sleep scores, with breakdowns of sleep phases, measures of sleep efficiency and even suggested bedtimes.Much of the content around sleepmaxxing online is couched in the language of self-optimisation, as well as a looksmaxxing-adjacent pursuit of aesthetics: sleeping on your back prevents your face becoming asymmetric, influencers claim, while a mouth taping brand suggests its product will give its users “a perfectly aligned jaw”.What does the evidence say?Though consumer sleep trackers are improving in accuracy, “there is quite a bit of variability between devices”, according to Melinda Jackson, an associate professor at Monash University.“Most consumer-grade sleep tracking devices are better at estimating total sleep time than accurately distinguishing between light and deep sleep,” Prof Fatima Yaqoot, an epidemiologist and sleep scientist at the University of the Sunshine Coast, says. “Relying too much on a ‘perfect sleep score’ or fixating on achieving an ideal number may lead to sleep-related anxiety and worsen the overall sleep experience.”Sleep perfectionists: the exhausting rise of orthosomniaRead moreSleep researchers have coined a term for this anxiety – “orthosomnia”, which is often driven by sleep-tracking devices.“The best measure of sleep quality is how you feel upon waking,” Yaqoot says. “If you wake up feeling rested and refreshed, that means you slept well” – regardless of what a device reports.So will a shut mouth make for better shut-eye? Probably not.“Some of the concerns raised on social media with mouth breathing have been around poor oral health, increasing risk of infection, and poor sleep,” Jackson, a registered psychologist specialising in the treatment of sleep disorders, says.“Nasal breathing can be beneficial in terms of filtering and humidifying the air, as well as improving lung function through promotion of diaphragmatic breathing.”She notes that there have been very few studies looking at the effect of mouth taping during sleep. And, Yaqoot points out, it can worsen airway obstruction in people with sleep apnoea.As for nasal dilators, “I don’t see any harm in doing that if you are a nose breather”, Jackson says. “If it’s not going to be harmful and you’d like to give it a go, and it works for you, great, but there’s possibly a bit of placebo effect in these strategies.”The best position for sleeping depends on who you are: if you’re heavily pregnant, say,side sleeping is safest. Side or stomach sleeping can also reduce snoring, while sleeping on one’s back may reduce lower back pain and the likelihood ofskin changes.What about melatonin? Should I take a supplement?Increasing drowsiness at the end of the day is driven by natural increases in melatonin, produced by the brain’s pineal gland. “When we wake up in the morning [and] light hits our eyes, that production stops,” Jackson says. “It’s low during the day and then starts to peak in the evening to help us with sleep onset.”Shorter wavelengths of light – such as blue lights from digital screens – are more likely to stop or slow the production of melatonin. “I wouldn’t say that red light enhances production of melatonin but it just doesn’t impact it as much as other wavelengths,” Jackson says. “When we talk about light, there’s not just the wavelength but also the lux – the illuminance of that light. Any light, if it’s bright enough, will impact our sleep to some degree.”Melatonin supplements can help to reset the internal body clock for people with jet lag or after shift work but are “not particularly helpful” for improving sleep in those who don’t have a diagnosed sleep disorder, Yaqoot says. “While melatonin use is considered safe for the short term, since in addition to sleep it also affects reproductive hormones and other biological functions, there are risks to affecting these functions, and long-term use needs more evidence.”Magnesium supplements are primarily useful in people with diagnosed deficiencies but “there’s currently limited evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium on insomnia symptoms”, Jackson says.What do experts recommend for a good night’s sleep?“Night-time sleep is directly influenced by what we do during the day,” Yaqoot says. Experts suggest:Beginning the day with exposure to sunlight, to align the body’s internal clockKeeping consistent bed- and wake times, even on weekendsLimiting afternoon naps to no more than 30 minutesReducing caffeine intake later in the afternoonAvoiding heavy meals right before bedReducing screen exposure before bedtimeDeveloping a calming pre-bedtime routine, such as reading, meditation or deep breathing.Good sleep hygiene also means avoidingbed rottingwhere possible, Yaqoot says. “While rest is essential … spending long hours in bed while awake weakens the brain’s association between bed and sleep, making it harder to fall and stay asleep.”On average, it takes 20 to 30 minutes to fall asleep, Jackson says. “If you’re falling asleep within four to five minutes, it can be a sign that you are experiencing some sleep deprivation.”Behavioural changes alone, though, are insufficient to address underlying sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnoea, which require support from a health practitioner.Donna Lu is Guardian Australia’s science writerAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But time is running out for the government to make a case for itTue 18 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 09.12 EDTShareFive years ago this weekend, life as we knew it was suspended overnight. Though with hindsight it seems amazing that it took Britain so long to lock down in the face of a gathering pandemic, at the time the pace of events felt dizzyingly fast.It took a still-young government time to realise its manifesto was toast; that it would be forced into decisions either it or the public hated, which would nonetheless beat the alternative. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was visibly reluctant to rip upa budgetwhose ink was barely dry and insteadspend billionspaying people not to go to work. Yet ironically, it is furlough for which history may remember him most kindly.I won’t pretend that this still-new Labour government finds itself in exactly the same predicament, despite facing the collapse of a world order with grave consequences for national security. This time, life won’t change overnight. We have the relative luxury of perhaps four or five yearsto rearm, rebuild alliances across Europe and develop resilience. That means not just weaning the country more urgently off fossil fuels or tackling Russian disinformation on social media, but being honest about what has changed and how.Britain’s armed forces are so hollowed out by years of austerity that in truth even spending 3% of GDP on defence may not be enough to plug the gaps in European security left by a rapidly retreating US. Borrowing is maxed out, which leaves either spending cuts of the kind currently traumatisingLabourbackbenchers – potentially deep enough to unravel us as a society – or tax rises. There is a tiny, shrinking window of time in which this government could make the connection between such a painful tax rise and the chill felt across Europe when watching the White House turn on Volodymyr Zelensky. Call it a defence levy, a national resilience programme, a patriot tax, even, if you want to win over the Sun – but time is running out to start making the case for it. If taxes will ultimately have to go up this parliament, better come out fighting for it early than be miserably backed into it closer to an election.Nobody pretends that would be easy. Taxes are already high by British standards, if not by European ones, and the cost of living crisis has not disappeared. Unfortunately, the money needed won’t all come from the kind of magical unicorn wealth taxes that people always hopefully suggest at this point could raise untold billions while only affecting a handful of multimillionaires, but which in practice never quite stack up like broad-based progressive tax rises do.Manifesto promises on tax and spending were already stretched to snapping point and Labour is now reaching the point of having to choose which to break. Either Rachel Reeves will have to raise taxes again eventually, despite suggesting last autumn that shewouldn’t be deliveringa budget like that again, or the better lives this government was elected to deliver won’t happen. The former would be hideously unpopular but might help avoid the latter, which in the worst-case scenario could be terminal not just for Labour but for mainstream politics. Keir Starmer represented a last throw of the dice for too many voters who think politicians talk a good game but nothing really changes. If this doesn’t work out, all that is left that hasn’t been tried is something more darkly Trumpian.Many said the Starmer era would be just Tory-lite – now it’s worse than that. Time to stop the pretenceRead moreThe welfare cuts over which Labour MPs have agonised are only the tip of a spending-review iceberg. Last week’s unusually widespreadcabinet leaks–suggesting ministers from Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner to Shabana Mahmood and Yvette Cooper raised concerns about threatened raids on their budgets – were notable because all are charged with delivering things that matter to the ordinary working people we are told Starmer is most worried about, and because of wider concerns among some MPs that he is outsourcing too many big judgment calls to the Treasury. If a Labour government can’t build more houses, control crime and immigration, and generally tackle the impression that nothing in this country works, it is doomed. Fixing what was broken within the tight constraints that – for perfectly understandable electoral reasons – Reeves set herself was always going to be hard, but it will be impossible if any proceeds of growth vanish into the Ministry of Defence.There are obviously a million good reasons not to do something that would be seen as ripping up manifesto pledges barely a year into government. When YouGov tested the idea of raising taxes “on people like you” to fund defence in February, admittedly before that shocking encounter in the White House,less than one-thirdof voters were in favour. Raising taxes on what might be the brink of a trade war-induced recession would be economically risky, and the political damage goes even deeper: wasn’t the whole point of Starmerism to make smaller promises, but actually keep them? Yet that’s precisely why, if Labour is going to end up forced into a reset anyway, an emotionally compelling case has to be made that something profound has changed.As the former Treasury guru Ed Ballspointed out recentlyon his podcast, and as Sunak came to realise in March 2020, sometimes the world does turn on its axis and there’s no pretending it hasn’t. There has been a new boldness to Starmer as he grapples with this crisis. Now he must bring that quality to paying for it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudgetRachel ReevesKeir StarmerTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

But the framing and the targeting of these cuts is wrongTue 18 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 07.13 EDTShareWhile those with disabilities wait in trepidation to hear what Liz Kendall’s green paper will do, the whole country waits to glean the nature of this Labour government. Is it really going to reach down among the poorest and weakest to take £5bn to plug the deficit? Why take from them, not from those with the broadest shoulders, or from an even spread across all citizens?Distraught Labour MPs echoEd Balls’s words: “It’s not a Labour thing to do.” The number of rebels matters less than the incomprehensible message sent out about what Labour is. Party focus groups suggest voters think claimants swing the lead, butpolls suggests otherwise: 27% say support is too mean, 26% that it is about right and just 26% that disability benefits are too generous. Wait for the hardship cases to swing fickle attitudes.The benefit system does need reform and new priorities. After an era of exceptional brutality under the Tories, with jobcentre managers target-driven to throw people off the books on any excuse, often tricking the helpless, the system relaxed as the pandemic and the years that followed saw claimant numbers soar. Basic universal credit (UC) for unemployment, shockingly low at a sub-survivable £393.45 a month, is enough to drive anyone into a depressed state and allow them to qualify for disability benefit, which would lift them above starvation.It will be good news if Kendall raises that basic UC rate. That the government has retreated from freezing personal independence payments (Pip) is also welcome: cuts would have fallen on all, including the most severe cases. However, eligibility may be toughened. How nauseating to hear George Osbornegloat on his podcast: “I didn’t freeze Pip. I thought it would not be regarded as very fair.” This is the man who impoverished hundreds of thousands of children bystripping £5,500 from families.It’s been rightly said that too many are written off, as people are parked for years, living on the edge, unable to take risks. The right to try jobs without forfeiting a return to benefits is a good plan. Very welcome will be £1bn for work coaches with time for personal support for people who have lost their nerve about working. Learn from Labour’s new deal for employment in 1997, which proved well-funded back-to-work programmes succeed. And, yes, benefit priorities do need reform, if that means shifting the emphasis towards children and the million young people not in work or training (Neets) before triple-locked pensioners.“Too many are overdiagnosed with mental illness,” Wes Streeting says. Is that a threat to cut payments or a promise of genuine help? We wait to hear if £5bn really is to be cut, and if that’s immediate or gradually by 2029. Should savings be scored only as people are successfully helped back to work, or will an axe fall regardless?There are lessons to be taken from recent history: Harriet Harman, social security secretary, sat white-faced on the frontbench in 1997, deserted by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who strong-armed her into cutting single-parent benefits as pledged in the manifesto to mirror Tory plans. (Harman, as scapegoat, was fired soon after.) Labour MPs trouped in to vote, as hangdog as Rodin’sThe Burghers of Calaisthat stands outside parliament: 47 MPs rebelled and, it was reported, some wept.That harsh act stayed scorched in the memory of disillusioned Labour people, never expunged despite what came after: the money was soon restored many times over in new working family tax credits, child tax credits, childcare and child benefit. But Labour often failed to herald its best policies, or fix them into public imagination: generosity scared it as a message. Sticking to pre-election tough pledges caused public spending to fall steeply in its first two years after 1997. But as Harman says now, hindsight is a fine thing: what could the party risk after four lost elections? As now, it feared that losing fiscal credibility would cause a Liz Truss-type market crash. Similarly, this government seems unclear on what symbols it wants to imprint.How far will Starmer risk pushing Labour MPs to swallow welfare cuts?Read morePut it bluntly. In this most unequal country, where over decades wealth and income as a share of GDP have been shifting from employees to owners, from wages to capital, why would a Labour government reach for £5bn from a group – disabled people – who, the Resolution Foundation reports, live in households with44% less incomethan the median? To be disabled at working age is almost always to be poor, living in a poor district. (In Wokingham only4% of working-age peopleclaim a health-related benefit; in Blackpool,the figure is 19%.)This is only a starter. More cuts are on the way, the cabinet was warned last week, with every departmenttold to model cuts of 10% or more, with the overall sum revealed next week in Rachel Reeves’s spring statement. If so, the fate of already-stricken public services looks frightening. Or did Keir Starmer mean it when he said,yet again, last week: “No return to austerity. We are not going down that route”? No new tax, no borrowing, no austerity – all three pledges can’t be kept. But the US’s abandonment of Europe changes everything. A call to rearm rescinds all former fiscal rules in every European country. For Britain, with alarming debt already, taxing is the way, not cutting spending. Britain stilltaxes and spendsless than our neighbours.Times are far harder than in 1997. But Reeves is a Keynesian – read her book praising Keynesian economists who would all tell her cutting is no solution to near-stagnant growth.If spending cuts will be as deep as predicted, that demands a strong act of faith from Labour supporters that things will eventually get better. But remember this: every Labour government always improves the living standards of those with least, lifts more children out of poverty, revives the NHS, schools and local councils. In this dark economic moment, it takes trust to believe Starmer and Reeves too will, in the end, do as Labour always does.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionDisabilityWelfareLiz KendallKeir StarmerRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

A cyclone also menaced the east coast of Australia.While Alfred didn’t give the Earth the bump it desperately needsin the climate polls,it has coincided with a fillip– to the prime minister with his best approval ratings since the defeat of the voice to parliament referendum in October 2023.Cyclone Donald continues his own whirlwind of destruction of what was until recently a global democratic consensus led by the most powerful government on earth.Most Australians look on with horror, although there is a notable exception emerging: young men between the ages of 18 and 35. Because we ran a double sample (2,000 respondents) this cycle, we have a big enough pool to get a better feel for how these lads are thinking.To what extent do you think that Trump’s presidency will have a positive or negative impact on the following?Trump’s more muscular form of government sits well with our archetypical lad, who embraces his rugged individualism and sense of grievance egged on by American podcasters laced with a machismo nurtured by UFC.On everything from world peace to climate change to the Australian economy these young men are twice as likely to see Trump as a positive influence compared with the broader population.To be clear, our findings do not find a one-dimensional conservative cohort – young men remain more progressive voters than older men. But there is a clear gender cleavage on voting intention among generation Z: significantly more likely to voteCoalition(38 to 25) and less likely to vote Green (12 to 26).Our lads are also by far the demographic group most supportive of Peter Dutton, their +20 net approval of the opposition leader (55-35) a full 40 points more positive than women the same age (32 to 52).Do you approve or disapprove of the job Peter Dutton is doing as opposition leader?What’s going on? Another extreme event, the global pandemic, which reached our shores five years ago this month and continues to cast its pall over our body politic, might help explain.The pandemic marked a high point in trust in government as authorities moved rapidly to protect public safety and ensure businesses did not go under, but this week’s Guardian Essential report shows that, in retrospect, many voters are not so sure.Remember,approval of government performancesat in the high 70s through much of 2020 and 2021, with citizens rallying around their leaders. That gloss has well and truly lifted, especially in Victoria where lockdowns were the strictest.Action that prevents a bad outcome is always difficult to quantify (think Kevin Rudd’s lack of credit for avoiding the GFC) but these residual attitudes create a brand challenge for federal Labor in one of the few states where the state government has not changed in the intervening years.But there are broader pandemic hangovers that will affect the election contest in myriad and contradictory ways.The cost of living crisis that has defined the political zeitgeist is in part a consequence of the impact of this event on the global economy, as the unprecedented debt to prop up societies was wound back.Secondly, the economic and social impact of the lockdowns has shifted the way we work, the way we connect with each other, how we consume information and who we choose to trust from the concrete to the virtual. For young voters, who were as young as 13 during the lockdown, these changes have been life-changing.Most profoundly, by showcasing exactly what can be done by government in a crisis, the pandemic response has had the perverse effect of making business as usual governing seem even more technocratic and incremental.Guardian Essential poll: Albanese scores highest approval rating in almost 18 months as support for Dutton slipsRead moreThe Albanese government may argue it has had an active policy agenda in areas as diverse as energy transition, IR reform, aged care, early learning, the roll-out of Medicare clinics and what it hails as the biggest commitment to social housing in Australia’s history.But after the pandemic, these measures seem a bit like the petty street crim taking on Crocodile Dundee: “That’s not government intervention.Thisis government intervention!”For all his manifest deficiencies Trump instinctively scratches this itch. His first 100 days will make Gough Whitlam look like a laggard and, while his focus is on breaking government, he is doing it fast.This may be where Dutton gets some advantage from his nuclear fantasy, particularly among the lads. At least he has big, bold plans to shake things up while the other side just seems to be doing their knitting.But there’s also risk for Dutton in overreach. His pledge to order public servants to stop working from home may be the moment Icarus flew too close to the Orange Sun. Even among Dutton-curious lads this has been dismissed as “boomer shit” in focus groups.To what extent do you support or oppose the removal of working from home provisions for all public service workers?In light of these findings it’s not surprising that Dutton has walked back this element of his Trump-lite agenda, but the impression he is playing for cheap votes will persist as long as he swings so hard.Dutton’s edict to return to work or job share is one issue where the lads are on the same page with young women because they have lived a shared reality.Maybe that’s the antidote for this growing gender divide. While the lads are hard to reach through traditional means, they are sharing their life journey with much more progressive women, for whom both climate change and the threat of Trump are very real.With no sign the storms – whether human-induced or “acts of gods” – are abating, giving young women the support to trust their worldview and drag the lads back from the fight club might be our most pressing political challenge.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

We meet the Barnett twins among the Southend amusement arcadesTue 18 Mar 2025 12.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 19.00 EDTShareJack and George Barnett arrange to meet me at the Hope Hotel, an 18th-century pub in their native Southend. With Talking Heads on the jukebox and pints already flowing at midday, it feels like we’ve stepped back into the good-timeEssexseaside town of old. The twins arrive, Jack in a dark grey tweed and black fleece, George in knitwear and leather jacket. They suggest going outside so we don’t have to shout over 1980s hits, but if anything the sonic interference of Southend – all amusement arcades and revving motors – is worse.It turns out this chimes with the creation of Crooked Wing, the fifth album from their bandThese New Puritans. Jack was living on an industrial estate in Tottenham, London, between factories and evangelical churches. “I think some of the loudness,” he says, “comes from trying to compete with all the machinery and religious ecstasy.”Jack broke off working on the album to travel with a Brazilian circus – its aerialist sings on the recordWith its melancholy, exultation and occasional blasts of menacing drums, Crooked Wing is instantly recognisable as a These New Puritans record, but the band are now going to places they have never been before in their two-decade avant-pop career.The album begins with a 10-year-old member of Southend Boys’ Choir singing “I am buried / I am deep underground”, over the sound of the organ in St Mary’s and All Saints Church in Stambridge, a village outside Southend where the Barnetts’ grandfather was once organist. The locale soon shifts to the Peloponnese on Bells, the first song Jack wrote for the album, which stemmed from a particularly fruitful field recording of a Greek orthodox church.Pop singerCaroline Polachek– a fan of the band – is on Industrial Love Song, a duet imagining two cranes serenading each other on a building site, which launched last week with a surreal video directed by Harley Weir with creative direction from George: the protagonist is a middle ages knight covered in a translucent goo reminiscent of Thames mud. Other tracks were recorded across the estuary in Ramsgate, where co-producer Graham Sutton lives. “It’s sleepier than Southend, and probably a bit less edgy,” says Jack. “But it does have the largest Wetherspoon’s in the world.”George was born two minutes before Jack and has the slightly frustrated air of an older brother who is aware of the thinness of his seniority. During the interview, the 37-year-olds put on a united front, constantly checking with one another if what they say is OK to put on the record. But occasionally there is a scrap over who gets to tell a story. George to Jack: “It doesn’t matter. That’s irrelevant.” Jack to George: “Just wait a second. Let me fucking talk.”Jack is the singer, multi-instrumentalist and principal songwriter, George is the drummer and percussionist, but also in charge of visuals, artwork and stage direction. While Jack takes after their organist grandfather, George is more like their steelworking amateur boxer grandad on the other side, and on the face of it their lifestyles could not be more different.George is a successful model for clients including Gucci, and has lived in east London for years with his wife, Pixie Geldof. The couple have a child but, given his partner’s experiences growing up in the world of celebrity, he is reluctant to go into detail. Geldof is “amazing,” he simply says. “I adore her.”Jack is now back in Southend and has a regime for writing songs, but is also restless. While working on Crooked Wing, he broke off to travel with a Brazilian circus, accompanying his then-girlfriend, an accomplished aerialist who sings on the record. He also spent time living in Athens.View image in fullscreenFlower power … the lineup in 2007 with Thomas Hein, centre.Photograph: Avalon/Getty ImagesI first saw These New Puritans playing upstairs at the Grand Hotel in 2005, a large, now defunct pub in Leigh-on-Sea, close to Southend, where the band (and I) grew up. By then they were already steeped in local musical lore. Their father, a quick-witted builder born in London, would sink pints at the Grand with Lee Brilleaux, singer with Dr Feelgood, whose guitarist Wilko Johnson taught their mum to play. She even stitched togetherDr Feelgood’s white suits – though, George says, “the sweat took the pink lining through the suit and turned them pink, and so their manager refused to pay”.After years playing in various bands, the brothers enlisted their friend Thomas Hein, and later their cousin Sophie Sleigh-Johnson. A Fall song inspired their name and their scratchy sound fitted with the 00s post-punk revival, so they were quickly subsumed into a vibrant Southend scene that also included the Horrors. Their dad drove them to gigs in his work van. “All his tools were still in the back,” says Jack. “It almost felt like doing a heist.”In 2008 they recorded Beat Pyramid, a frenetic album bristling with electronics and ideas. But instead of riding the wave of a period now known as “indie sleaze”, the band recoiled from being “subtly channelled into areas that aren’t the most interesting”, Jack says. “And so from that point on, I decided that, whatever the cost, we would just pursue the music to the bitter end.”The result was 2010’s acclaimed albumHidden, which provided the blueprint for future These New Puritans records, fusing the propulsive battle-rap-meets-Beefheart rhythms of Beat Pyramid with the pointillism of Steve Reich and choral arrangements of Benjamin Britten, who loved the east of England coastline as much as Jack.Jack learned to write stave notation at the age of 21 for Hidden and the band later performed the album live with the Britten Sinfonia, London Children’s Choir – and their mate Rory smashing melons with a hammer. To a UK music press still searching for the next Liam and Noel, it was a befuddling about-turn, but to the brothers it made perfect sense. “It was closer to what it was like when me and George were making music when we were seven or eight,” says Jack, “on an old four-track in the loft with one microphone and a pair of bongos and an acoustic guitar.”Hidden set in motion an astonishing – though slowly gestated – run of records whose fans included Elton John, Björk and Massive Attack. With its wide-eyed Edenic feeling, Crooked Wing nestles back into the same territory as the band’s masterpiece, 2013’s Field of Reeds – an album that riffed on the intensity of Jack’s internal world as well as Essex’s beguiling islands – rather than the slick, propulsive, Berlin-penned Inside the Rose, which came out in 2019. There’s more space between the notes again, and the organ influence is greater, while Jack’s piano playing sounds more accomplished and natural.View image in fullscreenScratchy post punk … live in 2010.Photograph: Jordi Vidal/RedfernsSince Hidden, the way of working has been set: music written by Jack is then sent to George, a process George describes as “finding a diamond in the rough”. Once the shape of the music has been agreed, Jack writes out the notation like a film score. The Barnetts are now the only constant Puritans after Sleigh-Johnson left to become a writer and artist and Hein retrained as a neuroscientist (though he returned for a percussion cameo for this record). The band expand to make each album, with additional musicians sought, booked and recorded as quickly as possible so as not to run up too large a bill. Jack lays down vocals outside the studio, improvising in a trancelike state, sometimes in hotel rooms.“All of life was sent into the mincer” for the lyrics this time around, he says. The Ukraine war was a background influence: “Maybe in the back of my mind, it makes you realise life can be harsh and brutal, but you do your best to build a little edifice of beauty around it.”How have they steered this ambitious artistic project through the turbulent economic headwinds of the 21st century? “It’s always a battle,” Jack says. “It’s just the way it is for musicians now.” When making the album Inside the Rose, he was existing on one euro a day: his top tips are to live on tinned food and “get fruit at the end of the day at the market”. He also composes music for adverts: clothes, cars, perfume, food. “It makes a nice change from working on stuff that is yours. A palate cleanser.”George says the modelling industry isn’t what it once was, but his earnings have contributed to projects such asWe Want War’s music video in 2009, with its slo-mo aquatic acrobatics.View image in fullscreen‘It’s always a battle’ … George and Jack Barnett.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianPart of the reason it has taken six years for Crooked Wing to appear is because the Barnetts wanted to make the full album before securing a label to release it. “So sometimes we have to stop,” says Jack. “Oh, we want to do this session. Well, we have to wait until we have enough money to do it. So you have to be prepared to take a massive financial hit.” Luckily Domino, home to Arctic Monkeys and Wet Leg, snapped up the finished album: a series of songs that seemingly sit outside of time, sounding like both the future and the past.While Jack’s songwriting prowess is obvious, the band is a complete collaboration. Jack gives the example of album opener Waiting, with George paring it back to just an organ and that choirboy’s voice. “That completely transformed it,” Jack says. “It’s almost like I’m up close looking at all the cells and the bacteria – and George is looking at the whole body.”Crooked Wing will be released on 23 May by Domino.

On their own dime, Xhloe Rice and Natasha Roland rocked up at the festival in 2022 to try their luck. The US duo’s queer western clown show,And Then the Rodeo Burned Down, went from an audience of seven to winning aFringe First awardand selling out. They repeated both feats with another two-hander in 2023. And another in 2024. This summer, the best friends – who perform as Xhloe and Natasha – will stage all three prize winners in Edinburgh.That is, if they can afford to get there. “We haven’t bought our flight tickets yet,” says Rice, highlighting the grim economic truth behind fringe success. “We have to wait until we make abitmore money.”In the scouts, the boys did archery, knot-tying and camping. The girls? We sold cookies and made friendship braceletsWe meet at Soho theatre in London where the pair are performing their second hit,What If They Ate The Baby?, and their most recent one,A Letter to Lyndon B Johnson or God: Whoever Reads This First. Both shows playfully consider Americana and gender using absurd comedy, distilled dialogue and striking choreography. Each has a light touch yet ambushes your emotions. The former is a melodrama-cum-horror detonating 1950s domestic ideals, with the pair wearing pastel frocks and serving neon green spaghetti. In the latter they portray muddy scouts, in a Boys’ Own caper, venturing into tragedy.The scouts, Ace and Grasshopper, await a visit from the eponymous US president who served from 1963 to 1969. The Beatles’ Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da gives the show its jaunty rhythm but war looms on the horizon. “We don’t say ‘Vietnam’ ever in the show,” points out Roland. “We don’t say ‘1950s’ or ‘housewives’ in Baby … We don’t like to spoon-feed every detail. As writers we usually prefer giving the audience the responsibility to fill in the gaps.”View image in fullscreenMythical boyhood … A Letter to Lyndon B Johnson or God: Whoever Reads This First.Photograph: © JCB VISUALSTalking a mile a minute, Rice and Roland have developed a hive mind and frequently finish each other’s sentences. With A Letter to LBJ, they wanted to explore “mythical boyhood”, says Rice. “We felt like we missed out on something because we were raised girls.” To be a boy, they were taught, “was all about skinning your knees and jumping fences and playing baseball. And you had no troubles. It’s kind of insidious and speaks to the myth of a great former America that doesn’t exist any more and it’s weaponised.” Both were girl scouts. “The boys did archery, knot-tying, camping.” And the girls? “Sold cookies,” says Roland. “Made friendship bracelets,” adds Rice. “But I want to shoot an arrow!” protests Roland.The show was almost a letter to Richard Nixon “but he has a flatly negative connotation”. Johnson intrigued them as he had a more complex legacy. Defined by the conflict in Vietnam, he made considerable achievements in social welfare and civil rights. Ace and Grasshopper start out simply “playing good guys and bad guys” but the theatre-makers delve into grey areas. “America is the good guy – you’re told that as a kid,” says Roland. “Then you hit a certain point where you have your own thoughts and it’s maybe … ‘Oh, we’re not?’”As president, Johnson championed the Kennedy Center, breaking ground for it with a gold-plated spade in 1964 and heralding the government-funded, bipartisan venue as “a living force for the encouragement of art”. Last month, Donald Trump ousted its chair to preside over the board himself and ensure, he declared on social media, “no more drag shows, or other anti-American propaganda”.As fringe theatre-makers, the pair weren’t planning on playing the venerable venue any time soon, but the Kennedy Center is “representative of culture in America” says Rice. What happens at the top “trickles down”, adds Roland. “When you start to govern what artists are allowed to make, that’s dangerous territory.”View image in fullscreenPlaying with fire … And Then the Rodeo Burned Down.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianTo save money and create A Letter to LBJ, the pair moved back into their family homes. Both have fathers who were in the military. “Most of our childhoods were in post 9/11 America – one of the most nationalistic times in recent US history,” says Rice. The friends grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, and became inseparable at school, where Roland was Rice’s tour guide on orientation day. Studying acting at different universities inNew York, they collaborated on a “rogue” production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at Rice’s college. “We did it secretly,” grins Rice. “I was sneaking people in. We lit the whole thing with 100 desk lamps.” “Such a fire hazard,” tuts Roland.The Tank, a nonprofit theatre in Manhattan, became their artistic home. But “we were having a hard time making a name for ourselves in New York. Or just getting eyes on us,” says Roland. They crowdfunded for Edinburgh, saving what they could from daytime teaching jobs (maths for Rice, biking and skateboarding for Roland) and rehearsing Rodeo from 10pm until 2am. The show – a tricksy comedy about a clown, his shadow and a cowboy – had a meta subplot about their fight to get it finished. This was born from bleary rehearsals, where Roland felt: “I want the energy to give to the art I want to make.”As a duo, they’re a “cheap date” for theatres, says Rice. With minimal set and props, “most of our shows fit in a duffel bag”. They thought the majority of artists at the fringe would be in a similar position to them but were surprised by how “a lot of the shows getting recognition or reviews had funding from an arts council or huge companies”.The pair create their own costumes, sound design and choreography. The long-term plan is “to do this, but bigger” says Rice. “And maybe not have to share a room?” Until then, they’re juggling two shows in London and taking all three back to Edinburgh. “We’re going to drink alotof vitamin C,” laughs Roland. After all, it’s not their first rodeo.Xhloe and Natasha are atSoho theatre, London, until 29 March.

The government needs to ban smartphones for childrenJack ThorneTue 18 Mar 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 18 Mar 2025 11.09 EDTShareTwo and a half years ago,Stephen Grahamphoned me up to ask if I was interested in writing a show about knife crime. He wanted to talk about young male violence towards women and he had two stipulations: he wanted to do it in a series of single shots, and he didn’t want to blame the parents.Adolescence review – the closest thing to TV perfection in decadesRead moreI enthusiastically got involved and suggested we write together. At first, we didn’t know why Jamie, the perpetrator of the attack, did it. We knew he wasn’t a product of abuse or parental trauma. But we couldn’t figure out a motive. Then someone I work with, Mariella Johnson, said: “I think you should look into ‘incel’ culture.”I expected to be confronted by anger and aggression; what I didn’t expect was to quickly grasp the attraction of the so-called “manosphere”. I knew almost immediately that if I was an isolated kid, I would find answers as to why I felt a bit lost. One of the central ideas – that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men – would have made adolescent me sit up and, frankly, nod. The path then becomes: what do you do to upset that equation? How do you manipulate and harm in order to reset a female-dominated world that works against you? If you believe one part of the logic, the other half becomes conducive.The only episode Stephen left me alone with was episode three. He said to write a two-hander that looked into Jamie’s mind. Writing it, I was shocked at how much of Jamie I had in me. His pain, his anger, contains sides of me I didn’t want to see. He comes from a good background, like me; he’s a bright boy, like I was. The key difference between us? He had the internet to read at night whereas I had Terry Pratchett and Judy Blume.View image in fullscreen‘Katie’s loss is the apex of the tragedy, but I hope it’s OK to say that Jamie is a tragedy, too’ … Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixJamie is not a simple product of the “manosphere”. He is a product of parents that didn’t see, a school that couldn’t care and a brain that didn’t stop him. Put 3,000 kids in the same situation and they wouldn’t do what he did. Yet spend any time on forums on 4chan or Reddit, spend any time on most social media platforms and you end up, quite quickly, in some dark spaces. Parents can try to regulate this, schools can stop mobile phone access but more needs to be done. There should be government support because the ideas being expressed are dangerous in the wrong hands and young brains aren’t equipped to cope with them.My son is almost nine. In two years’ time he will be begging me for a smartphone. By that point, 60-70% of his class will have phones. Do I say no and isolate him? I can put controls in, but I’m not digitally sophisticated; my 12-year-old nephew already runs rings around me. I have seen what he could see and I don’t know how to stop him seeing it. I know I’m in the same position as hundreds of thousands of parents worrying about these things.Josh MacAlister’s protection of children (digital safety and data protection) bill originally proposed banning phones in schools and introducing a digital age of consent that would ban social media use until 16. This was watered down, for reasons I’m unsure of, and by the second reading what was decisive had become discursive. Instead of legislation, the government has committed only to an assessment when the problems of the present are so clear.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreIf it was my decision, I would be talking of smartphones like cigarettes and issuing an outright ban on all use by under-16s, but if that isn’t possible the digital age of consent is a fine alternative. In Australia, social media companies will be liable for fines of up to £25m if they don’t systematically stop children younger than 16 from holding accounts; in France and Norway there arerestrictions up to 15. We need to do something similarly radical here.What you hope when you make a piece of social realism is to create a conversation.

This show is a tragedy. Katie’s loss is the apex of that tragedy, but I hope it’s OK to say that Jamie is a tragedy, too. We will not solve the problem by kicking this issue into the long grass.

People have been building in the city for millennia and, in more recent times, bombing it. But if the building before went too deep, or there has been too much exposure to the air by bomb damage in the past, there won’t be much to find. Things were especially bad before 1991, when there was no planning protection for anything but scheduled ancient monuments. “We used to have to beg to get on site,” says Sophie Jackson, archaeologist at Museum of LondonArchaeology(Mola).It’s not that developers are insensitive, says Jackson: “When we did the excavation at Barts hospital, [it] was functioning above us – we were right under the MRI machines. Developers recognise the social value.” It’s just that the stars don’t often align.View image in fullscreenThe Bloomberg site in the City of London in 2016, during the excavation.Photograph: John Stillwell/PABut when Bloomberg, the financial media company, acquired the Bank junction site in 2010, the stars were aligned. Before thisexcavation, I’m afraid, Iconformed to the gender stereotypeand rarely thought aboutthe Roman empire. Since I saw London Museum’s new, unparalleled, internationally seismic collection, I have thought of little else. A total of 14,000 objects, 81,000 fragments of animal bones and 73,000 shards of pottery were recovered from this single site – the largest acquisition the museum has ever had from one place. Some items will be on displayfrom 2026 at what used to be the site of Smithfield meat market.Geography mattered on the Bloomberg site in the heart of the City, close to the Bank of England. TheWalbrook, a lost river of London, had carved a deep valley into the landscape and the Romans constantly tried to reclaim the banks as the city grew and prospered. They did this by packing the ground with rubbish, building on it, then packing it again, three more times, so there is a stratigraphical layer cake of Roman trash going almost all the way back to London’s creation, in AD47 or 48. The river also waterlogged the ground, protecting the material from oxygen: leather, brooches, shoes, writing tablets, wood, animal bones and ceramics were all phenomenally well preserved. There are sandals that look fresher than last year’s Birkenstocks.View image in fullscreenSophie Jackson, archaeologist and director of business development at Mola – the boxes behind contain excavation findings.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSite B2Y10 – to give it its academic name – was previously occupied by Legal and General, which dug deep in the 1950s, to create the biggest post-blitz rebuild in the City. Excavating archaeologists found the third-centuryTemple of Mithras, andoral historiesfrom Londoners who witnessed the find in 1954 recall a magical atmosphere, when the secrets of the ancient past met the regeneration of the postwar present to create a sense of enormous hope and renewal. People queued for hours to see the temple. One woman who was pregnant at the time called her baby Mithra. As significant as that archaeological yield was, it was pretty haphazard – workers on the site were just picking things up and handing them in.View image in fullscreenA magical atmosphere … an exhibition at the Temple of Mithras dig in 1954.Photograph: Robert Hitchman/© MolaThe Legal and General building had huge double basements, except on one side, where they had had to stay shallow for fear of jeopardising a Christopher Wren church on the opposite corner. “We were so excited by that single basement,” Jackson says. “We knew that in the layer underneath, that they hadn’t dug into, a lot of material would have survived.” Across 150 years of previous Roman recoveries inLondon, 19 writing tablets were found in total. In this one find, there were 400, of which 80 have already been deciphered. These are wooden frames, with an inset writing area about “the size of a Ryvita”, which would be filled with black wax, then written on.View image in fullscreenOne of the 400 writing tablets found in the dig.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThe wax has long degraded, but you might get lucky with a heavy-handed scribe and be able to read the indented text on the wood beneath. Or it might be a palimpsest, an original script overwritten at a later date, and you’ll see fragments of numerous messages, obscuring each other. The first tablet they read, dated 8 January AD57, was a financial document – an IOU. “They were amazing bureaucrats, the Romans,” Jackson says. “And it’s nice for Bloomberg, isn’t it?”The team managed to recover the names of 100 Roman Londoners we had never heard of. “One tablet says, ‘Take this to someone’s house, it’s by the house of Catalus.’ It really struck me. These people had their city, as much as we have it as our city,” Jackson says. “There’s a really gossipy one,” says curator Meriel Jeater, “a bloke who’s writing to someone called Titus: ‘Everybody’s talking about you in the market, saying you’ve lent them money. You’ve done a really bad deal; you shouldn’t appear shabby.’”View image in fullscreenRoman writing implements from the site.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianAlan Pipe, Mola’s animal bones specialist, shows me some skeletal remains on which “every tool mark, every nick made by a butcher’s knife” is visible. He could almost recreate a day in the life – or certainly the meals – of a Roman Londoner. Many of the bones are from cows, pigs and sheep; there are others from chickens but fewer. Chickens only appeared in the UK during the iron age, and were not regularly consumeduntil the third century. Hares and other game, as well as fish, give us an overall picture of the diet.You can gauge the skeletal age of the beasts from scores of amazingly preserved mandibles (lower jaws) and how worn the biting surfaces of the teeth are, Pipe explains. If a pig died at a year old, you can infer an amount of animal husbandry and agriculture. He shows me chunks of bone resultant from “splitting and smashing, way beyond what’s necessary for butchery”. This was probably for boiling and grease extraction.View image in fullscreenMola pottery specialist Charlotte Burn holds a small Roman vessel depicting foliage and a face.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianYou can also cross-reference these bones with other items found in the same layer, and archaeologically date the whole lot with associated finds – with ceramics in particular, as the techniques and ingredients evolved quite quickly and distinctively. You can pinpoint an era more precisely from a shard, sometimes, than from a coin, which may still have been in use 40 years after it was minted. Dendrochronology (dating by analysing tree trunk rings) is better still because trees would have been built into a building, so you can pinpoint it to the year. Sure, if some helpful Roman wrote the actual date on to a tablet, that works as well.Mola’s senior finds specialist, Michael Marshall, has 750 pairs of Roman shoes believed to date from the second half of the first century AD. The Claudian invasion (that is, the main Roman invasion in AD43, led by Claudius) brought new Mediterranean styles and materials, such as a dainty flip-flop – the adults’ hobnailed, the children’s not. You can see evidence of a big military presence – the paraphernalia of war, the ceramic leftovers of those catering to thirsty soldiers.View image in fullscreenMore than 700 Roman shoes were found, the leather well preserved in the waterlogged ground.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThere is plenty of evidence of people living very comfortable, good lives in the centre of London in AD50: the shoes are finely made, and there are gradations of material and craft in the pottery, which suggests some people were already considerably wealthier than others. There are a number of face pots (domestic pots with facial features carved into or applied on to them), for example, some of which are very crude, others exquisitely detailed. One depicts a woman with complicated hair and is thought to represent a maenad, a female follower of Bacchus, god of wine, who were associated with divine frenzy. There are a lot of snakes on the ceramics, representing agriculture, hope, rebirth and fertility, and also suggesting cultural cross-pollination with the European continent and people moving between one place and another – almost as if they had invented freedom of movement by the first century AD. There was also slavery – there are shackles in the find, too.View image in fullscreenFaience beads, pendants and copper embellishments for cavalry harnesses.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThen there are anomalies that tell us something about the limits of Roman understanding. Jackson shows me a black, pebble-like object with three indentations on it, in which someone has tried to make a hole, to turn it into a pendant. Finding the material unnaturally unyielding, the Romans decided these were “solidified thunderbolts”, she says. “It’s so interesting to think of Romans doing archaeology themselves.” Not very well, mind; it wasn’t a solidified thunderbolt, it was a neolithic hand-axe made of obsidian.View image in fullscreenAn obsidian axe head from the neolithic period – some Romans thought they were stone thunderbolts.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIt’s a reminder that we modern humans are also capable of misreading the signs. In the 1954 excavation, for example, they found beads that were assumed to have been worn by a woman, but here, those same beads and amulets were found still on their original strings, alongside other material that indicates they were worn by a horse. “It might have been a lady horse,” Marshall allows. Horses wore amulets covered in sexual imagery – such asfist-and-phallusamulets, with a clenched fist gesture at one end and an unmetaphorical phallus at the other, which was thought to ward off the evil eye. Children also wore amulets to ward off plague.As Jackson says, these people had their London as much as we have ours. A trove this size, when it goes on display next year, offers not so much a glimpse of the past as an immersion into it. It’s like falling head-first into the first century – in so much detail you can almost smell it.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsRoman BritainLondonArchaeologyHeritageHistoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You watch on, injured and helpless astheOda Nobunaga - the warlord responsible for numerous civil wars and the eventual unification of the country - smirks from a nearby hill. You draw your katana, the blade shining in the flickering light of the flames. This is Assassin’s Creed: Shadows – part exciting ninja game, part history lesson. It’s an odd combination but it comes together in a sprawling historical-fiction adventure full of discovery and deception.The tumultuous period that saw the unification of Japan and the fall of Nobunaga in the late 1500s is an ideal setting in which to play around as a sneaky shinobi and a brave samurai. The series’ science-fictiony framing device is that you, the player, are diving into your ancestor’s memories to hunt down a mysterious artefact by taking down a group of menacing masked samurai, one at a time. But mostly the game leaves you alone to enjoy feudal Japan.In this fraught time period, there is a sense of constant danger, each conversation like careful steps on a knife’s edge. The story is complete fiction of course, but it does weave around actual historical events and figures, and the developers at Ubisoft have clearly gone to great pains to make the settings feel authentic, both landscapes and the people who inhabit them. You’ll automatically remove your shoes when entering a building, and famous temples appear as they would have looked then, rather than as the tourist destinations they are now.The world truly is gorgeous, with several provinces to explore in all seasons and weathers, and period-accurate cities including Kyoto and Osaka. Giant temples rise up over busy towns full of stalls and workshops, while mossy shrines are scattered along winding paths through the countryside. You’ll see Japan in all colours, too, from the gentle pinks of spring’s sakura blooms, to the fiery-coloured leaves blanketing the hills in autumn, to the inky darkness of a winter’s night. It’s easy to be distracted by the view mid-mission when you’re surrounded by ancient red torii gates, or notice a random puppet performance in the street. Ubisoft’s Japan feels alive. It also feels totally overwhelming, at times.As much fun as it is to roam the countryside on horseback, scouting out new villages and historic sites, there’s just so much of it that it’s easy to feel lost. There are plenty of missions and side quests that will guide you around the map, but there’s a lot of repetition in those tasks. To kill a high-level samurai you will need some help; the person who can help you wants a favour, which involves findinganotherperson who wants you to kill adifferentsamurai, and so on. Over the game’s long run time, this starts to grate.View image in fullscreenImportant feature: you can pet all the cats (and dogs) in Japan if you want.Photograph: UbisoftThe dual protagonists do help to alleviate the feeling that you’re stuck in a repetitive loop. For the first 10 to 15 hours of the game, you’ll step into the sandals of shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe, a young woman seeking revenge after her home was destroyed, and help her to rebuild her life and set up a network of spies and rebels from a secret mountain base. Then there’s Yasuke, a principled black samurai based on the real historical figure of the same name, who appears briefly in the game’s introduction, then disappears until Naoe gets close to Nobunaga.Naoe is light on her feet, capable of scaling walls and temples with ease, while also melting into shadows to creep around enemies. Her stealthy approach makes for some fun sneaky moments, such as stabbing through paper shoji screen-doors for a surprise attack. That tip-toe approach comes at a cost, though, when she’s faced with a brawl. Enemy strikes hit her hard and she’ll quickly get overpowered in a fight. Yasuke, on the other hand, is brutally strong, and capable of running straight through those screen doors and shrugging off sword strikes like they’re a tickly irritant. He can still assassinate foes like Naoe can, but he does it head-on rather than in the shadows. In a series that has traditionally prioritised stealth, it feels extremely liberating when you bust through a castle’s gate and face everyone head on. Both characters are viable options to play through most of the game and you can swap between them (mostly) at will.View image in fullscreenFew other games have done such a good job with this setting … Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.Photograph: UbisoftUnfortunately, no matter whom you play as, you’ll have to put up with a few niggles in a fight. While dodges and parries feel amazing when you can pull them off in one-on-one scraps, you’ll often find yourself surrounded as more opponents are alerted to your presence, which makes it really tricky to see where hits are coming from. When you’re creeping around castle rooftops and taking your time picking enemies off, springing backwards into the shadows afterwards before scoping out your next kill, everything feels as it should. But the instant you get into a fight on the ground it starts to feel messy and frustrating.‘It’s been a challenge’: Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the quest to bring feudal Japan to lifeRead moreWhile I did find myself getting annoyed running back and forth between quest givers, I still can’t stop thinking about Shadows. Excellent performances and emotionally resonant moments, such as Naoe’s painful recovery after she loses everything she holds dear, mean you’ll feel every bit of sorrow and anger alongside the game’s heroes. Events are often troubling, as power struggles between lords often come at a huge cost to locals, and you see the unwelcome effects of your actions on your allies.Few other games have done such a good job with this setting, as you run through lush bamboo forests before scaling ancient castle walls and sneaking inside to steal treasures. These moments of brilliance more than compensate for its weaker points.Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is released on 20 March; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

If only it had waited for their trial …Jack SealeTue 18 Mar 2025 18.05 EDTShareLeaving Neverland,Dan Reed’s 2019 film, which laid out accusations that the singer Michael Jackson sexually abused children, is among the most impactful and important documentaries of the past 10 years; the view of one of the 20th century’s biggest stars irreversibly changed, as rumour and innuendo were replaced by a detailed narrative that was hard for all but Jackson’s most committed fans to doubt. As well as altering Jackson’s reputation for ever, Leaving Neverland offered a wider look at how abusers groom their victims, why those victims can choose to protect their abuser, and how and why the parents of victims might fail to protect their child.It was also about the extremes of fame. His celebrity allowed Jackson to bewitch young fans, and disarm families who would otherwise have balked at an adult stranger befriending their child. It gave him the drivers, bodyguards, hotel suites and mansions he needed to spend time with young boys. (Nobody denies that a series of children were alone with him for long periods, and shared his bed, although his estate strongly denies all allegations of sexual abuse.) And his fame gave him the power to settle lawsuits. It helped Jackson deflect public suspicion too, since it was just about plausible for his eccentrically childlike persona to include being seen with a string of pre-pubescent companions. The mega-famous can hide in plain sight.Leaving Neverland review – astonishing accounts of Michael Jackson’s sexual abuseRead moreLeaving Neverland 2: SurvivingMichael Jacksonis another film about life in the public eye, but this time the world’s gaze is on Jackson’s two accusers from the original film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck. The story starts in 2013 when Robson appears on US television to make his claims, and extends for the next decade and beyond as Robson and Safechuck seek redress in court, a process made more complicated by the lag between the alleged abuse and the accusation – about 20 years – and by the fact that Jackson died in 2009.The two men have to overcome legal arguments, which are initially successful, that their claims are beyond the statute of limitations and that they cannot be directed at Jackson’s estate or at the company that still handles his affairs, MJJ Productions. When Leaving Neverland is released in 2019, they also face a wave of vitriol and misinformation from Jackson supporters and media agitators who know nothing about the facts of the case, but earn a kick or a buck from posing as experts. The reaction to Leaving Neverland forms the most memorable section of Leaving Neverland 2: there is an extraordinary clip of Robson and Safechuck appearing on a show hosted by Oprah Winfrey, herself an abuse survivor, who praises them for their courage while warning them of the negative reaction they are about to endure.The new film, however, struggles to deal with how comprehensive the old one was. Although Safechuck talks movingly here about reconnecting with the younger version of himself, fighting for that boy’s interests and wondering what he would say to him, the obvious topics for a film about the aftermath – the difficulty survivors of abuse have with forming adult relationships, the pain of maintaining a relationship with the parents who didn’t step in, the lifelong anguish of those parents – were all covered in Leaving Neverland.‘I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had armed people say they’ll shoot’ – Dan Reed on the fallout from his Michael Jackson filmsRead moreSo we are left with the somewhat dry legal battle. Robson and Safechuck have their case thrown out, so they appeal, helped by the release of Leaving Neverland contributing to a change in the law regarding abuse victims belatedly speaking out. The tale culminates in a recording of a Zoom hearing – luckily a split-screen video call is as visually engaging as courtroom footage would have been – in which the MJJ Productions lawyer is dressed down and tripped up by visibly annoyed judges. But we’ve gone through a lot of arcane legalities to get to this point. The film’s closing caption tells us that the big trial, as opposed to these pernickety preliminaries establishing whether there is a case to answer, will take place in 2026. Leaving Neverland 2, which has arrived six years after the original film, might as well have waited seven.We also feel the absence of the other side of the debate. While Leaving Neverland could be forgiven for setting out the accusers’ testimony without peppering it with denials from their more powerful opponent, it would be useful now to hear from MJJ Productions. Reed shows us a letter where he begs them to participate in this new film – he highlights a paragraph where he literally writes: “I’m begging you.” Their refusal means the question of who knew what within Jackson’s staff can’t properly be explored. Reed has done fine work in telling us a highly significant story, but at this stage there is not enough more of it to tell.Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichael JacksonreviewsShareReuse this content"

At a time when the games industry is racked with layoffs and studio closures, the barrage of dispiriting headlines can be numbing. But the shutdown of Monolith cut through the noise, sparking fresh shock and outrage at the industry’s slash and burn approach to cost cutting. There are numerous reasons for this, but among them was a pervading belief that Monolith would be around forever. “I don’t think I ever really considered the possibility that it would shut down one day,” says Garrett Price, one of Monolith’s seven founding members.True to its name, Monolith was a singular presence. Founded in 1994, it was a prolific developer whose games displayed visual flair, mechanical inventiveness and a knack for synthesising pop-cultural themes. Most excitingly, you could never really predict what the studio would do next. While it primarily produced first-person shooters, there were forays into platformers, dungeon crawlers and open-world games. And even the core FPS titles differed wildly in theme and style, inspired by everything from 60s spy films to Japanese horror.View image in fullscreenWent toe-to-toe with Quake … Blood.Photograph: Monolith Productions/GOG“Monolith didn’t really have a true identity, and we honestly didn’t really care,” Price explains. “We pretty much just made whatever we wanted to make… We didn’t spend a lot of time trying to figure out what genre would sell the best or what theme would be the most accessible to the mass market. We just tried to make what we thought was cool.”Monolith emerged from the edutainment software company Edmark, where several of the company’s founders were previously employed. “On my interview day, I remember this bald chap walking past me on the stairs wearing aWolfenstein 3DT-shirt. I figured this would be a great place to work,” says Toby Gladwell, Monolith co-founder and software engineer. He recalls that his co-founders were emboldened by the recent release of Doom, the demonic first-person shooter that catapulted its creators, id Software, to rockstar status and transformed perceptions of the PC as a gaming platform. “We realised quickly that this was our calling. We simply had to make the best games of all time.”However, Monolith’s initial project bore little resemblance to id Software’s classic. Claw was a 2D, Mario-style platformer about a pirate cat. It was meant to be Monolith’s debut title, but in a quirk of fate, the company acquired another developer in late 1996 – Q Studios – which was deep into production on a Doom-like first-person shooter called Blood. Monolith opted to prioritise Blood’s completion over Claw – a decision that would have huge ramifications.Released in March 1997, Blood puts players in the role of Caleb, a gunslinging servant to the demon Tchernobog who is is betrayed and murdered by his fiendish master. “Those early games, especially Blood and Claw, have a very hand-crafted feel to them and were very much DIY endeavours,” Price says. A 2.5D shooter released as games were pivoting hard into full 3D rendering, Blood was in some ways behind the times. But its gritty visual style, creative weapons such as flare guns and voodoo dolls, and innovative addition of alternate fire modes for weapons, helped it stand toe-to-toe with more technologically advanced games such as Quake.View image in fullscreenAnime-inspired … Shogo: Mobile Armour Division.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsThe success of Blood sent Monolith into a frenzy of FPS development. Between 1998 and 2003, it designed seven new games in the genre including Blood 2; the anime-inspired shooter Shogo: Mobile Armour Division, which alternated between on-foot combat and city-flattening battles inside Gundam-style mechs; and two licensed tie-in games, Aliens Versus Predator 2, and Tron 2.0.“Our studio culture was born from a deep-seated conviction that we could accomplish anything we put our minds to,” Gladwell says. “We talked games, we played games together, both competitively and to analyse. There weren’t significant boundaries, given that we were all new to building a company – other than a strong desire to build games that would stand alongside the giants of the time.”The lack of boundaries also applied to the practical side of game design. “This was still a fledgling industry when we got started. The more specific roles you see today, such as world builder or environment artist were far more nebulous. Everyone pitched in. This helped give us a broader spread of opinion and feedback, because everyone was contributing to design,” Gladwell says. “Much of my own time at Monolith was spent in the energy vortex between design, art, audio and engineering.”View image in fullscreenA gloriously colourful pastiche of 60s espionage fiction … The Operative: No One Lives Forever.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsThe brightest star of Monolith’s early years, The Operative: No One Lives Forever, or NOLF as it is affectionately known, saw players don the orange catsuit of Cate Archer in a gloriously colourful pastiche of 60s espionage fiction. Its wide-ranging adventure transported players to Morocco, Germany, the tropics and even into space, with each level introducing new ideas, weapons and gadgets. Released in 2000, It was also one of the only shooters of its time with a female protagonist – and her portrayal holds up surprisingly well for a game that owes a significant debt to Austin Powers.Monolith’s vintage year, however, came in 2005, during which it released three games. Alongside The Matrix Online, a massively multiplayer adaptation of the 1999 sci-fi action movie, Monolith released a second game partly inspired by the same film: Fear. The culmination of Monolith’s mastery of the FPS, Fear combines the espionage themes of NOLF, the stylised ultraviolence of Blood and the Japanese borrowings of Shogo – though this time it looked to J-horror films, particularlyRingu,for inspiration. It bound these elements together with dynamic slow-motion combat and state-of-the-art enemy AI design, pitching the player against an army of clones that could seemingly work together tactically to outfox the player. The result is one of the best first-person shooters ever made.Fear is arguably Monolith’s best game. Yet despite its title, it isn’t the scariest. One month after Fear launched, Monolith released Condemned: Criminal Origins. A dark and gritty detective thriller inspired by films such as Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs, Condemned likewise blended horror and battles against eerily human enemies. But the foes you face in Condemned are crazed vagrants who attack the player with steel pipes and wooden planks, these tooth-and-nail duels interspersed with grisly crime-scene investigations.View image in fullscreenArguably Monolith’s finest … Alma from Fear.Photograph: Sierra GamesBy far Monolith’s most unsettling game, Condemned’s atmosphere of dread is thicker and more convincing than anything in Fear. A level set in a mannequin-filled department store has become infamous for its paranoia-inducing qualities. “Their studio had a real talent for permanently altering your imagination by turning everyday locations into memorable levels,” says Cameron Martin, senior producer at New Blood Interactive, publisher of retro shooters including Dusk, partly inspired by Monolith’s work. “After playing their games, you’ll never look at empty office buildings or crusty subway stations the same way again.”Fear and Condemned would be the last truly original games the studio would make. By 2005, Monolith had been acquired by Warner Bros, and after providing Fear and Condemned with decent if lesser sequels, Monolith became a servant of Warner Bros’ media licences.Yet even in this role, Monolith’s inventive, capricious personality shines through, as in 2012’s bizarre multiplayer shooter Gotham City Imposters, where players assumed the roles of random Gotham citizens pretending to be Batman and the Joker. The highlight of the studio’s latter years, however, was Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. An open-world game in the Assassin’s Creed mould, Shadow of Mordor featured the remarkable Nemesis AI system, which reorganised Sauron’s faceless army of orcs into a scheming political hierarchy, filled with recognisable personalities players would repeatedly encounter in tit-for-tat blood feuds.View image in fullscreenHighlight of Monolith’s later years … Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.Photograph: Monolith ProductionsNemesis was a potentially genre-defining concept, an idea dozens of other games would borrow from and riff on. But we will never know what its influence could have been. Warner Bros patented the system in 2021, and the only game to feature it since is Monolith’s final release, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War. Monolith was working on a Wonder Woman game that would also have featured the system, but this project was cancelled alongside Monolith’s closure.When a game studio closes, it can be difficult to gauge what is lost. Drive, perhaps, is what ultimately defines Monolith’s legacy. Between its foundation in 1994 and Shadow of War’s publication in 2017, Monolith created 23 games, one for every year of its existence up to that point. Which makes it more shocking that Monolith closed with nothing to show for its last eight years of existence.That such a dependable studio failed to release another game in almost a decade should raise serious questions about modern industry practices and how studios are increasingly subject to the whims of executives, investors, and venture capitalists. The demand that every release be bigger and better looking, appealing to the widest audience, and poised to serve players for years, is transforming the industry into a zero-sum game – a game that some studios aren’t allowed to finish, let alone win or lose.Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesMMORPGWarner BrosShooting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had visited the palace twice before the theft but denied these were reconnaissance trips.He previously told jurors at Oxford crown court he “took advantage of” the gold toilet’s “facilities” while at the country house the day before it was stolen. Asked what it was like, he replied: “Splendid.”The court heard that Jones had worked as a roofer, builder and “right-hand man” for James Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, who had pleaded guilty to burglary, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property.Another man, Frederick Doe, 36, helped Sheen to sell some of the gold in the following weeks after the robbery and was found guilty on Tuesday of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 39, from west London, was found not guilty of the same charge.The fully functioning toilet, created by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was plumbed in at the time of the heist, so its removal led to flooding and resulted in damage to the 18th century stately home and Unesco world heritage site.The toilet, weighing around 98kg, was fitted in 2016 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where 100,000 people queued to use it. It was moved to Blenheim and into a chamber opposite the room where Churchill was born, for Cattelan’s first solo UK show in more than 20 years.Cattelan created the sculpture – called “America” – to reflect the excesses of the art market and evoke the American dream of opportunity for all.Speaking at the time of the theft, he said he hoped the theft was a prank and asked: “Who’s so stupid to steal a toilet? [The work titled] America was the 1% for the 99%.”Blenheim Palace is the ancestral seat of the Duke of Marlborough. Before the toilet’s installation, the duke’s half-brother, Edward Spencer-Churchill, founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, said the lavatory would not be “the easiest thing to nick”.He told the Times: “Firstly, it’s plumbed in; and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don’t plan to be guarding it.”The heist was carried out at 4.50am in the morning when two stolen vehicles, a VW Golf and an Isuzu truck, entered the palace grounds at speed.Three robbers armed with sledgehammers and a crowbar gained entry to the palace, smashed through a solid wooden door and tore the toilet from its fixings.They carried the toilet out of the palace, rolled it along the ground, and placed it into the boot of the VW.In the following days, Sheen made plans to sell the gold, which is believed to have been moved to different locations and melted down in the hours after the raid.According to Thames Valley police, Doe contacted Sheen and offered to find a buyer for the gold and brokered the deal. During the deal-making, both men referred to the gold bars as “cars”, each worth £26,000.Jones was arrested on 16 October 2019 and police analysed his phone. He had allegedly been searching for newspaper reports about the stolen toilet on 20 September, jurors were told previously.Doe will be sentenced on 19 May. Jones and Sheen will be sentenced at a later date.Det Supt Bruce Riddell, head of Thames Valley police’s specialist operations department, said the convictions were the result of a vast amount of police work and that additional investigations are still trying to recover assets related to previous criminality by Sheen.A serious crime prevention order has already been obtained for Sheen after a previous conviction, which will be in place for five years upon his release from prison.“As part of the investigation a number of other arrests were made but further charges could not be brought and it is clear that there are others who were involved in this crime,” said Riddell.Shan Saunders, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed – but those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.“It has been a complex case to prosecute, involving a nationwide investigation with many lines of inquiry to identify those who were subsequently charged in relation to the theft.“While none of the gold was ever recovered – no doubt having been broken up or melted down and sold on soon after it was stolen – we are confident this prosecution has played a part in disrupting a wider crime and money-laundering network.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

If enough people pledged financial support, the author would write the book, with supporters receiving various perks, such as early access to the book or a special edition.Unbound confirmed last week that the business had been acquired by the newly-formed BoundlessPublishingGroup. A statement on its website said “Boundless will be moving forward with the majority of the Unbound projects”, instructing readers who have made pledges to “check back at the end of March when our new website will be live and you will have access to your account and order status”.Boundless will be led by Archna Sharma, who was appointed as Unbound’s new CEO in January, with Mitchinson as a director. “This is the beginning of a bold new era,” said Sharma in a statement. “Boundless looks forward to forging exciting new connections between authors and readers.”Author Tom Cox, whose latest book Everything Will Swallow You was due to come out this Thursday, became suspicious after months of not having received payments he was owed. That combined with the publisher’s failure to confirm that his new book would definitely come out on the proposed date, after the time it was originally due to be printed, led him to ask for the reversion of the rights he had sold to the publisher. He is now trying to personally sell the 5,342 copies of his books that Unbound sent to his house after the rights were transferred back to him.Cox, who has published seven books with Unbound and whose 2017 book21st-Century Yokelwas the publisher’s fastest-ever crowdfunded title, is not sure exactly how much he is currently owed but believes it is “a five-figure sum”. He is in a WhatsApp group with other authors waiting for payments. They have been receiving “update after update,” from the publisher, but “the update is we’ll have another update soon”.Though Unbound has promised in a statement that “all monies owed to authors by Unbound will be honoured by Boundless IP Limited,” Cox said he and other authors have been told they will receive what they are owed via “a payment plan”.“That immediately sort of rings the alarm bells with me,” he said. “Is it going to be like a mortgage? Perhaps the payment plan is going to be over 25 years … I’m a bit cynical about it at this stage because the earliest money that I’m owed from them dates back to May last year.”Cox is also concerned about the readers who paid into the crowdfunder for his new book. He was initially told by Unbound that all of his supporters would be refunded, which he communicated to his readers. “And then we find out last week that they are not going to refund them. They’ve just taken all that money that I’ve worked so hard to raise, and my readers have given in trust and in support of me, and now they’re not going to give it them back. Well, I just think it is shocking behaviour.”According to a spokesperson from Unbound, new company Boundless “has no obligation to pay any of Unbound’s creditors, but has undertaken to pay in full the money owed to Unbound’s authors and to fulfil the orders for books that have transferred from Unbound. It will not be fulfilling orders or offering refunds for books that haven’t transferred.”Letters of Note author Shaun Usher said he is “deeply disappointed by Unbound’s collapse”.Though none of his books are still under contract with Unbound, he and his wife invested “a substantial amount of money in the company” in 2014. “Losing that money is crushing, and frankly, it’s not something we can afford.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Here, Dracula is put through their humour wringer and comes out a pansexual bloodsucker, chasing anyone with a neck.There are gender and genre inversions galore as Jonathan Harker (Charlie Stemp, good comic timing) treks up the Carpathian mountains to Dracula’s castle. Harker’s fiancee is now Lucy (Safeena Ladha) rather than Mina, who is turned into Lucy’s less eligible sister and played by Sebastien Torkia in ginger-ringleted wig.In a production directed by Greenberg, Dracula (James Daly) makes quite an entrance in lace midriff top and leather trousers, with the ripped bare muscles of an underworld hottie. He is bedroom-eyed and playful, in the mould of Rocky Horror’s Frank-N-Furter.View image in fullscreenJames Daly in Dracula: A Comedy of Terrors.Photograph: Matt CrockettIt is a shame then that the story does not manifest the same danger and allure in his wooing of Lucy and flirtations with Harker. None of it is truly transgressive, and his status as a sexual outsider and chaotic force is neutered by the lightness of the comedy. The script ping-pongs into earnestness too, with warnings about time and the torments of immortality.Daly is still a charming stage presence and his Byronic, gym-bunny twist on Dracula is amusing if one-note. There is lots of larking and some funny physical gags, although the scripted jokes can be less than pin-sharp: a dated gag about dentistry references Janet Street-Porter while Harker has two cousins called Mary and Shelley.In its gender reversals, the show has the rambunctious, good-natured feel of a gothic panto. Van Helsing is a German doctor and bluestocking, played twinklingly by Torkia. It is not radical or innovative, but it is fun.Tijana Bjelajac’s set design, featuring luminous bat-shaped wings, bears the look of a wonky 1980s nightclub. Disco beats are mixed with claps of thunder and cracks of lightning. DIY special effects give it charm: cans sprayed by actors in place of a smoke machine when Dracula walks on, puppetry and ventriloquism by Stemp who carries off the comedy nicely as a whole.The five-strong cast juggle multiple roles with particularly fast work by Dianne Pilkington as various characters including Lucy’s father. The performances are superb all round, full of fun and mischief, but the low-hanging jokes of the script short-change the actors’ talents.

The inventor ofQuasimodoandJean Valjeanis so universal that we absorb his myths even if we have never picked up one of his books. Yet how much do most of us know about Hugo himself, behind the books, the films, the musicals? By dedicating an exhibition to this versatile creator’s visual art, which started with a few caricatures and developed into sublime and surreal masterpieces, the Royal Academy does something unexpectedly moving. It takes you into the secret heart of a man we tend to think of only as a classic.For instance we discover that Hugo campaigned against the death penalty nearly two centuries ago. His 1854 drawing Ecce Lex (Behold the Law) is a macabre inky portrait of a hanged corpse, part of his doomed campaign to save a condemned murderer calledJohn Tapner. Hugo opposed capital punishment on principle, but a few years later gave permission for this drawing to be made into a print protesting the execution of American anti-slavery activistJohn Brown. If there was a liberal cause, Hugo threw his huge heart into it.View image in fullscreenLace and Spectres, 1855-56.Photograph: Maisons de Victor Hugo/Roger-ViolletOne of the first drawings you encounter in this sensitively curated show is his sketch of the council chamber in the town hall of Thionville in the north-east of France, after it was left in ruins by the invading Prussian army in 1871. Thus, in his late 60s, he added war artist to his vocations of author and campaigner, and recorded the violence of the Franco-Prussian war. In fact, this disaster for France improved his own life. It led to the fall of the dictator Louis Napoleon, whom Hugo had defied, choosing political exile on Guernsey, where he created some of his most haunting art.That was his public life. Hugo’s art, however, takes you under his skin, without rules or any audience except himself, absolutely free and dauntingly creative. You can feel the isolation and soul-searching in his 1850 sketch Causeway, which dwells on nothing more than a bleak rocky causeway, perhaps his road to exile. In a drawing beside it he ponders the woody morass of a soaking breakwater in Jersey – the first Channel Island to which he fled.Sketch?Drawing? It’s hard to define exactly what these are. Hugo uses a mixture of ink, charcoal, graphite and wash to create his murky paper visions. Sometimes he works on a tiny scale: The Abandoned Park, a silhouette-like image of trees beside a mirroring lake, is just 4.4cm tall and 3.5cm across. The miniaturisation adds to the ghostliness. Yet he can also take drawing to staggering largeness, as in the final depiction of a Guernsey lighthouse with a frail staircase spiralling up to a mystical, hopeful light.View image in fullscreenMushroom, 1850.Photograph: CC0 Paris Musées / Maisons de Victor HugoAt times Hugo is just the writer doodling – using up spare ink, he said – yet his doodles develop. A symmetrical ink stain, like a Rorschach blot, has little faces drawn into it. Other frolics that Hugo called “taches”, or stains, are boldly abstract. Sometimes they form themselves into cosmic visions of planets or unreal landscapes but others remain free and formless.Out of this wild freedom a theme emerges: architecture. This should not be a surprise because after all the real hero of his novel Notre-Dame de Paris is not Quasimodo but Notre-Dame itself – a tottering, unloved old pile of stone when Hugo wrote it. So as well as Dickens, he resembles those Victorian champions of the gothicRuskinandPugin. But he’s Ruskin on a lot of beaujolais, his imagination drunk on gothic turrets and spires; castles on hilltops or by lakes; fairytale castles and nightmare castles; real ones and dreamed ones.When he visited the town of Vianden, in today’s Luxembourg, its castle fascinated him so much he lived in it for three months. He depicts it as shadowy and unreal, like a design for a 30s horror movie. In a second drawing the castle is a floating phantasm above a rickety array of wooden houses: not so much Dracula’s castle as Kafka’s.View image in fullscreenOctopus, 1866–69.Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale de FranceWhen Hugo lived on Guernsey he turned his house into a gothic retreat with a Romantic interior full of fantastical touches. It is evoked here with spooky photographs and a battered mirror whose wooden frame he painted with colourful birds. His fireplace, which he sketched, was emblazoned with a huge H, as if he were a medieval lord.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hugo was a Romantic yet he lived on until 1885, doing the art we see here into old age – and it is timeless, eternally contemporary. Uninterested in artistic fashion – his living came from writing – he followed his own fancy. Like Goya, whom he often resembles, this makes his art speak directly to us.Here is a portrait of an octopus, which he must have seen from the Guernsey rocks, its flailing tentacles making him, and you, wonder if it has a consciousness. Hugo feels the universal pulse of life. He can empathise with medieval outcasts, hanged men and cephalopods. What an artist.

Directors Fang Li, Ming Fan and Lily Gong do an exemplary job of recounting this tragedy from the British, Chinese and (to some extent) Japanese perspectives with a piercing empathy.An oceanic sense of loss pervades the film. Fang, a former geophysicist and the on-camera presenter here, first surveyed the Lisbon Maru’s wreck 100 miles south-east of Shanghai in 2016. Now he plumbs the depths of time to reconstruct its story, salvaging the testimony of the PoWs’ families, and finally locating the two remaining survivors, nonagenarians Dennis Morley and William Beningfield (who have since died). Morley says his daughter and granddaughter knew nothing about his ordeal; a silence practised by countless others, including the Japanese civilian captain later convicted for his role. His astonished children get the news here from Fang.Morley and Beningfield’s words, a trove of historical accounts and artful animation flesh out the horror. The British soldiers were transported in the Lisbon Maru’s cargo holds in unspeakable conditions, then after the attack by a US submarine, the hatches were battened as the vessel started to sink. Perhaps to give them the illusion they would be saved, the prisoners were told to pump out the bilge; they worked in four-man, five-minute shifts in darkness for hours. One squaddie, believing he was in hell, went insane. The stiff upper lip factor seems to have benefited the escapees only in the short term; decades later, family members attest to a grim history of PTSD symptoms.Fang’s even-handed humanism allows him to excavate this emotional wreckage on all sides, even though the Japanese one remains clouded. While he locates the family of the American torpedoman who pulled the trigger, there is no voice from the Japanese military here. The country has of course long since moved beyond the imperial arrogance that finally saw its troops turn their guns on the desperate Brits, but it’s a chilling reminder for our backsliding times of the importance of international law.The film’s only real flaw is an occasional sentimentality; it could have done without the syrupy torch song over the roll call of the fallen. Otherwise it’s potent stuff; a blockbuster treatment, called Dongji Island, is due in the summer, but it’s hard to see it being more affecting than this.The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru is in UK cinemas from 20 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsSecond world warChinaAsia PacificJapanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their deaths are (somehow, invisibly) filmed and sold as horror movies at the local video store, run by Roger Bladecut. This maniac’s daughter, Abbie (Sari Arambulo), is for some reason keen to follow in her father’s footsteps, but when she starts hanging out with other teens realises that maybe murdering your fellow humans isn’t all its cracked up to be.Even a cursory outline of the premise is probably enough to set alarm bells ringing for anyone with even a passing interest in plausible world-building. For those willing to suspend their disbelief, Bloody Axe Wound features some charismatic performances (from Sam Crane and Eddie Leavy in particular), a banging soundtrack crammed with riot grrrl riffs, and some nice juicy practical gore effects.But that premise really doesn’t work. Abbie expresses her reluctance to slaughter her friends, and her dad tells her tough shit, the video store will be in danger of going out of business if she doesn’t commit; it’s neither so silly that you might just go with it, nor is it a clever exploration of dysfunctional family dynamicsà la cannibal movie We Are What We Are.The recent gore movie Terrifier 3features similarly pointless world-building and lore in a film that didn’t need it, but that doesn’t suffer because it’s so effectively put together that you’re too busy cheering on the brutal kills and grand-guignol set pieces. Unfortunately, Bloody Axe Wound doesn’t have quite enough distraction technique, giving the audience far too much time to start wondering how on earth any of this is supposed to hang together. You’re left with the sense that these ingredients, mixed slightly differently, could have added up to something rather more delicious, but as it is, your attention is drawn repeatedly to the artificiality of it all in a way that does the film as a whole no favours.Bloody Axe Wound is on Shudder and AMC+ from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Inevitably, a prequel was spawned,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes(2020), now followed by Sunrise on the Reaping, set about a quarter of a century before the events of the original trilogy.The books’ success partly lay in Collins’s skilful refashioning of an ancient story, the myth of the Minotaur, which she placed in a futuristic world, giving agency to the weak to overthrow the powerful. But it also came from her close attention to the effects of social media and reality television, as she examined the line between the authentic self and pretence, and how narratives can be manipulated for advantage. In this new book Collins returns to these familar themes with the story of the likable Haymitch Abernathy. Readers have met him already, as a mentor to the original trilogy’s beloved heroine, Katniss Everdeen.TheHunger Gamesare a violent entertainment designed to keep the country of Panem in a state of permanent subservience. Every year, teenage “tributes” are chosen by lot to take part. Thrust into the role of child soldiers, in a giant arena that functions like a panopticon, they must battle against each other, until only one survives. Collins’s interest in media pervades the text: at the “reaping”, where tributes are selected, a boy runs away, and is shot in the head; the resulting chaos is edited out from the broadcast. Everyone grows up skilled in the mechanisms of public relations, since knowing how to manipulate your appearance might help you survive.At the top of Panem’s hierarchy broods the monstrous President Snow, riddled with disease and vampiric in his lust for young blood. Underneath him are the glittering, empty-headed inhabitants of the Capitol, followed by ordinary citizens in strictly delineated districts down to scummy District 12, from which both Katniss and Haymitch hail. These class boundaries may seem artificial, but they underscore the novel’s notions of power, and allow for some blunt satire of fashion and luxury: a Capitol woman has real cat ears sewn on to her head, while those in District 12 live in poverty.The wholesomeness of District 12 is a contrast with the Capitol’s decadence, and Haymitch appears a stereotypical bumpkin. He works hard for his Ma, looks after his kid brother, and bootlegs liquor to earn extra cash. His love for his singer sweetheart, Lenore Dove, is the book’s emotional touchstone. The year is the 50th anniversary of the games, so twice as many tributes as usual are chosen. And it’s hard luck for Haymitch, who draws the short straw. The games begin once more, in all their viciousness.Expecting to be trained up to fight, Haymitch also finds stirrings of revolution: some within the Capitol seek an end to the games, and he is drawn into their machinations. He thus faces a double task: to win, and to subvert the entire enterprise. Since we know the games continue, we also know that he won’t succeed in the latter part. But that doesn’t detract from the suspense, since the reader wants to know what seeds of sedition are lain down for the future.‘Electrifying experience’: stage version of The Hunger Games to open in new London theatreRead moreCollins is an excellent writer, and there are moments of surprising lyricism, which help to leaven the grimness. In a literary touch, Haymitch remembers a William Blake poem,Ah! Sun-flower, reminding us of both radicalism, and the importance of nature; the sunflower necklaces worn by tributes are both symbols and, since they are fashioned from explosives, agents of destruction.Classical references abound. The man who designs the parades for the games is Incitatus, after Caligula’s horse, and in the monstrous arena, which parodies the pastoral, Collins employs a trope from Latin poetry: thelocus amoenus, where a pleasant place becomes a site of violence. She also plays with doppelgangers, increasing the sense of uncanniness: one District 12 tribute, the brilliantly sarcastic Maysilee, must leave her twin sister behind; another, once dead, is replaced by a living body double.I have always found the books’ attitude to underage violence and the deaths of children difficult, even if it follows a long literary tradition. The tributes are subjected to physical and mental degradation: Sunrise on the Reaping can feel more like A Clockwork Orange than a novel for 12 and up. In a particularly cruel touch, a father is asked to act as mentor to his own son, teaching him the skills to survive, while knowing that he will almost certainly die. The stench of death is everywhere; and the tone of the whole is tragic rather than triumphant. Nothing reaches the heights of exhilaration of the first Hunger Games, but Sunrise on the Reaping contains enough both to snare new readers and to satisfy the most bloodthirsty fans.Sunrise on the Reaping by Suzanne Collins ispublished by Scholastic (£19.99).To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Excursions into the comparatively offbeat – Japanese contemporary art, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud – are balanced by home bankers, of which this account of the original impressionist exhibition in 1874, must be counted.The film takes its cue from a show jointly mounted by the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC (where it was calledParis 1874: The Impressionist Moment) and Paris’s Musée d’Orsay (Paris 1874: Inventing impressionism). Both exhibitions, and the film, re-create the founding moment of the style, when 30 (or possibly 31) artists – who had been turned down by the official Paris Salon – showed their work in a studio operated by the celebrated photographer Nadar, under the moniker “Société Anonyme”; the Salon des Refusés, the repository for rejects from the Salon founded by Napoleon III, had in fact been established over a decade earlier.Some of the works on display would go on to become indisputably major – not least Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise, which gave its name to the group aftera scathing review by art critic Louis Leroy– and the names are legion; alongside Monet, participating artists included Degas, Renoir, Berthe Morisot and Paul Cézanne. (One notable absentee was Édouard Manet who, despite his prominence within the group, apparently preferred to focus his efforts on getting into the official Salon.)This is a somewhat more granular film than we are used to from the EoS strand, with its focus on a single, undeniably momentous event, rather than a luxurious stroll around a particular artist’s oeuvre or collection. That perhaps explains the decision to move away, after a few opening statements, from the now traditional stream of curators’ talking heads to provide context, replaced here by actors reading from letters and articles from the time. It all adds up to the very classy package we are now completely used to from these film-makers, and a valuable resource for the considerable numbers of people who won’t have been able to see the show in person.Dawn of Impressionism, Paris 1874 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 18 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsClaude MonetÉdouard ManetFranceEuropePaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

In this documentary, completed beforeshe died in December, we watch Giovanni in her late 70s, reigning over sold-out public appearances. On stage she recites poems about love, race and gender and in between, with the timing of a standup comedian, she has the auditorium erupting in whoops and laughter. Posing for selfies, a woman tells Giovanni she named her daughter after her; another says she wrote to her on the verge of dropping out of college. “You wrote back. I’m a teacher now!”In archive footage, Giovanni as a young woman, reads her 1968 poem Nikki-Rosa, which has a line about how white people fail to understand the lives of black people: “they’ll probably talk about my hard childhood / and never understand that / all the while I was quite happy”. Giovanni was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, during segregation and, after witnessing domestic violence at home, she went to live with her grandparents. Speaking in a radio interview she is blunt: “Either I was going to kill him” – she’s talking about her father – “or I was going to move.”Filmed at home with her long-term partner Virginia, Giovanni comes across with tenderness. For fans she has all the time in the world, endlessly smiling for selfies. But clearly she was not a woman to suffer fools; as a documentary subject she is firm with her boundaries, refusing to budge on areas that she deems off-limits – that includes challenges in her childhood and the death of Martin Luther King.Her poems, read by Giovanni herself and the actor Taraji P Henson, made the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. There are snippets too from a conversation – televised in 1971 – between Giovanni, still in her 20s, and the writer James Baldwin. Two utterly original and brilliant thinkers, a flicker of recognition sparks between them that here is someone on their level, a match for their fierce intellect.

The change, when it came, was sudden and complete. After Peñarrubia the heavy traffic vanished, and with it the industrial estates and dull dormitory towns. We were now in Guadalajara, a province of Castilla-La Mancha which, with an average of just five inhabitants per square kilometre, has been described as “the largest demographic desert in Europe”.The Spanish call places like thisla España vaciada. The word for “empty” isvacío,butvaciadameans “emptied”, as if there were something deliberate about the way the fabric of rural Spanish society has been worn threadbare by depopulation and underdevelopment.Map showing where Campillo de Ranas, Roblelacasa and Guadalajara are in SpainBeyond the small town of Tamajón, gateway to the wild Sierra Norte de Guadalajara natural park, a single-track road picked its way through ancient forests of gall oak and juniper. Bald peaks reared up in the near distance; Ocejón, the highest of them at 2,046 metres (6,713ft), bore a sugar-dusting of recent snow. In recent years the Iberian wolf, which in the 1970s hovered on the verge of extinction, has returned to the mountains of the Sierra Norte. Birds of prey, perched on the treetops, swivelled their gaze as we passed.Twenty years ago, these silent lands were the site of an extraordinary social phenomenon. In June 2005 the socialist government of José Luis Zapaterobrought in a lawmaking same-sex marriage legal. After pushback from a number of conservative mayors who declined to officiate at gay weddings in theirayuntamientos(town halls), others declared themselves open for business – among them Francisco Maroto, mayor of Campillo de Ranas in Guadalajara. The news spread fast, boosted by Andrés Rubio’s documentaryCampillo Sí, Quiero(Campillo Yes, I Do, 2007), and before long gay couples were beating a path to a village in the middle of nowhere with two dozen inhabitants.View image in fullscreenThe Sierra Norte de Guadalajara natural park.Photograph: Javier Diez Compadre/AlamyAs a beneficiary of the 2005 law – I married my Spanish partner five years later in a civil wedding in rural Extremadura – I had long been intrigued by the story of Campillo de Ranas. Twenty years down the line seemed like a good moment to see it for myself. The visit would also involve exploring a region that, even after 35 years in Spain, I had never once set foot in.The landscape seemed to stretch out as if physically pulled from both sides. For about 20 miles (30km) we drove without seeing another car. Long-horned cattle dawdled over the single-track roads as if they, and not the occasional motor vehicle, had right of way. Dotted among the scrub and forest of a wide valley flanked with mountains were villages whose dark colours made them almost indistinguishable from their surroundings: thepueblos negrosof north-western Guadalajara, so-called because their houses and churches are built entirely of slate.Since 2005, the village has hosted more than 1,000 ceremonies, with gay couples coming from as far afield as Japan, Iceland and the US to tie the knotCampillo de Ranas is one of these “black villages”. Though never exactly prosperous, for much of its history Campillo scraped a subsistence living from livestock farming and forestry. At its height, in 1877, the village had a population of 827, falling gradually for half a century and then dramatically in the post-civil war period, when internal migration drew workers to the factories of Barcelona and Bilbao. When Francisco arrived here from Madrid in 1984 this was, in his words, “like a Celtic hamlet lost to the rest of the world”. Just three families lived permanently in the village, which still had no mains electricity or running water. Women did their washing in the stream; goats roamed the unpaved streets. By the 21st century, rural tourism was taking off in Spain and a new awareness of the area’s unique architectural heritage was bringing in a trickle of visitors – but still Campillo de Ranas had only onecasa rural(the common designation for a country lodging).View image in fullscreenCampillo de Ranas.Photograph: ChaviNandez/AlamyI spoke to Francisco in the small office where he attends to mayoral business on two mornings a week. In pride of place on his desk stood a small rainbow flag. “I started the gay marriage thing as an act of political militancy, and of course I never imagined it would have the repercussions it did,” he said. “What a wedding signifies economically is that you’ve got 150 people who are going to eat 150 meals, and you’ll need to hire 16 people to serve them.”The first gay couple to be married in the village were Alex and Santi from Madrid, who read about Francisco’s progressive stance and got in there promptly on 21 November 2005. There followed a flood of bookings, the initial boom partly owing to a historical backlog of couples who had been waiting for years for their rights to be enshrined in law. Among the first wave were the mayor himself and his boyfriend, Quique, in 2007. Since then the village has hosted more than 1,000 ceremonies, with couples coming from as far afield as Japan, Iceland and the US to tie the knot. One thing that’s changed is that, if at first Campillo was known for LGBTQ+ weddings, hetero unions now make up the great majority. Though, as Francisco said, both gay and straight weddings feature essentially the same cast of characters: immediate family, relations, and a gang of friends who themselves may or may not be LGBTQ+.In this rural community, sexuality is less interesting than the fact of being from somewhere elseEither way, the effect on the economy has been notable. Campillo and its four hamlets now have 19casas ruralesand five restaurants between them, most of which serve the wedding market and offer fixed employment for locals. A powerful word-of-mouth effect among wedding guests brings in yet more couples to Campillo and also has an impact on property in the village, with about 70% of houses now owned by outsiders. If the population has not grown hugely, it has at least stabilised at 50.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the couples on his list of upcoming receptions – 42 in total this year – I saw Julio and Andrés, Carlos and Mario, Beatriz and Pilar. “I’ve lived here for 31 years and have never had insults or anything remotely like it,” said Quique. “You can walk around the village holding hands andno pasa nada.”Which happens to confirm my own experience of LGBTQ+ life in a small rural community in Spain: in a place without a middle class and with a sometimes pursed-lipped morality, sexuality tends to be less interesting than the fact of being from somewhere else.View image in fullscreenTraditional architecture in Campillo de Ranas, which is in one of Spain’s most depopulated regions.Photograph: Maria Galan/AlamyIn the streets of nearby Campillejo, a blink-and-you’ve-missed-it village of slate-built houses, the silence was deep as a millpond: cooing doves made the only sound. We stopped at the bar-restaurant Los Manzanos, one of the few eating-places open on a year-round basis in the “black villages”. David García-Alcalá Cuenca, who runs the bar, brought us a hearty lunch of stewed lentils and grilled sirloin of localavileñabeef, telling us that he and his husband were married by Francisco Maroto in the town hall of Campillo de Ranas and held the reception at Aldea Tejera Negra.Afterwards, we meandered between the scattered pueblos, ranking each one for prettiness and preservation as we went. Majaelrayo, El Espinar, Umbralejo – all had solid little foursquare churches with beamed porches and bell towers rising shyly from among the slate-tiled roofs. From the hamlet of Roblelacasa (population 22), we hiked the few miles down a stony track, past walled enclosures still used to protect beehives – heather honey being, along with prime beef, the main gastronomic delicacy of thepueblos negros. The trail ended at a waterfall, the Cascadas del Aljibe, powering its way through a deep romantic gorge.Two hours later we were back in the smog and the noise of Madrid (population almost 3.5 million), still buzzing from our day out on the lonely roads of Guadalajara. The fact that such a silent wilderness, practically devoid of human habitation, lay no more than 60 miles as the crow flies from the Puerta del Sol, was tough to get our heads around. After all my years here – 15 of them as a married man – it’s good to know Spain hasn’t lost its capacity to surprise.Paul Richardson is author of Hidden Valley: FindingFreedom in Spain’sDeepCountry (Abacus, £10.99).

And don’t say meringues!Billowy meringues may be the most high-profile pal of surplus egg whites, but their circle is far wider and more encompassing than those delicate shells. “My immediate thought is chocolate mousse,” says Oliver Costello, co-owner ofToad Bakeryin south London. “White chocolate is quite good here, because the egg whites take its richness down. If you’ve ever had a pot of Milkybar yoghurt dessert, it’s a bit like that.” It couldn’t be simpler to make, either: “Melt white chocolate in a bain-marie or in bursts in the microwave, and whip some cream to stiff peaks in a separate bowl. Fold the melted chocolate into the cream, then whisk egg whites to stiff peaks and fold those in, too.” Chill for three hours, then grab a spoon and dig in, perhaps accompanied by a little poached or baked rhubarb.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Rosie Healey, ofGloriosain Glasgow, meanwhile, would put her excess egg whites to work in some coconut macarons. “They’re so delicious and easy,” she says, plus they’ll also account for a decent number of whites in one fell swoop. “Whip them up, stir in a load of desiccated coconut, then bake.” Dip the cooked macarons in melted chocolate, put them in the fridge to set and the job’s a good’un.Of course, there are many other sweet solutions – use egg whites to make nougat or Swiss meringue buttercream, or to achieve extra-crunchy granola clusters, say – but let’s not forget the savoury side of things. Fritters, for example, have saved many a weeknight dinner, and can also save surplus egg whites from the trash. “Make a batter, add sweetcorn kernels, then fold in whisked egg whites, lots of coriander and some chopped green chilli,” Healey says. Deep-fry in batches until golden and crisp.Then there’s velveting – a Chinese technique for marinating fish or meat in egg whites, then cooking it in water or oil and adding to the likes of stir-fries and soups. AsYotam Ottolenghiexplains: “The egg white creates a protective barrier that seals in moisture and helps keep the flesh tender, which makes the protein smoother and silkier.” He often adopts the approach with hake (although any meaty fish will do): whisk egg whites, cornflour and rice wine, then toss in the chunks of fish and marinate for half an hour. Drop the fish in boiling water for 20 seconds, then lift out, drain and stir into a pan of caramelised onions, masala paste, chicken stock and coconut milk, along with a big handful of Thai basil. Ken Hom inClassic Chinese Recipes, meanwhile, tosses cubes of chicken breast with egg whites, salt and cornflour. After covering and chilling the meat for 20 minutes, he fries the chicken in oil and serves with a stir-fry of walnuts, garlic, ginger and spring onions.Of course, egg whites hit the happy hour spot, too, because they’re brilliant at adding creaminess to cocktails. “My favourite is an amaretto sour, but a gin sour is always going to be welcome,” Healey says. Take 200ml gin, the juice of two or three limes, some sugar syrup (50:50 sugar to water), and an egg white. “Use two egg whites if you want things super-creamy,” she adds. Give it all a good shake and it’s good to go: “It’s easy-peasy and, if you put some mint in there as well,reallydelicious.”Got a culinary dilemma?

They were originally made to use up old bread, turning simple leftovers into something truly delicious. Here, I’m giving them a very early Easter twist with hot cross buns, which add their own special flavour and soft texture. The saffron syrup brings a lovely warmth and a little touch of something special, making thesetorrijasfeel just right for the season while still keeping that familiar, comforting charm we all love.Hot cross torrijas with saffron syrupFor extra indulgence, mix finely grated orange zest into some mascarpone or similar creamy cheese to serve alongside.Prep15 minSoak 10-15 minCook25 minServes4500ml whole milk50ml double cream100g caster sugar1 cinnamon stick6 hot cross buns, cut in half horizontally50g unsalted butter2 tbsp olive oil4 large eggs, beatenFor the syrup150g caster sugar1 pinchsaffron threadsPared zest of½ orangeWarm the milk, cream, sugar and cinnamon in a medium-sized saucepan, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Take off the heat and set aside for five to 10 minutes, to infuse and cool slightly.Arrange the hot cross bun halves in a shallow baking dish into which they’ll fit neatly, then pour the warm milk mixture over the top. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes, flipping them over halfway through.Put the butter and olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat. Working in batches, dip each soaked bun half into the beaten egg, then fry for two to three minutes, until golden and caramelised on each side. Keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the remaining bun halves.For the syrup, put the sugar, saffron, orange peel and 150ml water in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for five minutes, until the mix has thickened slightly, then lift out and discard the orange peel.Serve the torrijas warm, drizzled generously with the saffron syrup.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkDessertFoodEasterBreadSnacksEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"
