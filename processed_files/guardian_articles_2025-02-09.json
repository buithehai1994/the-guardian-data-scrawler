That’s why I quit the UK Foreign OfficePatrick WintourDiplomatic editorSun 9 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareBritain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed.Writingfor the Guardian, Mark Smith, whoresigned from the Foreign Officein August, said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies, and if they did not do so, their reports were edited by senior colleagues to give the impression that the UK was in compliance with the law.Appealing to serving Foreign Office officials to end their cooperation with a broken process, he wrote: “What I witnessed was not just moral failure but conduct that I believe crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes.“The British public deserves to know how these decisions are made behind closed doors – and how systemic dysfunction enables the government to perpetuate harm while shielding itself from scrutiny.”He also said his efforts to raise his concerns were blocked, and he was ordered not to put his concerns in writing in case they became subject to freedom of information requests.Smith served as a Middle East desk specialist adviser on arms sales, and subsequently moved to serve as a second secretary at the UK embassy in Dublin.He wrote: “The Foreign Office’s handling of these issues is nothing short of a scandal. Officials are bullied into silence. Processes are manipulated to produce politically convenient outcomes. Whistleblowers are stonewalled, isolated, and ignored.”Although much of his criticism is directed at the last Conservative government concerning arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen, and arms sales to Israel, Smith did not absolve Labour. He welcomed theUK ban on arms exports to Israelin September, but since then, he said the government had stood by as Israel continued to commit war crimes.View image in fullscreenCampaigners protest in August outside BAE Systems against the supply of parts for the F-35 fighter jets used by Israel.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe UK last September banned sales of arms for use in Gaza, but exempted allparts for the F-35jet programme, a carve-out that is now subject to full judicial review. UK laws state that the government will not issue export licences “if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law”. The Foreign Office still insists it has not been able to conclude that Israel’s bombing of Gaza breached international law.Possibly the most significant of Smith’s allegations is the claim that officials had demanded the toning down of evidence that UK arms had been used to commit war crimes, which would be a clear manipulation of what is intended to be an objective evidence-gathering process.Smith wrote: “The most egregious example of this manipulation occurred during my work on arms sales toSaudi Arabiaamidst its military campaign in Yemen. The UK government was fully aware that Saudi airstrikes were causing massive civilian casualties.“In a high-level meeting with senior officials, including legal advisers and the Queen’s Counsel, it was acknowledged that the UK had exceeded the legal threshold for halting arms sales. Yet instead of advising ministers to suspend exports, the focus shifted to finding ways to ‘get back on the right side’ of the law.“Rather than confronting the illegality, officials resorted to delaying tactics – extending reporting deadlines and demanding additional information that was unnecessary. This ‘wait for more evidence’ approach created a loophole, allowing arms sales to continue while the government feigned compliance.“I raised my concerns repeatedly, only to be overruled. One of my colleagues, equally troubled by what we were witnessing, resigned over the issue. I soon followed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet the UK government continued to justify arms sales to Israel, relying on the same flawed processes and evasive tactics.”He said from the UK embassy in Ireland – a country that strongly backs a Palestinian state – he sought answers from the Foreign Office headquarters about the legal basis for arms sales to Israel, and was “met with hostility and stonewalling”.“Emails went unanswered. I was warned not to put my concerns in writing. Lawyers and senior officials bombarded me with defensive instructions to ‘stick to the lines’ and delete correspondence. It became clear that no one was willing to address the fundamental question: How could continued arms sales to Israel possibly be legal?“I followed every internal procedure available to me to raise my concerns. I engaged the whistleblowing team, wrote to senior officials, and even attempted to contact the foreign secretary directly. At every turn, I was met with delays, obfuscation, and outright refusal to engage. It became clear that the system is not designed to hold itself accountable – it is designed to protect itself at all costs.”Smith’s evidence may prove material in the case being mounted by human rights groups over the continued sale of parts for the F35s that are sold to Israel and can be used inGaza.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “These allegations are a misrepresentation of this government. Our export licence controls are some of the most robust in the world and are strictly guided by legal advice. As soon as the foreign secretary took office, he ordered a review into Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law and on 2 September, we suspended export licences to Israel for use in military operations in the Gaza conflict.”The Foreign Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but had an established process for handling internal concerns.Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeArms tradeWar crimesForeign policyInternational tradeSaudi ArabiaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

He died early last year when the Israeli army bombed a building inGazanear where he was being held.Shortly before he was handed over to the Red Cross on Saturday, Sharabi was escorted on to a stage by masked Hamas fighters, where he said: “I feel very, very happy today to return to my family and friends – to my wife and daughters. I truly hope to see them very soon.”He appeared emaciated and is now being treated for severe malnutrition at a hospital in Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenEli Sharabi, pictured before the 7 October attack.Photograph: APLianne’s parents, Gill and Pete Brisley, who live in Bridgend, Wales, said their son-in-law has “sunken cheeks”, “hollow eyes” and wrists like “sticks” but was lucid when they spoke to him on a video call.“He got choked up a couple of times but managed a small smile for us. Such a brave man,” the couple said.They expressed joy and relief at his release and were preparing to fly out to see him soon, after enduring a “very emotional morning” watching his release on livestream on Saturday, they told the BBC. “Seeing Eli come out now, it brought everything back. [We] sat and bawled our eyes out,” said Gill, Lianne’s mother.“I was sitting there cuddling Lianne’s teddy bear. I think I made him wet actually. It reminded us of what we lost.”Sharabi’s brother-in-law, Stephen Brisley, told the Guardian on Saturday that he was feeling a “kaleidoscope of emotions” after Sharabi’s release.Brisley described his joy and relief at seeing Sharabi alive “because, up until yesterday afternoon, we didn’t even know whether he was alive or dead”. He said this was “very much tempered by the distress of seeing the state that he’s in”.“You can see the clothes are hanging off of him. You can see his face was gone. The spark and the light has gone from his eyes. His cheeks are sunken.“It’s a bittersweet day because we don’t know, other than the fact that he’s alive, exactly what state he’s in physically and mentally,” said Brisley. “But it’s the moment we’ve been waiting for. I’m just trying to focus on the joy of that and leave the more distressing elements for another time while we help him to recover.”The three hostages were released on Saturday as part of a three-phase agreement, designed to broker a permanent end to the war after 15 months of fighting.About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack on 7 October and another 250 taken hostage. It is estimated that nearly 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Then I’m going to go, go to the military. Let’s check the military,” the US president told the host from the rightwingFox News, adding: “We’re going to find billions, hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud and abuse.”In the last few weeks, Musk’s “department of government efficiency” has been trying to dismantle numerous federal agencies in Washington DC, going through data systems, shutting down DEI programs, and in some cases, attempting to eliminate entire agencies.Last week, Musk and Trump attempted to put thousands of workers of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) on leave, but a judge on Fridaytemporarily blockedthe effort.0:44Trump tells Fox News he expects Musk to find billions in Pentagon 'fraud and abuse' – videoWithout providing any evidence, Trump said in the Baier interview: “You take a look at theUSAid, the kind of fraud in there … We’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that’s going to places where it shouldn’t be going … It’s crazy. It’s a big scam.”Trump went on to reiterate his wish for Canada to be the 51st state.“I think Canada would be much better off being a 51st state because we lose $200bn a year with Canada and I’m not going to let that happen,” he added. “It’s too much. Why are we paying $200bn a year, essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state, I don’t mind doing it.”0:36Trump tells Fox News Canada 'would be much better off being a 51st state' – videoTrumpis the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, which has served as the finale of theNFLseason since 1966, although it is not unusual for a president to be part of Super Bowl programming.Presidents have traditionally given interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl, although both Trump andJoe Bidendeclined some requests during their first terms.Biden skipped theSuper Bowlinterview in 2024, in a move thatsome Democratic insiderssaw as a missed opportunity to speak directly to Americans. Biden’s aides said he eschewed the interview because he felt voters wanted a break from political news.This year’s interview is somewhat unusual. Fox is hosting theSuper Bowl, and has assigned Baier to host the interview. Baier is seen as less rabidly pro-Trump than some of his colleagues, but the move suggested from the beginning that the interview might not be as adversarial as one conducted by a less-partisan network.Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who moved to his members-only club in Florida after alienating much of his home state, has not indicated which team he will support.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSuper Bowl LIXFox NewsJoe BidenSuper BowlNFLUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

So, at this traditional moment for gauging initial success, how well is she doing? It depends, perhaps inevitably, on how you measure it.“What you have to remember is that for the first 18 or so months after you lose an election, especially as badly as we did, no one cares what you do,” one Tory MP said. “From that point of view, Kemi’s caution in not rushing into policies makes sense. No one is listening yet. She has time.”This is a key point. For all that the Tories are trailing behindReform UKand Labour in the polls, with Badenoch showing few signs of turning things around, there is not yet open panic, even in a party with a tradition of removing underperforming leaders.But there are definitely worries. Some centre on strategy – for example, whether Badenoch is capable of devising a suite of policies to see off Nigel Farage. Others focus on the party machine, the leader’s inner circle, and for some MPs, Badenoch herself.A common complaint is that Badenoch appears to view media duties as a chore and a challenge, often sending out shadow cabinet colleagues in her place.“Kemi absolutely hates doing media. She does not see it as an integral part of her job,” one former adviser said. “We could get away with that in government but in opposition you have to turn up to the opening of an envelope. She should be trying to get clips on the news every night. But she is not prepared to do it.”“In opposition, it’s a one-man or one-woman show,” an MP said. “With the best will in the world, voters don’t know who Chris Philp is, and they don’t care what he says.”Some seniorConservativescomplain that Badenoch neglects other basics of her job, in particular the gruelling circuit of fundraising dinners and constituency events. “She thinks she can do the job differently, but the fact is, 90% of it is graft,” said one Tory MP. “She wants to be an architect, but being leader of the opposition is more like being a bricklayer.”They added: “The problem is, the job she was applying for was not the one she thought she was applying for. She was running to be leader of the opposition, but she thought she was running to head up a right-of-centre thinktank.”View image in fullscreenBadenoch feeds a calf on a visit to a farm in Broomhall, Cheshire, last month.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PABadenoch’s circle of advisers is small and close-knit. The two major powers are her chief of staff, Lee Rowley, and her director of strategy, Rachel Maclean, both Tory former ministers who lost their seats at the last election, as well as Michael Gove’s former adviser Henry Newman.Rowley grew close to Badenoch when both served as junior ministers, and was the creative force behind her leadership campaign. But very few members of her staff have any experience of opposition, and thus how to make the weather against a government.She also faces the challenge of a creaking, diminished and disheartened party machine, with Reform UK now boasting more members.A parallel drop in funding has resulted in staff numbers at Tory HQ plummeting from 200 to about 60, with insufficient money to hire political advisers for shadow cabinet ministers. Some say the party needs to raise about £5m in the coming months just to keep afloat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The survival of its northern HQ in Leeds, which was opened under Boris Johnson, is under question.Within a context so generally grim, it is no surprise that some thoughts have already moved beyond how well or not Badenoch is faring and on to more existential matters, including whether to seek a formal deal or even union with Reform.“There’s a 40% chance that the Conservative party does not survive,” one Tory insider said.Some veterans of Conservative government believe that MPs and the people around Badenoch have not come to terms with how bad things are. A former special adviser said: “Tory MPs are totally deluded about how bad it is. They’ve got this view that it will fizzle out. They think of Farage as he was in 2015 or 2017, when he was an outsider campaigning on a single issue. He was still appearing on things like Russia Today. Now he’s standing up in parliament asking prime minister’s questions and urgent questions.“For the next 18 months Reform will be getting positive media coverage. They’re going to do well in the local elections this spring and the big ones in May 2026.”One shadow minister said: “I didn’t think this could happen, but things have actually got worse since the election. Councillors are leaving for Reform across the country; they think they’re not getting any clear sense of direction from Kemi. The only hope we realistically have of winning the next election is to do a deal with Reform. But Nigel Farage will demand a very high price for that.”Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesReform UKfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And those who say it is are lying, or simply do not know or understand Mexico.”Organised crime could be seen as a ubiquitous but uneven “parallel power”, said Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Sometimes it works with the state; sometimes it fights it. Sometimes they just exist side by side,” Freeman said.Corruption is most prevalent at a municipal level, which is both theleast protected layer of the stateand where criminal groups seekdeals with authoritiesto deepen their control over the local territory and its businesses.This was on show during the 2024 elections, whenmore than 30candidates were killed as criminal groups competed for influence. Butcorruption has gone higher up, too.Several state governors have been extradited to the US for ties to organised crime, while the Trump administration cited the case ofGenaro García Luna, the former security chief who was recently sentenced to 38 years in US prison for receiving bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.Then there were the allegations against Salvador Cienfuegos, the former defence minister who was arrested on drug-trafficking charges at the Los Angeles airport,only to be released under pressure from the Mexican government.But such cases did not equate to an alliance, a term that tarred the whole of the government, said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego.‘Mother of all battles’: terror for Mexicans as war rages inside Sinaloa cartelRead more“The way it’s phrased implies that it’s all done with the knowledge of the Mexican government, and almost willingly,” said Farfán-Méndez. “No one denies the existence of corruption in Mexico. But that’s very different to saying [the government is] an active participant.”US frustration may have stemmed from its perception that the Mexican government has more intelligence than it acts on. “The army has such power in Mexico,” said Freeman. “I think they see and hear everything that’s going on.”But inaction may just reflect differing priorities: while the US wants to go after top drug traffickers, Mexico primarily wants to reduce violence. And in practice, these objectives often run counter to one another, said Pérez Ricart.Last year, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel withJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained along with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane arrived in the US.This starteda war within the Sinaloa cartelthat has killed or disappeared almost 2,000 people so far.The Mexican governmentwas blindsided by the arrests, and blamed the US for triggering the violence. US authorities have denied their involvement, while celebrating the arrest of El Mayo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

BP has lost almost a quarter of its value in the past two years, while its rivals in Europe and the US have managed to grow and in some cases report record annual profits.In recent weeks the company has set out plans to cut thousands of jobs from its global workforce,amounting to 5% of its staff, in an effort to save billions in costs to appease its worried shareholders.BP has fallen out of favour with many investors since embarking on a plan to slash its oil and gas production in favour of spending billions on renewable energy projects. Although it has since backtracked from its full green ambitions, for some the road aheadappears uncertain, thoughreports emerged at the weekendthat the activist investor firm Elliott Investment Management has built a “significant” stake in BP and sees it as undervalued.This fall from grace could amount to an existential risk for the 120-year-old company. Industry commentators have pointed out thatBPis arguably now worth less than the sum of its parts, meaning the company could be a prime takeover target for a rival with deep enough pockets.Speculation over the future of the company is expected to grow. On Tuesday, BP will unveil its annual financial results after warning that in the final quarter of 2024 its oil and gas production was lower, its oil trading performance would be “weak” and the profit margins from its refining business would be “weaker”.At the end of this month it will hold its capital markets day in London. It is here that Murray Auchincloss, BP’s chief executive, is expected to set out a new strategy to tackle the company’s falling value, hefty debts and the market’s scepticism of its green energy aspirations.View image in fullscreenMurray Auchincloss is expected to set out a new strategy to tackle BP’s falling value, hefty debts and scepticism of its green energy aspirations.Photograph: Amr Alfiky/Reuters“We believe BP has a narrow window to come up with a positive narrative,” said Kim Fustier, HSBC’s head of European oil and gas research, adding that a “holistic shift” in strategy was needed to win back investor confidence.“A shift has already been under way at BP for some time,” said Fustier, as shown by its increased oil and gas developments and a more cautious approach to low-carbon energy investments.“The key to market perception will be how BP frames the shift. Rather than clinging to an ‘unchanged direction of travel’, it should highlight a more profound change in capital allocation and strategic decision-making,” she added.Equity analysts believe that in the near term, BP will confirm plansto discard an “aim” to reduce oil and gas productionby the end of the decade. The company is also expected to scale back spending on its five “transition growth engines”, which include electric vehicle charges and bioenergy, from between $6bn (£4.8bn) and $8bn in 2025, then rising to between $7bn and $9bn by 2030. This could fall to about $5bn, according to Fustier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

BP was expected to sell $5bn worth of assets by the end of the year, but it could raise its ambitions to $8bn by next year, he said. These assets could include its US onshore windfarms, retail fuel stations in the Netherlands, or its minority stake in the UK solar company Lightsource BP, Romeo added.Any plans to relaunch the company’s oil and gas production could be too little, too late if its new fossil fuel volumes come onstream only in the 2030s, when many expect oil consumption to have peaked.Fustier said: “This might be a concern for climate-conscious investors worried about the impact of the energy transition on oil and gas demand. In summary, rebooting BP’s upstream business is a decade-long endeavour, with little that can be done to accelerate the process.”These steps may not be enough to win over investors – but perhaps the best Auchincloss can hope for is to win over a potential suitor for a sale.Explore more on these topicsBPEnergy industryOil and gas companiesRenewable energyOilCommoditiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its tackling of politics is starting to feel very ham-fistedRebecca NicholsonSun 9 Feb 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 17.03 ESTShareFor five series,Unforgottenwas my go-to comfort television. Yes, the crime drama is always about a grisly murder, and every season begins with the gruesome discovery of remains that have been buried for years or even decades. And yes, there are plenty of scenes with body parts laid out on mortuary tables, being picked over by pathologists who say things such as, “this artery does show signs of gaping”, as if they’ve just won the lottery. But in its combination of strong casts, ample twists and the inevitable dispensation of justice, it always felt soothing, somehow. It is occasionally workmanlike, but reliably solid.As it reaches its sixth season, though, I worry that the wheels are coming off. The structure is largely the same every time – another reason it is so comforting, perhaps – and this seems to be no different. A body is discovered, it turns out to be a cold case, so it reaches the desks of the friendly, efficient and only mildly troubled cops we know and love. It throws a handful of suspects into the air and dares you to guess how these people could possibly be connected, then it waits for them to come crashing down to earth, as the pieces finally slot into place. It sprinkles it all with a touch of concern for the private lives of the detectives, and kicks back in nice, fancy kitchens as it works out whodunnit and why.The new old case arrives when an adult ribcage is discovered, having been submerged in fictional marshland in east London. This is a wonderful excuse for the scene-stealing pathologist to offload a lot of technical exposition about how a chopped-up body might look, versus one that has naturally “dispersed” over the years. Such moments are not for the squeamish. But the show has maintained its dry sense of humour. DCI Jessica James (Sinéad Keenan, who replaced Nicola Walker as the boss at the beginning of season five) surveys the scene, then offers her professional opinion: “Realistically, how far could you chuck an arm?”Her initially frosty relationship with stalwart DI Sunil Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) has definitely thawed, and the pair appear to be on good terms. As usual, they remain excellent at their jobs, while struggling with every aspect of their lives outside work. Having reluctantly stayed with her philandering husband for the sake of the children, Jess suspects that he is still at it, while poor old Sunny is lonely, having lost both his best mate and his partner Sal. Dining alone is all well and good, but not in the presence of an excessively friendly waiter who overuses the word “awesome”.View image in fullscreenA thaw in relations … Sanjeev Bhaskar and Sinéad Keenan in Unforgotten.Photograph: ITVThis series takes us to County Cork, where a “Britannia News” reporter (MyAnna Buring) is spouting off on screen about the case of a stateless woman, who has a different name but sounds a lot like Shamima Begum; behind the scenes, she is having the beginnings of a crisis of conscience. In London, a history lecturer (Victoria Hamilton) is hauled in front of her superiors for recommending a book with a controversial title (“We’re all fucking terrified of them,” she says, of her students), while also trying to parent her wayward daughter. And in Deal, Kent, a young man with autism (Maximilian Fairley) is living in squalor and struggling to care for his ailing mother. How could they be connected to each other, let alone to the severed spine found on the marshes?The problem is that Unforgotten is trying to do an awful lot of things with an awful lot of hot-button topics. This is not out of character; the last series was about austerity. But it now feels as if it is hamfistedly stuffing the plot with politics, and doing neither plot nor politics very well as a result. It covers – deep breath – illegal Channel crossings, clickbait-hunting far-right news presenters, how cancel culture is affecting the university syllabus, and the misogynistic and racist online radicalisation of vulnerable people. Of course it is easy to grasp that, in the real world, these are all interconnected. But on television, in a drama, it starts to feel as if you’ve been trapped inside a newspaper comments section and somebody has locked the door behind you.Unforgotten is wading into the culture wars, then, from the vantage point of its gorgeous kitchen islands. I’m not sure that is quite what anyone needs, nor what Unforgotten does best. I have only seen the first episode, so perhaps it will do what it always does, and bring together its disparate strands into one cohesive and predictably satisfying conclusion. Right now, though, it is no longer as soothing as it was.Unforgotten aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewUnforgottenreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are no clear surfaces. Blackened, disintegrating cabinets sag under yet more wreckage. Not an inch of floor can be seen.“One of my earliest memories is climbing over and under my mother’s hoard to get to this kitchen,” he adds, gesturing at the mountainous towers of tangled possessions overwhelming the house’s open-plan lower floor.“I was probably about six. I remember something sharp falling on my hand when I was under a pile of stuff. When I got to the kitchen, I realised I was bleeding.”‘I’m never going back to living like this’: how an innovative project is helping hoardersRead moreThere was little recognition of the specific problems faced by the children of parents who hoard untila review paperfound that about 70% of adults said their hoarding difficulties began when they were aged between 11 and 15.Experts are now calling on local authorities to intervene earlier with parents who hoard. “We want to prevent the escalation of hoarding by children into more problematic behaviour in adulthood,” said Stuart Whomsley, the author of the paper and lead clinical psychologist for Northamptonshire healthcare NHS foundation trust.Megan Karnes, of HoardingUK, agreed. “The trauma of growing up in a hoard can trigger hoarding behaviours in a child, although there is also a genetic component,” she said.HoardingUK is so concerned about the risks and impact on the children of parents who hoard that it is launching a dedicated online support group in April.“Children of parents who hoard can be at more physical risk than the children of alcoholics,” she said. “As well as the physical dangers of living in a hoard – the fire risks, hygiene, vermin, avalanche risk – the child lives in the visual representation of the parent’s trauma, and therefore experiences trauma themselves.”Even when the scale of hoarding is less extreme, children of parents who hoard learn to do without basic comforts, including anywhere to play, learn and relax. And they internalise the message that their parent’s objects are more important than they are.A parent’s hoard also affects their children’s social world. Richard, now 21, still lives with his mother. He worked hard as a child to hide her hoarding disorders from other people, struggling through her chaos to ensure he presented a neat appearance to an outside world that he never allowed through the front door.He had no playdates or sleepovers. Decades later, he still feels the same distress he experienced when a friend arrived unexpectedly at his door to invite him to the park.His machinations worked: his mother’s disorder remained hidden. But Richard is now also a hoarder, his room an overwhelming confusion of total disorder washing up against meticulously arranged collections of Warhammer and Lord of the Rings merchandise.“I can’t move out,” he sighs. “My mum needs me and I’ve got all my stuff here. It’s just too complicated.”Even if a child does not develop hoarding difficulties of their own, having a parent who hoards precludes any opportunity to learn how to be tidy in later life.Lily, 32, only learned at university. “I just didn’t see mess, and even when it was pointed out to me I had no idea what to do about it,” she said.“I’m painfully alert now because I do worry that I might have a genetic pull towards hoarding. But having grown up in a house where nothing was clean, nothing worked and nothing was thrown away means I have absolutely no instinct about what is the right way to acquire possessions, arrange or dispose of them.”Help is emerging. Jo Cooke, of Hoarding Disorders UK, reports a huge surge in contacts from children’s services, schools and charities such as Home-Start wanting to understand the complexities of hoarding. “We have trained up many in this area,” she said.Kayley Hyman, a child of a parent who hoarded and the founder of Holistic Hoarding, recruited what she believes to be the UK’s first specialist children and family worker. In the one year, the specialist has prevented 18 children from going into the care system.“We were getting increasing numbers of referrals where the lead reason for the children going on the child protection register was their home conditions,” Hyman said. “We realised we needed someone to advocate for the child so that the way in which the local authority dealt with the parent’s hoarding behaviours took the needs of their child into account as well.”Karnes is working with Gloucester city council to focus on children. “What we have in these situations are good parents who have a bad problem,” she said. “We want to make sure the focus of the local authority becomes the child instead of the parent, so that parent is no longer penalised and pressurised to deal with a problem that the evidence proves they can’t solve without time and understanding.“It means the local authority has to slow right down,” she added. “Instead of just clearing out the parent’s home, they work with the parent to prevent their child suffering the additional trauma of going into care. With enough time and patience, this issue is solvable.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenMental healthLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Now they’re all Christian nationalist yes-men, and we’re up against something greater this time around. But it’s bringing this community together.”The US president has taken a special interest in the historically immigrant-friendly state ofColorado, calling his deportation plan for alleged gang members Operation Aurora, named for the Denver suburb claimed by him and echoed by conservative media to have been “taken over” by the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA).One of the executive orders signed on Trump’s first day in office was to cut funding andsend a stop-workorder to the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (Rmian), a Colorado non-profit offering free legal services to the undocumented. Due to the large volume of those in need, Colorado has one of the lowest rates of legal representation for undocumented immigrants.Then last week heavily armed Swat teams began storming apartment complexes around Denver and Aurora in the early hours of the morning – sometimes witha Fox News crew embeddedwith the teams – though with30 arrestsin all, only one gang member has been confirmed to be in custody.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the state capitol in Denver on Wednesday.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APWith around 155,000 undocumented immigrants in Colorado fearing for their safety, many local residents have rallied to show their support however they can.Despite their setbacks, last week the Rmian wasable to offera crash course in immigration law to 100 Colorado attorneys who, despite not working in that field, have volunteered their legal services.Whenever Ice raids are spotted, volunteers from groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center often are on hand to offer literature on the legal rights of those under siege. At Saturday’s rally outside the state capitol building inDenver, activists with megaphones led a call-and-response chant of legal advice, prompting the crowd with “When Ice shows up?” followed by a collective roar: “Don’t open the door!”The protester and artist Starks, along with many others, have been attending weekly gatherings at a local Methodist church on how to best serve the legal needs of immigrants. One organizer placed the turnout at a meeting last Monday at more than 1,500 people.View image in fullscreenMany local residents in Colorado have rallied to show their support however they can.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APMany of the activists speaking at Saturday’s rally expressed contempt for New York-based property management company CBZ Management, which oversee several properties in Aurora and Denver that have beenfined or shut downfor squalid and neglectful living conditions. Last August, Zev Baumgarten of CBZ Management,accused of being“an out of state slumlord” by the Aurora mayor, claimed one of their Aurora apartment buildings had been overtaken by TdA gang members, which was why they were unable to provide needed repairs and services.This unfolded just in time for Trump to parrot the claims during hispresidential debateagainstKamala Harrisweeks later, eventually making Aurora an unlikely campaign spot for the Republican candidate, since Colorado has been a reliably blue state since 2008.For decades Colorado has cultivated a reputation for welcoming immigrants who have come across theUS-Mexico border, especially when they’re under siege from many across the rest of the nation.In the 1990s, when Democrats were being pulled to the right on issues like immigration, Denver’s mayor, Wellington Webb, pushed against that tide, criticizing federal persecution of immigrants ina 1998 executive orderand declaring the state capital would “welcome all to share in Denver’s warm hospitality”.He insisted: “We must respect this diversity and ensure the rights of all our residents are protected,” and Denver “would not tolerate discrimination in any form”.However a movement of hard-right, anti-immigrant activists in the Republican party found representation at this time in Colorado, such as in the form of congressman Tom Tancredo, who built his political careerattacking Denver librariesfor stocking Spanish speaking books,calling forthe deportation of a Denver high school student,stripping“sanctuary cities” of their federal funding, and calling on Americato rejectthe “cult of multiculturalism”.View image in fullscreenThousands took to the streets after raids by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) throughout Denver.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APTancredo’s decade as a congressman from 1999-2009, along with his failed bids for the presidency and governorship, helped build the narrative architecture of what would become the Make America Great Again conservative movement’s anti-immigrant rage.Despite the protests last Wednesday and Saturday in Denver, portions of the state still hold enough conservative voters to keep Trump loyalists like Representative Lauren Boebert in office.Boebert recently joined forces with two other Colorado representatives topressurethe state’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, to repeal a series of laws protecting immigrants rights in Colorado. Often referred to as a “Democratic libertarian”, Polishas endorsedthe core of Trump’s deportation plan.“Hey Polis, where are you? We have courage, how about you?” the crowd at Saturday’s rally chanted, as it moved away from the capitol building and through downtown Denver.The march eventually made its way peacefully back to the capitol, where more literature was handed out and future gatherings were announced.“We take these threats [from Trump] very seriously,” said Katie Leonard, one of the days’ speakers and an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which has been documenting Ice raids and posting their locations on social media, leading to the arrival of more volunteers, often shouting advice to residents about their rights through megaphones or blasting the neighborhoods with informative leaflets.“But the decisive factor in what happens here, when these Ice raids come and indiscriminately round up people, is whether the community is prepared, whether the people know their rights,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsColoradoDenverDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

From the very beginning, this tale of male bonding and sexual expedition – inspired bythe comedian Jack Rooke’s university days – existed in the shadow of grief. The first thing we learn about Jack, our semi-fictional protagonist, is that his dad, Laurie, died when Jack was a teenager. Loss hovered over the show’s chronicle of the sensitive, sheltered Jack’s student scrapes, as he formed an unlikely friendship with his laddish, socially assured roommate Danny while struggling to find his feet in Brent uni’s gay scene.Yet it wasn’t until the final instalment of series two that we were thrown headlong into Jack’s grief. When his motormouth cousin Shannon goes into labour with her first child, the family are transported, physically and psychologically, back to the place where Laurie died. By intercutting the farcical birth scene – inappropriate midwives, urgent demands for Peperami Firesticks – with gut-wrenching flashbacks to Laurie’s final days, Big Boys was able to do what it does best: splice ferocious sadness with snippets of sweet, mildly profane comic relief, and capture life at its most precious and prosaic.But Jack’s bereavement was not Big Boys’ only framing device. The sitcom’s matey vibe disguised an elaborately meta concept: Jack, you see, has been split in two. On screen, he is played with dozy innocence by Derry Girls’ Dylan Llewellyn, while the sparkier Rooke takes on voiceover duties, narrating the action as an older version of Llewellyn’s imaginary Jack and asthe writer’s real-world self. But there’s more: Rooke is addressing this trip down memory lane exclusively to Danny (Jon Pointing), who, we discover, struggles with depression. Why? It seems to be connected to the fact that Danny’s real-life counterpart, Olly – Rooke’s friend from his stint at the University of Westminster – killed himself a few years after graduation.View image in fullscreenBravura … Harriet Webb with Camille Coduri in Big Boys.Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Channel 4/Patch DolanSo it’s with a sense of needling dread that the third and final series ofBig Boyskicks off. Initially, however, that specific topic is pushed to the back burner as we’re whisked back to a more innocent time – the summer of 2015 (“pre-Brexit, pre-Covid, pre-air fryers”) – to rejoin an increasingly confident Jack and a very happy Danny, who is now loved-up with the pair’s clever, kind and assertive friend Corinne (Izuka Hoyle).In the opening episodes the trio, plus Yemi (the unwaveringly hilarious Olisa Odele), their flamboyant fashion designer pal, holiday in Greece with Jack’s family. They grapple with their dissertations – in keeping with the show’s laudable mission to normalise gay sex, Jack’s is on the mainstream media representation of homosexuality – and delve into the eye-watering world of performance poetry. Meanwhile, Rooke has a lot of fun with the 2010s setting, mining nostalgia from such epochal cultural moments as Jeremy Clarkson leaving Top Gear and that time in Celebrity Big Brother when the housemates thought David Gest had died in the next room.Big Boys is at its most gratifying when hymning this slightly dated picture of joyously ordinary British life: bingo, Tesco meal deals, Fleet services, The X Factor. Cousin Shannon – who has become the show’s primary comic engine thanks to a bravura performance from Harriet Webb – is an endless font of such references (in the first episode alone, she shoehorns in Balamory and Hollyoaks Later).‘Does my character have to be so horny?’ Big Boys star Jon Pointing on lust, laddishness and leaping into blockbustersRead moreOccasionally, the show’s warm relatability strays into sitcom cliche; storylines such as Jack getting sunburnt in Greece or his mum, Peggy (Camille Coduri), donning uncomfortable knock-off shapewear that makes her behave strangely on a date feel very familiar. But some cliches exist for a reason. Jack entering his pretentious poet era may seem like a well-worn comic trope, but the plotline is genuinely (and, in light of the disastrous literature produced, regrettably) rooted in Rooke’s real life.In any case, we should luxuriate in the laughs while we can, because Big Boys soon takes a stomach-dropping tonal turn that allows the show’s multiple strands – mental health, loss, friendship, the high-concept intent behind Rooke’s self-referential fictionalisation of his student years – to come together. Like Danny’s beloved Top Gear, Big Boys ends on a bombshell, just not quite the one you might be expecting. Pointing deserves to win major awards for his goosebump-inducingly poignant depiction of how depression can look from the outside and how it can feel from the inside. It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.Big Boys is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But for leading film and TV publicity and awards strategist Julie La’Bassiere, it made complete sense. Julie is British-born but moved to the US with her mother when she was a child and had been based there ever since. That was, until 2021, when she found herself living through a particularly ugly point in American history. “Between the Covid lockdowns, George Floyd and Trump, it was… a lot. I realised it was time to come home.”Julie did consider other areas of London, but kept finding herself drawn back to the neighbourhood where she lived until the age of eight, which was where her grandparents had settled when they came to London as part of the Windrush generation in the 1960s. “My grandparents were incredibly special to me and I have many warm memories of being looked after by them when my mother was at work,” she remembers. When Julie was collected from school by her grandfather, a bonus was that he drove an old Bentley. “It must have been in the year of the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, 1977, because I took to sitting on the back seat and giving my classmates what I called my ‘royal wave’…”Julie now lives in a flat that is a stone’s throw from both her primary school and her grandparents’ old house. “When you return to a place you knew as a child, where you felt happy and protected, it awakens some kind of muscle memory,” she says, “you immediately feel at home.”View image in fullscreen‘You immediately feel at home’: dark aubergine walls and textural details in the bedroom.Photograph: Anna Stathaki/The ObserverIt was important that the décor also felt instinctively right: “I wanted my home to be stylish but comfortable, colourful but not garish, and decorated with interesting things,” she says. “But most of all, I wanted it to feel like me.”While so much about this Victorian flat felt familiar to Julie, there was the odd duff note. “The bathroom was a problem. It was small and a tricky shape and I knew I needed help to fix it,” she says. A friend of a friend said Julie should talk to interior designer Olivia Clasper, who runsAssembly Interiors. “That was the beginning of our interiors love affair,” she laughs. “She is a great listener and tuned into all the things that I love.”View image in fullscreen‘Small’ and ‘tricky’: the bathroom, post-makeover, with its soft green tilesPhotograph: Anna Stathaki/The ObserverBefore work began, most of the walls of this flat were painted a uniform cold grey. Now, mellow paint shades set the mood, with a deep blue in the living room, a dark aubergine dimming the levels in the bedroom and a green-grey backdrop in the hallway. “When you list all the colours, they sound potentially overwhelming,” says Julie, “but visually it works, with smooth transitions from one space to the next.”Rather more playful colours and vertical stripes are used in the kitchen, which takes inspiration from Mediterranean style, rocking terrazzo tiles and a cute café curtain. Then there’s Julie’s dressing room, which adds a blast of sunshine yellow, with just a sprinkling of powder-puff pink. “I love walking into this room every morning – it’s such a treat,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Such a treat’: Julie’s dressing room in soft shades of yellow and pink.Photograph: Anna Stathaki/The ObserverA tactile theme that runs through all the rooms is velvet, softening edges and adding sink-into comfort. “I would never want a home that’s too stylised, where guests don’t feel they can sit down and immediately relax,” Julie adds.As a textural contrast to the soft furnishings, the entire chimney breast of the living room is clad in a shimmering wall of glazed tiles. “Initially, I wasn’t sure about the idea, but once the tiles were up, it looked stunning. So much so that I felt bad covering them up with a TV – but at least it is a design that displays an artwork instead of a blank screen when it’s turned off,” she smiles. Given Julie’s job, a TV was always going to be a must: alongside her role as chief strategy officer at DDA, a global communications agency that specialises in film, TV, brands and games, she is also deputy chair atBafta.View image in fullscreenArtful touches: the glazed blue tiles of the chimney breast contrast the room’s soft textures – and the TV that turns into artwork when not in use.Photograph: Anna Stathaki/The ObserverWhile some of the luxe finishes in her home might whisper of the glamorous side of the film world Julie inhabits, there are also artworks, photographs and woven fabrics that resonate in personal ways. “It’s important for me to sit in my womanness, to sit in my Blackness and to sit in the fact that I work in film and entertainment – all of those things are part of my identity,” she says.So twoFrank Bowlingprints hang over the sofa in the living room and a joyful photograph by civil rights photojournalist Gordon Parks greets Julie as she walks in the door.

The simple way to build a fitness habit you’ll actually loveIf you can find a workout you always look forward to, you’re far more likely to stick with it and keep fitter for longer. Trainers give their pointers – and pitfallsPhil DaoustSun 9 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareOnly an idiot would claim to love every form of exercise. At 61, I believe it’s the only way to delay the body’s slow crumble, but ugh, so much of it is unpleasant, or dull, or just not for me. I don’t think I will ever not hate Bulgarian split squats. I’m bored to tears by the static bike. Football, rugby, tennis, cricket? Been there, done that, burned the T-shirt.But that’s OK, because there’s a lot that I adore.Running. Lake swims. Yoga. Skiing, snowshoeing, anything snow-related. Just bloody walking! And above all, calisthenics – dangling from gymnastics rings, standing on my hands, trying to hoist and fold and balance myself in ways that demand far more strength and control than I can usually muster. I will never be cool, but “cali” is.I’m rubbish at most of this stuff, but that doesn’t stop me putting in the hours. I will practise handstands in the hall when the rest of the family are slumped in front of the TV, or get up before dawn to run through pitch-black woods – not because I have to, but because I want to. I’m hoping to be doing this forat least another 39 years.Fun is the key, as far as I’m concerned. Sooner or later, you will stumble across some kind of movement that makes you happy, whether it’s powerlifting, ping-pong or pole dancing. To stay as fit as you can, for as long as you can, you need to grab it and hold it close.View image in fullscreenKelly Cho performs a front lever.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“For me, fun is the No 1 thing,” agreesKelly Cho, whose tough but beginner-friendly calisthenics classes pack out theWaking Dreamsstudio in east London. I’m such a fan that I’m reluctant to mention them in case I never get a place again. “Motivation is not going to be there all the time,” Cho says. “The only thing that’s going to carry you through is the love.”“Leaning into what you enjoy is super important,” saysLucy Joslin, another inspirational instructor, who teaches cali atMissiona few miles away. “When it gets hard, when it’s cold outside or raining, or you’ve got to get up at six in the morning to do it, it has to be something you enjoy. It has to bring you some kind of joy – otherwise what on earth is it all for?” On top of teaching, Joslin works out six days a week. “I’d be really happy if I had three hours a day just to go to the gym.”“Life is full ofshoulds,” saysTiffany Soi, a yoga movement coach and former competitive rock climber. “There’s all this stuff we have to do. You can tell yourself that something is good for you, but if it becomes a kind of grinding routine, it’s very easy to lose that sense of engagement and motivation – and you stop doing it. But people want toplay.”Now 38, Soi has been climbing since she was 20. “And I’m planning on doing it till I’m at least 100.”View image in fullscreen‘I will never be cool, but calisthenics is’ … Daoust tries the ‘candlestick’.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“Fun matters” shouldn’t be a radical idea, but a lot of the fitness industry doesn’t seem to get it. All too often what you get from a personal trainer is what they know how to teach rather than what you might stick with. You’d better hope that what makes you happy is three or four sessions in the gym every week.“I hear so many horror stories of how people were first introduced to exercise,” saysMichael Ulloa, an Edinburgh-based personal trainer. “People can be won over by different forms of exercise if they are shown a healthy and enjoyable way to undertake them, but I would treat that as an add-on once you’re consistent with exercise. Get your body moving regularly, see how it feels doing it for a while, and then you can worry about any extras that might further improve your health.”That said, there’s a point where those “extras” become compulsory. Whatever your passion, in the long term you’ll need to do something on top to support it and look after the stuff it neglects. This might be your bone and muscle, your heart and lungs, your mobility or your balance. Even the funnest activity can’t cover all the bases.If you’re into football, say, then off the pitch you should be doing everything you can to prevent knee injuries, and to strengthen your upper body. If cali’s your thing, your upper body is taken care of, but your legs may need resistance work, in the form of weighted squats, perhaps, or one-legged squats. And let’s not forget the cardio …“Things go wrong when the thing we love to do becomes the only thing we do,” warns Laura Williams, the owner ofMat Pilates ATXin Austin, Texas. “Whether it’s pickleball or ballroom dance, the activities we love will create asymmetrical movement habits and strength imbalances that might lead to acute or overuse injuries.”View image in fullscreenKelly Cho demonstrates an L-sit.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianWilliams, 54, is talking from experience: dancing has been her passion since 2008, when she took her first “Broadway jazz” class. “But dancing began creating a lot of pain for me in my early 40s,” she says. “I went to physical therapy, did my exercises, and got stronger and the pain was managed. When I asked my physiotherapist if I had to do these ‘boring exercises’ for the rest of my life, she said, ‘Yes, if you want to keep dancing as much as you do – or you could do pilates.’” Williams enjoyed that so much that she now teaches it as well as practising it. “And I am still dancing.”Worried that all these extras will dilute the fun? They don’t have to, says Joslin. “Take my friend, who’s 50-odd. She was like, ‘Ugh, I hate going to the gym. I hate it.’ And I said, ‘Well, what did you do when you were younger?’ She used to love netball. ‘OK, so why don’t you go and find a netball club?’ So now she’s playing netball, and with the games and the drills to prepare for them it’s pretty much covering all her bases.”If all else fails, a friendly face can make all the difference. “Even if it’s a grim exercise you don’t like, maybe you can do it with people that you do like. I hate jumping exercises, for instance, but if I do them with a mate, then I’ll be looking forward to hanging out with her – and it will work.”Nailed the basics? Don’t forget the extrasFive activities you just might love – and how you should be supplementing themClimbingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: fotodelux/Getty ImagesWhat’s it good for?“Climbing is a great full-body exercise, head to toe,” says Tiffany Soi, a former competitive rock climber. “You engage many of the smaller muscles that perhaps you wouldn’t in a regular weight-training session, and train your core a lot ifyou’re playing on steeper angles. It’s also amazing for problem-solving, coordination and proprioception.”What’s it less good for?“There’s a lot of upper body intensity in climbing, and it can be hard on your shoulders, elbows and fingers. You can make quite rapid progress when you start, but your tendons and ligaments don’t necessarily adapt quickly enough. And when you begin to do more difficult things, there’s a tendency to get a little overeager with some of the smaller holds and it can be easy to sprain a finger. It’s also easy to neglect your lower body, although the more you use your legs and hips, the better your climbing gets.”So whatelse should you be doing?“Yoga is great, ideally a dynamic style with a focus on strength. This is excellent ‘antagonistic’ training that balances all of climbing’s pulling. You want to work your core muscles, but also your legs, because it is very easy to focus too much on your upper body.Pilatesis also a lovely complement to climbing – both mat and reformer. Resistance training becomes more important as you get older – either through the reformer or with free weights.”Weight trainingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mike Harrington/Getty ImagesWhat’s it good for?“The benefits of weightlifting are vast,” says personal trainer Michael Ulloa. “Building muscle mass, improving bone density, reducing risk of injury, reducing your risk of chronic diseases …”What’s it less good for?“It will have less of an impact on heart and lung health than traditional cardiovascular exercise (running, swimming, cycling, etc). This does depend on how you train, though, as more circuit-based weight training can provide good benefits for both.” As far as injuries go, these mostly affect knees, the lower back and shoulders.So what else should you be doing?“If you want to really bulletproof your health as you age, couple this with a form of cardio,” says Ulloa. “My advice is simple: get walking.Walkingis an excellent low-intensity, low-injury-risk, easily accessible form of exercise that we can all benefit from.”CyclingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesWhat’s it good for?Cycling is not just superb cardiovascular exercise. “There is also a high resistance element for the legs, and it will build strength and muscle mass,” saysGeorgia Vaines, an Exeter-based triathlete and pilates teacher. “Off-road cycling can be more physical for the upper body, too.”What’s it less good for?“There is little impact in comparison with other sports, particularly in road riding, so cross-training in something with impact is necessary for healthy bone density, particularly in older women.” The most common cycling injuries include “shoulder dysfunction caused by all that time hunched over the bars, lower back and knee pain, weak back extensors, tight hip flexors … If you cycle without any form of cross-training, you are likely to get injured. It’s just too much of a repetitive movement pattern in a very limited plane of motion – certain muscle groups get very overactive and you lose mobility in your joints.”So what else should you be doing?“Work on your stability. Pilates is a fantastic tool for cyclists because you are going to strengthen the core stabilisers of the pelvis and spine, mobilise your hips and your thoracic spine, and restore elasticity to muscles such as the hip flexors. This is also going to help you carry your groceries to the door without shoulder pain and swing your grandkids without herniating a disc.”FootballView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pekic/Getty ImagesWhat’s it good for?“Football is great for heart and lung health, while also improving your agility and coordination,” says Ulloa. “Although not to the extent that direct weight training will, it will still help to boost bone mineral density (or at least help to limit the loss of it as we get older). In addition, the social element of playing a team sport can drastically improve mental health.”What’s it less good for?“Although football is a full-body activity, engaging every muscle in our body, it does not provide the best stimulus for increasing muscle mass. It lacks that strength element.” It’s also a major source of anterior cruciate ligament (knee) injuries.So what else should you be doing?“Learning good running mechanics can reduce the risk of injury, along with strength training to build your body’s resilience and to iron out any muscular imbalances.” Strength training will pay off later, too: “If you’re regularly picking a heavy barbell off the ground, you will make light work of picking up the grandkids. Carrying those heavy dumbbells will replicate walking with heavy shopping bags. If you can squat down holding some weight, then getting off that toilet seat with just your body weight will be a breeze.”RunningView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesWhat’s it good for?Cardiovascular fitness, above all. “Beyond the heart health benefits, it also works your lungs, and improves cognition and mood,” saysAmanda Katz, a New York-based personal trainer and running coach.What’s it less good for?“It’s not a bone-building activity in the way that lifting weights and plyometrics are.” Running-related injuries include IT band syndrome, plantar fasciitis and issues with the achilles tendon.So what should you be doing?“I encourage everyone, runner or not, to engage in strength training – specifically, lifting heavy. The main areas for strength development are squat, hinge, press and pull variations.”Fit For Ever: An Evening With Phil Daoust,Chrisvan TullekenandNahid de BelgeonneJoin Phil Daoust, physician and author Chris van Tulleken, and movement coach Nahid de Belgeonne on 12 February, 7.30pm, Conway Hall, London, as they talk about how to live a strong, happy and long life.

I urge my former colleagues to resist themBritain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, former diplomat claimsSun 9 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 13.07 ESTShareMy name is Mark Smith. I am a former diplomat and policy adviser at theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO). I spent my career working in the Middle East directorate and serving in the Arab world. As a lead officer on arms sales policy, I was responsible for assessing whether the UK government’s arms sales adhered to legal and ethical standards under domestic and international law.In August 2024,I resignedover the UK government’s refusal to halt arms sales to Israel amid the bombardment of Gaza. This decision followed over a year of internal lobbying and whistleblowing. My resignation made headlines, and weeks later, the new Labour government announced it would finallysuspend arms sales to Israel. While this was welcome, it came far too late. Israel has continued to commit atrocities in Gaza as the UK stands by, unwilling to act.My time at the FCDO exposed how ministers can manipulate legal frameworks to shield “friendly” nations from accountability. They stall, distort and obscure official processes to create a facade of legitimacy, while allowing the most egregious crimes against humanity to take place. Now, as the US – one of our closest allies – proposes the full-scaleethnic cleansing of Gaza, what will our response be?What I witnessed was not just moral failure but conduct that I believe crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes. The British public deserves to know how these decisions are made behind closed doors – and how systemic dysfunction enables the government to perpetuate harm while shielding itself from scrutiny.As a lead adviser on arms sales policy, my role was to gather information on the conduct of foreign governments involved in military campaigns, particularly regarding civilian casualties and adherence to international humanitarian law. This information formed the basis of reports that advised ministers on whether continued arms sales were lawful.The UK’s legal framework is clear: arms sales must cease if there is a “clear risk” that weapons could be used to commit serious violations of international law. Civil servants are bound by a strict code of impartiality, requiring us to produce neutral, evidence-based advice. Any attempt to alter or manipulate this advice for political convenience is not just unethical – it is unlawful.However, during my tenure, I witnessed senior officials under intense pressure from ministers to skew the legal assessment. Reports were repeatedly returned to me with instructions to “rebalance” the findings – to downplay evidence of civilian harm and emphasise diplomatic efforts, regardless of the facts. I was often summoned for verbal instructions – a tactic deliberately employed to avoid creating a written record that could be subject to freedom of information requests or legal scrutiny.In one instance, a senior official bluntly told me, “This looks really bad,” before urging me to “Make it look less stark.” My protests were ignored. Significant edits were made to my reports, shifting the focus away from credible evidence of war crimes to paint a misleading picture of “progress” by foreign governments. This was not an isolated case – it was part of a systemic effort to suppress inconvenient truths.The most concerning example of this manipulation occurred during my work on arms sales to Saudi Arabiaamid its military campaign in Yemen. The UK government was fully aware that Saudi airstrikes were causing massive civilian casualties. In a high-level meeting with senior officials, including legal advisers, it was acknowledged that the UK had exceeded the threshold for halting arms sales. Yet instead of advising ministers to suspend exports, the focus shifted to finding ways to “get back on the right side” of the law.Rather than confronting the illegality, officials resorted to delaying tactics – extending reporting deadlines and demanding additional information that was unnecessary. This “wait for more evidence” approach created a loophole, allowing arms sales to continue while the government feigned compliance. I raised my concerns repeatedly, only to be overruled. One of my colleagues, equally troubled by what we were witnessing, resigned over the issue. I soon followed.The UK was ultimately forced to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia afterlosing a judicial reviewbrought by civil society organisations. But instead of learning from this failure, the government responded by changing the lawto make it harderto challenge arms exports in court. A year later,arms sales to Saudi Arabia resumed.While the Saudi case was alarming, what I witnessed regarding UK arms sales toIsraelwas even more concerning. Israel’s repeated bombardments of Gaza have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed vital infrastructure, actions that are clearly incompatible with international law. Yet the UK government continued to justify arms sales to Israel, relying on the same flawed processes and evasive tactics.During Israel’s current military campaign inGaza– a campaign marked by unprecedented destruction and the deliberate targeting of civilian areas – I grew increasingly concerned. By this time, I was serving as a diplomat in Dublin, where Ireland’s staunch support for Palestine put me in an uncomfortable position. I was expected to defend UK policy, but I could not in good conscience do so without answers.When I raised questions with the FCDO about the legal basis for our arms sales to Israel, I was met with hostility and stonewalling. Emails went unanswered. I was warned not to put my concerns in writing. Lawyers and senior officials besieged me with defensive instructions to “stick to the lines” and delete correspondence. It became clear that no one was willing to address the fundamental question: how could continued arms sales to Israel possibly be legal?The Foreign Office’s handling of these issues is nothing short of a scandal. Officials are bullied into silence. Processes are manipulated to produce politically convenient outcomes. Whistleblowers are stonewalled, isolated and ignored. And all the while, the UK government continues to arm regimes that commit atrocities, hiding behind legal loopholes and public relations spin.I followed every internal procedure available to me to raise my concerns. I engaged the whistleblowing team, wrote to senior officials and even contactedthe foreign secretary, David Lammy, directly. At every turn, I was met with delays, obfuscation and outright refusal to engage. It became clear that the system is not designed to hold itself accountable – it is designed to protect itself at all costs.The UK’s complicity in war crimes cannot continue. We must demand transparency and accountability in our arms export policies. Ministers must be held to the same legal and ethical standards that they claim to uphold. Civil servants must be empowered to provide impartial advice without fear of political interference, and whistleblowers must be protected, not punished, for speaking the truth.The situation in Gaza could not be more acute. The UK’s closest ally now proposes the mass expulsion of 2.1 million people from Gaza and the demolition of one of the most densely populated civilian areas on Earth – this is ethnic cleansing.I call on my former colleagues – those who still believe in the values of integrity and justice – to refuse to be complicit.

The public isn’t falling for itSun 9 Feb 2025 08.21 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 11.12 ESTShare“Keir doesn’t engage in the political process. He got this far by not expressing any political opinions … He’s good with people, but he doesn’t debate big ideas.”After 200 pages of a compelling new book about the Labour party’s return to power, the story falls into a run of these quotations.Get In, by the Westminster journalists Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, makes it clear that after he became the Labour leader, Keir Starmer developed an incredible ruthlessness. Casting him as the kind of operator who ought to be renowned for the trail of human wreckage they leave in their wake, the book highlights the “many people whose careers have come to a brutal end at Starmer’s remorseless hand”. His readiness to behave like that, however, does not come from any ideological zeal, but rather its opposite: an absence of convictions and ideals that means he can shape-shift – and dispatch colleagues and allies – with a blithe ease.In 2021, we are told, the Labour leader was visited at home by one of his predecessors, Ed Miliband, and Tony Blair’s old flatmate,Charlie Falconer, who presented him with a handful of challenges: “Are you left? Are you right? Are you middle? Why should we be in power?” No answers seemed to be forthcoming: the problem, among others, was that Starmer was “a leader who did not much like politics”. This revelation explains the other defining feature of his time at the top: the fact that, as Maguire and Pogrund tell it, Starmer has taken his most basic political orders from a coterie – or “project” – centred on his all-powerful strategist and mentor Morgan McSweeney.In that sense, the directionless mess the government has fallen into has two interlocking causes. Having cunningly manoeuvred Labour to victory, Starmer’s advisers have apparently failed to supply him with a coherent governing script, exposing his lack of politics, and leaving him panicked. Onlookers sense this as a matter of instinct: his approval ratings, for what they are worth,have lately registered numberseven worse than Rishi Sunak’s low point. In focus groups,voters reportedlyoffer such opinions as “He looks like a rabbit caught in headlights.” Aside from his obvious liking for international diplomacy, his famed ruthlessness seems to sit alongside the kind of discomfort with his job that people always find troubling – witness the way that such ill-at-ease premiers as Gordon Brown and Theresa May never really connected with the public.There is still – just about – an identifiably social-democratic strand in some of what the government is doing – from Angela Rayner’s mission on new workplace rights, through moves onpublic transport, to plans for new investment in our hospitals and schools. The problem is that the relevance of this stuff to Starmer and his colleagues’ sense of purpose is falling away. Worse still, the resulting vacuum is now being filled by manic, feckless lurches into places that no centre-left government ought to go.Reboots and relaunches now seem to arrive on an almost weekly basis: the latest isall about being “disruptors”, and delivering shocks and surprises that may not actually be shocking or surprising at all. Last week, Labour launched online adverts seemingly purposelycreated to look like Reform UK propaganda, complete with such slogans as “Labour hits 5-year high in migrant removals” – the kind of flimsy posturing that surely makes it look like Nigel Farage is dictating the political weather, and encourages even more people to support him. The same applies to an imminent run of grim campaigning videos thatwill focus on deported immigrants, following them “from detention in early morning raids to transfer from bleak immigration removal centres to waiting planes and … footage aboard flights out of the country”.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner arrives at 10 Downing Street for a cabinet meeting, 28 January 2025.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockAt the same time, the kind of moves that might substantially weaken Reform UK’s insurgency in old Labour heartlands seem to be off limits. Angela Rayner today talked upLabour’s determination to meet its target of building 1.5m new homes, but who sees any signs of that? And amid plansto drastically develop the corridor between Oxford and Cambridgeand build a third runway at Heathrow – eventually – what of the seemingly flatlining prospects of the old coalfields and manufacturing centres where Farage and his party may soon clean up?Which, once we are past a work and pensions secretary claiming that many people on sickness and incapacity benefits are“taking the mickey”while her departmentthreatens cruel cuts, brings us to the current defining feature of Starmerism. The government’s re-energised belief in economic growth at all costs is exactly what people with precious few substantial ideas would pick as their chosen cause. Given that it now entails brazen strides away from the green agenda that Starmer and his allies once claimed was the absolute fulcrum of their politics, it heightens their air of twitchy desperation.Monomaniacal growthism is also making Starmer’s administration sound discomfitingly weird, something highlighted bya quote from a government spokespersonincluded in a recent run of stories about the UK’s childhood mental health crisis: “We are committed to raising the healthiest generation of children ever and recognise the importance of this to our number one mission – economic growth.” The tone suggests one of Stalin’s five-year plans being fronted by Alan Partridge.Get In by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund review – behind the scenes with Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s arch strategistRead moreMore troubling still, growth’s motor will be the government’s latest drive: deregulation. A recent Starmer piecein the Timessuggested that his lack of values is also manifested in an odd historical amnesia, and the choice of language it produces: he compared “a morass of regulation” to “Japanese knotweed”, and insisted on the urgent need to “curb regulator overreach”. Most of us know what that kind of zealotry has led to: the financial crash of 2008, the Grenfell Tower disaster and a country full of sewage-strewn rivers. And flirting with it gifts Labour’s opponents with ready-made attack lines. Watch what happens next time Rayner breaks cover to extol the wonders of limits to zero-hours contracts and restrictions on fire-and-rehire tactics: the right will trill endlessly about new additions to what Starmer calls “thickets of red tape”.At the end of Get In, the authors tell the story of the night that went from 4-5 July 2024, which now feels like it happened a very long time ago. Starmer is caught making a speech at Tate Modern at 5am, to a crowd full ofLabourparty insiders: “Change begins now! … Four and a half years of work changing the party. This is what it is for.”Seven months on, those words have an unsettling quality, centred on how flimsy Labour’s programme now feels, and the glaring political void at the top. Starmer’s emptiness, moreover, is not just a problem for his party: it blurs into the even bigger story of how weak orthodox politics seems in the face of global threats that are still unfolding. As the new right runs riot around the world, does this government feel like it might blaze a trail away from all the chaos, or soon be swept away by it, as another confused relic of a faded political past? Increasing numbers of people seem to know the answer to that question. The fact that it feels so likely is surely terrifying.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Female employees should not be expected to share changing rooms with male colleagues. They shouldn’t be socially shamed into undressing around them, or being in spaces where male colleagues get undressed in front of them.There is a host of principles and evidence around women’s privacy, dignity and safety to be marshalled in support of this – the charity Sex Matterslays them out– but most people don’t need to read accounts of how uncomfortable mixed-sex changing facilities make some women feel, or statistics showing that voyeurism and exposure are two of the most common male sex crimes, to understand how wrong this would be.But not managers at NHS Fife, it would seem. Despite the law of the land enshrining that commonsense insight – that employers are obliged to provideseparate changing facilitiesfor their male and female employees – female staff working for this Scottish health board have been expected to share changing rooms with a male doctor who identifies as female. One nurse, Sandie Peggie, has brought an employment tribunal claim for harassment, sex discrimination and victimisation against the board, following her suspension after she raised concerns.Peggie shared her account of what happened with the tribunal last week. She initially talked to her line manager on a couple of occasions, including after Dr Beth Upton, the male doctor in question, walked into the room while she was partially undressed. Her manager said she passed on the nurse’s concerns but didn’t get anywhere; Peggie said that if she were put in that position again, she would need to address it with Upton. This is what happened a few months later, when she found herself needing to use the changing room after heavy menstrual bleeding.Peggie says she told Upton she felt embarrassed and intimidated; but the doctor claimed as much right to be there as she did. Peggie says she raised her previous experiences of sexual assault to try to engender understanding, and mentioned a recent case when a male prisoner had been put in a female prison. She described how she was “shaking with distress”. After this encounter, Upton put in a formal complaint, and Peggie was suspended for bullying and harassment.The board put a survivor of sexual assault in a traumatic situationThe facts of what happened will be ruled on by the employment tribunal, which is midway through the hearing. But enough has emerged to be certain thatNHSFife has treated this nurse, who has a 30-year track record, appallingly. The board’s expectation that she should tolerate mixed-sex changing facilities is clearly unlawful, and it put a survivor of sexual assault in a traumatic situation.A senior consultant sent an email to the whole department giving a one-sided account of what happened, to Peggie’s detriment, a few days afterwards. It transpired that Upton – who clearly took strong offence at two previous incidents when Peggie left the changing room after entering tofind the doctor there– later made other potentially career-ending allegations in relation to Peggie and patient safety, which her lawyer has suggested, together with the complaint of bullying,are unfounded.Astonishingly, NHS Fife has failed to comply with a judicial order to disclose all the relevant documents to the tribunal, including some that pertain to when the complaints about patient safety were raised and how they were investigated. Peggie’s lawyers also suspect – based on the incomplete documentation they have seen – that NHS Fife abandoned an original investigation and started a new one, but has not disclosed this to the court. NHS Fife denies this, which will be subject to scrutiny this week. This is highly suggestive of a public body that has conducted itself inappropriately, and may well have prejudged the outcome of a high-stakes complaint.There is no circumstance in which it could have been appropriate for NHS Fife to put Peggie in this position. The attempted justification is that everyone must adopt the minority belief system that someone’s sex is not a scientific fact but a matter of their gender identity, or some sort of gendered soul. As a personal worldview, that’s someone’s own business, but it is wrong – and, in a work context, unprofessional – to try to force it on others in relation to single-sex spaces, services and sports. That is true whether the fact someone identifies as trans is the product of gender dysphoria – feelings of distress about their sex – or, as it is for some men, a cross-dressing sexual paraphilia.It is worrying that in evidence last week Upton did not seem to understand why a female colleague might not want to share changing facilities, and appeared to experience this as a personal affront. But the doctor is unlikely to be alone in that. The greatest responsibility lies with Peggie’s employer, who, instead of making separate accommodations for Upton, expected female colleagues to ignore the fact he is male.Given the bravery required to take a legal case, this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. A group of nurses in Darlington are alsosuing their trustas a result of having to share facilities with a male colleague. In a Sheffield hospital, female staff worried about sharing a changing room with one of their male colleagues were told, incorrectly, that the colleague in question had a right to be there. Outside the NHS, there have been many cases where employers have unlawfully elevated a male desire to be treated as female above women’s established workplace rights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Politicians and women’s rights activists speaking against this have been excommunicated from the left. Slowly, but surely, this is starting to change in the UK: take health secretary Wes Streeting’s admirably principleddefence of the Darlington nurses, for example.Not before time. There is a cautionary tale from across the Atlantic, where Democrats’ stubborn and unpopular defence ofmen’s rights to self-identifyinto women’s sport has dropped the unlikeliest of moral victories into President Donald Trump’s lap, allowing a man accused of serious sexual assault to somehow position himself as a defender of women’s rights. Abandoning basic common sense for unpopular policies that put women at risk does not go well for the left.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However, we pushed through, with the hope of changing policies that will improve the living standards of the many families living on low incomes who struggle in silence.”Tayyaba Siddiqui was one of a group of parents and carers who sat around a table in Downing Street last month with the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, and the employment minister Alison McGovern to discuss the challenges of raising children in poverty – and what needs to change.The event was part of a comprehensive listening exercise, which has brought ministers and civil servants face to face with families and experts up and down the UK, to better understand the lives of the 4.3 million children living below the poverty line.“We left the room with a promise of improvement and a government willing to work on the issues we raised,” Siddiqui wrote in ablogpost for the Child Poverty Action Groupcharity, which facilitated the meeting.Yet while they do not doubt the sincerity of the ministers directly involved, there is growing wariness among campaigners about whether the long-awaited child poverty strategy will come with the necessary resources to make a real difference.“We are now very anxious that this hasn’t been given the attention it deserves from the very top, politically,” said one campaigner.Some inside government share similar concerns: that while Labour’s manifesto committed to tackling child poverty, aspects of the challenge sit uneasily with the party’s current preoccupations.First, lifting children out of poverty does not fit neatly into the “growth” frame, through which the government now wants all policies to be viewed.Second, it will cost a significant sum of money, at a time whenRachel Reevesis keen to wear the mantle of “iron chancellor”.Third – and perhaps most worryingly – it clashes with the desire by some in Labour to present the party as tough on welfare, a stance likely to be on clear display in a forthcoming green paper on long-term sickness benefits.One government source said they had been told by senior figures, citing focus groups and research, that Labour has a “brand identity problem” when it comes to welfare.Campaigners, meanwhile, have noted the silence on poverty from Reeves. After watching the chancellor’spro-Heathrow, anti-nimby speech, Rachelle Earwaker, the senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), said: “We cannot only focus on the potential long-term economic benefits of roads, bridges and runways. We must also focus on ensuring that families have enough money and opportunity to afford the essentials and contribute to the economy.”When it comes to solutions, there is a broad consensus among advocates and policy experts that the best-targeted measure would be to scrap the two-child limit, which caps some benefits for the third and subsequent children in a family, and had beenapplied to 450,000 of the UK’s poorest households by April last year.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has called this “a quick and cost-effective fixfor bringing large numbers of children above the poverty line”.Lifting the benefits cap, which limits how much in total a family can receive in welfare payments, is another powerful lever: the IFS estimates these two policies together would cost about £3.3bn a year.Given the importance of housing costs in determining families’ standard of living, uncapping local housing allowance is another widely advocated, though costly, measure.Of course, there is a range of important policies that do not involve pouring more resources into social security, and would improve poor children’s lives. These include supporting parents into jobs, building many more social homes, and ensuring energy companies provide a genuine social tariff for the poorest households.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves has repeatedly said economic growth is not just about “lines on a graph”. But missing from the government’s hi-tech utopia is a vision of what kind of country we want to live in.Surely for many Labour voters – and, indeed, backbenchers – that means working towards a Britain in which kids are not skipping meals or shivering in homes that their parents cannot afford to heat. As Save the Children points out, on averagenine children in every class of 30 are now living in poverty.Scottish Labour has backed plans by the Scottish National party to mitigate the impact of the two-child limit, which are likely to commence next year. Without change in England,JRF analysissuggests that will mean child poverty falling north of the border, while it continues to rise, from already “shameful” levels, in England and Wales.Some older, wiser heads in the Labour movement fear Downing Street may be underestimating the scale of the backlash it could face, not least from broadly loyal MPs, if it tries to kick the urgent issue of child poverty down the road.The child poverty strategy was promised in the spring, but some in Whitehall suspect it is now more likely to sit alongside the spending review, which concludes in June.Whenever it comes, Labour should seize the moment to show it is not just keen on bridges, roads and runways, but grasp the importance of cherishing another key national asset: our children.Explore more on these topicsPovertyEconomics viewpointChildrenWelfareBenefitsRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Liberals, take note!Leah DowneyThe US president has recognised something that is rarely acknowledged: monetary policy is political. The question is how to make it democraticSun 9 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 12.20 ESTShareIf I asked you to list the things that make democratic politics meaningful, what would you include? Most likely elections and education. Perhaps the NHS, or the armed forces, or the justice system. I’m guessing that interest rates didn’t come to mind, which is strange, because they’re crucial to democracy. Last week, Donald Trumpreignited a debateabout who should be in charge of the monetary system that controls a country’s interest rates. You may disagree with Trump on a lot of things, but he’s not wrong to recognise that monetary policy – a subject that can seem dull and horribly technical – is fundamentally political, and tells us a lot about democracy.Interest rates shape everything. They influence whether you can buy a house, and how many houses get built. They affect which businesses expand, what new technologies emerge, and which townsthrive or flounder. In the 1990s, central bankers hailed the “great moderation”, a period of low and stable prices dominated by central bank independence. Then came the financial crisis, the eurozone crisis, and then the pandemic. The giant bailouts that followed these events were often described as “unconventional”. But perhaps they simply uncovered a fact that was always there – that monetary policy is not as apolitical as some would like people to believe.Recently, the old consensus has begun to splinter. This is what Trump andthose around himhave recognised. And of course, in some sense, we knew this all along. When the Bank of England chooses to change interest rates, it makes it easier or harder for people to access credit, creating winners and losers. If the Bank raises rates, it makes credit generally more expensive. While a first-time buyer with a large deposit will still be able to get a mortgage, one with a small deposit and no credit history will be out of luck. The intuitive nature of Trump’s claim, that interest rates are political, is what makes his message so powerful. Itresonates.This isn’t newsto academic scholars, who have been shouting about it from their ivory rooftops for a while now. What is novel is Trump’s reaction. He wants to co-opt the political power of monetary policy for his own use. In his previous term as president, Trump tried, and largely failed,to appoint loyaliststo the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). He attempted (and also failed) to force the Federal Reserveto lower rates at his command. But in his new term, he’s having greater success.The Fed has withdrawnfrom the international Network for Greening the Financial System (it joined shortly after Joe Biden was elected), and the vice-chair for supervision (who was attempting to strengthen bank regulation under Biden)has resignedto avoid a battle with Trump.Trump knows that monetary policy is political, so he wants to conquer it. The Democrats should be careful in how they respond. In Britain, where Liz Truss threw out the idea of fiscal responsibility and challenged both the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Labour’s response was tohug those technocratic bodiesas closely as possible by enhancing their power, both formallyand informally. In aiming to distance itself from Truss’s poor economic choices, the Labour party seems to think that the enemy of their enemy must be their friend.This is a missed opportunity. Acknowledging that monetary policy is political doesn’t mean you have to adopt either the Trussian or Trumpian view of how to govern it. Instead of trying to conquer the central bank, or returning to the cosy consensus of the 1990s, why not subject these institutions todemocraticcontrol? This would mean making central banks more like the rest of the state. Parliament could hold its civil servants to account, and would have the capacity to compel the Bank to prioritise (or deprioritise) certain sectors or regions of the economy. In this way, the Bank could make it easier for businesses to get credit when investing in renewable energies or the north of England, for example, or more expensive for people to buy a third or fourth home.The idea of democratic central banking tends to scare people. Should politicians really be setting interest rates? Should “the people” be in charge of fighting inflation? Surely politicians, who only care about getting re-elected, aren’t the right custodians of monetary policy, since what looks like good policy in the short term (such as lowering rates in advance of an election) can become bad policy in the long term. Not even to mention the fact that this field is undoubtedly too technical for politicians to understand. It should be left to the experts.But this is odd reasoning. First, because it supposes that the electorate doesn’t consider the long-term consequences of its decisions. Why should we think this is any truer of monetary policy than immigration policy, investment policy or education policy? And yet, we insist thattheseareas are under the control of elected officials. Second, the same is true of the “technical” nature of monetary policy. Do we really think it is that much more technical than tax policy, defence policy or environmental policy? We employ experts in all these cases, but we don’t insist that they must be insulated from democratic control.Why should monetary policy be any different? To me, it seems that all of these arguments reflect a fear of democracy itself. With democracy comes the risk of being ruled by those you disagree with. It is perfectly rational to wish that immigration policy, education policy, and environmental policy were all insulated from the reach of the Trump administration and its Maga-dominated Congress. But we must be honest in recognising that while that might be rational, it’s also anti-democratic.Since 1997, the UK’s approach to monetary policy has been designed to make it seem as boring and technical as possible. But in the years that have followed, through the financial crisis and the pandemic, this approach has come to seem outmoded. The politics of monetary policy is now explicitly contested. It would be a huge mistake for liberals and progressives to deny this, or to try to run back into the arms of the 1990s. This merely holds open the door to those like Trump. So instead of denying the politics of monetary policy, Labour and the Democrats should insist that it’s made subject to democratic control.Leah Downey is a junior research fellow at St John’s College Cambridge and the author ofOur MoneyExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveOpinionInterest ratesDonald TrumpBank of EnglandEconomicsUS economycommentShareReuse this content"

But maybe there’s more to life than being in a coupleSun 9 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 12.31 ESTShareSorry, Valentine’s Day is cancelled: we’re in a relationship recession. Analysis ofdemographic data by the Financial Timesshows a dramatic decline in married or cohabiting young adults, with tanking “relationship formation” rates in countries as diverse as Thailand, Finland, Peru, South Korea and Turkey. In the US,the marriage rate fell by 54%between 1900 and 2022, while younger people aren’t even dating: the percentage of 16- to 18-year-olds who report having dated has dipped under 50%, theAtlantic reports, “with the decline particularly steep in the past few years”.My immediate thought is: well, obviously. The resurgence of the far right, accelerating climate collapse, geopolitical instability and deep economic precarity aren’t exactly Marvin-Gaye-and-oysters vibes. As relationship red flags go, isn’t getting horny amid imminent global catastrophe one of the biggest, reddest ones? I just have to imagine Elon Musk and I’m ready to be walled up in an anchorite’s cell.In the immediate aftermath of the US election, women (sorry, “childless cat ladies”) expressed similar sentiments;not pussyhatsthis time, but a sort of repulsed withdrawal. That included renewed interest inSouth Korea’s 4B feminist movement, which rejects marriage, childbirth, dating and sex. “Doing my part as an American woman by breaking up with my Republican boyfriend last night and officially joining the 4B movement this morning,” oneyoung woman posted on TikTokon 6 November.This reflects a political split in gen Z along gender lines: 56% of 18- to 29-year-old men voted for Donald Trump,compared with 40% of women. Research suggests they are moving dramatically further apart, too: the ideological gap between young American men and women almostdoubled in the past 25 years. It’s a similar story in other places, including the UK (where twice as many young men as womenvoted for Reformin the general election, which is quite the ick).You can see that this might affect straight relationships. You don’t have to agree on everything, but I’m not sure how long even the most powerful attraction could make you overlook your partner thinking feminism had “gone too far”. I wouldn’t put out for anyone who didn’t support my reproductive autonomy – and abortion is among the most divisive issues for young people,according to a pre-election Gallup poll.Then there is dating. A “total nightmare” for women wasthe Cut’s verdict last summer: transactional, adversarial, even frightening, with readerschiming in with horror storiesof everything from flakiness to felony. Simultaneously, the#boysober hashtagemerged, whereby young women vowed to quit apps, dates and hook-ups; part political statement, part self-preservation.No one enjoys apps anyway: 78% of respondents in arecent Forbes surveyfelt “emotionally, mentally or physically exhausted” by them at least some of the time; 23% of gen Z answered “always”.So is this … bad? On the “maybe” side, the US is experiencing an epidemic of loneliness,according to the surgeon general. In Great Britain,7.1% of people report feeling chronically lonely(being 16 to 24 is a particular risk factor). But I don’t think that maps neatly on to rising rates of singledom: a bad or failing relationship can feel like the loneliest place on Earth.A more persuasive answer might be “not for women”. Last year,researchers at the University of Torontoanalysed 10 studies conducted between 2018 and 2023 and found that single women reported “higher relationship status satisfaction [than single men], higher life satisfaction, higher sexual satisfaction as well as a lower desire for a partner”. Women, they concluded, “are, on average, happier in singlehood than men”. Perhaps that is because they have “stronger social support beyond romantic relationships”.This hints at what could make this less a relationship recession and more a reframing: looking less prescriptively at how we define the fulfilling relationships in our lives. That is already in the ether. There is a greater openness to imaginingbonds beyond conventional coupledom; gen Zers, in particular, are more open inwho they would consider datingandmore invested in friendships. We are social animals who crave love and connection, but that needn’t mean being till-death-do-us-part coupled up in some rigid category of romantic partner. The more expansively we define love, the more likely we are to find it.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His mother, Laila Soueif, and I have used it to challenge Downing StreetSun 9 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 09.03 ESTShareAlaa Abd el-Fattah knows about hunger strikes. When I was locked up in a cell next to him in Cairo’s notorious Tora prison in early 2014, he and I would stride the exercise yard discussing Egyptian politics, history, political reform, and – yes – forms of protest and resistance, including starving yourself.Hunger strikes, he explained, are the ultimate tool of the powerless. When all other forms of agency are stripped away, all that remains is to exercise control over the one thing left: your own body. That would become my first lesson in strikes.Alaa is Egypt’s best-known political prisoner. He was one of the young, social media-savvy activists who helped move millions of Egyptians on to the streets in the revolution of 2011. Because of his popularity, charisma and capacity to mobilise people, he also has the dubious distinction of being locked up by every regime since he’s been alive (including several that lasted barely a year).Soon after I arrived at Tora, Alaa and a group of other activists launched their own hunger strike to force the prison to respect our rights. We were only allowed two hours of exercise a day, and one family visit every two weeks; both in clear violation of Egypt’s own laws that said prisoners in pre-trial detention were entitled to four hours of exercise and weekly visits. They had already smuggled out letters to the press announcing the strike.At mealtimes, trays of food would clatter to the floor in the corridor outside the strikers’ cells as they shouted their demands. At times it got heated, with the guards insisting they were weighing the food and knew the prisoners were secretly eating (they weren’t). But in the end, after a week of rancour, Alaa and his colleagues won. The prison authorities backed down, fearing a ferocious public backlash should any of the prisoners die.And that’s lessons two and three in hunger strike strategy: there is no point doing it if nobody knows, and limit your demands to what is within your rights. It is vital to hold on to the moral high ground.That is exactly what his mother,Laila Soueif, is doing now. The extraordinarily resilient, stoic 68-year-old grandmother has been on strike since 30 September, the day after her son was due for release.After being arrested in 2019, Alaa was convicted and sentenced in 2021 to five years for “publishing false news”, in an utterly spurious case widely seen as an attempt to silence a prominent democratic voice. That sentence should have ended on 29 September last year. But with astonishing cynicism, the Egyptian government decided it would calculate his term from the day he was convicted, ignoring time served in pre-trial detention as its own laws require, and adding two years to Alaa’s time behind bars.Alaa and Laila are both British-Egyptian dual citizens, which means the British government has a responsibility to make sure their rights are respected. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, advocated forAlaa on a recent trip to Cairo, but so far without even gaining consular access. That is why she and I have been holding daily one-hour vigils outside Downing Street calling on the prime minister to intervene, and why I have also been on my own more limited hunger strike of 21 days to help draw attention to this symbolic case.Laila’s demands are straightforward and entirely reasonable. As Alaa did back in 2014, she is simply asking the Egyptian and British governments to respect their own laws and obligations.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah.Photograph: Omar Robert Hamilton/ReutersBut hunger strikes are grave undertakings. In a quiet conversation during one of our vigils, Laila told me she is doing this because she is convinced the only way she can get the British and Egyptian leaders to act is to precipitate a crisis.“I am not suicidal,” she said. “More than anything, I want to see Alaa again, free and with his own son [also in the UK]. But I also know I must be prepared to keep going to the end if that is what it takes. I have had a good life, and I want him and his sister, who has given up everything to campaign for him, to have their lives back too.”That conviction is something Britain’s most famous hunger striker, Bobby Sands, would have recognised. The Irish nationalist died in 1981 after refusing food for 66 days to demand that he and his fellow republican detainees be allowed to wear their own clothes, get regular visits and mail, and be treated as political prisoners rather than common criminals. (Sands, whose last days were dramatised in the Steve McQueen film Hunger, consumed only water, unlike Laila who is also taking electrolytes and salt – both necessary for vital organ functions.)In the 2008 Steve McQueen movie Hunger about Sands’s last days, Father Dominic Moran pays him a visit. The priest says: “You start a hunger strike to protest for what you believe in. You don’t start already determined to die. Or am I missing something here?”British-Egyptian dissident mulls giving up citizenship over failure to be releasedRead more“It’s in their hands,” Sands replies. “Our message is clear. They’re seeing our determination … Putting my life on the line, Dom, is not just the only thing I can do. It’s the right thing.” Nine more hunger strikers would die before the government granted their demands to the remaining prisoners.Laila’s unyielding love for her children and for justice is her driving force. She is now weak, and her vital signs are well into the danger zone, but she is as determined as Sands and as convinced of the legitimacy of her campaign. She also believes it will be successful, if not before she dies, then perhaps because of the outrage that must inevitably follow.And that may be the final lesson in strikes: a clear-headed, unwavering sense of purpose. As Sands says in Hunger: “I have my belief. And in all its simplicity, that is the most powerful thing.”Peter Greste is a professor of journalism at Macquarie University and the executive director of the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom.He was imprisoned in Egypt in 2013 on terrorism charges while reporting for Al Jazeera and released after 400 days.

Ministers should go back to basicsSun 9 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 14.56 ESTShareFor anyone involved in the government’s strategy to combat violence against women, the National Audit Office’s recentreportmust have felt like a bucket of cold water. This is a societal problem that plenty of evidence suggests is getting worse rather than better – though inconsistent data is itself a challenge and makes firm conclusions tricky.The prevalence of sexual assault against women in England and Wales is estimated to have risen from 3.4% of the population to 4.3% between 2009‑10 and 2023‑24. Over the same period the number of reported rapes and sexual assaults rose around fourfold – a change only partly explained by improved recording. Violence against women and girls now accounts for about20% of all crime, despite an estimated reduction in the prevalence of domestic violence (from 9.2% to 7.4%). Digital technology has created opportunities fornew kinds of offending– and left lawmakers struggling to keep up.A report last year led to police being issued deadlines to produceaction plans on stalking. New offences relating to the creation and sharing ofintimate imagesand sexually explicit deepfakes will be included in a crime bill that is expected soon. But the wider question of how ministers plan to meet their own hugely ambitious target, of halving violence against women and girls (VAWG) in a decade, is waiting for an answer.The NAO’s damning verdict on the Home Office’s existingstrategywill not make this any easier – except in as much as it allows ministers to blame the last government for a dire situation. According to the report, assessing progress is made difficult by the retrospective addition to the strategy of a “theory of change” that was devised as part of a separate domestic abuse plan. The Home Office told the NAO that it doesn’t know what impact either plan has had on offending. A ministerial group set up to oversee implementation met just four times between 2021 and 2024. The home secretary attended only once.Even more dismaying, given that prevention is among the strategy’s main aims, is the report’s finding that, despite spending £4.2m since 2021 on research, the government is in the dark regarding what works. These studies have yet to provide “significant insights”, with some projects still incomplete. While results are expected to feed into policymaking in future, the Home Office says that lack of evidence is an international problem.Preventing harm is an important goal of criminal justice policy, as it is in health. But given this lack of information, it makes sense to refocus on tried‑and‑tested services. Council-funded victim support andwomen’s refugesare chronically underfunded, whilecourtshave seen some of the deepest public sector cuts. Ministers should commit to rebuilding these crucial foundations of the VAWG sector, and improving criminal justice outcomes.Increasing funding forvoluntary-sector women’s groupsmight sound less appealing than stopping men from abusing their partners in the first place. But for now a policy focused on the needs of victims and survivors would send a powerful message. One thing the old strategy had right was its recognition that action must be coordinated across departments. Yvette Cooper at the Home Office, Shabana Mahmood at the Ministry of Justice, and Angela Rayner at the department for local government could together lead a shift at the top of government. They should approach VAWG pragmatically, by restoring vital support to those affected.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plenty of mortgage holders would agree. Savers might not share Mr Bailey’s sentiments. However, he justified the cut, made despite inflationary risks, by arguing that falling worker bargaining power would see price pressures subside. Without rate cuts, the Bank warned, there was the risk of anaemic economic growth.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the Bank,sayingits action would “ease cost of living pressures”. That is true, but the benefits of lowering the burden of borrowing won’t outweigh the costs of Ms Reeves’ fiscal choices. She is counting on up tosix base rate cutsby mid-2026 to buoy consumer sentiment. But relying solely on monetary policy is not effective economic management.The former Tory prime minister Edward Heath oncemockedthe then-chancellor Nigel Lawson for being a “one-club golfer” stuck in a bunker. “He doesn’t know what to do and has therefore very wisely decided to do nothing,” Mr Heath quipped. Many holes have been played on the parliamentary green since, but the critique still holds.Ms Reeves is betting that steeply declining borrowing costs will have an immediate impact on businesses and households in a way that capital investment – the core of the chancellor’s “plan for growth” – never could. Low interest rates alone won’t end stagnation. Between the financial crisis and the pandemic, the UK kept interest rates athistoriclows. Yeteconomic growthandproductivityremained lower than in the preceding decade – though Brexit didn’t help. Cheaper borrowing failed to spark robustinvestmentand high levels ofconsumer confidence.The reason is that businesses and households often use lower rates to pay off debt rather than taking on new loans. This is especially true in a sluggish economy – people prefer saving over spending. As John Maynard Keynesargued, in uncertain times, firms and individuals hoard cash, undermining the intended effects of monetary easing. Even if firms face lower borrowing costs, they won’t invest unless they see demand rising. The problem isn’t access to cheap credit – it’s weak demand.Stagnant growth this year stems from insufficient fiscal stimulus. Much of the government’sborrowingis likely just offsetting capital outflows due to thetrade deficit, rather than adding to private sector spending power. To boost growth, a larger fiscal deficit is needed. That could come through higher public spending. Or it might be through fiscal reliefs for, say, green investment. It could also be achieved by tax cuts targeted at lower-income households, who are far more likely to spend than save.Yet the Treasury wants public sector net borrowing to decline from 2025-26, to return “inflation sustainably to target”. This is not, as the Bank says, a concern. Constraining government spending will cut growth – growth that ministers say is theirtop priority. Ms Reeves’s real test comes in 2026-27 when spending cuts and tax hikes kick in to meet self-imposedfiscal rules. Labour MPs, councillors and activists must lobby her to rethink. Rather than prioritising deficit reduction, Ms Reeves should boost spending on public services andjob creation– ensuring fiscal policy aids, not hinders, economic wellbeing. The last decade showed clearly that low rates alone won’t deliver growth. Without an active fiscal policy, Britain risks remaining trapped in Mr Heath’s proverbial bunker.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsOpinionBank of EnglandAndrew BaileyMortgagesRachel ReevesAutumn budget 2024Interest rateseditorialsShareReuse this content"

I suspect the reality is the other way round, that it is not your culture which defines your class, but your class (however imperfect and shifting the definition may be) that defines your culture, or at least some aspects of it.When we encounter institutional racism, misogyny, Islamophobia and so on in the police or the armed forces, we should ask whether those views were created in people by the organisation’s culture, or was the culture created by people who already had those views when they joined. If there is a problem with such prejudices being common in the class from which rank-and-file members of those organisations are predominantly drawn, we must recognise that and address it there, or we will never mend the organisations. If someone joining the police at 18 is a racist, it’s already too late.Mike PerryIckenham, LondonAcross the world, the policies of the centre are enabling the right because people might not really want Donald Trump, Giorgia Meloni or Nigel Farage but, when it comes to it, they really don’t want any sort of left that challenges their wealth. For this reason, they will not adopt the policies that are needed to defeat the right but they continue with the policies that the Guardian identifies correctly as failing.The right winning is the consolation prize that protects their wealth if they cannot have the centre they would prefer. When the left does get the highest votes, the centre panics and makes deals with the right to keep the left out – seeEmmanuel Macron. This isn’t a bug, it is a feature.Jonathan FanningSenior lecturer/associate professor in international strategy, University of YorkWorking-class people can be defined by their reliance on having a job. Jobs are not careers. These jobs give no power to workers, who simply do what they are told in the way that employers want. There is little chance of promotion to a level where they can make or participate in the making of decisions.They clock in and out. They are paid the rate for the job or less, despite equal pay legislation. Any complaints can get them sacked, often by reducing the hours they are given to the point where they have to leave to survive. For many working people, the week or month is longer than wages, leaving debt or deprivation as normal before payday.Life for the working class might look different from Victorian conditions, but the reality is not. Pawn shops are now cash converters; credit cards and savings clubs still offer a way to stretch funds.No wonder Reform UK is attractive when the Labour party does not seem to want to reduce inequality, reform Tory taxation to reduce the burden on below‑average earners and give everyone a country with a betterGini coefficient.Margaret IngramBridgwater, SomersetYour leader seems to make the mistake of assuming that class politics is only practised by the left/underdog section of society. The right/reactionary section has never stopped practising class politics against poorer and less powerful people in society. The media may have ignored this or not called it out for what it is, but it has never stopped and definitely not faded.Mike DanielsStoke Golding,LeicestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Despite a shock 1-0 defeat against the Championship’s bottom club, Slot argued that his decision to give senior players a rest would pay dividends later in the season.Slot made 10 changes from thewin against Tottenham on Thursday night, with a relatively inexperienced bench and players such as Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo and Virgil van Dijk left out of the squad entirely.“Most of the things we do, we do for a reason,” Slot insisted. “We have many games to play. The ones who played today need game rhythm, for them to be ready in the upcoming months.”Stunned Liverpool sent crashing out of FA Cup in major upset at PlymouthRead moreThe defeat “hurt”, Slot admitted, but he was careful too to give appropriate praise to Plymouth. “They worked incredibly hard,” Slot said.“There were one or two big chances, but I think if a team is working so hard and throws themselves into any ball, maybe you deserve to be a bit lucky as well. The goalkeeper made one or two good saves in the end, but we hardly created anything at all.”Slot also revealed that Curtis Jones, named on the bench, had declared himself unfit on the morning of the game. And he also offered sympathy for Isaac Mabaya, the substitute who was himself substituted on hisLiverpooldebut. “I had to take him off,” Slot said. “He was already on a yellow. To be taken off after an hour is very disappointing for him, of course.”Plymouth are still four points adrift of safety but if they show this kind of defensive resolve they still have every chance. And forMiron Muslic, the Plymouth manager, “the biggest moment in my coaching career” came with a caveat. “So far,” he said. “The biggest moment is yet to come, at the end of the season, when we stay up. This is what I feel, in my mind, in my soul.“We wanted to represent ourselves. To be organised, to be brave, to be full of intensity, to use this huge stage as an opportunity. We had to enjoy defending. And we did. To keep them away from the goal is a huge, huge task.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have been outstanding’David Hytnerat Villa ParkSun 9 Feb 2025 16.03 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 16.56 ESTShareAnge Postecoglou made a ­passionate defence of his ­injury‑ravaged ­Tottenham squad after their 2-1 FA Cup exit atAston Villa, ­arguing that no team could have survived the same level of absentees for such a prolonged period.Postecoglou was without 11 ­senior players at Villa Park, where he started with four teenagers and the 21‑year‑old goalkeeper Antonio ­Kinsky, who was at fault for Jacob Ramsey’s opening goal. Morgan Rogers put Villa 2-0 in front before Mathys Tel’s injury-time consolation.Postecoglou lamented how he had carried numerous injuries since mid‑November as his team have fought in four competitions – they exited the Carabao Cup at the semi‑final stage against Liverpool last Thursday. He even cited ­Liverpool’s shockFA Cupexit at Plymouth to illustrate his point; his Liverpool counterpart, Arne Slot, made wholesale changes and watched his team lose 1-0.Superior Aston Villa cruise past Spurs thanks to Ramsey and RogersRead more“How did Liverpool go today?” Postecoglou said. “And they did that for one game. Do that for two‑and‑a‑half months. Any team. Do that for two-and-a-half months in multiple competitions. I don’t care about me. People will judge me. But you can’t judge this group of players on what’s happened. They’ve given everything.“Villa are one of the best teams in the country. They’ve had a week off, they didn’t play last Thursday night against Liverpool [in the Carabao Cup] We did. Same group of players.”“I’m not talking about me. People can judge me. They can say I’ve done a bad job, I’m not up to it or whatever. That’s fine. What I’m saying is you can’t be critical of players or players’ performances at this time. Because if you do, then do that with everyone else. Be as critical of other clubs when they’ve got 9 or 10 or 11 players out. And none of them have.“It can’t be that people think that’s an excuse. That’s just not anywhere near close to objective analysis. That’s just agenda driven stuff. If it’s to get rid of me that’s fine. Good on you. Go for it a million times. But in terms of this group of players, what they’ve given over the past two and half months has been outstanding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do you think they can press like [we would like to] if we hadn’t played Thursday night? Fair chance … unless you don’t think they’re human beings.“Why do you think Liverpool and others rotate 11 players? Why? There’s a reason and I wish I could do the same. They’re not playing anywhere near the levels that we want or expect but that’s not because they’re not trying. It’s because they can’t.“Once we get the rest of the group in, we will be an outstanding team. I have no doubt about that. Whether other people can’t see that, that’s of no interest to me. If you want to measure anything on what they’re doing at the moment, other than the extreme situation they’re dealing with then I think your analysis is skewed and it’s not objective.”The Villa manager, Unai Emery, was delighted with the result and the showing of his two loan signings, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, who came on for debuts. “We watched the skill, how they helped us and how they will help us again for the next month in different competitions,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFA CupAston VillaTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

But a one-day series at home is a radically dif­ferent challenge to a Test tour of Australia, and the aura of a white-ball king remains. Sharma struck a 90‑ball 119, his 49th international hundred, as India hunted down a target of 305 in Cuttack with four wickets and 5.3 overs to spare.I was wrong to say Bazball is a cult. It’s actually a death cult | Barney RonayRead moreSharma, India’s captain, went big, something England’s batting lineup could only threaten to do. Each ­member of the visiting top six reached 26 but none went to 70, Ben Duckett and Joe Root the two ­half‑centurions. Breaching 300 meant for a lively contest in the ­second half, or so we thought. Sharma found support through Shubman Gill’s 60 and, while wickets ­tumbled near the end, Axar Patel and ­Ravindra Jadeja applied the ­finishing touches. India lead the series 2-0, with a knockabout at the Ahmedabad ­coliseum to round things off.England’s record on this tour stands at one win and six defeats, their last ODI series victory ­preceding the 2023 World Cup. It’s tough ­reading as another major tournament approaches, their plans complicated by a hamstring injury sustained by Jacob Bethell. He is expected to miss the Champions Trophy. ­Somerset’s Tom Banton has been called up as cover for the series finale on Wednesday, a reward for county and franchise runs.“We just needed one or two of us to kick on and play a real innings of note and push our score up to 330‑350 kind of territory,” said Jos Buttler, England’s white-ball captain. “The cycle of the team, there’s a few ­players who are just gaining experience and days like this are great lessons, which is what you want. You’ve got to ­accelerate that ­learning and keep pushing the guys in the right direction.“We’re doing some things right, we always want to do some things better, but the way Rohit played showed the way we want to play our cricket is the correct way to play cricket.”Just like the first one-dayer, England had little trouble early on. ­Duckett was the aggressor, brutal square of the wicket, his ­half-century taking only 36 balls. But the top two didn’t pass the spin test, with ­Duckett and Phil Salt perishing to slog‑sweeps. Duckett’s dismissal for 65 in Jadeja’s first over felt particularly significant. Bethell’s absence made the opener England’s only southpaw; Jadeja could settle in nicely against the righties, his ­eventual figures an immaculate three for 35 from 10.View image in fullscreenRavindra Jadeja celebrates with Harshit Rana after taking the wicket of England’s Ben Duckett, caught by Hardik Pandya.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersRoot and Harry Brook brought restraint in a stand of 66, acknow­ledging that you’ve got to eat your veggies in this format if you want dessert at the death. But Gill leapt brilliantly to dismiss Brook for 31, and while another fifty stand would follow between Root and Buttler, the latter departed for 34. Even Root, England’s most successful hundred-maker in this format, failed to advance. The reverse sweep against the turning ball was his friend, ­making the attempted drive over long-off a surprise. Virat Kohli held on off Jadeja’s bowling to end the knock on 69.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liam Livingstone was crucial in deli­vering 300, blasting a couple of sixes off Harshit Rana and finding support in Adil Rashid, who took three consecutive fours off Mohammed Shami.Sharma began the response with a flurry of sixes, whipping Gus ­Atkinson and taking a couple off Saqib Mahmood. England were missing the extra pace up top of Jofra Archer, rested after playing every match on this tour. Sharma was ­disrupted only by electrical troubles, a malfunc­tioning floodlight tower prompted a half-hour break during the seventh over. When play resumed the right‑hander survived a marginal lbw call to Mark Wood, England’s review showing the ball clipping the bail. The next ball went for six: the feeling grew that this would have to be Sharma’s night.Gill was a classy support act at the other end as the pair managed Rashid with ease, the century stand brought up inside 14 overs. Two delicious bits of bowling brought England back. Overton thundered in a 87mph yorker to take Gill’s off stump before Rashid floated up a leg-spinner, ­enticing Kohli to push outside off and edge to the keeper.Sharma’s hundred, appropriately, came with another thump over the ropes and off his 76th ball. There wasn’t much of a celebration but that’ll happen when you’ve done this umpteen times. Sharma wasn’t to bat through, mistiming a Livingstone full toss in the 30th over, but he’d already decided the game’s direction.Explore more on these topicsCricketIndia cricket teamEngland cricket teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But after the last‑gasp win on Saturday kick‑started England’s campaignSteve Borthwickrevealed both ­players could yet return for his side’s run-in.Was England’s win a watershed moment for Borthwick or a fleeting slice of joy?Read moreThe head coach heralded the 26-25 victory against France as evidence of his side’s improvement and, after two rounds of the Six Nations, England sit third in the table with six points, fourbehind the leaders Ireland, and can consider themselves in the title race.“I’m really happy for the players that they’ve got the win,” ­Borthwick said. “Everybody does want that thing that is tangible and a win is tangible, and the progress then is tangible.”Feyi-Waboso was expected to have surgery on his dislocated shoulder and miss the Six Nations but, after forgoing the operation he is “rehabbing well”, Borthwick revealed, and will potentially be available next month. The Exeter wing was in two mindswhether to have surgeryand as a recipient of an enhanced England contract, was in consultation with Borthwick and his backroom staff as to the best course of action. The Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, admitted those discussions had slowed the process down but avoiding surgery gives Feyi‑Waboso a chance of featuring in this year’s competition.Furbank could also feature, depending on the outcome of a ­specialist’s report. In his absence, both Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith have started at full-back – the latter moved to the No 15 jersey against France with Fin Smith deployed at fly-half – and could find his place in the side under threat if Furbank returns to fitness.“[George] is going well,” said Borthwick, who could also ­welcome Alex Dombrandt and Jack van ­Poortvliet back to fitness. “He had a re-X-ray on his arm last week and we are waiting on the specialist to give his view on that. Hopefully he might be available at the end of the tournament but we are still waiting for the specialist’s report.”England players have been allowed to return home during the first part of the first rest week and will reconvene at their Bagshot base on Wednesday to begin plotting a first Calcutta Cup win since 2020 on Saturday week. Fixtures against Italy at home and Wales away follow and though ­Ireland have proved the team to beat so far as the only side to win their first two matches, England remain in the hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 6-3, 7-5 loss to Alexandrova followedfirst-round defeats by Marketa Vondrousovain Abu Dhabi andCristina Bucsa in Singaporeas well as a third-round defeat byIga Swiatek in Melbourne.The 22-year-old, who again needed a wild card to secure entry to the tournament, has not tasted victory since her coach Nick Cavadaystepped downfor health reasons after the Australian Open. Raducanu’s mentor Jane O’Donoghue flew to Doha to offer support but could not help the former US Open champion engineer a change in fortunes.Alexandrova bounced back from her defeat against Raducanu by winning a WTA Tour title in Linz and the difference in confidence levels between the pair became apparent.As against Vondrousova last Tuesday, Raducanu got off to a strong start, moving into a 3-1 lead, and had she taken any of three chances for a second break of serve things might have turned out differently.But Alexandrova began to really find her range on her big ground strokes and by the time Raducanu won another game she was a break down in the second set. She took advantage of a dip from her opponent to lead 3-1 again but once more could not cement her advantage and Alexandrova claimed the crucial break at 5-5.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sound of bagpipes had drifted around Murrayfield, Flower of Scotland was belted out with customary passion, and the inspirational figure of Chris Hoy even delivered the match ball. But when showtime arrived Ireland were simply too good, too physical, too precise. The reigning champions recorded an 11th straight victory over Scotland to top the table with two bonus-point wins, pleasingly poised for a third successive title.There had been a sense of triumph in the way Hoy, diagnosed with terminal cancer last year, strode on to the pitch for an emotional pre-match ovation. Hope existed among home fans that this might, finally, be their day against Ireland. And while there were flashes of brilliance, particularly Duhan van der Merwe’s stunning finish before half-time, Scotland’s back line is not complemented by a pack that can compete with the best.Scotland 16-32 Ireland: Six Nations 2025 – live reactionRead moreIt did not help that Scotland lost their fly-half, Finn Russell, and the lightning quick wing Darcy Graham to an early clash of heads. But there was inaccuracy from the hosts too, and the scrums brought endless pain. Sam Prendergast is also growing into the role of Test fly-half, kicking 12 points and displaying intelligent distribution throughout.“I think the fight was there until the end,” Scotland’s co-captain Rory Darge said, with Graham’s head injury being assessed in hospital. “In terms of the scoreline, it came down to errors from us … they got into our 22 too often, and a team who are as clinical as that, you’re always going to have a tough day.”The Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, revealed Russell had passed his head injury assessment but that he and his coaching staff decided he should not continue. Asked if the miserable sequence against Ireland points at a systemic issue in Scottish rugby, he said: “That’s a big question. I think we have to praise Ireland with what they’ve done structurally over the past few years … they are going for something unprecedented this year, a thirdSix Nationstitle in a row, no team has done that.“What they are doing is producing results and quality performances. We’ve unfortunately come up against them during this period, and not managed to get ahead on the scoreboard at the end.”Or indeed the start. Inside five minutes, after a powerful first scrum, the Irish pack were rumbling downfield in the manner of a freshly serviced threshing machine. Prendergast did not need the vision of a genius to spot Calvin Nash on the right and the champions were up and running, more so when the fly-half added a sweet conversion.Twice in the opening quarter a rampant Ireland were held up over the try-line, the second a heroic effort by Darge. The Scottish scrum was creaking, Ireland’s dynamism in the loose was dizzying. Van der Merwe was sent to the sin bin for blocking Nash before the hosts did get a breather from the Irish onslaught, albeit in unfortunate circumstances. The clash between Russell and Graham led to a long delay, the wing requiring lengthy treatment before leaving on a stretcher.View image in fullscreenJames Lowe scores Ireland’s third try at Murrayfield.Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesIreland’s dominance was underlined by their second try – scored by the captain, Caelan Doris – after another crushing scrum was followed by a darting run by the scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park. Combined with Prendergast’s early penalty, the score was 17-0.Enter Van der Merwe, then, back from his enforced break, for a scintillating try after being fed by Stafford McDowall, on for Russell. Scotland trailed by 12 points at the break but it could have been so much worse.When Huw Jones and Blair Kinghorn combined to roar into space soon after half-time, Ireland were wobbling, and the home fans were disgusted by the decision not to penalise Robbie Henshaw for a possible deliberate knock-on. Eventually Scotland settled for a penalty, kicked by Kinghorn, and it was a six-point game, but Simon Easterby’s side swiftly reasserted themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian understands that the trust is yet to receive notification from an employment tribunal.The case will serve as a test of the extent to which NHS staff can express their views or take actions regarding foreign policy matters.The issue has affected NHS trusts across England, prompting reviews after complaints about staff wearing badges and other clothing items in support of Palestinians.In this case, the pair created a WhatsApp group named ‘Free Palestine’ to discuss whether there was interest in a proposed walkout or a vigil that would not be disruptive to patient care.Layla said that they would have sought permission from management before embarking on any action.“We were never going to do something in the clinic, or do something that would put our patients at risk,” Layla said. “We saw that NHS staff in Homerton and St George were doing things [including a vigil] during their lunchtime. We were just talking about what might be possible, and how we can start these conversations at work.”View image in fullscreenProtests and vigils have been carried out across the UK since the outbreak of the current Gaza conflict in 2023.Photograph: Matt Duckett/Imageslive/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockLayla and Maya said they spoke to colleagues about taking similar action. One became upset and filed a complaint.The complaint, seen by the Guardian, confirms that Layla approached the colleague to let them know discussions had begun about a possible walkout in solidarity with Palestine. “I questioned why this would need to be done in the workplace and I asked her to clarify what the walkout was about, and she said that it is anti-Israel government, in support of Palestine, and that it is not anti-Jewish,” the complainant wrote.The complainant said they heard other people discuss wanting to take part in the protest and added that such a walkout would be “distressing for Jewish and Israeli children and parents who visit the clinic”.The protest did not take place, but the following day, management sent an email to staff warning that participating in a demonstration during work hours could breach trust policy.Several days later, Maya was taken to a separate room at the start of her workday and informed she was under investigation. She was instructed to collect her belongings and leave immediately. On her next day in, the same happened to Layla. Both were barred from the building and told they would be temporarily reassigned to another NHS service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are kids who are suicidal and the idea that you could just take away the consistent person who sees them all the time, who they trust, is so disruptive,” Layla said.While redeployed, they found out management had interviewed their colleagues to ask if the pair were safe to work with Jewish patients. They were also asked this question during the investigation.Layla resigned from her role during the investigation, while Maya returned to work at the service after being cleared.Layla was told she was not allowed to enter the building to say goodbye to her colleagues or collect her belongings. “My supervisor offered to meet me on the street outside my building to hand me my stuff. They made me feel like a petty criminal.”Maya alleges she was told to remove a Palestine badge from her coat upon her return to work because it was political branding. “But I’ve seen other members of staff wear poppies, Ukraine or Labour party badges.”Last year,an employment tribunal concludedthat the belief that Israel’s actions amount to apartheid, ethnic cleansing and genocide are “worthy of respect in a democratic society”.In February 2024, the tribunal ruled thatProf David Miller was unfairly discriminated againstwhen he was dismissed by the University of Bristol over allegations of making antisemitic remarks. The ruling established that anti-Zionist views qualify as a protected belief under the UK Equality Act.A spokesperson for Central and North West London NHS foundation trust said: “The complexities of the Middle East conflict, and other world events, have impacted our staff, patients and communities in many different ways. We strongly support legal protest in a free society but also believe in making sure the NHS is a safe, unintimidating space for staff to focus on our patients.“The top priority for all of our teams, including use of our clinicians’ valuable time, resources and premises, is to provide the highest standard of care for our patients, maintaining public trust and confidence while upholding principles of civility, respect and working well together.”* Names in this article have been changedExplore more on these topicsNHSHealthGazaProtestPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was ejected from the stands and arrested.On Friday, a misconduct panel chaired by the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington, found that Coppin had breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct.He was dismissed from Essex police force without notice and will be placed on the College of Policing barred list.According to the Crown Prosecution Service, tragedy chanting is when fans sing, chant or gesture offensive messages about disasters or accidents involving players or other fans.Harrington said Coppin, who had previously had an unblemished career in policing, was being dismissed as the result of “a moment’s serious stupidity”, but that this was “the only appropriate outcome”.“It is clear that ex-Sgt Coppin was remorseful and may not have been aware of the impact of his words, but he has been criminally convicted of a public order offence,” the chief constable said.“His actions will seriously undermine public trust and confidence and I must send a clear message to officers, staff and the wider public that behaviour such as this cannot and will not be tolerated in policing.“If officers are responsible for upholding the law, it cannot be right that they break it.”Ch Insp Kevin Chatterton, ofMerseysidepolice, said: “This type of behaviour has no place in football. We will take action and identify those who commit hate crime in any form, and this includes unacceptable chanting which causes distress to others.”In a “fan information and chant warning”,published on its websitein January last year, Chelsea FC wrote: “Chelsea Football Club believes hateful chanting has no place in football.”Last season, Arsenal welcomed three-year banning orders handed downto three Arsenal fanswho pleaded guilty to tragedy-related abuse during an FA Cup match against Liverpool at the Emirates stadium, north London.Explore more on these topicsPoliceEssexLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)MerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

But it has faced opposition from the Twentieth Century Society, which hassubmitted a listing application to Historic Englandthat could prevent its destruction.Built between 1966 and 1970 and designed by Diamond, Redfern & Partners, the building sits beside Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Molineux Stadium and is one ofa small number of brutalist buildingsof its type that remain in good condition.“This is an excellent surviving example of a postwar art school that has remained in its original use and survives in very good condition, and is loved by both staff and students,” a Twentieth Century Society spokesperson said. “It clearly has abundant potential to be sympathetically upgraded or reconfigured to suit whatever plans the university may develop in the years to come. On the other hand, demolition would simply be wasteful, irresponsible and anti-growth.”Historic England is assessing the School of Art and will submit its advice to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which will make the ultimate decision.A listing would mean the arts tower was of “special architectural or historic interest” and would have legal protection from demolition.Gavin Rogers, a senior lecturer in fine art and photography at the university, said many students were “angry, confused and disappointed” by the demolition plan. “Yes, it can get a bit cold in the winter and some double glazing would be nice, but any replacement would never match the spirit that this building offers,” he said.The building was the site of the First National Black Art Convention in October 1982, where many of the most celebrated British artists of the last four decades congregated to discuss what black art was forin the early part of the Thatcher era. Sonia Boyce, who won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2022 for her workFeeling Her Way, was in attendance, as was theBlack Audio Film Collective, including John Akomfrah, who represented the UKat the Venice Biennale last year.TheTurner prize winner Lubaina Himidwas present that day, as were other Turner nomineesIngrid Pollard(who also won the Hasselblad award in 2024) andClaudette Johnson, who had a studio in the building and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 2022 for “her contribution to the arts and creative industries sector”.Other alumni includeCornelia Parkerand the founder of the design website Dezeen,Marcus Fairs.Johnson was part of the Blk Art Group, which formed in Wolverhampton and included Janet Vernon, Dominic Dawes, Wenda Leslie, Ian Palmer, Marlene Smith, Eddie Chambers and Donald Rodney, who is the subject of a major retrospectivethat comes to the Whitechapel Gallery this week.Another member of the group, Keith Piper, whorecently responded to the Rex Whistler mural at Tate Britain, said the building was a site of “massive historical significance”.He said: “As the site of the First National Black Art Convention in October 1982, it will for ever be the location where artists who would become central to the development of British art of the following decades met for the first time and went on to form some of the most important collaborations of the decade and beyond.”The event was commemorated at an anniversaryconference in 2012 and a symposium in 2023, while a research project was set up by Piper and the rest of the Blk Art Group that includesaudio recordings from the eventin which Boyce, Johnson and Himid can be clearly heard.A university spokesperson said that under the current redevelopment plan the School of Art and Creative Industries would be relocated to a different building “where we will develop new, modern, inspiring teaching and learning spaces that help to foster creativity, collaboration, innovation and an enriched student experience.“This is a very exciting time for theUniversity of Wolverhamptonand we look forward to working with our staff, students and partners to deliver this ambitious and transformative programme.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageUniversity of WolverhamptonArchitectureWolverhamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

He also speculated on whether successive governments were guilty of a “snobbery” about retail.Writing in the Sunday Times, Machin said a plan to lower the threshold at which employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) kick in should be phased in over two years. He also called for a review of planned changes to business rates that would increase the burden for retailers with large stores.He has previously said changes to NICs, which were announced in the budget in October, wouldadd £60m to the company’s costs. This equated to about half a total rise in wage costs for M&S, including an increase in the legal minimum wage.Machin also wants the government to delay an increase in fees for handling the recycling of packaging and a deposit return scheme for bottles, which he claimed were “poorly planned” and “nigh on impossible to operate” as well as “highly costly”.He said changes to the extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees, which are designed to fund recycling, would mean retailers would have to pay 20 times more, with £2bn of the fees going straight to the Treasury without improving recycling. “Retail is being raided like a piggy bank and it’s unacceptable,” he said.A string of retail bosses have already warned that prices may have to rise, recruitment be paused or job cuts made, amid rising costs and lacklustre consumer demand.Retailers face a £7bn increase in costs this year, according to the British Retail Consortium, including the changes toemployers’ NICs, packaging levies and the increase in the legal minimum wage.In response, a Treasury spokesperson said: “We delivered a once-in-a-parliament budget to wipe the slate clean and deliver the stability businesses need, laying the foundations for economic growth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It followed fears of a walkout by angry armed officers in London after a police marksman, Martyn Blake,was tried for murderover the shooting of Chris Kaba. Blake was acquitted in October by a jury in three hours.Police say they want the system to be fairerand protect officerswho use force as part of their duties. Rights groups believe the system holding police to account is already too weak, and diluting it would “undermine public trust”.In a letter seen by the Guardian, groups including Inquest, the Centre for Women’s Justice, Liberty and Black Lives Matter warn the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, againstweakening police accountability.“This review is less a kneejerk reaction but rather a dangerous and calculated attempt to use a high-profile case to push for less scrutiny and accountability of police actions,” they said.“The number of cases where police officers are prosecuted for a death is vanishingly small (since 1990 there has only beenone successful prosecutionof an officer for manslaughter and none for murder).“2023-24 saw a 10% increase in police use of force and the highest figure of police-related deaths for nearly a decade.“Our work has exposed disturbing levels of neglect, violence and excessive use of force by police officers, particularly in cases involving black and racialised people. The institutional impunity afforded the police at an individual and corporate level indicates in most cases that police officers remain above the law.”Inquest says since 1990 there have been 1,915 deaths after police custody or contact.Later this year new laws will be introduced giving anonymity to firearms officers who shoot someone, unless they are convicted.Within weeks, a review conducted by a former judge and former senior Scotland Yard chief will report.It is looking at whether it should be made harder for inquests to find police unlawfully killed someone. It is also examining whether to make it harder to disprove an officer’s claim of self-defence in misconduct inquiries, by changing the standard of proof to the higher criminal test of beyond reasonable doubt, rather than the current civil test which is on the balance of probabilities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police should not have a licence to kill. The changes they want would, in effect, give them one.”The government believes it faces a balancing act of ensuring officers have the confidence to use their powers, while also reassuring the public that police are not above the law.The Home Office was asked to comment.Explore more on these topicsPoliceDeaths in custodyRacenewsShareReuse this content"

And those who aren’t in Aberdeen might not be willing or able to move there.”The “tricky” process of finding a CEO could also be frustrated by the relatively modest salaries available to civil servants compared with private sector pay packets, and the lengthy notice periods of senior energy industry executives who might be interested in taking up the job. “They might be fishing in a smaller pool than they expected,” the source added.GB Energy is currently under the leadership of the former Siemens UK bossJürgen Maier, who is based in Manchester, and a five-strongteam of non-executive directorsbased in various parts of the UK.The non-executive directors on the startup board are Frances O’Grady, the former general secretary of the TUC; Frank Mitchell, the former boss of Scottish Power’s power networks business; Kate Gilmartin, the chief executive of the British Hydropower Association; Nina Skorupska, the former chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association; and Valerie Todd, a former HR director at Siemens UK.A source close to GB Energy said the recruitment could prove to be “challenging” due to the location and salary, and the chief executive would “100% be based full-time in Aberdeen”.“The chief executive role will tap into a sense of public duty – it’s a chance to do something that’s in the public interest. So it might appeal to the heart rather than the bank account,” they said.GB Energy emerged as one of Labour’s most popular election manifesto pledges after the party promised that investing public funds in clean energy would help the UK meet its climate targets while bolstering the economy and cutting energy bills by up to £300 a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have always been aware that air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer, but we can now see how stark the impact truly is. This hard evidence must prompt action.”Ministers must act to curb air pollution, Chadwick said. “Failure to do so will only see more lives devastated by lung cancer.”Andrew Haines, a professor of environmental change and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the data emphasised the “imperative” for the government to “address the ongoing impacts of air pollution on health with greater determination”.Dr Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at World Cancer Research Fund, said the toll of cancer cases caused by toxic air could “only be addressed by a concerted government effort to reduce air pollution”. She said: “We already know pollution is a risk factor for lung cancer, but these figures highlight just how important environmental causes can be when looking at cancer risk.”Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence and cancer mortality worldwide. In 2022, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease. But the patterns of incidence by subtype have changed dramatically in recent decades.Of the four main subtypes of lung cancer – adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma – adenocarcinoma has become the dominant subtype among both men and women, the IARC found.Adenocarcinoma accounted for 45.6% of global lung cancer cases among men and 59.7% of global lung cancer cases among women in 2022. The respective figures were 39.0% and 57.1% in 2020.Adenocarcinoma accounted for as much as 70% of lung cancer cases among never-smokers, the IARC said.About 200,000 cases of adenocarcinoma were associated with exposure to air pollution in 2022, according to the IARC study,published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal.The largest burden of adenocarcinoma attributable to air pollution was found in east Asia. China’s incidence rates in 2022 were 6.15 cases per 100,000 men and 4.25 cases per 100,000 women, according to the IARC.The UK rates of adenocarcinoma caused by toxic air were much lower than China (0.66 and 0.7) but still higher than the US (0.49 and 0.53) and Canada (0.38 and 0.41). The UK rates were four times higher than in Finland (0.16 and 0.12).Lucy Clark, cancer intelligence manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “While tobacco remains the biggest cause of lung cancer in the UK, the disease can affect anyone, including people who’ve never smoked.“This major study shows that air pollution causes hundreds of thousands of lung cancer cases every year across the world, and the highest rates are in east Asia. The data also suggests that the rates of lung cancer cases linked to air pollution in the UK are slightly higher than the US and Canada.“To help people lead longer, healthier lives, the UK government must do more to reduce levels of air pollution and continue to tackle the harms of tobacco.”Sarah Sleet, the chief executive of Asthma + Lung UK, said the IARC figures added to an “ever-growing body of evidence” showing the “devastating impact of air pollution on our health”. “Sadly, it’s not a shock to see the UK so high up in these depressing leagues tables of adenocarcinoma caused by air pollution.“Yet still the government fails to take decisive action, even just last week giving the go ahead to anadditional runway at Heathrow– which will undoubtedly increase air pollution – rather than setting stricter targets to protect people from the harms of air pollution.Without stronger air pollution targets, the UK risked creating “another generation growing up breathing toxic air”, Sleet said.Livi Elsmore, campaign manager at the Healthy Air Coalition, said the findings “must be a wake-up call” for ministers and called for “concerted government action” to clean up the air across the UK.The government said it was determined to clean up the UK’s air to make it safe for everyone to breathe. A spokesperson added: “That’s why we are developing a comprehensive and ambitious clean air strategy, and we have launched a rapid review of the environmental improvement plan to make sure it is fit for purpose to deliver legally binding targets on improving air quality.”Explore more on these topicsLung cancerAir pollutionCancerHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve served the Labour party all my life and it was a huge honour to be appointed a minister by Keir Starmer.“I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can,” he wrote.The Mail on Sunday reported that Gwynne’s comments included antisemitic slights and a joke about a constituent being “mown down” by a truck.He also reportedly wrote in one message that he hoped a 72-year-old woman would soon have “croaked it” after she asked a councillor, who shared the message in the group, about her rubbish bins.A senior Conservative said the mention of the elderly woman was “nasty”, and described as “sinister” a message in which Gwynne is said to have written that someone’s name sounded “too Jewish”.The shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart questioned whether any other members of the chat group had called out the alleged antisemitic comment.“That is a very serious remark, and if the prime minister doesn’t take action against everyone in that group very quickly, we know that there is still a problem in the Labour party,” he told Sky News.Explore more on these topicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

She laterannounced the decisionin parliament.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner also defended her decision to postpone local elections in nine council areas.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PARayner told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show that she had taken part in meetings with different families and community groups during the consultation phase, after years of debate over the tower’s future.“I felt, weighing up all of the different conversations that I had, and the engineering report, that actually the only way forward really was to sensitively make sure that we start taking the tower to ground level, but that we have a lasting memorial on that site,” she said.Some people wanted the tower to remain standing as a lasting reminder of the tragedy, while others called for it to be removed completely. Rayner said she was determined to work with the families to develop a lasting memorial to “do justice to what is a sacred place”.However, the housing secretary acknowledged that “there isn’t a consensus” over the building’s future after being accused by some of failing to properly consult survivors.“I think what I tried to do is take a really difficult meeting, and explain to people … knowing full well that whatever I said in that room that night was going to be very traumatic for people, and people would be upset,” she said.Grenfell United, which represents some of the families, has said it appeared from the meeting that “no one supported” the government’s decision. “Ignoring the voices of the bereaved on the future of our loved ones’ grave site is disgraceful and unforgivable,” they said.A spokesperson for Grenfell Next of Kin, a separate group representing some bereaved families, said that while the decision was “obviously a very sensitive and difficult” one, families “understand the hard facts around safety”. Kimia Zabihyan from the group described the meeting as “charged”, but said Rayner appeared to have attended with the “best of intentions”.What is left of the high-rise block has stood in place since the fire on 14 June 2017, with a covering on the building that features a large green heart accompanied by the words “forever in our hearts”.View image in fullscreenKimia Zabihyan, of the Grenfell Next of Kin group, said Angela Rayner appeared to have attended the meeting with the ‘best of intentions’.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersAlso in the interview, Rayner denied that her decision last week topostpone local electionsin nine councils across England as part of her devolution plans was a “stitch-up”, after criticism from Reform UK that the rightwing party would have otherwise taken swathes of seats.The move to combine some authorities and introduce six elected mayors affects elections scheduled in May for seven county councils – Essex, East Sussex, Hampshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and West Sussex – and two unitary councils, Thurrock and the Isle of Wight.Rayner said it would have been pointless to go ahead with May elections to bodies “that are not going to exist”. She added: “It would not be a stitch-up … I don’t take the voters as idiots. What we’re trying to do is reorganise so the taxpayer gets the best value for money from local government, and they get to unlock powers from Whitehall, pushed down to local areas through the mayoral model.”The deputy prime minister was also pressed over claims that she had once joked that Keir Starmer “couldn’t run a bath”, amid criticism over his leadership skills. She dismissed the reports, which appear in a new book,Get In: The Inside Story of Labour Under Starmer, as “tittle-tattle”.She did not deny that she had called Prince Andrew a “nonce” and tried to block the royal from ever standing in for King Charles, as the book claims.Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireAngela RaynerLondonEnglandLabourLocal electionsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas, meanwhile, says it will not hand over the last hostages it seized during its attacks on 7 October 2023 until Israel removes all troops from the territory.Despite the withdrawal – andthe release of some of the hostages and prisoners held by both sides– little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal, which is designed to extend the truce and to secure the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Further doubts over what comes next arose on Saturday after it emerged that the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, had dispatched a delegation including low-level officials to Qatar – which helped negotiate the truce – prompting speculation that the mission might not lead to a breakthrough in extending the ceasefire.A day later, the Palestinian health ministry said two women in their 20s, one of whom was eight months pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank.Under the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 of the Israeli hostages it seized, in exchange for a pause in fighting, the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and access to more humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza.The second phase anticipates the release of all remaining living hostages in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable calm”.But more substantial details remain unclear and the ongoing efforts to secure an extension to the ceasefire have been hindered by deep mutual distrust – and, more recently, by Donald Trump’s wildly inflammatory suggestion thatthe US could take control of the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants.On Tuesday, the US president said America would “take over” and “own” Gaza, claiming that it could become the “riviera of the Middle East”. He also called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians.The suggestion produced shock waves across the Middle East and prompteda warning from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, against “any form of ethnic cleansing”.Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, headed to Washington for talks on Sunday, while Trump’s plans have prompted Cairo to host an emergency summit of Arab nations on 27 February.A statement from the Egyptian foreign ministr​y said the gathering had been called “after extensive consultations by Egypt at the highest levels with Arab countries in recent days, including Palestine, which requested the summit, to address the latest serious developments regarding the Palestinian cause”.Netanyahu, however, has welcomed Trump’s proposal, saying Israel was willing to “do the job” after Trump ruled out sending American troops to the territory.The Israeli prime minister told Fox News on Saturday: “I think that President Trump’s proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza.”Netanyahu sparked further fury when he suggested that a Palestinian state – which he has long opposed – could be “in Saudi Arabia”.The Saudi foreign ministry stressed its “categorical rejection [of] such statements”, while the Arab League chief, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said such ideas “are nothing more than mere fantasies or illusions”.Netanyahu’s far-right political allies want to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. But the prime minister is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want the deal to continue, especially afterthe gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed on Saturday ​​shocked the nation.Netanyahu’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who opposed the ceasefire, has threatened to quit the coalition if the war does not resume – a move that could topple the administration.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The sudden cessation of services prompted panic in the camps after aid workers failed to turn up for work.Three days later, Blumont was given a two-week waiver to the aid cuts, which unless extended, will expire on Monday. “We have no idea what will happen tomorrow. It seems as if even the provision of bread will be halted,” said Jihan Hanan, the director of al-Hol camp.The camp holds the relatives of suspected IS fighters and is mostly populated by women and children. Rights groups have for years warned that detainees are held arbitrarily without charges in inhumane and substandard living conditions.No charges have been raised against the camp’s population. Despite this, they are unable to leave, with the exception of non-Syrian detainees whose countries agree to take them back.Though IS no longer holds any territory after the group’s last stand in March 2019, US and Kurdish officials say the group ideology prevails among former members and that camps and detention facilities are a hotbed of extremist ideology.In the section of the camp where foreign women from at least 40 countries are kept, guards say they are in a constant struggle with women who seek to keep IS alive.“Even if a normal person enters the camp, they eventually will be psychologically affected. The violent behaviour is really high among the kids and women,” Hanan said, describing incidents of violence against al-Hol’s staff.mapWomen there have constructed cloth roofs above their tents and walkways to conceal themselves from guards’ view. In once incident, a child as young as six years old waited at the edge of the fenced-off annexe, hurling rocks at passing NGO vehicles with a makeshift sling.It is unclear what will happen on Monday when the brief waiver given to Blumont, which provides the bulk of services in al-Hol, expires. Camp officials are hoping for an 11th-hour exemption from Donald Trump’s 90-day global aid freeze, but have been given no assurances from the US administration.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a blanket waiver for “life-saving assistance”, for which humanitarian organisations can apply while the administration reviews which US aid projects will continue. The review process has confused US aid officials, diplomats and humanitarian workers worldwide.When aid was briefly cut off from al-Hol in late January, the camp administration was given no notice. Camp officials had to scramble to secure the most basic of services, as contractors such as Blumont, which normally provided bread and water to the camp, had shuttered their offices. US special forces visited the camp, assuring its director they would help safeguard it in case of any unrest or IS attacks.“We were able to get bread to the camp by the afternoon. It was 5,000 bags of bread for one day, which was 4bn Syrian lira (£35,000) – the Autonomous Administration [the Kurdish authority of north-east Syria] cannot cover this cost,” Hanan said.Humanitarian conditions in al-Hol are already abysmal. On Thursday, residents shopping at the camp’s marketplace moved through mud and puddles as cold winter rain flooded the dirt alleyways of the sprawling complex. Young children, many of whom said they could not remember life outside the camp, darted between the shops, their clothing worn and dirty.“Everything is bad here. We get food aid every two months and we have to sell most of it. Everyone is tired,” said Taysir al-Husseiniya, a 39-year-old Iraqi woman, sitting in a shop whose shelves were sparsely stocked with lightbulbs and other home goods.Al-Husseiniya said that raising her four children, one of whom was injured by an airstrike during the international campaign against IS, “was extremely difficult” in the camp’s conditions. Her husband was imprisoned by Kurdish authorities in 2019 for being a suspected IS fighter, leaving her to raise her children alone.Human Rights Watch warned on Friday that the Trump aid cuts were “exacerbating life-threatening conditions, risking further destabilisation of a precarious security situation” in the camps.The future of the US military presence in north-east Syria has also been called into question as the Trump administration seeks to shrink the US military footprint abroad.The US maintains military bases across north-east Syria and has trained, equipped and supported Kurdish forces in their fight against IS since the formation of the US-led international coalition to defeat IS was formed in 2014.The director of the Panorama prison in al-Hasakah, north-east Syria, which houses 5,000 suspected IS fighters, said that a US withdrawal would stretch Kurdish authorities and leave prisons vulnerable to jail breaks.“If US forces pull out, it will be even worse than 2012. IS sleeper cells in the Syrian desert will emerge and could attack the prison,” the prison director said on Saturday, asking not to be named for fears of being targeted by IS.In al-Hol, there fears that a security vacuum, along with the sudden withdrawal of much of the camp’s resources, could provide fertile ground for the radical group’s recruitment.“We will descend into chaos. Maybe the lack of supplies will allow IS sleeper cells to take control of the camp. Maybe there will be attacks on the administration. I can’t say what will happen,” Hanan said.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateKurdsAidUSAidUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

All have promised to reduce the widespread crime that pushed the country into an unnerving new normal four years ago.The rise in violence across the South American country is linked to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. Many voters have become victims of crime, so their personal and collective losses will be a determining factor in the outcome of the election.Voting is mandatory inEcuador. In the port city of Guayaquil, people lined up under a light rain outside a public university where tens of thousands were expected to cast ballots.“For me, this president is disastrous,” said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting centre with her three teenage children. “Can he change things in four more years? No. He hasn’t done anything.”‘Clear signs of authoritarianism’: Ecuador’s ‘iron fist’ leader seeks re-electionRead moreBarres, who must pay $25 (£20) a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she would vote for González because she believed she could reduce crime and improve the economy.More than 13.7 million people are eligible to vote. To win outright, a candidate needs 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger. If needed, a runoff election would take place on 13 April.Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by thedecision of the then president, Guillermo Lasso, to dissolve the national assemblyand shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of the former president Rafael Correa, had served only short stints as lawmakers before launching their 2023 presidential campaigns.Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. He founded an event-organising company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp, where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the national assembly and chaired its economic development commission.Under his presidency, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. It nevertheless remains far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019.Keila Torres, an architecture student waiting for her turn to vote, said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None of the candidates, she said, would be able to lower crime across Ecuador because of deep-rooted government corruption.“If I could, I wouldn’t be here,” said Torres, who has witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. “Things are not going to change.”Torres added that criminal activity had affected her studies as her neighbourhood’s gang targeted anyone walking the streets after 10pm., which forced her to skip night classes to not miss curfew. She said her family was not forced to pay monthly extortion fees to the gang, but the group had urged neighbours to vote for a specific candidate.“In my area, they left flyers in every house door saying that if they didn’t vote for Luisa, they would have to face the consequences,” Torres said.González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 to 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the national assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa’s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Representatives of his “department of government efficiency” have been granted administrative-level access to all of the agency’s IT systems, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Union officials said on Friday that Musk was effectively seeking to seize control of his own regulator.In a statement, Dennis Kelleher, head of Better Markets, which advocates for stricter government oversight of the financial sector, accused Trump of throwing his own voters “to the financial wolves.“This latest attempt to kill the consumer bureau is another slap in the face for all Americans who depend on basic financial products and services, but especially for those in the multi-racial working-class coalition of Americans that helped elect President Trump,” Kelleher said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a large Garda presence in the area and other emergency services attended.The local Fine Gael councillor Ray McAdam said residents had been told to stay inside and lock their doors. He said police had reacted very quickly and “swarmed the place”.Garda said a man in his 20s was intercepted and detained close to the scene by an unarmed officer, at a Garda station in the north of Dublin.Police said three men assaulted in the course of the incident were taken to hospital for treatment. Two had serious but not life-threatening injuries, while the other’s injuries were described as less serious.After the arrest, a spokesperson for the Garda Síochána, the Irish national police force, said: “There is no ongoing risk to the public at this time.”The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, wished those injured in the “shocking attacks” in Dublin a “full recovery”.In a statement on X, he said: “Our thoughts are with the victims of the shocking attacks in Stoneybatter earlier today. I want to pay tribute to the gardaí and emergency services for their prompt response.“I wish all those injured a full recovery and urge anyone with any information to contact Garda.”A heightened police presence and a number of crime scene cordons were in place until shortly before 5pm. All traffic restrictions had been lifted by the evening.Police are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward.“Anyone who was in the Stoneybatter area between 2.30pm and 3.30pm, who may have any video footage linked to this incident, is asked to make this footage available to gardaí,” a spokesperson said.“Anyone with information is asked to contact the Bridewell Garda station on (01) 6668200, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111, or any Garda station.”McAdam said community officers were contacting local residents to assure them they would maintain a presence in the area. He described the neighbourhood as closely knit.“There’s a level of shock, a level of concern, but the overriding sense here in Stonybatter is one of hope that those who have been impacted and injured will make a swift recovery,” he said. “There’s a sense of ‘how could something like this happen in our neighbourhood?”’Local people had been reassured by the quick Garda response, he said.The Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, described the incident as “terrible news”. “My thoughts are with those injured and their families. The community is in a state of shock,” she said in a statement. “The gardaí and emergency services are to be commended for their response.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Mbumba said Nujoma died on Saturday night after being hospitalised in the capital, Windhoek.Among those who paid tribute was King Charles, who said he was “profoundly saddened to learn” of Nujoma’s death.He said Nujoma’s “contribution to history was immense”, adding: “His lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy, overcoming so much adversity on that journey, was truly inspirational.”He was revered in his homeland as the charismatic father of the nation who steered his country to democracy and stability after long colonial rule by Germany and a bitter war of independence from SouthAfrica.He was the last of a generation of African leaders who led their countries out of colonial or white minority rule that included South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda and Mozambique’s Samora Machel.View image in fullscreenSouth African president FW de Klerk delivers a speech in Windhoek, where he handed over Namibia to Namibian president Sam Nujoma, seated left, during an independence ceremony on 21 March 1990.Photograph: John Parkin/APMany Namibians credited Nujoma’s leadership for the process of national healing and reconciliation after the deep divisions caused by the independence war and South Africa’s policies of dividing the country into ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and healthcare for each race.Even his political opponents praised Nujoma – who was branded a Marxist and accused of ruthless suppression of dissent while in exile – for establishing a democratic constitution and involving white businessmen and politicians in government after independence.Despite his pragmatism and nation-building at home, Nujoma often hit foreign headlines for his fierce anti-western rhetoric. He claimed Aids was a human-made biological weapon and also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays “idiots” and branding homosexuality a “foreign and corrupt ideology”.Explore more on these topicsNamibiaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We can finally return to our motherland,” he said.Somboon Saethao, the father of Bannawat, said he was “so happy” and that his family would welcome his son home with a traditional Thai ceremony.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Sathian Suwannakham greet him as he arrives at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/Reuters“I don’t think I want him to be far from home again,” said Somboon, who comes from Nan province in northernThailand.Bannawat moved toIsraelnine months before his kidnap in search of a better income for the family, he added.Foreign minister Maris Sangiampongsa said it was “very inspiring” to witness their return, and that officials would monitor their reintegration into Thai society, “focusing on their mental health”.“We never gave up on these hostages,” he said during a press conference at the airport.The five returnees are now making their way to their home towns.Boonsong Tapchaiyut, a labour ministry official said that each hostage would receive a one-time payment of about $18,000 (600,000 baht), along with a monthly salary of $900 until the age of 80, to ensure they did not have to return to Israel.WhenHamasattacked Israel on 7 October 2023, 31 Thais were abducted, with 23 released by the end of that year and two confirmed dead in May.One Thai national is still believed to be alive in Gaza.View image in fullscreenThailand’s foreign minister Maris Sangyampong with the five freed Thai hostages at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, 9 February 2025.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersThe handover of the five hostages last month in Khan Younis in southern Gaza was marked by chaotic scenes as Islamic Jihad and Hamas fighters struggled to hold back hundreds of spectators.After the release, prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said she was “elated” that they were out of captivity and thanked Israel, as well as Qatar, Egypt, Iran, Turkey and the US for their work to secure the releases.A total of 46 Thai workers have been killed since October 2023, according to the foreign ministry in Bangkok, the majority in the Hamas attack and some by rockets fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah.Thailand’s labour ministry said last week that the country will expand its workforce in Israel by 13,000.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsThailandIsrael-Gaza warHamasIsraelAsia PacificMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

That sunshine you asked for, you gave to me,” before signing off the post with “Your fan, Robert x”.Hanson Auctioneers offered Morecambe’s belongings in 700 lots on 10 and 11 January, more than 40 years after the comic died of a heart attack, aged 58, in 1984.Explore more on these topicsRobbie WilliamsMorecambe and WisenewsShareReuse this content"

Mark (James Westphal) is the older, estranged, gay brother who has made a successful life elsewhere while Tiny (Jerome Yates) has never left their faded home town in Hartlepool.We only ever see them coming together on the sands of Seaton Carew, to the cries of gulls and surge of water around them. Tiny feels an elemental connection to this sea and land, believing in its local mythologies, while Mark only sees its merciless qualities.There are lovely switches between humour and solemnity, as well as sadness and scratchiness between brothers: Tiny’s grieving vulnerability contrasted by Mark’s buttoned-up resentments at his father’s homophobic bullying. There are contested memories with gentle shocks and apologies. It is beautifully done through their exchanges on the beach.Writer Tim Foley has won several awards for past works (including the Bruntwood prize) and it is clear, from the love and lyricism in this script, that he is a striking talent. The play captures the brothers’ relationship with tenderness without ever slipping into sentimentality, and also conjures their backdrop in the post-industrial decline of the north-east.Co-produced by Pentabus and ThickSkin, what eclipses the delicacy of the script is the giant screen at the back of the stage, showing a mix of abstract water imagery and landscape shots, which at first seems like a good device for creating atmosphere and watery dread. But this cinematic element swamps the theatricality and feels too literal and overbearing, the evocative sound design by Lee Affen might just as well have sufficed.Co-directed by Elle While and Neil Bettles, there are two wooden beach structures moved around on the stage and in-between scenes but this physicality does not seem clean or distinct enough, the brothers’ movement a little woolly.An environmental message is tied to the prevailing theme of loss, with dead crabs strewn on the beach and polluted water, and a slightly strained analogy between the lies of the father, and that of the government.But the emotional core is full of truth, sadness and beauty, and it is this that brings the quiet magic of this drama.On tour until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSheffield TheatresreviewsShareReuse this content"

And, in a unique coup de théâtre, Samuel West will be giving a performance that he has already partially recorded: in fact, he did it 19 years ago.Beckett’s daring short play, one of his most popular works afterWaiting for Godot, revolves around the thoughts of Krapp, who at 69 listens to a recording made by his younger self back on his 39th birthday. Writing in 1958, Beckett gave most of the dialogue to this disembodied voice from the past. A recording is usually played to the audience from a reel-to-reel tape machine.West, now 58, had the foresight to record these taped lines from the play when he was actually 39, back in 2006. So when he eventually reaches the correct age for the older Krapp he can play both parts with true vocal authenticity for the first time in theatrical history, as far as anyone knows.The time-lapse play, West told theObserver, is like “a two-hander”, but with only one actor. “It is all crystallised beautifully by using this technology of the tape recorder, which was a new thing when Beckett wrote it,” he said.The first Beckett Biennale will take place in July next year, split between venues in theplaywright’s native Enniskillenin Northern Ireland and Greystones in County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland, where Beckett walked in the mountains with his father. Run by Seán Doran and Liam Browne of Arts Over Borders, the biennales will pick up the duo’s previous work, steering the Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival, staged in Northern Ireland until 2022.West, who is the son of Prunella Scales and the late Timothy West, made his original recording under the supervision of Katie Mitchell, the acclaimed director, but he remains uncertain how good it will sound to him when he hears it again. “I last listened to it a few weeks after making it, and immediately thought I could do better. I went back to the director and said, ‘I want to re-record them,’ and she, very properly, said, ‘You can’t. That’s the whole point.’”View image in fullscreenSamuel West recorded the lines in 2006.Photograph: David Hartley/ShutterstockDoran took the recording to the BBC, asking it to protect the tape from degrading and stow it away for possible use 30 years later. “To the best of my knowledge this hasn’t been attempted anywhere before,” he said. “Beckett’s play is a perfect miniature that catches that moment we will many of us arrive at, when we suddenly see the years that have gone by and the opportunities lost.” A limited number of Extremely Early Bird tickets for the 2036 productionwill be on salefrom 13 April, Beckett’s birthday.“The first words of the play are ‘39 today’,” West said. “And I thought to myself back then, I can really only do this once. So I asked Katie, who I really admired, if she would consider directing me in it when we were older, if we were still around. She has messaged me recently to say, ‘Count me in’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hope is that Dormer will play the part at the seventh biennale in 2038, when he too reaches 69. “Richard told me then it was his most depressing birthday ever!” Doran said. “Many wonders and surprises await us and, God willing, we’ll look forward to meeting up with Samuel in 2036 and Richard two years later. It’s not all that far off, after all.“I was very fortunate that Samuel and Richard were keen to take part and fulfil the first half of the bargain at least. It’s very exciting, 19 years on, that we can announce, with a little more confidence, what we set in motion back then.”Explore more on these topicsSamuel BeckettThe ObserverSamuel WestTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

The new biennial competition with a £40,000 bounty for the victor is initially guaranteed to run for 10 editions, by which time it hopes to be on a par with the Booker or Turner prizes, boosting dance’s profile accordingly. It was Greek choreographer Christos Papadopoulos who took home the honour (and a cool Es Devlin-designed trophy) for his piece Larsen C, chosen by an eclectic judging panel, with Christopher Bannerman and Arlene Phillips from the dance world, musician PJ Harvey and poet Karthika Naïr. (There was also £15,000 awarded to an early-career choreographer in the Bloom prize, won by Stav Struz Boutrous.)Papadopoulos is pretty much unknown in the UK, but a darling of the Greek dance scene who’s toured widely in Europe. Larsen C may have been the most divisive piece in the contest. The title refers to an Antarctic ice shelf, and the dance does indeed move at glacial pace, with small, repetitive movements that drove some viewers to distraction (it’s rare to hear a “boo” in a polite dance theatre). It was inspired, the choreographer has said, by how your perception of something can completely alter when the smallest element is changed. There’s an element of illusion that can’t help call to mind Papadopoulos’s compatriot Dimitris Papaioannou, as bodies disappear into the blackness of the stage and flashes of flesh appear, looking like truncated arms or extra limbs – the dancers’ feet in shadow making them seem as if they’re gliding soundlessly. There’s beautiful movement here, boneless limbs like drifting tentacles, as mysterious as the creatures in the depths of the Mariana Trench.View image in fullscreenLives in full swing … Keturah Stephen, Tamisha A Guy, Catherine Kirk and Gianna Theodore in An Untitled Love by Kyle Abraham.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs the music grows from fuzzy white noise to insistent rhythm, rumbling subwoofer to thick drone, the dancers gather into a moving mass with the repetition inviting a sort of trance state. It grows towards a coup de theatre made of copious haze and a piercing light – when a hand penetrates its beam it looks like an arm from the heavens coming to grab a lost soul, a divine intervention perhaps. It’s an impressive effect. But after that the piece doesn’t know what to do with itself and loses its way.View image in fullscreenDeeply primal … Carcaça by Marco da Silva Ferreira.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe three other works on the strong shortlist, presented across two weeks at Sadler’s Wells, were American choreographerKyle Abraham’s An Untitled Love, previously seen in the UK at Edinburgh International festival, Carcaça by Portuguese choreographer Marco da Silva Ferreira and Brazilian Lia Rodrigues’s Encantado. Trying to judge art may seem a futile exercise to some, but it’s an intriguing snapshot of dance right now. The pieces on show aren’t attached to traditional formal techniques and structures, more driven by vibes or viscerality. Three of the works, Larsen C, Carcaça and Encantado are built on long slow crescendos; An Untitled Love, set to the music of D’Angelo, is episodic in nature, as if dropping into lives that are already in full swing. Abraham’s genius is in smooshing together different dance styles – classical, contemporary, social and street – with laid-back ease, presenting a picture of extended family life with dance at its heart.Da Silva Ferreira is also concerned with dance as a social activity, drawing on club, street and folk in a distinctive but unpindownable language. It is part sexy, part military, part silly, strictly rhythmic, not in phrases of steps strung together but cells or riffs, one thing repeated many times, then moving on to the next. It’s very 2020s with its mildly intimidating, androgynous cast, the catwalk and duck walks taken from club culture, but it’s also deeply primal, building to hypnotic effect, which may daze, energise or enervate, depending on the viewer (personally, this could be my favourite piece of the four). It then takes an unexpected swerve into politics, calling out the bourgeoisie in forceful voice, turning this into the people’s dance, harnessing the power of bodies coming together, in escape, in ecstasy and in protest.View image in fullscreenAll of life vividly appearing out of nothing …Encantado by Lia Rodrigues.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLia Rodrigues has long acted on her politics, Encantado was created in the favelas of Rio in the midst of the pandemic. The veteran of this group, at 68, is also the most avant garde. Confident enough in her practice to, for example, start her piece with an empty, silent stage, and to keep that silence for a length of time that some in the audience clearly found uncomfortable (the sound of stifled giggles and shifting in seats). Then have her dancers walk on naked and burrow underneath huge sheets of fabric laid across the stage, mountainous lumps covered in loudly clashing colours, florals and animal prints. But when the dancers slowly start to move, and drape and twist and tie those fabrics around their bodies, they are transformed into innumerable vibrant characters, turbans and robes make gurus and kings, young ladies sunning themselves at the beach or old ones gossiping at the market, animals and raggy monsters; all of life suddenly, vividly appearing out of nothing. Rodrigues became a grandmother during the making of the piece, and here is the magic of life materialising, with joy and effervescence. An ode to the infinite possibilities of some bodies and a stage.Explore more on these topicsDanceAwards and prizesSadler's WellsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the books that came next were harder to pin down. AfterHuman Acts, about the 1980 massacre of student protesters in Han’s native Gwangju, cameThe White Book, in which a Han-like novelist reflects on the death of her baby sister while musing on wartime Warsaw. Then came 2023’sGreek Lessons, riddling to the point of opacity, about a divorced poet’s inability to communicate.We Do Not Part, Han’s first novel to be translated since winning theNobel prize for literaturelast year, has elements of all these books. Stark as well as ethereal, chronologically discontinuous, full of nested narratives – often structured as remembered conversations about remembered conversations – it exhumes historical horror but also swerves into hallucinatory magic realism without breaking the plausibly autofictional frame with which it begins.When Han won the Nobel, she said she couldn’t celebrate amid war in Gaza and UkraineOur narrator is the Seoul-based author Kyungha, whose life has gone off the rails after publishing a novel that sounds a lot likeHuman Acts(it’s about “a massacre at G–”). Even watching passersby is traumatic, reminding her of life’s fragility (“The flesh, organs, bones, breaths passing before my eyes all held within them the potential to snap, to cease – so easily, and by a single decision”). She can’t shake the memory of the survivors she wrote about, putting herself in the place of mothers who sheltered from gunfire with their children in a well. “In retrospect it baffles me. Having decided to write about mass killings and torture, how could I have so naively – brazenly – hoped to soon shirk off the agony of it, to so easily be bereft of its traces?”This is all happening at an unspecified point in the recent near-present. Kyungha, having previously held down a job to support her family, now doesn’t have to – not only because her daughter’s no longer a child, but also because of some coyly hinted-at domestic rift in the wake of her breakdown. She’s struggling to think of anyone she can name in her will – a symbol of her predicament – when out of the blue comes a text from Inseon, an old colleague from her journalism days. A visual artist living alone on Jeju Island, about 300 miles away, she’s now in hospital in Seoul after an accident at her studio, and she needs Kyungha to go and take care of her abandoned pet bird – a request Kyungha accepts, despite the hazardous snowbound trek it entails.View image in fullscreenJeju Island in Korea, where thousands of civilians were murdered in the 1940s.Photograph: ds3ann/Imazins/Getty Images/ImaZinS RFThus does the novel’s musing give way to a quixotic rescue mission (“Inseon had told me that to save her I had to get her water within the day. But when does the day end for a bird?”), shifting in tone yet further once Kyungha arrives only to find Inseon – or a vision of her – already there, and ready this time to elaborate on the horror that their previous conversations only circled: the state’s mass murder of civilians in Jeju during anti-communist violence in the late 1940s, prior to the Korean war, a bloody history that scarred Inseon’s family, not least her late mother, whom she nursed through dementia.The harrowing testimonies she presents Kyungha ultimately constituteWe Do Not Part’s main business. In contrast toHuman Acts, the stories of violence don’t come to us via narratorial recreation, exactly; they instead emerge solely from quotation in the form of interviews with the eyewitnesses and relatives whose accounts Kyungha hears from Inseon and then passes to us – a storytelling technique that, while no less a performance on Han’s part, gives the impression of being less presumptuous, more ethically scrupulous.When Han won the Nobel, she said she couldn’t celebrate amid war in Gaza and Ukraine. John Banville puckishly responded by saying the committee should take back the award, but it would be hard to readWe Do Not Partand not think her words heartfelt. Even at its most seemingly inessential – witness the repeated lingering descriptions of snowflakes – the book insists quietly on the necessity to pay attention, to never turn away, to look, to see. As a message, it risks appearing somewhat frictionless, even self-serving, offering reward without cost, but it’s worth remembering how this strange and unsettling novel begins: with the nightmare-haunted protagonist, alone.We Do Not Partby Han Kang is published by Hamish Hamilton (£18.99).

What our changing coffee tastes say about usFrom a 13th-century Yemen brew to the latest full-on blast of beans, the quest for the perfect caffeine hit continuesRachel CookeSun 9 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareWhen a man called Jacob opened what’s thought to be the first Britishcoffeehouse in Oxford in 1650, he cannot possibly have known what he was starting. Then, as now, coffee was fashionable. In France, which had beaten Britain in the race to bring the drink to western Europe, people were dazzled by the Turkish ambassador’s parties, at which he once servedIsaac D’Israeli, father of Benjamin, “the choicest Mocha coffee in tiny cups of egg-shell porcelain”. Perhaps Jacob hoped this glamour would rub off on the Angel Coaching Inn (admission: one penny).But coffee was then still a quite basic thing: fragrant, maybe, but incredibly bitter. It was a matter of one size fits all (and absolutely no caramel syrup). The only faux pas a person could commit in its vicinity was to grimace too vigorously on tasting it, a gaucherie grand ladies were able quickly to conceal with the careful deployment of their fans.Cut to 2025, when fans are only for the Hades-like depths of theLondonUnderground in high summer. If coffee is now ubiquitous thanks to the domination of the high street chains, drinking it has become something of a social minefield, at least for those who care about personal branding.Not so long ago, it was, after all, acceptable to order a cappuccino or a latte in the afternoon – unless you’re Italian and know that coffee with milk is only ever to be consumed at breakfast (or by big babies).View image in fullscreenThe flat white arrived in Britain about 20 years ago.Photograph: Washington Imaging/AlamyBut in 2005, or thereabouts, the flat white, which has a higher proportion of espresso than a latte and less froth than a cappuccino, arrived on these shores from – no one seems sure – Australia or New Zealand. Suddenly, consumers began to disdain lattes and cappuccinos, to the point where even Starbucks and Costa got the message (both sell flat whites, though aficionados probably prefer not to think about this).To every caffeinated beverage, however, there is a season, and at the hipper end of the market, the flat white’s may be cooling. The big news in coffee right now isthe long black, which also has its origins in Australia or New Zealand. In 2023, it was London’s fifth most popular coffee order, accounting for 9% of sales; it has also been seen in the wild in Bristol, Edinburgh and Leeds. By this time next year, then, it will surely have been adopted by your local independent coffee shop, wherever you happen to live, and the year after that, by Caffè Nero et al. With a fair wind, it should be available in cans in supermarket chiller cabinets by 2028 at the latest, which means, basically, that the window for early adoption is already long past, and maybe you don’t need to abandon your flat white after all. (Be retro, and be proud.)What is a long black? Its name makes no sense, because while it’s undoubtedly black, it’s shorter than an americano. Baristas make it by pouring an espresso into hot water, to fill a cup that would ordinarily hold a flat white (about 120ml). The coffee goes in last to preserve thecrema,the brownish foam that coffee snobs fetishise, but the lure is supposed to be its taste: if an americano can be innocuous – like diner coffee, only pricier – a long black is meant to give the drinker a decent blast of bean. I’m not sure it’s anything special, though I think I understand the impulse behind it. As every serious drinker of coffee surely knows, the search for the perfect cup is like the search for the perfect lipstick: a quest that will end only with death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A layered latte.Photograph: Eddie Grecu/AlamyIn general, coffee trends in Britain are very back-to-the-future, and hardly new at all; the long black is merely a speedy variation on this theme. Many of us grew up with coffee made by pouring hot water over grounds in a cone, drip-drip style, straight into the cup, and if you go into a truly hip coffee shop now, you’ll see this method is once again thene plus ultrawhen it comes to caffeine (Zen patience is an important element of the experience). It tastes better than either an americano or a long black, but doesn’t suit the morning rush hour, or work for a long queue of impatient addicts.Taste aside, though, coffee is a duller, safer thing now than in the past, however much we believe its more unusual or ascetic variants signal our coolness (the drinker of a long black may be the kind of person who 40 years ago would have signalled their style by smoking Gitanes … in Birmingham). A rich mythology, comprising dancing goats and sleepy monks, grew around the discovery of the coffee plant in Arabia (it was first mentioned as a drink in the 10th century, but cultivation probably began centuries earlier). InThe Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson suggests that when the practice of roasting beans began in the 13th century in Yemen, it was known asQahwah, originally a poetic name for wine. Thereafter it was often seen as subversive: a threat to religious life that would leave mosques and churches alike empty.In 2025, by contrast, its revolutionary qualities are somewhat limited. Chains may be boycotted, indies may refuse to serve it in disposable cups, and domestic consumers may pay more for fair trade. But otherwise it’s basically as cosy and as orthodox as, well, English breakfast tea.Explore more on these topicsCoffeeThe ObserverFoodLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, the family-run lingerie couture house in Paris is still the go-to for the world of high fashion – and stars like Beyoncé and Lady GagaSun 9 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareDown a passageway on the Rue Saint-Honoré, in Paris, sandwiched between the startling glamour of Chanel and Saint Laurent, there is a glass door stuck with peeling photographs that make up the Cadolle family tree. This family business has been making corsets since the late 1800s, with current clients including designers such as John Galliano (who hired them to make corsets for his Maison Margiela Artisanal couture show) and stars such as Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.Poupie Cadolle, now 78, welcomes me into the mirrored salon, “Welcome!” and arranges herself elegantly beside me on a fuchsia sofa, re-tying her silk neck scarf to tell their story. “It’s a very long story!” she warns, leaning in.The business is now run by Poupie’s daughter, Patricia, while Poupie concentrates on the couture fittings, but “It started with my great-great-grandmother Herminie Cadolle, who was a very strong personality. She was a feminist and an anarchist. She spent a lot of time in prison.” Upon release, Herminie “decided to liberate the woman from the corset, and she patented the very first bra ever made, in 1889, presenting it at the World Fair where they built the Eiffel Tower.” She points to a high shelf where this, the very first bra ever made, watches over the room: imperious, cream, covetable. The trick was elastic straps. They allowed women to live more functional lives, unbound by corsetry and, as women reshaped their bodies and place in society, the business grew. Poupie learned how to fit and design first from her mother, then from two mentors in the 1980s, Monsieur Bernardin, dressing nude dancers at the Crazy Horse Saloon, and the couturierAzzedine Alaïa, “Genius men who were in love with the women’s figure.”View image in fullscreen‘Lingerie was a symbol of oppression’: Patricia and Poupie Cadolle.Photograph: Patrick Swirc/The ObserverMuch has changed, much has remained, “but the bodies are completely different today.Womenhave no more waists! Because women don’t wear girdles any more, so the women never trained their waistline to be thin.” She’s seen “many, many breasts and they are all so different.” When she started in the boutique, the largest size they stocked was a B cup. Today, “I have a customer with a K cup. And in a lingerie show I saw a booth doing an N cup!” She motions with her hands. Her regular customers pay from €900 for a custom bra. They fly in from the US or Middle East, and sit here in her velvet-curtained room, and tell her about their life. “I have to know who she is, how she feels about her body – sometimes she hates herself. I have to know what she needs. What they usuallysaythey need is, ‘A good bra.’ Which means, first it looks good and second that she doesn’t need to remove it as soon as she gets home.” Downstairs, a messy atelier is lined with boxes and wooden plan chests, each containing customers’ patterns – among them, four young women chuckle and sew carefully. It’s highly technical work, despite the distractions of blue silk and slippery lace.View image in fullscreen‘The woman has such different bodies all her life’: a reproduction of the first ever bra, 1889.Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty ImagesPoupie loves lace and mourns lingerie of the past, mourns a bow, mourns a ruffle. “In some countries we are losing the essence of being a woman!” she tuts. “Bras or lingerie that is boring? That looks like a bandage when you cut your finger? For us it’s very frustrating.” There has been, she thinks, “A fight against lingerie, because it was used as a symbol of oppression – women thought that they didn’t need pretty things to wear underneath to seduce men. But forgot they could still wear them for themselves!” She’s watched (and slowly adapted to) the popularity of the thong and with it the rise of the bottom. “Working with Galliano last year for the show, they were adding fake bottoms, extreme ones, and since then I’ve seen in the street in Paris recently, some girls, not always that chic, with fake ones too.” She chuckles remembering a story about a pop star (redacted) she made lingerie for, who “was singing on a show and her bottom blew up! The implant exploded!”Cadolle is happy to make “porno chic” lingerie, as long as the fabrics are exquisite. “When it’s beautiful you can get away with it, if the woman herself behaves!” As Poupie attends to a fitting (should the buttocks be covered by lace?) my mum messages – was I going to buy a bra? “No, they cost €900,” I replied. “You could pay someone to carry your breasts around for a year for that,” she gasped. No need – in the UK we’re lucky, says Poupie, because we have Marks & Spencer. “Their bras are so good – technically they are wonderful. They are boring, but they’re good, and very innovative, with things like the uplift for the bottom.”Does Cadolle do uplift for the bottom too? “Of course! I reshape the body completely, the way they want to be reshaped. That’s what I love to do.” She spoils her customers, she smiles. “Because I love them. I really do.” She leans forward. “Now, would you like to meet my daughter?”View image in fullscreenA good bra looks good and doesn’t need to be remove as soon as you get home’: corsetry at the Cadolle atelier in Paris.Photograph: Patrick Swirc/The ObserverRound the corner, past Dior, Patricia greets us behind the counter of the boutique, where they stock the ready-to-wear lines. “We never agree with each other,” Patricia explains (her silk scarf is barely visible above the collar of her shirt), “but we always find the in-between. That’s really the point of working through generations – when you are young, you don’t need structure. So you don’t realise it’s very technical, you just look at the visual effect. And she teaches me the final result.”Behind her a wall of drawers contains hundreds of pairs of knickers, nestled together like birds. “In a regular business you don’t dare say what you think, whereas of course, with mother and daughter, you have to!” Poupie nods. “We are not doing a career, we are just doing our work, to improve the products and the knowhow the family has grown.”Patricia grew up in the atelier – that she’d end up here, she says, was inevitable. “But now she sees much further than I do” says Poupie. “I’m more in the moment. She’s more in the future. She has more,comment on peut dire – une analyse différente?”When she was a teenager, says Poupie, she fought terribly with her mother, who had banned her from wearing tights. “She said she thought it was vulgar. But she was smart because she knew that the tights would ruin our business. They removed girdles, garter belts, merry widows, everything that would hold the stockings. And then when women started wearing trousers, it killed the lingerie business. So now all that’s left is bras.” With the popularity of soft cups and comfort being prioritised, could they be disappearing, too? “They are trying! But then we wait.” Yes, says, Patricia.“The woman has such different bodies all her life. And everything changes, the bust, the volume – the older you get, the more it needs to be supported.” The luxury goods market declines each year – how will a 136-year-old couture lingerie brand adapt? “The market is shrinking, but we’re still here, because we’re still loyal to who we are, and what we represent.” While other luxury brands, they say, have tried to be competitive and lower their prices, “We didn’t, because we are very small and because we are not able to do a bra with bad lace.” Poupie shudders gently at the thought. “That doesn’t work, that’s not Cadolle.”Explore more on these topicsLingerieThe ObserverWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Small plates£7.50-£11.50, large dishes £9.50-£23.50, desserts £6.50, wines from £23, Cobra £6.30At the top of the menu at the Great Indian, a new and thoroughly delightful food pub in London’s Archway, there’s a set of slogans of a sort guaranteed to make my teeth itchy. It says things like “comfy”, “social” and “vibe dining”. I looked up the last one. Apparently, it means the place is, y’know, nice. We can all get behind nice. It was, however, another phrase that really stood out. It said “Indian influenced”. The Great Indian is owned by Aman Dhir who already has a takeaway of the same name in Hackney where they serve chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, aloo gobi and the rest. The executive chef here is Surjan Singh, an experienced restaurant consultant from India known there as Chef Jolly and familiar as a judge onMasterChef India. He has been spending time in Archway, alongside his Indian cooks and the Indian front of house team. The charming head waiter who served us had not long arrived in the UK from India.It speaks volumes about increasing sensitivities around dish origins and cultural appropriation that an entirely Indian team apparently think it wise to open up a little distance between the satisfying and well-executed Indian food they are serving and the mere suggestion that it might actually all be Indian food. Perhaps it’s because, among the small plates section of the evening menu, there are gunpowder Buffalo wings, which the pious might allege, with a performative eye-roll, must come from the upstate New York bit of India. Likewise, there’s a lamb “taco roti”, which might come from the Mexican part.View image in fullscreen‘Served in its own cast-iron pot’: chicken biryani.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThese are dainty folds of flaky, buttery roti, each filled with a hefty spoonful of a hot, dry lamb curry, in which the sauce has almost been cooked out to a crust around the meat. These are topped with crispy deep-fried curry leaves and arrive at the table in one of those zigzagged metal trays used to keep hand-sized tacos in one piece. If these were served as canapés at a party, one to which I would very much like an invitation thank you, anyone with good taste would be loitering by the door from the kitchen to get their hands on them as they arrived. Given all the ingredients, this is clearly an Indian dish. To describe it otherwise would be to set weird, po-faced, and arbitrary boundaries around what fits within a culinary tradition and what does not. We all play with our food. Be thankful that we do. The word “influenced” is happily redundant.View image in fullscreen‘Served with a chutney in the colours of the Indian flag’: smoked poppadoms.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDefinitions can still be helpful. The Great Indian is inside what was the Prince Alfred, an old boozer on a north London residential street. It is a restaurant serving Indian food housed in a pub. I believe we call those gastropubs. It is not, however, a Desi pub, like theYew Treein Wolverhampton, which I reviewed at the end of last year. A Desi pub is one which happens to have an Indian kitchen, generally serving the local Asian community among others; a place where you genuinely could just go for a quick pint or seven. There is a bar here, a pretty one with a jade-green tiled frontage, boasting a collection of gins, alongside Cobra, Guinness and Neck Oil Session IPA on draft. But the two high-tops for drinking at feel solely like places at which to wait for tables in the abutting dining room, rather than somewhere to pass the night. This isn’t a criticism. It’s a description.View image in fullscreen‘Heavy with roasted spice’: Punjabi lamb.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe ceiling is hung with artificial foliage and there are multilayered rattan lampshades. They care about small things. Start with the spiced poppadoms, which have been smoked and come with a chutney in the colours of the Indian flag. At the bottom there’s a date and tomato relish, in the middle, some spiced yoghurt and, on top, of that a dense mess of finely chopped sweet-sour mint. Hilarious amounts of work have gone into this idea, given that digging in with a teaspoon doesn’t quite reveal the full beauty of the flag. But it’s a great accompaniment and a nice story. Alongside the roti tacos we have their tamarind-rich chaat. It surrounds two flaky vegetable samosas, served warm, which peek out shyly from the crust of fried noodles and pomegranate seeds.View image in fullscreenFrom the Mexican part of India? Lamb taco roti.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAt lunchtime there are thalis at £14.90 built around the likes of butter chicken or tandoori paneer. Or there are bigger dishes priced in the mid-teens, which are proof once more of the power and joy, the depth and profundity, of brown food. The Punjabi lamb curry has a thick gravy the colour of freshly turned London clay, heavy with roasted spice and the sort of acidity that opens everything up. The dal makhani is described as having been simmered for 48 hours and there is a buttery-rich quality to it that suggests they really aren’t kidding. Come for the lamb tacos; stay for the lentils. Assume no one is watching and spoon it neat from the bowl. It’s cold and raining out there. Yellow weather warnings are in place. This dal will keep any storm at bayView image in fullscreen‘Tamarind-rich’: samosa and chaat.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe forgo a side of rice in favour of the chicken biryani, served in its own cast-iron pot. Take off the lid and breathe in the hot waves of cardamom and the sweetness of caramelised onions in among each spice-dusted long grain. Lubricate it with a little of the snowy garlic yoghurt with which it arrives. Or scoop it away with a crisp-crusted naan filled with pickled chillies and stringy cheese, which feels like the sort of thing you might order after a long session down the pub, when boozy appetite is fully in charge, rather than before. That one item shows a particular determination to feed. The sense is very much of a kitchen which, given the price point, is putting its back into the cooking rather more than might be expected.View image in fullscreen‘Sweet, creamy’: baked berry doi.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDesserts are sweet, creamy things. Sliced orbs of syrupy gulab jamun, for example, come on a splodge of rabdi, made by simmering sugar-rich milk with cardamom and saffron until it thickens. It’s topped with almonds and pistachios, and serves as a great defence against the miserable, thrashing weather outside. The Great Indian might be a slightly grandstanding name for this newcomer, but it sits comfortably alongside places like the Tamil Prince, only a few miles away, which have helped redefine what the gastropub might be. Doubtless, some locals will feel they’ve lost an old boozer. They should think, instead, of having gained a great Indian restaurant.News bitesThis week’s high-profile closure is perhaps less surprising than some. Café Laperouse is an outpost of a Parisian restaurant group which opened here less than two years ago inside the OWO (Old War Office) hotel on London’s Whitehall. Now it is shutting its doors. Despite the high prices – main courses topped out at £58 – it was dogged by a one-out-of-five hygiene rating at opening and less than favourable reviews, including from thiscolumn.In better news, chef Livia Alarcon, who cooked up a storm atQueens Bistroin Liverpool, has been announced as the head chef of the Dog and Collar, a new food pub on the city’s Hope Street. Alarcon, who is currently representing the northwest on BBC2’sGreat British Menu, says she intends to “celebrate British produce in a pub setting, pulling influence and inspiration from the north, my culture and upbringing,” The new pub opens at the end of the month (dogandcollarpub.co.uk).And news of another chef who made his name in Liverpool.

But also, it was 1 August 2024. The bump in 1992 was mine; the baby, who would be born the following day, at 29 weeks’ gestation (“term” is 40 weeks) was my daughter Rosie. The bump in 2024 was hers: 32 years on, history was repeating itself.Like mine, Rosie’s pregnancy had been textbook up to that point. Like me, she’d had no warning that things could suddenly shift to red alert, with the baby in her uterus seemingly failing to thrive. And yet, of course, therewasa warning – because patterns repeat in families. Sometimes, as perhaps in this case, it’s about genetics; other times it’s about something less tangible, a kind of inexplicable déjà vu. An illness that echoes something similar in a previous generation; a heartbreak that’s reminiscent of a heartbreak in another moment; a decision that seems to weirdly mirror a similar choice made decades before. And yet these “coincidences” take us unawares. Perhaps we can’t compute that the traumas of the previous generations will recur.But they do. Pre-eclampsia meant Rosie was plucked out of my womb much too soon: my husband, Gary, and I spent two months sitting anxiously by an incubator at St Thomas’ hospital in London. And yet, more than three decades on when I heard the wonderful news that Rosie was pregnant, it never entered my head that a similar experience might be in store for her and her partner, Toby. They live in Amsterdam; the baby was due on 22 September last year. As we live in the UK, I booked an apartment round the corner from theirs for six weeks from that date. “The baby will probably be late,” I said to Rosie. “Most babies are.”Just as I had back in 1992, Rosie was planning a home birth – easier to organise in Holland, where they account for around one in three births (as compared with one in 50 in the UK). Just as Gary and I had been, she and Toby were hoping they’d be able to move to somewhere bigger than their flat after the baby arrived; just as we had, they were planning to meet other couples at antenatal classes expecting a baby around the same time as them. It was all back to the future for me: this would be our first grandchild and everything Rosie said about her life and her hopes, their plans and ambitions, echoed ours when we were expecting her. I reminisced happily about everything to do with having a baby but, somehow, I erased the trauma of my own first-born’s actual arrival. So, although Rosie talked to her caregivers about the circumstances of her own birth, we didn’t dwell on them; in fact, we hardly spoke about them at all.I reminisced happily about having a baby but somehow erased the trauma of my first-born’s arrivalEverything changed when, at 32 weeks, Rosie went for a routine scan. When she called me, I was driving down the A3 en route to a meeting. I answered the phone on the car speaker; within seconds I was tumbling back three decades. I knew instantly the shock, the fear, the total disbelief Rosie was feeling. I pulled off the road and into the first car park I saw. Rosie, so upset she couldn’t speak, had handed the phone to Toby; he began telling me a story I already knew. They were on their way to hospital, where more tests would be done. Although she had no signs of pre-eclampsia, the scan had shown the baby was tiny, much smaller than expected for the gestation.“It’s going to be OK,” Rosie kept saying. She was, of course, her own role model. She had survived; her baby would survive. I believed that too, but also, I knew what lay ahead. Suddenly I remembered all too well the long weeks of hoping and waiting. Weeks when the entire backdrop to life was a series of beeping machines with alarms that would go off inexplicably, living a twilight existence in a part of the hospital most new parents never see, neonatal intensive care.It is physically exhausting and emotionally draining, because at the centre of it all is a new person, impossibly tiny, smaller than any baby you’ve ever seen or held before. In Rosie’s own case, she was so small and early that, at that time, there were no promises she would even survive. She was born around 12 hours after my routine antenatal appointment, by section, weighing 2lb 15oz. Ventilated for a fortnight, she failed to breathe on her own when she was first disconnected from the machine, and had to be back on it for another eight days. Even when we eventually brought her home, aged two months, at around the day when she should have been born, there were more difficulties in store: I was terrified of suddenly having sole responsibility for this minuscule infant. She only weighed 4lb at discharge.On the day Rosie told me she was at risk of giving birth prematurely, these memories all came flooding back. More than anything, I wanted to protect Rosie and Toby, and this as-yet-unborn child, from the experiences I knew lay ahead. But I knew I couldn’t. Even when life is on repeat, the scenes have to be played out; there’s no fast-forwarding over the difficult bits.Rosie stayed in hospital from the day she was admitted; the plan was to keep her baby inside until 34 weeks, when there would be the best chance of survival. Tests showed a continuing failure to thrive; as in my case with her, there was no option but to accelerate the birth by doing a caesarean. When the day came, she and Toby had at least been in hospital for a fortnight, and not just a few hours. There had been time to talk everything through, to plan for the first few hours and the first few days; to see the neonatal unit, to learn about the machines and the medics who would be caring for both them and their newborn.Their little boy, Sol, arrived at 11.30am on a sunny morning (hence his name). When Rosie was born, I didn’t get to see her for the first 48 hours – all I knew was that somewhere in the hospital was a baby who was pink, because that’s what the doctor had told me (hence her name). But I saw my grandson within an hour of his arrival: being invited to be at the Amsterdam hospital for the delivery was one of the greatest privileges of my life. For Rosie and Toby, miraculously – or so it seemed to me – there would be no separation from their baby, which I’d found one of the hardest parts of Rosie’s birth. He was cared for in an incubator alongside Rosie’s bed and Toby was able to stay in the room. They were a unit from day one. When I insisted on running out to buy champagne, I was celebrating not only that the baby was here and alive, but that my daughter and son-in-law and grandson seemed in a much better place than Gary and Rosie and I had been 32 years ago.Born at 34 weeks, Sol was bigger than Rosie – 3lb 5oz – and she had been able to take steroids before his birth, to help mature his lungs. For all of this, my heart was singing: it was déjà vu, but the re-run was a lot better than the original. Everything was going well and we were over the worst.This time she was the pale-looking mother who couldn’t take her eyes off the tiny baby in the incubatorTwo mornings later I was woken at 7am by a call from Rosie. The baby’s condition had worsened significantly overnight; he had been blue-lighted across the city at 2am to the hospital for the sickest babies, with Rosie and Toby following in a second ambulance. The doctors at the new hospital weren’t sure what the problem was: all we could do was wait and hope.Wait and hope. I was back to where I’d been; and Rosie was back to where she’d been. Only this time she was the pale-looking mother who couldn’t take her eyes off the tiny baby in the incubator who was trying to stay alive.They were tense, long days – the sort of days it’s hard to see beyond. But slowly, Sol rallied, and then grew stronger. Today he’s six months old – a plump, chuckling, diamond of a boy – and you’d never know what he’d been through. But, like Rosie, who believes, as I do, that the circumstances of her arrival shaped the person she became, his earliest experiences will always be a part of him. And while Rosie already knew about her early birth and was her son’s role model for survival, his early months have also taught her – retrospectively – about her own beginnings.Patterns so often repeat in families and even if they tend not to forewarn us for the future, they do teach us about the past. In the end, however painful it has been, we are all the richer for the experience. Most importantly, Rosie and Toby have their Sol, just as Gary and I have our Rosie. And that is one example of history repeating itself for which we will be forever grateful.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingPsychologyPregnancyFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Recently, I had to isolatefor health reasons and(as was the case during the lockdowns), being apart revealed the relief and peace I felt without her presence. My mum was sympathetic about my illness, but she made out it affected her more than it did me, my partner and child.Since childhood, I’ve been her emotional carer, hoping she might one day support me. Therapy helped me see I need boundaries, but attempts to set them were met with resistance, manipulation or dismissal. Her struggles with mental health and past trauma are undeniable, but they’ve left me feeling burdened, unsupported and resentful. I love her, yet I feel trapped in cycles of guilt and anger. Time apart has again clarified that my ideal of a mother-daughter relationship may never align with reality.Reconnecting with her fills me with dread.Now my treatment is over, I face a decision. I don’t want to resume a triggering relationship or assume future caregiving, but permanent estrangement feels equally shameful. My mum deserves clarity on my boundaries, but guilt and fear weigh on me. I don’t want to undo my progress or compromise my health, yet leaving her behind feels devastating. How do I proceed without feeling selfish?Philippa’s answerWhatever treatment you have been undergoing sounds serious and it seems you have had to put yourself first before seeing to whatever it is that your mother wants from you. Treating yourself as a priority is something of a novelty for you – and for her. You will both have to get used to it.Having to isolate brought you relief. I think this fact is profound. It shows me that you feel it’s impossible to prevent your mother manipulating you into subjugating your own needs to serve hers.When parental relationships fall short of fulfilling our own emotional needs, they can leave us feeling at fault, burdened by guilt and a sense of obligation. You felt emboldened by therapy to put down some boundaries, but they were hard to keep. It is as though you are enmeshed with your mother. It’s like you and her are a system. Being free of that system brought you relief.Two things I can think of may be happening. One, called “ressentiment”, the other “projective identification”. If it’s ressentiment it would mean that your mother suffers from unresolved, unwanted feelings of, say, resentment, fear, envy. Instead of facing up to and resolving these emotions, she may be suppressing them and redirecting blame outwards, often towards you, who – to her – seems “better off”. If that’s happening, it’s a guilt trip. You’ve obviously gone through a scary time with your health, but still your mother clings to being the victim in this situation.If it’s projective identification, it would mean your mother disowns intolerable parts of herself and projects them on to you and then treats you as though you have those parts. Then, unconsciously, you could be identifying with that projection and acting it out. If this was the case, it could explain why you feel so much better when you are not with her. So maybe that guilt, anger, fear or selfishness that you feel isn’t yours, it’s hers; she could be treating you as if you’ve got it, which compounds it. Whether either of these unconscious processes are happening (or a mashup of both), they will rob you of vitality, which will not be good for your health. Your health must be your priority.Treating yourself as a priority is something of a novelty for you – and for herBy being firm with your boundaries to allow you peace, you are not so much abandoning your mother as refusing to abandon yourself. Let go of the idealised version of your relationship with her. This will not be an act of cruelty but an act of liberation. Don’t be tied by the cycle of giving more than you can, only to feel depleted and unworthy when your own need for acknowledgment or support goes unmet. Boundaries may benefit her, too, because you would be creating the possibility for her to develop healthier coping strategies. Whether she does or not is beyond your control.You may feel grief about the possibility of estrangement, but grief is not the same as guilt. You would be mourning the loss of what might have been. This isn’t selfishness; it’s creating space for freedom and authenticity. Guilt is not necessarily an indicator of wrongdoing. Often, it is the residue of internalised expectations you no longer need to meet.Choose the version of you that you met in isolation. The version who feels better unmeshed from your mother. And by doing so, you are creating a legacy of love and strength for your child, a gift far greater than any inherited guilt.The Book You Want Everyone You Love To Read (and Maybe a Few That You Don’t) by Philippa Perry is now out in paperback.

This time, a couple of less-than-perfect aubergines and a paper bag of tomatoes were turned into a thoroughly satisfying stew, the aubergines fried separately, then added to a turmeric and cumin-scented sauce. The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a last-minute stirring-in of yoghurt and spoonful of crème fraîche brought a silky, almost luxurious note to my fridge-find. A shot of lime at the end made our supper sing.The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a stirring-in of yoghurt added a silky noteWhen I think about it, there is almost always an aubergine or two in the fridge. Like butternut squash, I buy them without having a plan. They are as much a part of a culinary squirrel-store as having a jar of beans and a packet of pasta in the cupboard. Their relatively long life means I can keep them for emergency suppers, those dinners I make when I have had neither the time nor the inclination to shop.The only ingredients I bought that day was a bunch of coriander and several garnet stalks of rhubarb. The latter catch was irresistible. A dozen glowing stalks complete with their (sadly inedible) lemon-yellow leaves. I carried them home like a bunch of gladioli, then cut them into short lengths and drizzled them with honey and cooked them under a hot grill with a very fine dusting of cinnamon.On the side, to bring the gift of a change of texture, I fried some cake crumbs in a little butter and sugar and scattered them over the soft stalks and their puddle of ruby red juice. I used brioche, but there is also a plastic box of cake crumbs in the freezer from a day I was testing cake recipes and froze the less-than-successful bakes, crumbled, with just this purpose in mind.Aubergines with tomato and yoghurtOnce the aubergine is soft and the dish is almost ready, I recommend lowering the heat, even turning it off, before you stir in the yoghurt – the sauce is less likely to curdle. Warm flatbreads or rice would be good here, although I often eat the dish this as you might a stew, with no accompanying carbs.Serves 5. Ready in 75 minutesaubergines2, large (about 650g)onions2, mediumvegetable or groundnut oilginger60g piecegarlic3 plump clovescoriander20g, freshdried chilli flakes½ to 1 tspcumin seeds1 tspground turmeric2 tsptomatoes400glimes2yoghurt4 heaped tbspcrème fraîche4 tbspCut the aubergines in half from stem to base, then in half again, and then into thick pieces about 2cm long. Put the aubergine in a colander over a deep plate (or in the sink) and sprinkle with salt.Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tbsp of oil in a deep saucepan and stir in the onions, letting them cook over a low to moderate heat with the occasional stir.Peel the ginger, then grate it finely (use the fine side of a grater or, should you have one, a special ginger grater). The result should be a soft paste. Stir this into the onions. Peel the garlic, then very finely slice each clove and add to the onions. Let the mixture cook until the onions are soft and pale gold in colour – a total cooking time of about 20 minutes.Remove the leaves from the coriander and set aside somewhere cool. Finely chop the stalks and add to the pan, with the dried chilli, cumin seeds and turmeric and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.Roughly chop the tomatoes and add, along with 400ml of water, and then bring to the boil.Warm 6 tbsp of oil in a large shallow pan. Tip in enough of the aubergines that will sit comfortably in a single layer and let them soften and lightly brown. As they colour, remove them with kitchen tongs or a draining spoon and drop them into the sauce. Then continue with another batch of aubergines. When they are all lightly browned and stirred into the pan of sauce, partially cover with a lid and adjust the heat, so the sauce simmers gently. Leave to cook for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.Chop the coriander leaves and squeeze the limes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the yoghurt, lime juice, coriander leaves and, lastly, the crème fraîche.Rhubarb, honey and sweet crumbsView image in fullscreen‘I suggest brioche for the crisp element’: rhubarb, honey and sweet crumbs.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverI suggest brioche for the crisp element, the textural contrast to silky stalks of rhubarb.

Reduce the brioche to crumbs, either with a food processor or a coarse hand grater. Toss the crumbs and caster sugar together, then scatter in a single layer in a grill pan. Watching carefully, let the crumbs cook under the grill for a couple of minutes until the sugar starts to caramelise.Transfer the warm rhubarb and its juices into bowls, then scatter the toasted crumbs over the surface.

With handfuls of tokens, they will purchase persimmons, pomegranates, Asian pears, purple potatoes, kale and more from the farmers who grew them – then embark on a tasting journey, featuring new and familiar spices.The first-graders are visiting the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market – a Bay Area institution that draws more than 100 farmers to San Francisco’s waterfront three days a week – with 22 of their classmates from Lincoln elementary. That morning, the children had ridden the subway from their school in Oakland’s Chinatown into the city with parent chaperones and their teacher, Kitty Chen.View image in fullscreenLincoln elementary students visit the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco, California, on 10 December 2024.Photograph: Felix Uribe Jr/GuardianChen has taken previous classes on this field trip, and she’s thrilled to be doing it again. She knows that at this age, her students are prone to becoming picky eaters – but what is cooked at home and what they try at school can change that. The hope is that after this field trip, when the cafeteria serves up an unfamiliar veggie or they’re offered a new fruit, the students might be a little more willing to take a bite.The trip is sponsored by Foodwise Kids, a nutrition and wellness program for elementary school students in the San Francisco Bay Area coordinated by the 30-year-old non-profit Foodwise. Since the program’s launch in 2012, it’s brought more than 20,000 local students out to the farmers’ market to learn about the food system. It’s focused primarily on schools with a high percentage of students of color or kids eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, and education director Tiffany Chung says the aim is to get “students excited about eating fruits and vegetables” in the hopes that “they’ll incorporate them into their daily life and eventually lead to longer-term healthy eating options”.View image in fullscreenAn activity during a farmers’ market trip.View image in fullscreenFoodwise Kids has brought more than 20,000 students to farmers’ markets to learn about the food system.When Chen’s class of first graders descend on the Ferry Plaza market in December, bundled in jackets and toting backpacks featuring Chinese and American cartoon characters, they are divided into three small groups – which the students later nickname the Strawberry-Raspberries, the Cherries and theCaliforniaColumbines. At folding tables, they introduce themselves to Foodwise’s staff and volunteers, and name their favorite fruits and vegetables. Chung jumps in for a moment to speak Mandarin with one student who doesn’t feel comfortable speaking English – she notes that many of the program’s volunteers are bilingual, usually in Spanish, to support the city’s diverse youth.While the majority of the classmates in her group prefer peaches, Temnit Desta says her favorite fruit is lemons. “She likes sour,” her mom, Tehesh Hadush, explains. Although Temnit was born in California, her family is from Ethiopia and she has grown up eating lots of spicy foods.View image in fullscreenTemnit Desta listens to instructions at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market.In their small groups, the Lincoln elementary schoolers take off with $12 of market tokens to spend. The first stop is farmer Bill Crepps’ booth. The owner of Everything under the Sun has been making the hour drive to the Ferry Plaza market from his farm in Winters, California, for more than 27 years. Seeing the kids – whom, he notes, prefer kale and broccoli in the winter, but can sometimes be talked into trying arugula – “makes this market more than just a market”, he says.Crepps has been coming to the market almost since its founding. In 1993, just a few years after the Loma Prieta earthquake devastated the highway running along San Francisco’s coast, community groups began discussing ways to connect downtown with the waterfront – and settled on a farmers’ market. Another aim was to educate urban dwellers about California’s farmland and sustainable agriculture while providing access to healthy, fresh produce. To this day, the market prioritizes urban families – not only by acceptingSnap, previously known as food stamps, but by matching every dollar spent so families can double their Snap spending up to $15.View image in fullscreenLincoln elementary students visit Bill Crepps’ produce booth.After they’ve filled a basket with produce – so much that the six-year-olds are carrying the basket in teams of two – the small groups take off for a quick tour of the Ferry Building. When they return, Chung and other volunteers lead the groups in a game guessing which season different crops grow in. As they play, youth education manager Marcelo Clark starts chopping and roasting different trays of the produce – washing raspberries, flavoring cauliflower with jerk spice and roasting potatoes with cumin. He aims to use a mix of spices the children may have already tried at home – and others that might be new to them.“A lot of our students are newer to America, and may not speak English,” says Chung, but at the market “they’re able to see produce that is familiar to them”. “They’re able to point out: ‘I know this. This is cilantro. I have this on tacos.’ Or: ‘I eat bok choy. I’ve seen that before.’”View image in fullscreenTiffany Chung, director of education at Foodwise, listens to Lincoln elementary students.When the food has been prepared, Clark carries trays of fruit and both raw and roasted veggies out to the class. The students dive into the purple potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts, kale and cauliflower – but are more hesitant to try hummus and raw broccoli. Although her classmates and their parents exclaim at the fresh persimmon, Temnit is wary of the unfamiliar fruit.“Today is all about trying new things and giving things a chance,” Chung reminds the class, gently encouraging them to try just the smallest bite of everything.View image in fullscreenTrays of fruit for students to try during a Foodwise activity.“When students are unfamiliar with a fruit and vegetable, there is a lot of hesitation. We try to create this safe space where we’re telling them: ‘It’s OK if you don’t like it. The whole point is just to try it,’” she says later, explaining that sometimes she’ll challenge students to join “the One-Bite Club” or to watch their peers when a classmate is enjoying a food. “Just making it a really fun experience and gamifying it” works really well, she says.By the end of the class, Temnit will be asking for more persimmon, and one of her classmates will be racing around trying to finish everyone’s leftover pomegranate seeds.Explore more on these topicsNutritionOur unequal earthChildrenFoodUS educationCaliforniaSan FranciscoFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Supplies of lifesaving medication and children’s food in many countries have screeched to a halt.The US government was giving more than $350m (£282m) to Malawi annually, according to theUS Department of State, equivalent to more than 13% of the African country’s 2024-25 budget.More than half of healthcare spending in Malawi comesfrom foreign donors. Since 2003, the US has put more than $2.1bn (£1.7bn) into fighting HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. Between 2019 and 2023, foreign donations accounted for 11% of the education budget and 80% of spending on capital projects such as schools and classrooms,according to Unicef. USAid accounted for a quarter of this.US foreign aid chart“Developed countries like the US know and appreciate thatMalawiis one country that has invested heavily in efforts to eradicate poverty, disease and other socioeconomic ills,” said Malawi’s information minister, Moses Kunkuyu. “But, being a repetitive victim of natural disasters and global economic woes, it is clear that Malawi still needs a hand.”Immediate impacts include funding for HIV prevention medication being stopped, while university students on US bursaries have been told to find alternative sources of support.“Malawi is already experiencing some devastating consequences,” said Pemphero Mphamba, a health economics researcher at Kamuzu University of Health Sciences in Blantyre.She said the economy’s dire state could worsen, pointing to high inflation, which has been above 23% since June 2022 because of repeated currency devaluations amid foreign exchange shortages. “USAid was another source of forex,” Mphamba said.Last year, GDP per capita in Malawi was just $481, according to the International Monetary Fund and the already weak economy has been battered by repeated climate shocks. Cyclone Freddykilled 679 people and displaced 659,000in March 2023. Then, last year, Malawi was hit by theworst drought in southern Africa for a century.The World Bank estimatedlast monththat for the past three years the economy has been growing slower than the population, which is now estimated to be more than 21 million.The prospects for landlocked Malawi to export its way out of aid dependency look slim. It is dominated by subsistence agriculture and exported just $900m (£725m) of goods in 2022, according to theWorld Bank’s most recent data. Of those goods, 40% were tobacco.While growing numbers of tourists have been flocking to the country for its abundant wildlife, soaring mountains and the golden beaches of Lake Malawi, they have not plugged a foreign exchange gap that has led to repeated shortages of fuel and other imports.“As a country, we have been relying on one source of revenue collection for the longest time and that’s tobacco,” said Victor Chipofya, a political science lecturer at Blantyre International University. “So how does a country sustain itself with a product that globally everybody is campaigning against?”He estimated several thousand people were working for NGOs and projects funded by USAid: “These were middle-class employed people, and obviously they were spending and they were able to pay taxes, and as a country we would be able to benefit from that … and now these people are unemployed.”The sudden withdrawal of support could mean the reversal of some of the aid-related gains Malawi has made, said Yvonne Mhango,Africaeconomist at Bloomberg.The end of aid dependency was not in sight either, she said: “I don’t think that will happen for a generation … It’s not like it’s got a vibrant stock exchange or debt market or foreign direct investment coming in in a big way, because they don’t have a consumer market.”There were valid criticisms of aid for not catalysing sustainable, long-term growth, said Christopher Vandome, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank. “But the immediate reality is that government spending and so many of the government’s social provisions are dependent upon that donor support.”Additional reporting by Charles Pensulo in LilongweExplore more on these topicsMalawiAfricaDonald TrumpAidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Soon it became clear: the Bidwell mansion, a pink 26-room Victorian building dating to 1865 and one of the oldest buildings in the region, was on fire.Flames were consuming the three-story structure nestled along the school’s north-eastern boundary. Just after 4am, as firefighters attempted to extinguish the fire, the top floor began to crumble.The home had once belonged to John Bidwell, the founder of Chico, and his wife, Annie. In its heyday, it had hosted 19th-century luminaries such as Susan B Anthony, President Rutherford B Hayes, Gen William T Sherman and John Muir. Over the decades, it had become a symbol for the city of 100,000 at the northern edge of the Sacramento valley.The fire prompted a public outpouring of grief. Residents gathered for a candlelight vigil near the charred building. Officials mourned what they described as the “heart of the community” and “the iconic structure of Chico”. The area’s representative, Doug LaMalfa, penned a tribute to the “cherished landmark” where thousands of students had learned history, and the “pioneering spirit” of the couple that had helped shape California, he wrote.But for some, the building served as a reminder of the painful history of colonization and genocide in the region and the forced displacement of the Mechoopda, who worked as laborers for the Bidwells and upon whose land the mansion had been built.View image in fullscreenThe Bidwell mansion in Chico, California, before the fire.Photograph: John Elk III/AlamyIn the 1960s, a law stripped the Mechoopda of federal recognition, and the tribe lost their 26-acre rancheria. By the time the tribe’s federal status was restored nearly three decades later, all that remained was a parcel and a cemetery, said Ali Meders-Knight, a traditional ecological-knowledge practitioner and the executive director of the California Open Lands non-profit.“We had a cemetery and they had a mansion,” she said.The fire sparked difficult conversations about the legacy of the Bidwells. Meders-Knight, a Mechoopdatribal member, and others in the community sought to push back against the prevailing narrative about the couple and their treatment of the Mechoopda. Others argued the Bidwells were now being portrayed unfairly. The loss has exposed a deep faultline over how the history of the community should be understood and, perhaps, set off a reckoning almost two centuries in the making.Tributes to John Bidwell and his wife, Annie, are all around Chico. Their portrait sits on the side of a downtown building. A local coffee shop, school and pizza shop are named for the couple. Annie is particularly beloved for donating thousands of acres to the city that would become Bidwell Park – one of the largest city parks in the US.Bidwell, who went on to serve in Congress and ran for president, was long viewed as a pioneer hero and visionary, said Michael Magliari, a history professor at Chico State University and a co-author of John Bidwell and California: The Life and Writings of a Pioneer, 1841-1900.“He was looked at as a very heroic figure, a classic American hero of the American west,” said Magliari, who is also a member of the Bidwell Mansion Association. “It was a very traditional kind of gung-ho view of the American past, how the west was won.”Bidwell migrated to California in 1841 at age 22 after organizing and helping lead the first overland pioneer wagon crossing from the US. Upon his arrival in the Chico region in 1847, he quickly formed a relationship with the Mechoopda, a band of Maidu people who lived a few miles south of what is today the city’s downtown, and had what the tribe says “appears to have been recognized as a marriage” with an Indigenous woman named Nuppani.By the 1850s, through the purchase of Mexican land grants, he had acquired more than 30,000 acres of land that were home to the Mechoopda. His ties with the tribe are now seen as complex.View image in fullscreenJohn A Bidwell.Photograph: US National Archives and Records AdministrationThe Mechoopda became Bidwell’s resident workforce on Rancho del Arroyo Chico, the tribe states on itswebsite. Those who worked for Bidwell were granted homes, work that “paid the same rate as non-Indian workers” and some protection from hostile vigilantes, the tribe has said.“The rancho also became a refuge for individuals escaping government sponsored removals of Native people from Butte County,” the tribe website states.Indigenous people in California in the era were subjected to state-sanctioned violence and forced removals. California’s first governor in 1851 pledged that a “war of extermination” would continue “until the Indian race becomes extinct”. Gavin Newsom in 2019 apologized for the genocide against Indigenous people that killed as many as 16,000 people in the state.In 1863, following aspate of violencein the area, white settlers in the county ordered the expulsion of all Indigenous people. Those who didn’t leave were to be shot on sight, Magliari said. Bidwell argued against such actions, and when compromise failed heaskedfor Mechoopda workers on his land to be spared. After his request was rejected, he told them to hide and eventually called in a cavalry unit to protect them. In what is called California’strail of tears,the US army forcibly removed nearly 500 other Indigenous people from their lands and marched them more than 100 miles to a reservation – many died or were too sick to complete the journey and little more than half arrived.But, the tribe’s website states, some viewed the relationship with Bidwell in less favorable terms: “The Bidwells prospered with the help of Native labor and the scene resembled that of a plantation to some.”In 1860, Bidwell founded the city of Chico, and the role of the Mechoopda in the workforce meant that unlike tribes in other parts of the state, they had a place in the city. They worked on the Bidwell mansion, which was built with the most modern plumbing and gas lighting of the era, but were moved from their village behind the residence to an area that is now several blocks away.They remained in that area for nearly a century until the federal government stripped them of their recognition and sold much of their land to the university.The Mechoopda tribe declined to comment for this story.Magliari argued that although Bidwell had his shortcomings, there were episodes that set him apart from his contemporaries.While in Congress, he voted in favor of legislation to guarantee equality and freedom for formerly enslaved people in the south, Magliari said. Bidwell insisted on fair treatment for Chinese immigrants and Indigenous people and may have been one of the only white men in Gold Rush California who seriously advocated for some voting rights for Indigenous people, Magliari said.But he also privately advocated against a treaty that would have established a reservation for the Mechoopda and other Maidu people east of Chico and likely cost him workers – even though he had signed it, local historian Michele Shoverfound.In Meders-Knight’s view, he capitalized on his access to the land and power over his Mechoopda workforce to further his own ambitions, while destroying their way of life. “He did not want us to have sovereignty,” she said. “We needed to be his ranch hands.”“He would smile in their face, have children with them, knowing the whole time that he always had the upper hand,” she added.View image in fullscreenWomen and children of the Mechoopda tribe of Maidu people.Photograph: California State University, Chico, library/AlamyReportshave persisted for years that Bidwell fathered children with Indigenous women. The Bidwell Mansion Association has publishedaccountsabout his Indigenous descendants, although Magliari said there is no documented evidence of this and that his political opponents would have been eager to use that against him.Following the fire, a negative narrative of Bidwell emerged online, Magliari said, depicting him as an enslaver, and in the same light as John Sutter or Stonewall Jackson.“It’s kind of like we’re caught in between two cartoon versions, two warring cartoon versions of Bidwell that really reflect what’s going on on a larger scale with American history generally,” he said. “Right now, we’re going through another really divisive time in America, and our politics are really acrimonious. Everything’s extremely polarized, and our history, our understanding history, is reflected by that.“Bidwell, locally, is caught in the middle of that,” Magliari said.For many Indigenous people, Bidwell cannot be separated from the genocidal colonial project of which he was a part. His control over the tribe has created a legacy that persists today in how local officials and residents have interacted with the Mechoopda, Meders-Knight argues.After regaining their federal recognition, the Mechoopda encountered fierce pushback from residents and officials when they sought to develop housing in the region, Meders-Knight said, and faced a lawsuit that derailed a planned casino for decades: “That’s why they go into the city hall and tell us where we can live. That is exactly what was modeled under John Bidwell.”But people prefer a story about Bidwell’s legacy that validates the existence of the city of Chico, she said.They need to believe the land was taken legitimately by John Bidwell and it was done correctly, she said. The thinking is that “there’s no harm and what happened to the natives was a shame, but he did the lesser evil because he wasn’t actually out there cutting throats”, she said. “He didn’t do the dirty work – he benefited from it, we benefit from it, but the story has to say that we’re good guys.”John Bidwell died in 1900. Annie passed away in 1918. Shortly after, the property was acquired by Chico State Teachers College and served as a dormitory for students for a decade. It remained in university hands until the state parks system took ownership of it in 1964.Late last year, the Bidwell mansion was in the middle of a $2.3mrestoration projectthat would see the building receive fresh exterior paint and a new roof.Then came the fire.In the days and weeks that followed, residents were anxious for answers about what had happened. In acity that has been at oddsabout how to address homelessness for years, people quickly turned their anger to unhoused people as early reports indicated the fire could have been the result of a “warming fire”. Less than a week later, however, investigators revealed they had determined the fire was an act of arson.In early January, officials announced they had charged 30-year-old Kevin Carlson with allegedly using an incendiary device to start the fire inside the mansion. He allegedly visited the property the day before and was seen on video using cash to purchase a gas can and lighter in a nearby town, officials said. The district attorney suggested he may have had a political motive as he followed a social media channel with “communist and Marxist ideologies” and an “anti-colonialism bent”. His family described his ideology as “far left”, and said it had caused a rift in their relationship, the district attorney said.Carlson pleaded no contest to the charge this week, and will be sentenced next month. He faces a sentence of up to 11 years in prison.Meanwhile, it’s unclear what’s ahead for the mansion. The local newspaper, the Chico Enterprise-Record, has come out in support of rebuilding, with the publication’s editordeclaring: “Our collective spirit will settle for nothing less.” A local bank donated $50,000 to a fund to rebuild or memorialize the building.State parks officials are waiting for authorities to complete their criminal investigation and release the site before sending in engineers to determine the structural viability of what’s left.The agency will work with the Mechoopda as well as the city and university on what’s next, and expects a long road ahead, said Aaron Wright, a public safety chief and spokesperson with state parks.“Figuring out the future of the mansion is going to take some time,” Wright said.Much of the site remains – the visitors’ center, architect’s house and carriage house were not damaged. If the mansion cannot be rebuilt, Magliari anticipates a number of possibilities from a reconstruction to a Mechoopda cultural center or museum, or perhaps the return of the land to the tribe. In 2022,Chico State University returned 93 acres of land to the tribein the first such agreement in the state.Meders-Knight hopes the community will choose another route besides rebuilding the mansion – and she wants to see people have difficult conversations about the region’s past.“We don’t have the time or resources to build empty mansions,” she said. “We have to re-evaluate who we are and how we work together. We should do that if that’s the hard work we need to do rather than do all the hard work to rebuild an empty mansion.”When she first learned what had happened to the mansion, Meders-Knight, who is also a basket weaver, thought of the Mechoopda baskets that had likely been destroyed. The tribe traditionally burns people’s possessions after death and she felt comforted by the idea.“They were finally being burned and going home to the ancestors,” she said. “They were getting their things back that were being held at the mansion. Now they are free.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaNative AmericansRaceIndigenous peoplesWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the school’s longtime videographer, Talankin was instructed by his superiors to document the implementation of the Kremlin’s new directive: shaping a generation steeped in ultra-nationalist views and ready to soon join the ranks of the army fighting inUkraine.Fiercely against the war, Talankin instead set out to capture and showcase to the world an unfiltered, insider’s view of how Putin’s war on Ukraine was shaping the lives of Russia’s children. “I immediately knew this had to be preserved for the historical record. I quickly realised this material can’t be lost,” Talankin told theObserver.The recordings would turn intoMrNobody Against Putin, a thrilling documentary that premiered last month at theSundance film festival, where it won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award.The idea for the film emerged in the early days of the war, when Talankin began reaching out to independent outlets, offering them his footage. Eventually his story reached David Borenstein, a US filmmaker who co-directed the project alongside Talankin.View image in fullscreenCo-director David Borenstein.Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Rex/Shutterstock for Sundance Film FestivalUnder the cover of following orders to meet the school’s propaganda quota, Talankin proceeded to take on a secret and extremely risky mission to document Putin’s information war at home. In a country where all independent journalism has been banned, Talankin said he had an unparalleled front-row seat to history. “Any journalist trying to film what was going on in schools would be immediately jailed. I was put in this unique situation,” he said.“The Russian ministry of education would send extremely detailed orders that certain lessons had to be filmed, and I would go and film.”In the documentary, Talankin shows how children are ordered to march with the Russian flag,read freshly printed ­history booksthat defend Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and compete in grenade-throwing tournaments.War veterans, often former convicts from the ­notorious Wagner paramilitary group,visit schools to preach “patriotic values”to the children. Since the war began, Moscow has beenspending millions of roublesto mould a new generation willing to give their lives in military service. Russian analysts have described the ideological indoctrination of teens as one of the areas where the Russian state comes closest to being totalitarian.“Schools are one of the main places where they spread propaganda,” said Talankin. “Fascism can take root in the simplest ways – starting in schools, with children,” he added.Shedding light on the campaign to transform Russian schools into instruments of militarisation, Putin himself declared last year: “Wars are won not by commanders but by schoolteachers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He captures teachers navigating the complexities of their roles – some fully embracing the country’s fervent pro-war sentiment, others ­quietly resisting. Among the former is Abdulmanov, a history teacher and staunch Putin supporter, who openly admires some of Stalin’s most infamous henchmen.Others, however, struggle with their new roles as propagandists, confiding in Talankin their unease with the school’s shift in direction. “Many teachers don’t want to do this, but they’re trapped,” Talankin said.“People study to become teachers and dream of educating children, then find themselves forced to spread propaganda.”In Karabash, jobs are scarce, Talankin said, and for many – especially older teachers – uprooting their lives wasn’t an option. In the end, much of what happens in the classroom feels like staged roleplay for the cameras, with both teachers and students reading from prepared notes, reciting the answers the state expects.“A Potemkin village,” Talankin remarks.Yet, he warns, the effects of militarisation are real and tangible: “For younger children, everything their teacher says is taken as truth. The long-term impact of the military propaganda will be felt.”Older students are often more ­sceptical, Talankin said, but he witnessed first-hand the power of propaganda on those around him. A few of his former classmates and friends decided to sign military contracts and fight in Ukraine – some coming home in coffins.By the summer of 2024, Talankin felt the walls closing in. A police car lingered outside his home, and his anti-war views were becoming increasingly visible in Karabash just as Russia was tightening its grip on dissent with a wave of draconian laws. Without telling anyone – not even his mother – he fled Russia in June 2024, carrying with him seven hard drives of footage.Mr Nobody Against Putin review – a teacher fights back in a powerful documentaryRead moreSince the release of his documentary, reactions in Karabash have been mixed. “Just yesterday, I got a message of support from someone back home. But before that, I received a lot of threats, long voicemails calling me a scumbag, a traitor to the Motherland,” he said.Still, he hopes that many people in his home town and his native country will be able to watch the film. “I want as many people in Russia to see this as possible – not just in Karabash, but everywhere.

It celebrated the fact that Kurti has succeeded where his predecessors had failed, in tightening the control of the Albanian-majority government over a rebellious Serb area on its northern border.That sense of hard-won territorial integrity appears increasingly vulnerable however. While Kurti did not mentionDonald Trumpby name, his presence hung over the rally on the freezing Pristina night.‘We’ve proved that change is possible’ – but Serbia protesters unsure of next moveRead moreWhile every national capital has been watching the words and actions of anever more mercurial US presidentsince his return to the White House, Kosovo has more at stake than most. The last Trump administration backed a plan which at some point involved Kosovo’s partition, and one of his officials has already begun assailing Kurti on social media.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Vetëvendosje (Self-determination) party wave Albanian national flags during the party’s closing election campaign rally in Pristina on Friday.Photograph: Armend Nimani/AFP/Getty ImagesThe nation of 1.6 million people declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after a US-led Nato force helped it prevail in a liberation war. But 17 years on, it is still not a UN or EU member state as a result of the refusal of Serbia, Russia, China and some European states to recognise its independence.Kosovo’s ethnically Serb minority is variously estimated as 4% to 8% of the population, and many remain loyal to Belgrade rather than Pristina. Its most significant stronghold is in the north side of the town of Mitrovica near the Serbian border, which was a no-go area for the government until the past two years in which Kurti succeeded in deploying Kosovo police, shutting down parallel institutions, and enforcing the use of theeuro over the Serbian dinar.Kurti’s critics inside and outside Kosovo say these gains in sovereignty have been imposed on the Serb minority, rather than being a result of winning it over, leaving the frozen conflict unresolved. In particular, the prime minister has been rebuked by the EU and successive administrations in Washington for his refusal to implement an autonomy package for majority Serb municipalities.mapKurti’s party, Vetëvendosje, won an absolute majority four years ago on a programme that combined social democracy, anti-corruption and fierce Albanian patriotism. The name means “self-determination”, and Friday night’s rally was awash with bright red Albanian flags, dotted with a small handful of Kosovo’s national flag. That emblem, which hangs outside Kurti’s office in Pristina, is a compromise, portraying Kosovo’s geographical outline and some white stars on a blue background, shorn of historical and ethnic overtones.The Albanian flag is, Kurti said, “something of a long tradition that continues”.Speaking to the Guardian on Saturday, the prime minister said he had every reason to believe that Kosovo-US relations would remain as strong as ever.“We have enhanced our cooperation with the US during our tenure. It used to be mainly diplomatic, and we have added defence and development,” Kurti said.However, Richard Grenell, who was special envoy forSerbiaand Kosovo in the first Trump administration, tweeted on Friday that Kurti’s optimism on where he stood with Washington was “delusional”.“Relations have never been lower,” said Grenell, who a few days earlier had said Kurti’s government was “not trustworthy”.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Democratic party of Kosovo attend the closing electoral rally, in Pristina on Saturday.Photograph: Valdrin Xhemaj/ReutersIn the first Trump administration, Grenell pushed a peace plan that would have involved Kosovo’s ceding northern Mitrovica as part of a land swap deal. Grenell also served for a while as acting director of national intelligence four years ago, but his title this time round is “presidential envoy for special missions”. It is not clear whether the Balkans will be one of those missions.Perilous years lie aheadWashington is not Kurti’s only geopolitical headache however. His premiership has also been marked by friction with the EU, which imposed punitive measures on Kosovo for his alleged recalcitrance. The measures inhibiting new European funding have cost Kosovo €150m, according toone estimate by the Reuters news agency. They date back to 2023 when Kurti installed ethnic Albanian mayors in Mitrovica and other Serb municipalities, triggering Serb riots, in which nearly 100 Nato peacekeepers were wounded.Kurti and many analysts argue it was unfair to punish Kosovo and not Serbia, despite evidence that the riots were encouraged by the Serbian government of Aleksandar Vučić.Vučić also escaped US and EU censure for his refusal to sign a 2023 agreement on moves Kosovo and Serbia were to take towards normalising their relations, and failing to fulfil his undertaking not to oppose Kosovo’s membership of international organisations.Kurti has said he will not consider a law on Serb municipal authority or rejoin talks with Belgrade until Serbia takes steps to remedy its obstructive actions. The main opposition parties standing on Sunday say they will be more flexible and will re-enter normalisation talks without preconditions.“I would like to see Kosovo go back to the table with the EU and United States,” said Haki Abazi, who was once Kurti’s deputy prime minister but has recently joined one of the smaller opposition parties, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo.“If Kurti remains in power, I think what we’re going to see is the US basically acting swiftly against him by pulling out its troops from Camp Bondsteel [Nato peacekeeping headquarters in Kosovo] and also imposing sanctions to the point where Kurti is going to be blacklisted.”Unemployment has been radically reduced under the current government, which has raised the minimum wage and achieved economic growth above the regional average. But unease is growing over the the lack of progress towards normalisation of diplomatic relations, and so are fears about the country’s vulnerability.Ramadan Ilazi, head of research at the Kosovar Centre for Security Studies, argues that Kosovo would be in a stronger position now if it had passed the Association of Serb-majority Municipalities (ASM) law.“If we are concerned about potential plans for partitioning Kosovo, especially fears now amplified under a Trump administration, then establishing ASM would have been a way to prevent any kind of other solutions about the North,” Ilazi said.Kurti said he did not think Vučić would dare try to re-establish control over northern Kosovo by force, unless put under pressure from Moscow to act.“Vučić is not a leader who would go to war with Nato,” the prime minister said on Saturday. “However, one thing that we should be wary about is if he gets an order from Putin. Will he say no? I don’t think so.”Opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s election suggested that Kurti’s Vetëvendosje would fall short of its resounding majority four years ago, though historically polling in Kosovo has not proved particularly reliable. If he does fall short, the prime minister said on Saturday he was not interested in a coalition with any of the major opposition parties. But those parties too have a history of bitter rivalry, and would also face significant obstacles to forming a stable coalition.Whatever the election outcome, said Alex Anderson, a British-born Kosovo citizen and political analyst, the coming months and years are going to be some of the most perilous for the country since independence.“We could well see a lot of very dangerous things happen for Kosovo over the next few years, maybe even including the withdrawal of Americans from Camp Bondsteel,” Anderson said. “That would leave Kosovo feeling very vulnerable.”Explore more on these topicsKosovoThe ObserverSerbiaEuropeUS foreign policyDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In business, she goes by Holistic Hilda. She said she does not have health insurance.“We are looking to pills and prescriptions, programs and physicians for good health, when actually it can be found through much simpler ancestral health ways.”Culturally a world away from Washington, Amy Fewell spoke from her homestead, Refuge of Liberty. A mother of three expecting a fourth, she lives in rural Virginia, home-schools her children and runs Homesteaders of America.“Most of our family hasn’t seen a doctor in over a decade, because we just don’t have to – we’re healthy people,” said Fewell. To her, the most concerning thing about the confirmation hearing was Kennedy distancing himself from anti-vaccine views.“One of the things that I feel like the libertarian Christian moms are concerned about is hearing Robert F Kennedy say, ‘Well, if the science shows that vaccines are safe, then, yes, we should be fine with it.’ Just because the science says it’s OK – I still want the option to say no to it … We just don’t believe that’s God’s design for our life.”Kennedy has long held support among naturopaths, the supplement industry, homesteaders and theChristian back-to-the-landmovement – many of whom distrust not only vaccines but modern medicine.“This is our shot,” Karen Howard said she kept thinking about Kennedy’s nomination. She is executive director of the Organic and Natural Health Association, a trade group for the “nutraceuticals” and supplement industry. The group endorsed Kennedy in late January.“No administration has ever publicly supported what we do – ever,” said Howard. She said she “never” envisioned an administration like Trump’s putting up a nominee friendly to her businesses, and that she feels being “neither” Republican nor Democrat “benefits the work I do”.Labrada Gore, Fewell and Howard illustrate a potent new mix of wellness and conservatism – people who have adopted the alternative lifestyles once associated with the left, politically support the right, and advocate for a mix of the unobjectionable and potentially harmful.“It used to be seen as the whole hippie, left-leaning movement from the 60s, which is funny, because homesteading doesn’t have anything to do with politics – until it does,” Fewell said.Howard also recognized that “we definitely are on the fringe on this” in endorsing Kennedy. “We are not mainstream even amongst our own peer organizations.”Influencers such Labrada Gore push for less screen time, more exercise, and fewer chemicals, dyes and preservatives in the food supply. Other favored causes are implacably resistant to evidence of potential harm – such asunregulated supplements,raw milkandvaccine refusal.Like agrowing minorityof Republicans – about 20%, according to Gallup – Labrada Gore now believes vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent.“They’re more dangerous,” she said, acknowledging this is a “spicy” perspective – theoverwhelming majorityof Americans still support childhood vaccinations.Her theory is that vaccines go “directly into your bloodstream” and “giving it an easy path to bypass the body’s defenses”. She then espoused what many researchers regard as a fraught misunderstanding of the danger of measles, a disease rarely encountered now by Americans. Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but has since made a resurgence amid vaccine hesitancy.“Some diseases like measles – they are kind of natural rites of passage, I would say, for children to develop naturally. It’s like a hurdle, and when they do they are stronger afterward,” said Labrada Gore.Today, the CDC estimates measles kills between1-2 peopleper1,000sickened – though mortalityvaries by country. That is higher than historical rates, which are generally considered an underestimation. By contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO)estimates the riskof adverse reaction from the measles vaccine at about one in a million. It is widely accepted that measles vaccines have saved millions of lives globally.According to alarge systematic review, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) is not associated with brain swelling, autism spectrum disorders, “cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections”.Notably, many of Kennedy’s supporters aren’t fazed by conflicts and suggestions that left Democrats aghast. For example, Kennedy trademarked Maha for use in the supplement industry. Howard said she was “a bit surprised” but that “from a business perspective, it certainly makes sense”.Orn his suggestions that he might cut Medicaid, Labrada Gore said: “I don’t know many people on Medicaid, so I don’t really have a reference point.”If Kennedy is confirmed to lead HHS – an agency with a$1.8tn budgetand a remit across health health insurance, biomedical research and the investigation and containment of infectious disease outbreaks – it would take place in spite of fevered opposition.“My perspective is, and I happen to be a Christian in the south … It is my duty to get vaccinated because I should be helping those who can’t help themselves – those with compromised immune systems or who don’t have the resources to get vaccinated,” said Kristin Matthews, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Herrecent reportdocumented bills to limit vaccine access supported by state Republicans.“You can’t be a good Christian and then want to skip out on all vaccines for no reason – if you have as medical reason I completely support it.”Public health researchers,cliniciansandeven his own cousinshave worked to stop the nomination. Their sentiments are summed up by a statement by consumer advocate and Public Citizen co-president Rob Weissman: “There is not one senator who believes Robert F Kennedy is qualified to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and no senator should vote for his confirmation.”The confirmation may also come amid thenoted silenceof some of Washington’s most powerful groups, such as the American Medical Association andPhRMA. In 2024, pharmaceutical companies and their trade groups spent$293m lobbying Congress– more than any industryby a long shot.Few Republican doubters remain. Those that do, such aspolio survivorand Kentucky senator Mitch McConnell, may not do enough to stop Kennedy’s confirmation.Olga Irwin, a 57-year-old Aids patient and activist from Youngstown, Ohio, also attended Kennedy’s hearing. Irwin, who uses a wheelchair, has lived with HIV for 25 years. Like most people, she has spent little time dwelling on her own demise.That changed last week, after she attended Kennedy’s confirmation hearing.She fears the nominee’s history of HIV-denialism and suggestions of cutting Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the low-income that she and 79 million other Americans rely on. Without it, her prescriptions would cost roughly $7,000 per month.She called her husband after the hearing and said: “‘Sam, I’m gonna fucking die.’ Not because I’m not taking my meds – I’m not going to have access to them. I’m picturing my death.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Aga Khan said: “It is not an Islamic belief that spiritual life should be totally excluded from our more material everyday activities.” Or, as he told Vanity Fair magazine: “We have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil, it’s how you use it … if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual, you have a moral responsibility to society.” His personal wealth may have topped £13bn and he was probably richer than the British royal family.View image in fullscreenThe Aga Khan speaking in the early 1960s.Photograph: Reporters Associes/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesAn international businessman and philanthropist, “smiling, welcoming, with a receding hairline and slightly overweight figure”, according to the former Guardian journalistHella Pick, who came to know him well, the Aga Khan was a familiar and revered figure to members of the sect scattered in minority communities not only in the Indian subcontinent and Africa, but also in Europe and Canada.They donated tithes of their earnings to him, his foundation and development network and in return his organisation has provided hospitals, clinics, schools and scholarships to their communities.On a trip toAfricawith him to visit the Ismaili community in Kenya in the early 1980s, Pick witnessed the reverence with which he was held: “I felt that between the Aga Khan and his followers there was an extra element. I noticed during the Kenya trip that any cup from which he drank and even the jeep he drove during a safari instantly became treasured museum pieces, probably never to be used again.”View image in fullscreenThe Aga Khan with his horse, Shergar, at the 1981 Derby. The horse was kidnapped two years later.Photograph: taken from picture libraryDespite the distinguished lineage, the dynasty traces back in its modern form to the expulsion of the then imam from Persia (now Iran) in 1837. Settling inIndiahe became an enthusiastic supporter of the Raj as a spokesman for the Muslim community and was granted tax free status by the British and the title Aga Khan, which means Ruler.On the fourth Aga Khan’s accession in 1957Queen Elizabeth IIformally granted him the style of His Highness, “in view of his succession to the imamate and his position as spiritual head of the Ismaili community, many members of which reside in Her Majesty’s territories”. He remained close to the British royal family and was appointed KBE in 2004.Non-Muslims knew him better for what appeared to be a jet set lifestyle: a former Olympic skier, owner of fast racing yachts, a familiar figure at Ascot and other racecourses where his horses, not least the ill-fatedShergar– kidnapped by an armed gang thought to be the Provisional IRA from a stud farm in County Kildare in 1983 and never seen again – won major races.View image in fullscreenThe Aga Khan on his wedding day to Sally Croker Poole in Paris, 1969.Photograph: PAT/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesProbably the most famous horse in the world at the time, Shergar had won both the English and Irish Derbies and five of the seven races he had run before being put to stud, but the Aga Khan refused to pay the £2m ransom demanded. Another of his horses, Harzand, subsequently also won both Derbies and a third, Zarkava, won the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. He was fascinated by the science of horse breeding but never betted.Prince Karim was born in Genthod,Switzerland, the son of Joan Yarde-Buller, daughter of the British peer Lord Churston, and Prince Aly Khan, an international playboy and son of the third Aga Khan. According to Pick, who was commissioned to write his biography, it was a lonely childhood for the boy and his younger brother, Amyn, shuffled between homes in Paris, Deauville and Gstaad in the charge of an English nanny by parents whom they rarely saw. They spent the war in a dilapidated family house in Nairobi.Both of the boys were sent to an exclusive boarding school, Le Rosey in Switzerland, which at least provided some stability as their parents divorced in 1949: their father went on to marry the Hollywood film starRita Hayworthand their mother the newspaper proprietor Viscount Camrose. Aly Khan was killed in a Paris car crash in 1960.Karim was studying engineering at Harvard when his grandfather, the third Aga Khan, died in 1957 and unprecedentedly settled the succession on him rather than his father, laying down in his will that, in the fundamentally altered conditions of the world in the atomic age, he was convinced that the community “should be led by a young man who could bring a new outlook on life to the office of Islam”. Karim toured the Ismaili communities around the world before returning to Harvard to finish his studies in oriental history, receiving a BA degree two days after setting up a development fund for Muslim students at the university.The Aga Khan took all his responsibilities to his co-religionists seriously, as Pick observed during theKenyatrip: “Certainly for most of the days and also large chunks of the night, I watched a workaholic beavering away at his desk … there were meetings on hospital projects and other planned developments in Kenya. There were other meetings about the major hospital and medical centre being built in Karachi and on and on with still more projects.” Her planned biography was eventually vetoed, she thought, by conservative Ismaili leaders who believed the Aga Khan had opened himself up too much to an outsider.The range of the Aga Khan’s business interests, run from his headquarters in Switzerland, encompassed diamonds and marble, tyres and saucepans, real estate and mines and top of the range hotels including the Costa Smeralda beach resort in Sardinia and the Serena hotel in Kabul.View image in fullscreenThe Aga Khan, the owner of Harzand, with Queen Elizabeth II at the Derby in 2016.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockPhilanthropic initiatives funded through theAga Khan Development Networkincluded medical facilities in rural areas, higher education scholarships, a rural support programme to improve living conditions in the African bush and a hydro-electric power network in Uganda.TheIsmaili Centrein Kensington, London, was set up in 1983 and the 700-year-oldDjinguereber mosquein Timbuktu was restored, all part of his attempt to reconcile Islam and the Judeo-Christian world. “I see it as a clash of ignorance rather than a clash of civilisations,” he told theSunday Telegraphin 2005. “There is a remarkable degree of ignorance … I am talking about human society and civilisation. It’s not a religious issue.”The Aga Khan was married twice, first in 1969 to the English model Sarah (Sally) Croker Poole, who took the title Princess Salimah. The couple had three children, Zahra, Rahim – who now succeeds as the 50th imam – and Husain, but the marriage was dissolved in 1995. He married, secondly, in 1998, Gabriele Leiningen, a German lawyer and former pop singer, with whom he had a son, Aly. That marriage ended acrimoniously in 2004 with protracted divorce proceedings in British and French courts.The Aga Khan latterly lived in Lisbon, which has an Ismaili community, and was granted Portuguese citizenship.His children survive him.Prince Karim, Aga Khan IV, spiritual leader and philanthropist,born 13 December 1936; died 4 February 2025Explore more on these topicsReligionHorse racingIslamKenyaAfricaIndiaIranobituariesShareReuse this content"

Now he’s turned his focus closer to home. He opens up  about his adventurous childhood and what animals have taught him about living wellSun 9 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareGordon Buchanan is what’s called a super- recogniser. That means the 52-year-old wildlife presenter and cameraman from Scotland has a near-unfathomable recall of faces he has seen only fleetingly. In tests at the University of Greenwich, he has memorised thousands of humans after only having looked at them once. Buchanan also scored well on chimp faces, but drew a blank with pugs. “What I learned from that particular study is that pugs reallydoall look the same,” he notes drily.For the most part this isn’t an especially useful – or monetisable – skill. The day before we meet, he was walking down Byres Road in Glasgow’s West End with his wife, Wendy, when he noticed two people who looked familiar. “That’s the couple who are in the Airbnb,” he told Wendy, referring to the property they rent out at the back of their house. Buchanan had never met them; he was just going by the thumbnail photograph that was on the woman’s profile. Wendy knows well enough by now not to question his random spots, but Buchanan scrolled through his phone to prove his point. “Definitely her!” he said.But Buchanan has started to appreciate that being a super-recogniser does have benefits for his day job. For years, he was one of the world’s top natural history cameramen, shooting sequences for thePlanet EarthandFrozen Planetseries. Then in the 2000s, at first reluctantly, now without the arm-twisting, he moved to the other side of the camera, too. Buchanan was a natural: with his silver-fox looks, gentle Scottish bonhomie and deep knowledge of the subject, he has become something of an all-action Attenborough (a description he would hate).View image in fullscreenSilver fox: Gordon Buchanan meets an Arctic wolf on Ellesmere Island in Canada.Photograph: Partick EvansBuchanan has carved a reputation for being preternaturally calm and fearless, especially on his …&Mefilms for the BBC. In one particularly memorable scene from 2012, he sat alone in a Plexiglas box in Svalbard for 40 minutes while it was thoroughly worked over by a 1,000kg polar bear, all the while providing upbeat chat. In another tense sequence, he sat on the ground on Ellesmere Island in Canada – no box this time – while a pack of Arctic wolves circled him, scarcely a metre away.For Buchanan, in these moments, eye contact, noticing the tiniest details and forming a connection with the animals can, quite literally, be life-or-death crucial. He began to really appreciate this in Botswana, where he has spent a decent chunk of the past two years following lions, leopards and cheetahs in the Okavango Delta for the BBC seriesBig Cats 24/7.“When I first arrived, I thought the people I was working with had this supernatural ability to find these lions,” he says, over a bowl of bisque at a seafood restaurant in Glasgow. “But now I know what the system is. You tune into that whole environment. And if you hear a little baboon bark half a mile away, it’s like, ‘OK, well, why is that baboon barking?’ Then you’ll find a set of lion tracks and half an hour later, you’ll find the lion. If anyone observed that and you didn’t explain the process, they’d be like, ‘Why did you suddenly just go from going north to going west, and then you found it?’ And it’s like, ‘Well, the baboon told me it was here.’ It’s not rocket science.“People are generally oblivious to what’s going on around them,” Buchanan goes on. “I’ve always been hyper-vigilant, if you like. It feels like a bit of a superpower, this ability just to see the world a little bit more vividly than other people. For everything to be interconnected.”Buchanan has acouple of theories about why he is like he is, both going back to his childhood. He’s been reflecting on that period a lot of late, mainly because he was working on his memoir, which is out now and is calledIn The Hide: How the Natural World Saved My Life. When he started writing it, he – and probably his publishers – imagined the book as a grand adventure story, full of tales of derring-do: “Biggles but better,” says Buchanan, a nod to the fictional, archetypally British thrill seeker from the WE Johns stories. But Buchanan is a thoughtful soul, perhaps thanks to all those weeks spent crouching in the wilderness waiting for, say, a Gobi bear to reveal itself. And the result is a much more engrossing, and surprising, read because of it.View image in fullscreenUp close: Gordon Buchanan inside the ‘Ice Cube’ in Svalbard, 2012.Photograph: Jason Roberts“Personally, I find those types of memoirs boring,” he says. “I want to learn something that I don’t know.”Buchanan was born in Dumbarton, not far from Glasgow, the third of four children. His father was a mechanic, who then moved into running pubs and hotels; his mother worked, for a time, at an engineering company that made submarines. His parents separated when Buchanan was young and he moved with his mother and siblings to Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides. His upbringing there was pretty lawless: he and his brothers all had air rifles – without their mother’s knowledge – and would shoot at each other with impunity. When he was a teenager, Buchanan bought a motorbike for £10: it didn’t have brakes or a clutch, and half the casing for the engine was missing, so you had to change gears manually, but it did go 75mph on Mull’s forestry tracks. His mum never knew about the motorbike, either.This brings us to the first of Buchanan’s explanations for why he notices details others don’t: he was bored out of his mind for most of childhood. “Growing up in a rural community, you had to make your own fun,” he recalls. “And the funniest things are observing things your friends hadn’t: ‘I’m going to say that thing or point that thing out before anyone else does.’ It was all humour-based.”Mull is a haven for wildlife: dolphins and whales pass by the coast, while white-tailed eagles soar above. “People often say, ‘So you were really into nature?’ And I’ll be like, ‘Was I?’” he says, smiling. “I wouldn’t have said so at the time.I wasn’t walking about with a little almanac and a species list. I just loved being outside, whether that was on a rope swing or climbing trees for fun. I was never: ‘Let’s go out and look for a porpoise.’ They were just, kind of, there.”At this stage of the book – and our interview – he presents very much as the Buchanan you might recognise off the telly. The same ebullient chap who has to cajole two irascible camels across the Gobi desert (as he did in last Christmas’sMy Epic Camel Adventure) or the one who has to master seven over-excited huskies on a trail across Canada’s Yukon (Snow Dogsfrom Christmas 2023). But there’s a darker part to his story and it’s the second reason, he believes, for his “hyper-vigilance”. On Mull, in 1980, when Buchanan was eight, his mother became involved with a charismatic, 21-year-old islander called Alastair. In the early days, Buchanan hero-worshipped Alastair, who was tough and charming and looked like Burt Reynolds, complete with bushy moustache. After a couple of years he became his stepdad.View image in fullscreenHerd mentality: Gordon Buchanan filming in Tsavo National Park, Kenya, 2016.Photograph: Graham MacfarlaneBy then, though, the relationship was beginning to sour. Alastair had a spiteful temper and the rows with Buchanan’s mother were getting out of control: eventually he would smash her over the head with an alarm clock while she slept. The family never spoke about what was happening at the time – and still don’t, really – but Buchanan is convinced that he developed a sensitivity and ability to read people back then that has stayed with him. “I needed to be observant of what the vibe was and try to see these things before they happened,” he says. “And I do put it down to those years.”Buchanan had long-buried that aspect of his childhood, but writingIn The Hideforced him to confront it again. He realised he felt weak, because he couldn’t stand up to Alastair and that sense of impotence had stayed with him. “I thought I was completely unmarked by that experience,” he says. “But then looking back on it, you’re like, ‘Oh God, everything makes sense.’ I’ve probably got – not probably, I definitely have – massive feelings of inadequacy. And a bit of an inferiority complex.”When Buchanan started working as a cameraman, it was these emotions that powered his ascent through a ferociously competitive field. “Thatfeeling of inadequacy has probably driven me a huge way through my career,” he says. “Trying to do something that I’m good at and trying to be better than other people. So I’m thankful for those feelings of inadequacy–as a 52-year-old man, I see it now. I never really took pride in any achievements. Until quite recently, if someone said, ‘What’s your proudest achievement?’, that was the worst question you could ask me. Ask me what my most perverted thought is, that’s easier!”Buchanan’s break,when it came, had a hefty slice of good fortune. Aged 16, he landed a job cleaning dishes at a restaurant in Tobermory, run by an English couple, Ann and Nick Gordon. Nick was a wildlife cameraman and usually away somewhere far-flung (everywhere was exotic back then to Buchanan, who had never left Scotland). Bit by bit, Buchanan took an interest in Gordon’s work and, when he was 17, Gordon invited him to be a dogsbody on his next trip to Sierra Leone.View image in fullscreenFamily matters: with Wendy, Harris and Lola on the Isle of Skye, 2017.Photograph: Gordon BuchananIt was a gruelling assignment, mainly to film the critically endangered western chimpanzees in the Upper Guinean forest belt. Within two days of leaving Scotland, Buchanan had caught dysentery, was vomiting every hour, and had seen a dead body. A few weeks in, he started dreaming of inflicting semi-serious injuries on himself that would require being flown home. But Buchanan stuck it out for 18 months – until a civil war kicked off – and reflects now that it was the “making of me”.What Buchanan mainly learned from Gordon was how all-consuming the job of being a wildlife cameraman is – and also that it can have a catastrophic impact on your relationships (though that lesson would take longer to sink in). But, after an apprenticeship of a few years, Buchanan had seen enough to know it would become his calling. It may seem like a lonely profession, spending months in remote outposts, but he insists he rarely feels that. “You would think doing this job that you’ve got a lot of time in your own head,” he says. “Whereas actually you don’t. Because you’re opening your eyes and your ears and all your senses to what’s in front of you. So it’s escaping from yourself.”The only activity he’s experienced that comes close is transcendental meditation. “It’s a massive holiday from the stress and anxiety and problems you have,” says Buchanan. “That’s why it appeals to me so much.”Buchanan slipped into presenting when he was filming some reclusive leopards in Sri Lanka. Worried that they would not have enough material, the producer suggested that he supply his own commentary to bolster the footage. His laconic delivery worked and he was asked to do more. “For years I wouldn’t call myself a presenter,” says Buchanan. “It was a slightly dirty word. If somebody asked me what I did for a living, I’d say ‘wildlife filmmaker’. Presenter wasn’t how I wanted to be seen.”The emergence of Buchanan, the presenter, coincided with the boom in public interest in natural world films. In 2009 and 2010, he worked pretty well incessantly: onSpringwatchandAutumnwatch; filming black bears in Minnesota and then heading straight to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, where he became the first person to capture the tigers there on film, a moment that reduced him to tears. In the jungle in Papua New Guinea, he unearthed a new species, the Bosavi woolly rat.But the work was taking a toll, certainly at home, where Wendy, who runs a successful television production company, was left to look after their two children, Lola and Harris (who are now 21 and 19). In 2011, Buchanan had a “sort of breakdown, burnout episode”. He also accepted that he suffered from depression – like his father and grandmother before him – and probably had for most of his life.Was that a shock for Wendy? “I think it all probably made sense,” Buchanan replies. “It probably made sense for everyone who knew me.”Buchanan decided then to reduce his workload, reassess his priorities. “Itis an industry that is fraught with marital breakups,” he says. “I’m trying to think of all of the cameramen that I knew of Nick [Gordon]’s generation when I was younger, very few of them are with their wives and partners. And I just hadn’t thought ahead: How do I achieve my career ambitions? But, more importantly, how do I achieve my ambition of actually being a good husband and father?”That balance is much better now, Buchanan thinks. And he manages his mental health with daily workouts: gym one day, swimming the next. “It’s 70% wanting to be healthy for now and for the future, and 30% pure vanity,” he accepts. Buchanan started to go grey at the temples in his 20s – his father had turned fully grey at the same age – and freaked out a little. In the event, he didn’t turn fully silver until his 40s, and he quite likes it now. A few years ago, he found himself putting on weight, but he has kept it in check with a regimen of exercise, cold showers and cutting back on the nightly cans of BrewDog.“I realised that I’d stopped looking in the mirror,” says Buchanan. “And one night I stood in front of the mirror, with boxer shorts on, and I just looked like someone’s dad. It was like, ‘Fuck that! I love being someone’s dad, but I don’t want tolooklike one.’ So I checked myself.”Our lunch is long finished and we head out into Glasgow’s late afternoon. As I’m about to jump in a cab, Buchanan tells me I can check in with him if I have any factual queries. But then he stops and looks a little rueful. “You know we were talking about vanity and I said I’m 30% vain?” he says. “It’s actually 40%.”In The Hide: How The Natural World Saved My Life by Gordon Buchanan is published by Witness Books at £22.

He would share the results of behavioural analysis (who asks questions? Who helps others? Who clarifies problems?) with those with whom he was working.Peter helped with the Video Arts series of training programmes on management skills in the 1980s,featuring people such as John Cleese. He also wrote regular columns for magazines such as Training Journal, as well as many books.Born in Oxford, Peter was the son of Margaret (nee Hinton) andJohn Honey; when he was 13 the family moved to the Isle of Man. His father was bursar at King William’s college in Castletown, where Peter also went to school. He studied psychology at Hull and Oxford, and did his national service in Singapore, where he met Carol Lewis, the daughter of an army chaplain. They married in 1964.The year before, Peter had joined the Ford Motor Company. From there he moved to BOAC, becoming a freelance behavioural psychologist in 1969. We met in the late 70s when he was consulting at ICL, where I was head of management development.Later, in another job, we designed the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles Questionnaire, which was accompanied by a book, The Manual of Learning Styles (1982). These are still used around the world, in several languages. Peter oversaw the expansion of a successful wider business from this, Peter Honey Publications, publishing 40 books on workplace and behaviour.A superb speaker at conferences, Peter never allowed audiences to relax under the spell of his oratory, but jolted them awake by the questions he asked them.

Here, he explains how he learned to manage his fearsEmma BeddingtonSun 9 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 05.31 ESTShareKey work events make me anxious. They give me chest pain, a churning stomach and disrupted sleep; my thoughts run through all the mistakes I could make and replay every bad experience in my past. Why put myself through this, I reason, which inevitably means that when, say, a high-stakes meeting is on the horizon, those feelings are worse, more intense, more prolonged. It’s a vicious cycle and one I admit early on when interviewing the anxiety expert Owen O’Kane.O’Kane doesn’t seem surprised and why should he be? I bet everyone tells him about their anxiety. My dread, avoidance and catastrophising interior monologue are bog-standard these days:researchby the Mental Health Foundation in 2023 found that 60% of UK adults reported experiencing “anxiety that interfered with their daily lives in the past two weeks”. We’re anxious about global geopolitics, the climate and the cost of living; our health, jobs, relationships and what strangers think of us. It takeschildren out of schooland adults out of work. It’s an uneasy background thrum everywhere, something I have assumed to be a product of our ill-adapted, threat-seeking brains being constantly confronted with every terrible thing in the world through the shiny rectangles clutched in our sweaty hands (US psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt recently characterised a whole demographic of smartphone natives as“the anxious generation”).So the title of O’Kane’s latest book,Addicted to Anxiety, and the question it poses (“Have you ever considered you might be addicted to anxiety?”) feel sort of confronting. Is O’Kane saying our anxiety is our own fault? He doesn’t look like a provocateur when he logs on to Zoom – his sweet dog is slumbering in the corner and there’s collage art reading “Love is the answer” on the wall behind him – so I wonder, did he have any, well, anxiety, about how it would be received? “I really agonised about the book and the title,” he says. “Then when I started to write it, I said, no, I believe whole-heartedly this is the book I want to write.” He’s aware it might sound tough. “Did I want people to stop and think and did I want them to catch their breath for a moment? Yes, 100%. Because I don’t think there’s enough of that. There are so many false promises about healing your anxiety forever, never worry again… There’s so much bullshit out there; I just think I don’t want to be part of that.”There are so many false promises about healing your anxiety forever, never worry again…  I don’t want to be part of thatOwen O’KaneO’Kane has seen enough anxiety to know we need something better than the “bullshit”. In his career as an NHS lead psychotherapist, he saw soaring levels of anxiety both in practice and reported in his reading. (“It was really clear that the research was telling us more and more people are anxious, younger population groups, older population groups and everything in between.”) He also observed it in his personal life. “With family members, with people I meet in the street, talking about their kids struggling, or their husband…”His “aha” moment in terms of framing anxiety as an addiction came when he was running a small NHS anxiety group, which was making promising progress. He told the group that he noticed everyone seemed to be doing well, “I fed back the changes and noticed there was this deadly silence in the room. Then someone joked: ‘That’s made me a bit frightened that you said that.’” Another man, a former drug addict, jumped in. “He said: ‘Bloody hell, I thought it was hard to give up the drugs. But this is bloody addictive.’ The minute he said that, everyone in the group laughed, so they got it. And the thing was, I also got it. I thought, this is the one thing we don’t talk about enough. We talk about the ways you think, what happens in the body when you’re anxious, we talk about the process, but we never really think about thatattachmentto anxiety.”O’Kane is at painsto stress that anxiety in itself is not bad: throughout the book, he describes the importance of treating the “anxious self” with compassion and gratitude. “It’s an important part of our humanity,” he says, and welcoming it rather than pushing it away creates a sense of ease and understanding; it’s just doing its job, after all. “Anxiety is designed to protect us and keep us safe. Without that mechanism, we would get into all sorts of bother,” he says.In his own life, growing up in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, anxiety was “about survival”, he explains. “To let your guard down or not be cautious or not be watching out for the next problem did lead to actual and real danger.” But for him, and for anyone inclined to or wired for high levels of anxiety, it’s easy to end up with “a mechanism that will just keep playing out threat, threat, threat”.So we’re all anxious beings and circumstances or susceptibilities make us more so, but what makes anxiety addictive? “It’s not an official diagnosis,” O’Kane acknowledges in the book. “There are no 12-step programmes for anxiety addiction.” But anxiety does have a lot in common with mainstream addictions which, he says, “come with a promise: I will make you feel better; I will stay with you; I will get you out of this situation; I will take away your pain.” The mechanisms of anxiety, he argues, make similarly big promises. “I will protect you; I will keep you safe; I will stop bad things from happening. So, who wouldn’t want that? Who wouldn’t think that’s a really good thing to stay attached to?”There’s a sort of magical thinking involved: we believe our anxiety is essential to keep us safe, so we get hooked on the feelings, sensations and thoughts – the altered state, actually – it creates in us. Anxious people don’t “wake up each day thinking ‘I need my anxiety hit,’” he writes, but they do “attach to their anxiety as if it’s a safety blanket.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The ObserverIt’s odd to think of what anxiety provokes in the body and the mind – unpleasant physical symptoms, irrational thoughts, self-sabotaging behaviours – as comforting, addictive coping mechanisms, but that’s what they are, O’Kane suggests. They offer short-term relief from threat. “I can guarantee nothing will go wrong if you avoid that dinner party; I can promise you that you won’t feel rejected if you don’t apply for that other job. Those promises are alluring. But, of course, the problem is, the more hooked and attached you become, then the bigger the anxiety becomes and you get caught in this almost circular loop.”So how do you break that cycle? The book provides a step-by-step guide, helping sufferers to acknowledge and accept their anxious selves, offering DIY techniques for deactivating their physical symptoms, accepting the emotions they are experiencing and detaching from anxious thoughts. Perhaps the most muscular part of the process is tackling what O’Kane calls the “rascals” – the behavioural strategies that offer short-term relief, but actually strengthen your anxiety longer term. These might include making excuses not to confront or do things that make you anxious, getting angry, impatient or argumentative, using substances to dull your anxious feelings, resorting to compulsive behaviours and rituals or constantly seeking reassurance from others.Why do they need a firm hand? “I guess the robustness is because your anxious self needs to know that you’re in charge. Anxiety is a really powerful mechanism. It’s a life-saving mechanism, so it’s not weak. Negotiating with it has to be equally strong.” This is where the language of addiction is most helpful, O’Kane says, “because most habits are addictive”.The parallels with addiction and recovery break down for O’Kane around the notion of powerlessness. The whole book – subtitledHow to Break the Habit– is about precisely how much power we have over anxiety. “It’s about breakthroughs,” as O’Kane puts it. He has reservations about the notion of powerlessness in mainstream addiction treatment anyway, though he understands people find it useful. But with anxiety, the narrative of powerlessness is particularly unhelpful. “When it comes to this, you’re not.”His own story is proof of that. In addition to spending his formative years in, effectively, a war zone, O’Kane describes in the book and in a very movingTED talkhe gave in 2022, the fear, shame and pain of growing up in Northern Ireland both gay and Catholic and being ferociously bullied and humiliated. In one anecdote in the talk, he describes being called queer and spat on by a group of boys, then instructed by a passer-by to “wipe that off quickly before anyone sees you”. He landed in adulthood, he says, with “primal, hardwired responses to look out for threat even when it’s not there.”Rebuilding a positive, functional relationship with his anxious self came through therapy and his psychotherapy trainingRebuilding a positive, functional relationship with his anxious self came through therapy and his psychotherapy training; he maintains it with “healthy choices”. O’Kane says he’s “unapologetic” about his wellbeing now: he eats well, maintains good sleep hygiene, plays the piano, walks his dog, exercises and meditates daily, a practice he describes as “a safety check”. He regularly reminds himself: “Whatever is going on in my life, I’m not that thought, I’m not that emotional state, I’m not my ego, I’m not the fear.”Recovery, he says, is also about “not over-attaching to my story”. That’s apparent when I say I found some of those anecdotes very sad. “I see them differently,” he says. “I just try and see it as, OK, that was my experience and my story… then I had to salvage what I could from that.” His experiences deeply inform his practice, of course, and his special interest in anxiety; he returns often to the phrase “walking the walk” to describe that.O’Kane didn’t need to include his story at all. He’s a highly respected professional and a bestselling author with a public profile; on the book cover Davina McCall calls him “A force for good”, and Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi, who has Tourette Syndrome and suffers from anxiety, a “Huge help”. But, he writes, he didn’t want to be the “Big Man”, in Northern Irish parlance; the lofty expert. Why was that important? “It’s a big ask, to ask people to explore their own humanity and to make changes in their life,” he says. “If I’m not willing to give some of me in that, I shouldn’t be doing the job.”I find his writing generous, wise and very persuasive, particularly his description of anxiety as an “intolerance of uncertainty”: he identifies it as a compulsion to control; a focus on past and future to the detriment of the now. But – and it’s probably the rascally part of me asserting itself – I occasionally found myself thinking as I read, isn’t anxiety an appropriate response to the state of the world and a mark of caring about it? If we’re not desperately anxious about everything around us all the time, won’t that stop us from taking action? “The climate is what it is,” O’Kane writes at one point, but does it have to be?“I never advocate avoidance,” he says. “The book isn’t, ‘It’s all lovely, let’s pretend it’s not happening’; it’s about, ‘We work with what is.’” It would be “sociopathic” he says, not to be distressed by, for example, the recent LA fires, “but it would be equally unhealthy if I spend every moment of my day worrying about that – then I miss so many other parts of life.” Nice as it would be to see anxiety as reflective of selfless concern for the world, in his experience, he believes, “For somebody who struggles with anxiety, it’s never driven by altruism; it’s driven by almost an obsession to try and control what’s happening.”For somebody who struggles with anxiety, it’s driven by almost an obsession to try and control what’s happeningThere’s a danger, too, he says of trying to “justify a highly anxious existence based on the state of the world. If the world’s chaotic and we’re operating from an internal chaotic state, two negatives don’t make a positive.” The aim, rather, is to work on creating what he calls “a steady inner platform” to manage whatever the external world throws at us.In service of that,Addicted to Anxietyincludes a list of “lifestyle stabilisers” including the likes of “get enough sleep” and “try to work in environments you enjoy (there is always choice if you explore it carefully).” This is self-evidently sensible advice, but is it always accessible to everyone? I know anxious insomniacs who would love to get enough sleep and work is about economic necessity above fulfilment for most of us.O’Kane’s list is evidence-based, he counters; science shows this stuff makes a difference. When it comes to work, “I believe there are choices out there for every single person,” he says. “I meet people who say, ‘I really hate what I do’ and they languish and they stay in it, and I say, ‘I have to be that voice for you: if you’re prepared to stay in that situation at the cost of your wellbeing and health, that’s a choice you’re making.’” In jobs he’s hated, he says, “I’ve always made the decision, even though it hasn’t always been comfortable or practical to move and do something different. I’ve done it because I thought, I’m not compromising. I guess with a lot of these things, when you work in palliative care for 10 years…”This, I think, is really the inarguable core of his writing: O’Kane has the urgent perspective of someone who has seen, again and again, that life really is too short: “Way too short to play these games with ourselves.” He’s helped 20-year-olds with months to live make decisions about how they want to spend their final days, which gives him a powerful certainty that there’s always a choice. That’s really the message of this book – we don’t have to remain in thrall to anxiety; we have choices. “So much of this is about getting out of your own way.”Addicted to Anxiety by Owen O’Kane is published by Penguin at £18.99.

Tippetts’s pictures have now become a monograph that captures a pivotal moment in the history of that ever-changing part of London, when second-generation Bangladeshis were starting to assert their cultural identity, and to feel fully at home.In this image, the photographer recalls, “young Bangladeshi women, known as ‘sakhis’, friends of the bride, had gathered outside her home on a council estate in Tower Hamlets”. The women were preparing to shower other guests from the balcony with yellow and red flower petals and sweets during the Gaye Holud ceremony, a pre-wedding tradition. Though embracing the customs of their parents, Tippetts notes, the young people he met, including these young women, were at that time balancing that heritage with “multicultural influences of fashion, music, and youth subcultures that were flourishing in the city at the time”.Banglatown was christened by Tower Hamlets borough council a few years later – the idea partly being to replicate the tourist appeal of Chinatown, to bring diners to Brick Lane restaurants. Since then the area has undergone another transformation, just as dramatic: gentrification. Some sari shops and halal butchers have been replaced by artisan coffee bars; rents and property prices have risen exponentially, forcing some Bangladeshi residents to move to other parts of the capital. “And yet,” Tippetts suggests, to this day, Banglatown’s cultural legacy endures, the next generation “continuing to carry forward traditions of resilience and creativity”.Wayne Tippetts – Banglatown, London 1991 is published by Café Royal Books (£6.70)Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big picturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mbumba said Nujoma died on Saturday night after being hospitalised in the capital, Windhoek.Among those who paid tribute was King Charles, who said he was “profoundly saddened to learn” of Nujoma’s death.He said Nujoma’s “contribution to history was immense”, adding: “His lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy, overcoming so much adversity on that journey, was truly inspirational.”He was revered in his homeland as the charismatic father of the nation who steered his country to democracy and stability after long colonial rule by Germany and a bitter war of independence from SouthAfrica.He was the last of a generation of African leaders who led their countries out of colonial or white minority rule that included South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda and Mozambique’s Samora Machel.View image in fullscreenSouth African president FW de Klerk delivers a speech in Windhoek, where he handed over Namibia to Namibian president Sam Nujoma, seated left, during an independence ceremony on 21 March 1990.Photograph: John Parkin/APMany Namibians credited Nujoma’s leadership for the process of national healing and reconciliation after the deep divisions caused by the independence war and South Africa’s policies of dividing the country into ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and healthcare for each race.Even his political opponents praised Nujoma – who was branded a Marxist and accused of ruthless suppression of dissent while in exile – for establishing a democratic constitution and involving white businessmen and politicians in government after independence.Despite his pragmatism and nation-building at home, Nujoma often hit foreign headlines for his fierce anti-western rhetoric. He claimed Aids was a human-made biological weapon and also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays “idiots” and branding homosexuality a “foreign and corrupt ideology”.Explore more on these topicsNamibiaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

All have promised to reduce the widespread crime that pushed the country into an unnerving new normal four years ago.The rise in violence across the South American country is linked to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. Many voters have become victims of crime, so their personal and collective losses will be a determining factor in the outcome of the election.Voting is mandatory inEcuador. In the port city of Guayaquil, people lined up under a light rain outside a public university where tens of thousands were expected to cast ballots.“For me, this president is disastrous,” said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting centre with her three teenage children. “Can he change things in four more years? No. He hasn’t done anything.”‘Clear signs of authoritarianism’: Ecuador’s ‘iron fist’ leader seeks re-electionRead moreBarres, who must pay $25 (£20) a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she would vote for González because she believed she could reduce crime and improve the economy.More than 13.7 million people are eligible to vote. To win outright, a candidate needs 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger. If needed, a runoff election would take place on 13 April.Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by thedecision of the then president, Guillermo Lasso, to dissolve the national assemblyand shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of the former president Rafael Correa, had served only short stints as lawmakers before launching their 2023 presidential campaigns.Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. He founded an event-organising company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp, where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the national assembly and chaired its economic development commission.Under his presidency, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. It nevertheless remains far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019.Keila Torres, an architecture student waiting for her turn to vote, said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None of the candidates, she said, would be able to lower crime across Ecuador because of deep-rooted government corruption.“If I could, I wouldn’t be here,” said Torres, who has witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. “Things are not going to change.”Torres added that criminal activity had affected her studies as her neighbourhood’s gang targeted anyone walking the streets after 10pm., which forced her to skip night classes to not miss curfew. She said her family was not forced to pay monthly extortion fees to the gang, but the group had urged neighbours to vote for a specific candidate.“In my area, they left flyers in every house door saying that if they didn’t vote for Luisa, they would have to face the consequences,” Torres said.González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 to 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the national assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa’s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Surrounded by cameras, flanked by billionaire allies and confronted by a barrage of questions about whether he was really prepared to unleash a trade war on the US’s closest neighbors, the president talked tough.By his telling, powerful economies were scrambling to bend to his will. Hours earlier, Mexico had announced a series of measures to shore up its border, prompting the White House to hastily postpone the imposition of 25% tariffs on all its goods;Canadawould announce similar measures, and receive the same reprieve, later that day.Yet, one reporter had the temerity to ask whether Trump had blinked. “There was no blinking,” he shot back, claiming that illegal immigrants and fentanyl were “not going to come fromMexicoany more” as a result of initiatives cobbled together by its government that morning.There was, in fact, some blinking – for the third time in two weeks. Tariffs are a “beautiful” means of reviving the US economy, according to Trump – a central pillar of his Make America Great Again agenda. But when push has come to shove, he has repeatedly pulled back from the brink.What is motivating Trump’s reckless trade war? | Robert ReichRead moreWith Canada and Mexico, an initial pledge to impose tariffs from day one of his new administration shifted, without explanation, to 1 February. When 1 February rolled around, 4 February became the new deadline.Then, with hours to spare, after Canada and Mexico each promised that a big round number of personnel (10,000, give or take) would staff their respective borders with the US, and made some relatively vague commitments to strengthen security, Trump kicked the can down the road for a month.The White Housedidimpose a tariff on all exports to the US from China, as threatened, although the 10% rate was markedly lower than the 25% slated for Canada and Mexico. A call between Trump and the Chinese president Xi Jinping has been mooted, raising the prospect of another swift reprieve.And while Trump claims to be in no rush to pick up the phone, a key component of the tariffs on China – which would havemade sure they were charged on shipments of less than $800 from the country, closing a longstanding loophole – was quietly delayed, ostensibly for administrative reasons.When it emerged on Friday that the scrapping of thede minimis exemptionhad been delayed, Trump made sure to threaten yet more tariffs on yet more nations. These “reciprocal” duties would be announced next week, he said, in line with a promise on the campaign trail.For a man enamored with the “beauty” of tariffs, who says they could raise trillions of dollars for the US, and who happily threatens to use them to clobber his country’s biggest trading partners, the president seems remarkably cautious about pulling the trigger.There are three key reasons for this. The first, which Trump has talked about, is their use as a negotiating tool. “Tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting everything else you want,” he told reporters this week.But these potential uses – however powerful – are alternate, rather than complementary. The US can’t raise billions from a tariff it did not impose on, say, Canada, because Justin Trudeau won Trump over by pledging to appoint a “fentanyl czar” and establish a “strike force”.Second, the scale of what Trump has proposed would amount to an extraordinary experiment. Time and again, he has outlined nothing short of an historic overhaul of how the US federal government raises money – taxing the world more, and Americans less – by introducing sweeping universal tariffs on other nations.But tariffs, while imposed on goods from other countries, are paid by the US firms which import them. They may well challenge US demand for, say, Canadian lumber, or Mexican avocados, damaging the economies of either country – but only by increasing prices within the US economy.This brings us to the third, and perhaps most important, factor behind Trump’s caution. Should he press ahead with this strategy, and drive it beyond the bluster into reality who bears the brunt?Tariffs, by the president’s own admission, may cause “some pain” in the US. Many economists have gone a little further, warning of higher prices, weaker growth and – for the package of duties on Canada, Mexico and China alone – an average tax increase of more than $800 per US household in 2025,accordingto the Tax Foundation.US businesses face retaliation, too. Firms including Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube; PVH Corp, the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein; and farming equipment manufacturersfound themselves in China’s crosshairsafter the US imposed tariffs this week.Millions of Americans remain under pressure after years of heightened inflation. Trump regained the White House after promising, time and again, to rapidly bring down prices. But tariffs risk sending them in the opposite direction.So much of Trump’s political success over the past decade has been fueled by his exceptional ability to control the narrative, and his use of rhetoric to warp reality.But those who voted for the president last November put their faith in him to ease their economic burden. Their cost of living – laid bare each time they fill up their cars, pick up groceries and open the latest bills – is not swayed by posts on Truth Social, press conferences or rallies.You might blink a few times, too, before taking action many believe would make that burden heavier.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMexicoCanadaAmericasUS politicsUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

But experts say it misses the mark.“Of courseMexicohas a problem with corruption,” said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political scientist in Mexico City. “But the Mexican government is not an ally of organised crime. And those who say it is are lying, or simply do not know or understand Mexico.”Organised crime could be seen as a ubiquitous but uneven “parallel power”, said Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Sometimes it works with the state; sometimes it fights it. Sometimes they just exist side by side,” Freeman said.Corruption is most prevalent at a municipal level, which is both theleast protected layer of the stateand where criminal groups seekdeals with authoritiesto deepen their control over the local territory and its businesses.This was on show during the 2024 elections, whenmore than 30candidates were killed as criminal groups competed for influence. Butcorruption has gone higher up, too.Several state governors have been extradited to the US for ties to organised crime, while the Trump administration cited the case ofGenaro García Luna, the former security chief who was recently sentenced to 38 years in US prison for receiving bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.Then there were the allegations against Salvador Cienfuegos, the former defence minister who was arrested on drug-trafficking charges at the Los Angeles airport,only to be released under pressure from the Mexican government.But such cases did not equate to an alliance, a term that tarred the whole of the government, said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego.‘Mother of all battles’: terror for Mexicans as war rages inside Sinaloa cartelRead more“The way it’s phrased implies that it’s all done with the knowledge of the Mexican government, and almost willingly,” said Farfán-Méndez. “No one denies the existence of corruption in Mexico. But that’s very different to saying [the government is] an active participant.”US frustration may have stemmed from its perception that the Mexican government has more intelligence than it acts on. “The army has such power in Mexico,” said Freeman. “I think they see and hear everything that’s going on.”But inaction may just reflect differing priorities: while the US wants to go after top drug traffickers, Mexico primarily wants to reduce violence. And in practice, these objectives often run counter to one another, said Pérez Ricart.Last year, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel withJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was detained along with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane arrived in the US.This starteda war within the Sinaloa cartelthat has killed or disappeared almost 2,000 people so far.The Mexican governmentwas blindsided by the arrests, and blamed the US for triggering the violence. US authorities have denied their involvement, while celebrating the arrest of El Mayo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for them. We can finally return to our motherland,” he said.Somboon Saethao, the father of Bannawat, said he was “so happy” and that his family would welcome his son home with a traditional Thai ceremony.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Sathian Suwannakham greet him as he arrives at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/Reuters“I don’t think I want him to be far from home again,” said Somboon, who comes from Nan province in northernThailand.Bannawat moved toIsraelnine months before his kidnap in search of a better income for the family, he added.Foreign minister Maris Sangiampongsa said it was “very inspiring” to witness their return, and that officials would monitor their reintegration into Thai society, “focusing on their mental health”.“We never gave up on these hostages,” he said during a press conference at the airport.The five returnees are now making their way to their home towns.Boonsong Tapchaiyut, a labour ministry official said that each hostage would receive a one-time payment of about $18,000 (600,000 baht), along with a monthly salary of $900 until the age of 80, to ensure they did not have to return to Israel.WhenHamasattacked Israel on 7 October 2023, 31 Thais were abducted, with 23 released by the end of that year and two confirmed dead in May.One Thai national is still believed to be alive in Gaza.View image in fullscreenThailand’s foreign minister Maris Sangyampong with the five freed Thai hostages at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, 9 February 2025.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersThe handover of the five hostages last month in Khan Younis in southern Gaza was marked by chaotic scenes as Islamic Jihad and Hamas fighters struggled to hold back hundreds of spectators.After the release, prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said she was “elated” that they were out of captivity and thanked Israel, as well as Qatar, Egypt, Iran, Turkey and the US for their work to secure the releases.A total of 46 Thai workers have been killed since October 2023, according to the foreign ministry in Bangkok, the majority in the Hamas attack and some by rockets fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah.Thailand’s labour ministry said last week that the country will expand its workforce in Israel by 13,000.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsThailandIsrael-Gaza warHamasIsraelAsia PacificMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

All efforts are being made to resolve this issue. We will continue to keep you informed,” it said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAt around 9pm, a final message confirmed that the concert was delayed “due to an external Water Corporation water supply issue which could not be resolved.”“All existing ticketholders will be notified of an update as soon as possible and need not take any action at this time.”A late-night update from the Water Corporation posted on Facebook explained the cancellation and advised people to avoid contact with “pooled water” in Wellington Street, which runs alongside the venue, as it may be sewage.“As a priority, Water Corporation crews are working to clear the large blockage of fat, grease and rags, which has caused several wastewater overflows at properties along Wellington Street,” the alert said.Charlotte O’Dwyer became the face of black summer’s terrible toll.

Today’s older renters who are in work are tomorrow’s renting retirees.“We’re going to see more people renting in future, and many renters are not on track to have enough savings through their super to cover the cost of rent.”Coates called on the government to lift commonwealth rent assistance, which supplements the age pension for less well-off retirees who rent.“The problem now is that social housing is also a smaller share of the housing stock,” he said.He said Australia’s income support system “hasn’t updated for this emerging reality, which is that more people are going to rent”.The government has lifted the maximum rate of rent assistance (now $211.20 for singles) by 27% – over and above inflation – in the past two budgets.But even after these increases a single retiree who relies solely on income support can afford to rent only 4% of one-bedroom homes in Sydney, 13% in Brisbane, and 14% in Melbourne.Explore more on these topicsRentingAustralia's rental crisisPovertyHousingCost of living crisisSuperannuationAgeingnewsShareReuse this content"

This is more than four and a half times the prime minister’s $607,471 annual salary. The year before Rue earned $3.03m.The former Telstra executive Ellie Sweeney took over as NBN Co’s chief executive and managing director in December – the company’s first female leader.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIf Sweeney is on a similar package to Rue, the new rule would cut her pay by about $2.5m, as the amendment specifically limits senior executive pay to five times the average Australian’s weekly earnings.The latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May 2024 showed average weekly earnings for an adult working full-time was $1,923.40, which would result in a cap of senior executive salaries at $500,084.The Greens senatorSarah Hanson-Youngsaid the current CEO’s salary in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis was “obscene”.“[The amendments] will cap the obscene salaries of the NBN Co CEO and other executives,” she said.US Democrats call for more aggressive tactics against Trump and Musk: ‘We’re going to be the opposition’Read more“Something is clearly wrong when the publicly owned NBN Co pays its executives millions of dollars while some Australians are struggling to pay their monthly internet bill or access a reliable service for a network Australians built and own.”The bill as it stands would make it an objective of the NBN Co Act that the company remains owned by the commonwealth, and removes the legislative conditions that could enable private ownership and control.Those conditions include a report by the Productivity Commission on the impact of the sale of NBN Co on the future affordability of services, telecommunications competition and commonwealth budgets, as well as a declaration by the finance minister that the conditions are suitable for a sale.Labor will need the Greens and other crossbench support to pass the bill. The Coalition has refused to back it, calling the legislation a “political wedge”.Hanson-Young is due to meet with the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, to discuss the amendments this week. If the Greens make a deal, Labor can count on support from the independent Tasmanian senator Tammy Tyrrell.Tyrrell told Guardian Australia a privatised NBN would “come at the cost of regional areas like Tassie”.“I’m happy to support something that will safeguard Tasmania’s connection to the rest of the country,” she said. “Any bill that protects regional areas from potential NBN privatisation is worth it.”The independent Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe is also likely to back the bill, while Jacqui Lambie is yet to formalise her position but has previously opposed the privatisation of commonwealth assets. The independent ACT senator, David Pocock, is also yet to make his position public.Last month Labor also announced $3bn to fund a nationalupgrade of the NBN’s fibre-to-the-node infrastructure, which requires the use of copper lines. The government said the upgrades would reach 622,000 premises by 2030.Explore more on these topicsNational broadband network (NBN)Australian politicsAustralian GreensTelecommunications industryInternetLabor partyIndependentsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a large Garda presence in the area and other emergency services attended.The local Fine Gael councillor Ray McAdam said residents had been told to stay inside and lock their doors. He said police had reacted very quickly and “swarmed the place”.Garda said a man in his 20s was intercepted and detained close to the scene by an unarmed officer, at a Garda station in the north of Dublin.Police said three men assaulted in the course of the incident were taken to hospital for treatment. Two had serious but not life-threatening injuries, while the other’s injuries were described as less serious.After the arrest, a spokesperson for the Garda Síochána, the Irish national police force, said: “There is no ongoing risk to the public at this time.”The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, wished those injured in the “shocking attacks” in Dublin a “full recovery”.In a statement on X, he said: “Our thoughts are with the victims of the shocking attacks in Stoneybatter earlier today. I want to pay tribute to the gardaí and emergency services for their prompt response.“I wish all those injured a full recovery and urge anyone with any information to contact Garda.”A heightened police presence and a number of crime scene cordons were in place until shortly before 5pm. All traffic restrictions had been lifted by the evening.Police are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to come forward.“Anyone who was in the Stoneybatter area between 2.30pm and 3.30pm, who may have any video footage linked to this incident, is asked to make this footage available to gardaí,” a spokesperson said.“Anyone with information is asked to contact the Bridewell Garda station on (01) 6668200, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111, or any Garda station.”McAdam said community officers were contacting local residents to assure them they would maintain a presence in the area. He described the neighbourhood as closely knit.“There’s a level of shock, a level of concern, but the overriding sense here in Stonybatter is one of hope that those who have been impacted and injured will make a swift recovery,” he said. “There’s a sense of ‘how could something like this happen in our neighbourhood?”’Local people had been reassured by the quick Garda response, he said.The Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, described the incident as “terrible news”. “My thoughts are with those injured and their families. The community is in a state of shock,” she said in a statement. “The gardaí and emergency services are to be commended for their response.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Every day people are dying. This war is so bad inUkraine. I want to end this damn thing.”Last month, Trump estimated that approximately 1 million Russian soldiers and 700,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the invasion began – an estimate far in excess of numbers that Ukrainian officials or independent analysts have presented.The Post said the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, joined the president during the interview.“Let’s get these meetings going,” Trump said. “They want to meet. Every day people are dying. Young handsome soldiers are being killed. Young men, like my sons. On both sides. All over the battlefield.”Waltz would not confirm that Trump had spoken with Putin, telling NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that “there are certainly a lot of sensitive conversations going on” and that senior US diplomats would be inEuropethis week “talking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table”.Ending the war, Waltz added, had come up in conversations with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi; China’s president, Xi Jinping; and leaders across the Middle East. “Everybody is ready to help President Trump end in this war,” Waltz said, and repeated the president’s comments that he is prepared to tax, tariff and sanction Russia.“The president is prepared to put all of those issues on the table this week, including the future of US aid to Ukraine. We need to recoup those costs, and that is going to be a partnership with the Ukrainians in terms of their rare earth [materials], their natural resources, their oil and gas, and also buying ours.”But Waltz reiterated what he said was the Trump administration’s “underlying principle” that the Europeans “have to own this conflict going forward. President Trump is going to end it, and then in terms of security guarantees that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.”During his presidential campaign, Trump made repeated vows to end the war quickly if he was re-elected, often pointing to the loss of life on the battlefield.Last month, Trump said: “Most people thought this war would last about a week, and now it’s been going on for three years,” and said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had expressed interest in a negotiated peace deal.During the interview on Friday, Trump again expressed sorrow for the loss of life in the war and compared the young men dying to his own sons.“All those dead people. Young, young, beautiful people. They’re like your kids, two million of them – and for no reason,” Trump told the Post, adding that Putin also “wants to see people stop dying”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovtold the Tass state news agencyhe was unaware of any such call.“What can be said about this news: as the administration in Washington unfolds its work, many different communications arise. These communications are conducted through different channels. And of course, amid the multiplicity of these communications, I personally may not know something, be unaware of something. Therefore, in this case, I can neither confirm nor deny it.”The Kremlin has previously said it is awaiting “signals” on a possible meeting between Trump and Putin. The head of the state Duma committee on international affairs, Leonid Slutsky, has said that work on preparing contacts between Moscow and Washington “is at an advanced stage”.The US president also ventured into the current standoff between Israel and Iran, saying he “would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear” and would prefer a negotiated deal to “bombing the hell out of it … They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.”If there were a deal with Iran, he said, “Israel wouldn’t bomb them”. But he declined to go further on any approach to Iran: “In a way, I don’t like telling you what I’m going to tell them. You know, it’s not nice.”“I could tell what I have to tell them, and I hope they decide that they’re not going to do what they’re currently thinking of doing.

And I think what’s been going on with Karla Sofía Gascón is practically a lynching and I have the feeling that the brakes kind of need to be put on that.”The Spanish-Italian actor Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, who won an honorary Goya at the ceremony, said Gascón’s work was as good as it had been before, and that she had been subjected to a “destructive and excessive” backlash.“I don’t wish for her destruction, or for revenge, or for her to be cancelled,” Sánchez-Gijón added. “But I don’t wish this harm on anyone. She’s issued a full apology. She needs to be left in peace and she’s suffered considerably, as have the groups that were insulted by her words.”On Tuesday, Antonio Banderas said Gascón deserved the benefit of the doubt, adding that he felt she had also been the victim of transphobia.“I’m from Andalucía, and in Andalucía, there’s forgiveness for every sin,” he said. “If she’s asked for forgiveness, then she’ll get it from me. But, in any case, I think they’ve gone after her. There’s a lot of transphobia.”Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, a number of senior film publicists raised concerns over whether those working on the film, both during its making and its marketing, had, in the words of one PR veteran, “chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her body”.“Those tweets were despicable,” they continued. “But everyone was on board for this amazing fairytale: an unknown becoming the first ever [out] trans actor up for an Oscar.” That magical narrative, said another, curdled into “the absolute worst-case scenario”.The film, which was shot in France, has also caused controversy in Mexico, where many people have taken issue with its depiction of their country as a place of drugs, thugs and death.One Mexican screenwriter, Héctor Guillén,summed it up with a post on X that read: “This is a message to the Academy: Mexico hates Emilia Pérez” and described the film as a “racist Eurocentrist mockery”.Camila Aurora, a trans Mexican film-maker,responded with her own parody film, Johanne Sacreblu– “a tribute to Emilia Pérez” – which features “French” people in striped shirts, berets and painted-on moustaches dancing in the streets of a “Paris” that was actually Mexico.Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezSpainJacques AudiardEuropeAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

He died early last year when the Israeli army bombed a building inGazanear where he was being held.Shortly before he was handed over to the Red Cross on Saturday, Sharabi was escorted on to a stage by masked Hamas fighters, where he said: “I feel very, very happy today to return to my family and friends – to my wife and daughters. I truly hope to see them very soon.”He appeared emaciated and is now being treated for severe malnutrition at a hospital in Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenEli Sharabi, pictured before the 7 October attack.Photograph: APLianne’s parents, Gill and Pete Brisley, who live in Bridgend, Wales, said their son-in-law has “sunken cheeks”, “hollow eyes” and wrists like “sticks” but was lucid when they spoke to him on a video call.“He got choked up a couple of times but managed a small smile for us. Such a brave man,” the couple said.They expressed joy and relief at his release and were preparing to fly out to see him soon, after enduring a “very emotional morning” watching his release on livestream on Saturday, they told the BBC. “Seeing Eli come out now, it brought everything back. [We] sat and bawled our eyes out,” said Gill, Lianne’s mother.“I was sitting there cuddling Lianne’s teddy bear. I think I made him wet actually. It reminded us of what we lost.”Sharabi’s brother-in-law, Stephen Brisley, told the Guardian on Saturday that he was feeling a “kaleidoscope of emotions” after Sharabi’s release.Brisley described his joy and relief at seeing Sharabi alive “because, up until yesterday afternoon, we didn’t even know whether he was alive or dead”. He said this was “very much tempered by the distress of seeing the state that he’s in”.“You can see the clothes are hanging off of him. You can see his face was gone. The spark and the light has gone from his eyes. His cheeks are sunken.“It’s a bittersweet day because we don’t know, other than the fact that he’s alive, exactly what state he’s in physically and mentally,” said Brisley. “But it’s the moment we’ve been waiting for. I’m just trying to focus on the joy of that and leave the more distressing elements for another time while we help him to recover.”The three hostages were released on Saturday as part of a three-phase agreement, designed to broker a permanent end to the war after 15 months of fighting.About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack on 7 October and another 250 taken hostage. It is estimated that nearly 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is now completely pulverised, with no buildings left.The majority of the agricultural land has been bulldozed and destroyed by the Israeli military.It will be very difficult for people who were displaced from this area to return to their homes. It’s hard to imagine where they are going to stay here other than just setting up tents here and there.So we’re seeing more civilian movement between the north and the south.The hope is now that with the withdrawal of the Israeli military, there is more free movement, a flow of vehicles and aid trucks going all the way to the northern part of the Strip.A drone view shows Palestinian people making their way past the rubble after Israeli forces withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor.Photograph: ReutersShare"

That’s why I quit the UK Foreign OfficePatrick WintourDiplomatic editorSun 9 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareBritain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed.Writingfor the Guardian, Mark Smith, whoresigned from the Foreign Officein August, said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies, and if they did not do so, their reports were edited by senior colleagues to give the impression that the UK was in compliance with the law.Appealing to serving Foreign Office officials to end their cooperation with a broken process, he wrote: “What I witnessed was not just moral failure but conduct that I believe crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes.“The British public deserves to know how these decisions are made behind closed doors – and how systemic dysfunction enables the government to perpetuate harm while shielding itself from scrutiny.”He also said his efforts to raise his concerns were blocked, and he was ordered not to put his concerns in writing in case they became subject to freedom of information requests.Smith served as a Middle East desk specialist adviser on arms sales, and subsequently moved to serve as a second secretary at the UK embassy in Dublin.He wrote: “The Foreign Office’s handling of these issues is nothing short of a scandal. Officials are bullied into silence. Processes are manipulated to produce politically convenient outcomes. Whistleblowers are stonewalled, isolated, and ignored.”Although much of his criticism is directed at the last Conservative government concerning arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen, and arms sales to Israel, Smith did not absolve Labour. He welcomed theUK ban on arms exports to Israelin September, but since then, he said the government had stood by as Israel continued to commit war crimes.View image in fullscreenCampaigners protest in August outside BAE Systems against the supply of parts for the F-35 fighter jets used by Israel.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe UK last September banned sales of arms for use in Gaza, but exempted allparts for the F-35jet programme, a carve-out that is now subject to full judicial review. UK laws state that the government will not issue export licences “if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law”. The Foreign Office still insists it has not been able to conclude that Israel’s bombing of Gaza breached international law.Possibly the most significant of Smith’s allegations is the claim that officials had demanded the toning down of evidence that UK arms had been used to commit war crimes, which would be a clear manipulation of what is intended to be an objective evidence-gathering process.Smith wrote: “The most egregious example of this manipulation occurred during my work on arms sales toSaudi Arabiaamidst its military campaign in Yemen. The UK government was fully aware that Saudi airstrikes were causing massive civilian casualties.“In a high-level meeting with senior officials, including legal advisers and the Queen’s Counsel, it was acknowledged that the UK had exceeded the legal threshold for halting arms sales. Yet instead of advising ministers to suspend exports, the focus shifted to finding ways to ‘get back on the right side’ of the law.“Rather than confronting the illegality, officials resorted to delaying tactics – extending reporting deadlines and demanding additional information that was unnecessary. This ‘wait for more evidence’ approach created a loophole, allowing arms sales to continue while the government feigned compliance.“I raised my concerns repeatedly, only to be overruled. One of my colleagues, equally troubled by what we were witnessing, resigned over the issue. I soon followed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet the UK government continued to justify arms sales to Israel, relying on the same flawed processes and evasive tactics.”He said from the UK embassy in Ireland – a country that strongly backs a Palestinian state – he sought answers from the Foreign Office headquarters about the legal basis for arms sales to Israel, and was “met with hostility and stonewalling”.“Emails went unanswered. I was warned not to put my concerns in writing. Lawyers and senior officials bombarded me with defensive instructions to ‘stick to the lines’ and delete correspondence. It became clear that no one was willing to address the fundamental question: How could continued arms sales to Israel possibly be legal?“I followed every internal procedure available to me to raise my concerns. I engaged the whistleblowing team, wrote to senior officials, and even attempted to contact the foreign secretary directly. At every turn, I was met with delays, obfuscation, and outright refusal to engage. It became clear that the system is not designed to hold itself accountable – it is designed to protect itself at all costs.”Smith’s evidence may prove material in the case being mounted by human rights groups over the continued sale of parts for the F35s that are sold to Israel and can be used inGaza.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “These allegations are a misrepresentation of this government. Our export licence controls are some of the most robust in the world and are strictly guided by legal advice. As soon as the foreign secretary took office, he ordered a review into Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law and on 2 September, we suspended export licences to Israel for use in military operations in the Gaza conflict.”The Foreign Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but had an established process for handling internal concerns.Explore more on these topicsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeArms tradeWar crimesForeign policyInternational tradeSaudi ArabiaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas, meanwhile, says it will not hand over the last hostages it seized during its attacks on 7 October 2023 until Israel removes all troops from the territory.Despite the withdrawal – andthe release of some of the hostages and prisoners held by both sides– little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal, which is designed to extend the truce and to secure the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Further doubts over what comes next arose on Saturday after it emerged that the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, had dispatched a delegation including low-level officials to Qatar – which helped negotiate the truce – prompting speculation that the mission might not lead to a breakthrough in extending the ceasefire.A day later, the Palestinian health ministry said two women in their 20s, one of whom was eight months pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank.Under the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 of the Israeli hostages it seized, in exchange for a pause in fighting, the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and access to more humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza.The second phase anticipates the release of all remaining living hostages in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a “sustainable calm”.But more substantial details remain unclear and the ongoing efforts to secure an extension to the ceasefire have been hindered by deep mutual distrust – and, more recently, by Donald Trump’s wildly inflammatory suggestion thatthe US could take control of the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants.On Tuesday, the US president said America would “take over” and “own” Gaza, claiming that it could become the “riviera of the Middle East”. He also called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians.The suggestion produced shock waves across the Middle East and prompteda warning from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, against “any form of ethnic cleansing”.Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, headed to Washington for talks on Sunday, while Trump’s plans have prompted Cairo to host an emergency summit of Arab nations on 27 February.A statement from the Egyptian foreign ministr​y said the gathering had been called “after extensive consultations by Egypt at the highest levels with Arab countries in recent days, including Palestine, which requested the summit, to address the latest serious developments regarding the Palestinian cause”.Netanyahu, however, has welcomed Trump’s proposal, saying Israel was willing to “do the job” after Trump ruled out sending American troops to the territory.The Israeli prime minister told Fox News on Saturday: “I think that President Trump’s proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza.”Netanyahu sparked further fury when he suggested that a Palestinian state – which he has long opposed – could be “in Saudi Arabia”.The Saudi foreign ministry stressed its “categorical rejection [of] such statements”, while the Arab League chief, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said such ideas “are nothing more than mere fantasies or illusions”.Netanyahu’s far-right political allies want to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. But the prime minister is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want the deal to continue, especially afterthe gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed on Saturday ​​shocked the nation.Netanyahu’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who opposed the ceasefire, has threatened to quit the coalition if the war does not resume – a move that could topple the administration.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Severely reduced rations have led to prisoners emerging emaciated, in some cases having lost dozens of kilograms.Some of those released were serving multiple life sentences for violent offences. But also freed on Saturday were 111 detainees from Gaza, arrested after 7 October 2023 and never charged before their release.View image in fullscreenA released Palestinian prisoner is welcomed upon his arrival in Ramallah in the West Bank.Photograph: Alaa Badarneh/EPANetanyahu, who is in Washington for meetings with Donald Trump and other US allies, has repeatedly indicated that he is prepared to resume the war, insisting that only a “complete” military victory can keep Israel safe.“We will eliminate Hamas, and we will return our hostages,” he said in a statement celebrating the releases, and attacking the way the hostages were treated.The Israeli leader has ordered a delegation to Qatar to discuss “technical matters”, but no substantial talks will start until after a security cabinet meeting on Monday, Israeli media reported.Israel’s hostage coordinator, Brig Gen Gal Hirsch, said he viewed the condition of those freed with great concern.Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan Zangauker is in Gaza and not due for release under the first stage of the deal, accused Netanyahu of “sitting in a hotel in Washington, trying to sabotage” a deal that would save her son.“Tell them to shorten the first stage, close [the deal] on the second stage, and this time, bring them all home at once,” she said in a statement quoted by Israeli media.View image in fullscreenFreed Israeli hostage Or Levy is greeted by a loved one.Photograph: Haim Zach/ReutersA Hamas political bureau member, Basem Naim, warned Israel’s “lack of commitment” is putting the Gaza ceasefire in danger of collapse. He told AFP the group did not want to return to war, but was ready to fight if the ceasefire collapsed.The next round of negotiations was officially started at the beginning of the week, when Netanyahu met Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, but Naim said talks were not yet under way.Netanyahu has ordered a delegation to Qatar to discuss “technical matters”, but no substantial talks will start until after he returns from Washington for a security cabinet meeting on Monday, Israeli media reported.A third stage would see the reconstruction of Gaza, but the process has been thrown into turmoil by Trump’s shock suggestion that the US should take over the territory and Palestinians be resettled elsewhere, prompting the UN secretary general to warn of ethnic cleansing.Israelis were also angered by a Hamas ceremony that saw the frail-looking men forced to make statements on a stage in Gaza before they were taken to waiting buses.1:04Hamas releases three more Israeli hostages as part of ceasefire deal – videoIsrael made prisoners due for release watch a film about the destruction of the Gaza Strip in the war, some of those released said, and was criticised last week for releasing prisoners wearing bracelets with pro-Israeli messages.The Red Cross said it was “increasingly concerned” about the releases, in a statement that urged all parties including mediators “to ensure that future releases are dignified and private”.Two of the Israeli hostages were emerging from captivity to news of painful losses.Eli Sharabi, taken hostage fromBe’eri kibbutz, was not told during his entire captivity that his wife and daughters had been killed on 7 October 2023, Israeli media reported.Or Levy, who was abducted from the Nova music festival, suspected his wife was dead, but did not have the news confirmed. He was reunited with his now three-year-old son, who was staying with grandparents on the morning of the attack.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

The sudden cessation of services prompted panic in the camps after aid workers failed to turn up for work.Three days later, Blumont was given a two-week waiver to the aid cuts, which unless extended, will expire on Monday. “We have no idea what will happen tomorrow. It seems as if even the provision of bread will be halted,” said Jihan Hanan, the director of al-Hol camp.The camp holds the relatives of suspected IS fighters and is mostly populated by women and children. Rights groups have for years warned that detainees are held arbitrarily without charges in inhumane and substandard living conditions.No charges have been raised against the camp’s population. Despite this, they are unable to leave, with the exception of non-Syrian detainees whose countries agree to take them back.Though IS no longer holds any territory after the group’s last stand in March 2019, US and Kurdish officials say the group ideology prevails among former members and that camps and detention facilities are a hotbed of extremist ideology.In the section of the camp where foreign women from at least 40 countries are kept, guards say they are in a constant struggle with women who seek to keep IS alive.“Even if a normal person enters the camp, they eventually will be psychologically affected. The violent behaviour is really high among the kids and women,” Hanan said, describing incidents of violence against al-Hol’s staff.mapWomen there have constructed cloth roofs above their tents and walkways to conceal themselves from guards’ view. In once incident, a child as young as six years old waited at the edge of the fenced-off annexe, hurling rocks at passing NGO vehicles with a makeshift sling.It is unclear what will happen on Monday when the brief waiver given to Blumont, which provides the bulk of services in al-Hol, expires. Camp officials are hoping for an 11th-hour exemption from Donald Trump’s 90-day global aid freeze, but have been given no assurances from the US administration.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a blanket waiver for “life-saving assistance”, for which humanitarian organisations can apply while the administration reviews which US aid projects will continue. The review process has confused US aid officials, diplomats and humanitarian workers worldwide.When aid was briefly cut off from al-Hol in late January, the camp administration was given no notice. Camp officials had to scramble to secure the most basic of services, as contractors such as Blumont, which normally provided bread and water to the camp, had shuttered their offices. US special forces visited the camp, assuring its director they would help safeguard it in case of any unrest or IS attacks.“We were able to get bread to the camp by the afternoon. It was 5,000 bags of bread for one day, which was 4bn Syrian lira (£35,000) – the Autonomous Administration [the Kurdish authority of north-east Syria] cannot cover this cost,” Hanan said.Humanitarian conditions in al-Hol are already abysmal. On Thursday, residents shopping at the camp’s marketplace moved through mud and puddles as cold winter rain flooded the dirt alleyways of the sprawling complex. Young children, many of whom said they could not remember life outside the camp, darted between the shops, their clothing worn and dirty.“Everything is bad here. We get food aid every two months and we have to sell most of it. Everyone is tired,” said Taysir al-Husseiniya, a 39-year-old Iraqi woman, sitting in a shop whose shelves were sparsely stocked with lightbulbs and other home goods.Al-Husseiniya said that raising her four children, one of whom was injured by an airstrike during the international campaign against IS, “was extremely difficult” in the camp’s conditions. Her husband was imprisoned by Kurdish authorities in 2019 for being a suspected IS fighter, leaving her to raise her children alone.Human Rights Watch warned on Friday that the Trump aid cuts were “exacerbating life-threatening conditions, risking further destabilisation of a precarious security situation” in the camps.The future of the US military presence in north-east Syria has also been called into question as the Trump administration seeks to shrink the US military footprint abroad.The US maintains military bases across north-east Syria and has trained, equipped and supported Kurdish forces in their fight against IS since the formation of the US-led international coalition to defeat IS was formed in 2014.The director of the Panorama prison in al-Hasakah, north-east Syria, which houses 5,000 suspected IS fighters, said that a US withdrawal would stretch Kurdish authorities and leave prisons vulnerable to jail breaks.“If US forces pull out, it will be even worse than 2012. IS sleeper cells in the Syrian desert will emerge and could attack the prison,” the prison director said on Saturday, asking not to be named for fears of being targeted by IS.In al-Hol, there fears that a security vacuum, along with the sudden withdrawal of much of the camp’s resources, could provide fertile ground for the radical group’s recruitment.“We will descend into chaos. Maybe the lack of supplies will allow IS sleeper cells to take control of the camp. Maybe there will be attacks on the administration. I can’t say what will happen,” Hanan said.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateKurdsAidUSAidUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

He was ejected from the stands and arrested.On Friday, a misconduct panel chaired by the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington, found that Coppin had breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct.He was dismissed from Essex police force without notice and will be placed on the College of Policing barred list.According to the Crown Prosecution Service, tragedy chanting is when fans sing, chant or gesture offensive messages about disasters or accidents involving players or other fans.Harrington said Coppin, who had previously had an unblemished career in policing, was being dismissed as the result of “a moment’s serious stupidity”, but that this was “the only appropriate outcome”.“It is clear that ex-Sgt Coppin was remorseful and may not have been aware of the impact of his words, but he has been criminally convicted of a public order offence,” the chief constable said.“His actions will seriously undermine public trust and confidence and I must send a clear message to officers, staff and the wider public that behaviour such as this cannot and will not be tolerated in policing.“If officers are responsible for upholding the law, it cannot be right that they break it.”Ch Insp Kevin Chatterton, ofMerseysidepolice, said: “This type of behaviour has no place in football. We will take action and identify those who commit hate crime in any form, and this includes unacceptable chanting which causes distress to others.”In a “fan information and chant warning”,published on its websitein January last year, Chelsea FC wrote: “Chelsea Football Club believes hateful chanting has no place in football.”Last season, Arsenal welcomed three-year banning orders handed downto three Arsenal fanswho pleaded guilty to tragedy-related abuse during an FA Cup match against Liverpool at the Emirates stadium, north London.Explore more on these topicsPoliceEssexLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)MerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

During the Covid pandemic, the C of E allowed churches to use individual cups, rather than the traditional shared cup, to minimise the spread of infection.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismChristianityReligionGluten-freeAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

The inscription had been in place since the racial justice protests that followed the 2020 murder ofGeorge Floydby a white police officer.Trump had campaigned againstNFLplayers “taking the knee” before kick-off in a symbolic gesture against to racism, a practice that has been discontinued.Alvin Tillery, a politics professor and diversity expert at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press that the NFL’s decision to remove “End Racism” slogans was “shameful” given that the league “makes tens of billions of dollars largely on the bodies of Black men”. Tillery said the league should explain who it was aiming to please.In astatementbefore heading to New Orleans from his home in Florida, Trump said he was looking forward to joining fans for a sense of national unity and patriotism.“The coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American dream,” he said.Trump also noted the 14 deaths and 35 injuries from the truck attack inNew Orleanson New Year’s Day: “We remember that 14 families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon Street.”A White House official said Trump will meet with family members of the attack who will be honorary coin toss participants just before the big game.Trump added that the game was an annual opportunity to transcend differences, saying that the Chiefs and Eagles’ coaches, players and staff “represent the hopes and dreams of our Nation’s young athletes as we restore safety and fairness in sports and equal opportunities among their teams”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then I’m going to go, go to the military. Let’s check the military,” the US president told the host from the rightwingFox News, adding: “We’re going to find billions, hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud and abuse.”In the last few weeks, Musk’s “department of government efficiency” has been trying to dismantle numerous federal agencies in Washington DC, going through data systems, shutting down DEI programs, and in some cases, attempting to eliminate entire agencies.Last week, Musk and Trump attempted to put thousands of workers of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) on leave, but a judge on Fridaytemporarily blockedthe effort.0:44Trump tells Fox News he expects Musk to find billions in Pentagon 'fraud and abuse' – videoWithout providing any evidence, Trump said in the Baier interview: “You take a look at theUSAid, the kind of fraud in there … We’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that’s going to places where it shouldn’t be going … It’s crazy. It’s a big scam.”Trump went on to reiterate his wish for Canada to be the 51st state.“I think Canada would be much better off being a 51st state because we lose $200bn a year with Canada and I’m not going to let that happen,” he added. “It’s too much. Why are we paying $200bn a year, essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state, I don’t mind doing it.”0:36Trump tells Fox News Canada 'would be much better off being a 51st state' – videoTrumpis the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, which has served as the finale of theNFLseason since 1966, although it is not unusual for a president to be part of Super Bowl programming.Presidents have traditionally given interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl, although both Trump andJoe Bidendeclined some requests during their first terms.Biden skipped theSuper Bowlinterview in 2024, in a move thatsome Democratic insiderssaw as a missed opportunity to speak directly to Americans. Biden’s aides said he eschewed the interview because he felt voters wanted a break from political news.This year’s interview is somewhat unusual. Fox is hosting theSuper Bowl, and has assigned Baier to host the interview. Baier is seen as less rabidly pro-Trump than some of his colleagues, but the move suggested from the beginning that the interview might not be as adversarial as one conducted by a less-partisan network.Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who moved to his members-only club in Florida after alienating much of his home state, has not indicated which team he will support.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSuper Bowl LIXFox NewsJoe BidenSuper BowlNFLUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now they’re all Christian nationalist yes-men, and we’re up against something greater this time around. But it’s bringing this community together.”The US president has taken a special interest in the historically immigrant-friendly state ofColorado, calling his deportation plan for alleged gang members Operation Aurora, named for the Denver suburb claimed by him and echoed by conservative media to have been “taken over” by the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA).One of the executive orders signed on Trump’s first day in office was to cut funding andsend a stop-workorder to the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (Rmian), a Colorado non-profit offering free legal services to the undocumented. Due to the large volume of those in need, Colorado has one of the lowest rates of legal representation for undocumented immigrants.Then last week heavily armed Swat teams began storming apartment complexes around Denver and Aurora in the early hours of the morning – sometimes witha Fox News crew embeddedwith the teams – though with30 arrestsin all, only one gang member has been confirmed to be in custody.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the state capitol in Denver on Wednesday.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APWith around 155,000 undocumented immigrants in Colorado fearing for their safety, many local residents have rallied to show their support however they can.Despite their setbacks, last week the Rmian wasable to offera crash course in immigration law to 100 Colorado attorneys who, despite not working in that field, have volunteered their legal services.Whenever Ice raids are spotted, volunteers from groups like the Immigrant Legal Resource Center often are on hand to offer literature on the legal rights of those under siege. At Saturday’s rally outside the state capitol building inDenver, activists with megaphones led a call-and-response chant of legal advice, prompting the crowd with “When Ice shows up?” followed by a collective roar: “Don’t open the door!”The protester and artist Starks, along with many others, have been attending weekly gatherings at a local Methodist church on how to best serve the legal needs of immigrants. One organizer placed the turnout at a meeting last Monday at more than 1,500 people.View image in fullscreenMany local residents in Colorado have rallied to show their support however they can.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APMany of the activists speaking at Saturday’s rally expressed contempt for New York-based property management company CBZ Management, which oversee several properties in Aurora and Denver that have beenfined or shut downfor squalid and neglectful living conditions. Last August, Zev Baumgarten of CBZ Management,accused of being“an out of state slumlord” by the Aurora mayor, claimed one of their Aurora apartment buildings had been overtaken by TdA gang members, which was why they were unable to provide needed repairs and services.This unfolded just in time for Trump to parrot the claims during hispresidential debateagainstKamala Harrisweeks later, eventually making Aurora an unlikely campaign spot for the Republican candidate, since Colorado has been a reliably blue state since 2008.For decades Colorado has cultivated a reputation for welcoming immigrants who have come across theUS-Mexico border, especially when they’re under siege from many across the rest of the nation.In the 1990s, when Democrats were being pulled to the right on issues like immigration, Denver’s mayor, Wellington Webb, pushed against that tide, criticizing federal persecution of immigrants ina 1998 executive orderand declaring the state capital would “welcome all to share in Denver’s warm hospitality”.He insisted: “We must respect this diversity and ensure the rights of all our residents are protected,” and Denver “would not tolerate discrimination in any form”.However a movement of hard-right, anti-immigrant activists in the Republican party found representation at this time in Colorado, such as in the form of congressman Tom Tancredo, who built his political careerattacking Denver librariesfor stocking Spanish speaking books,calling forthe deportation of a Denver high school student,stripping“sanctuary cities” of their federal funding, and calling on Americato rejectthe “cult of multiculturalism”.View image in fullscreenThousands took to the streets after raids by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) throughout Denver.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APTancredo’s decade as a congressman from 1999-2009, along with his failed bids for the presidency and governorship, helped build the narrative architecture of what would become the Make America Great Again conservative movement’s anti-immigrant rage.Despite the protests last Wednesday and Saturday in Denver, portions of the state still hold enough conservative voters to keep Trump loyalists like Representative Lauren Boebert in office.Boebert recently joined forces with two other Colorado representatives topressurethe state’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, to repeal a series of laws protecting immigrants rights in Colorado. Often referred to as a “Democratic libertarian”, Polishas endorsedthe core of Trump’s deportation plan.“Hey Polis, where are you? We have courage, how about you?” the crowd at Saturday’s rally chanted, as it moved away from the capitol building and through downtown Denver.The march eventually made its way peacefully back to the capitol, where more literature was handed out and future gatherings were announced.“We take these threats [from Trump] very seriously,” said Katie Leonard, one of the days’ speakers and an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which has been documenting Ice raids and posting their locations on social media, leading to the arrival of more volunteers, often shouting advice to residents about their rights through megaphones or blasting the neighborhoods with informative leaflets.“But the decisive factor in what happens here, when these Ice raids come and indiscriminately round up people, is whether the community is prepared, whether the people know their rights,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsColoradoDenverDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Representatives of his “department of government efficiency” have been granted administrative-level access to all of the agency’s IT systems, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Union officials said on Friday that Musk was effectively seeking to seize control of his own regulator.In a statement, Dennis Kelleher, head of Better Markets, which advocates for stricter government oversight of the financial sector, accused Trump of throwing his own voters “to the financial wolves.“This latest attempt to kill the consumer bureau is another slap in the face for all Americans who depend on basic financial products and services, but especially for those in the multi-racial working-class coalition of Americans that helped elect President Trump,” Kelleher said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Surrounded by cameras, flanked by billionaire allies and confronted by a barrage of questions about whether he was really prepared to unleash a trade war on the US’s closest neighbors, the president talked tough.By his telling, powerful economies were scrambling to bend to his will. Hours earlier, Mexico had announced a series of measures to shore up its border, prompting the White House to hastily postpone the imposition of 25% tariffs on all its goods;Canadawould announce similar measures, and receive the same reprieve, later that day.Yet, one reporter had the temerity to ask whether Trump had blinked. “There was no blinking,” he shot back, claiming that illegal immigrants and fentanyl were “not going to come fromMexicoany more” as a result of initiatives cobbled together by its government that morning.There was, in fact, some blinking – for the third time in two weeks. Tariffs are a “beautiful” means of reviving the US economy, according to Trump – a central pillar of his Make America Great Again agenda. But when push has come to shove, he has repeatedly pulled back from the brink.What is motivating Trump’s reckless trade war? | Robert ReichRead moreWith Canada and Mexico, an initial pledge to impose tariffs from day one of his new administration shifted, without explanation, to 1 February. When 1 February rolled around, 4 February became the new deadline.Then, with hours to spare, after Canada and Mexico each promised that a big round number of personnel (10,000, give or take) would staff their respective borders with the US, and made some relatively vague commitments to strengthen security, Trump kicked the can down the road for a month.The White Housedidimpose a tariff on all exports to the US from China, as threatened, although the 10% rate was markedly lower than the 25% slated for Canada and Mexico. A call between Trump and the Chinese president Xi Jinping has been mooted, raising the prospect of another swift reprieve.And while Trump claims to be in no rush to pick up the phone, a key component of the tariffs on China – which would havemade sure they were charged on shipments of less than $800 from the country, closing a longstanding loophole – was quietly delayed, ostensibly for administrative reasons.When it emerged on Friday that the scrapping of thede minimis exemptionhad been delayed, Trump made sure to threaten yet more tariffs on yet more nations. These “reciprocal” duties would be announced next week, he said, in line with a promise on the campaign trail.For a man enamored with the “beauty” of tariffs, who says they could raise trillions of dollars for the US, and who happily threatens to use them to clobber his country’s biggest trading partners, the president seems remarkably cautious about pulling the trigger.There are three key reasons for this. The first, which Trump has talked about, is their use as a negotiating tool. “Tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting everything else you want,” he told reporters this week.But these potential uses – however powerful – are alternate, rather than complementary. The US can’t raise billions from a tariff it did not impose on, say, Canada, because Justin Trudeau won Trump over by pledging to appoint a “fentanyl czar” and establish a “strike force”.Second, the scale of what Trump has proposed would amount to an extraordinary experiment. Time and again, he has outlined nothing short of an historic overhaul of how the US federal government raises money – taxing the world more, and Americans less – by introducing sweeping universal tariffs on other nations.But tariffs, while imposed on goods from other countries, are paid by the US firms which import them. They may well challenge US demand for, say, Canadian lumber, or Mexican avocados, damaging the economies of either country – but only by increasing prices within the US economy.This brings us to the third, and perhaps most important, factor behind Trump’s caution. Should he press ahead with this strategy, and drive it beyond the bluster into reality who bears the brunt?Tariffs, by the president’s own admission, may cause “some pain” in the US. Many economists have gone a little further, warning of higher prices, weaker growth and – for the package of duties on Canada, Mexico and China alone – an average tax increase of more than $800 per US household in 2025,accordingto the Tax Foundation.US businesses face retaliation, too. Firms including Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube; PVH Corp, the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein; and farming equipment manufacturersfound themselves in China’s crosshairsafter the US imposed tariffs this week.Millions of Americans remain under pressure after years of heightened inflation. Trump regained the White House after promising, time and again, to rapidly bring down prices. But tariffs risk sending them in the opposite direction.So much of Trump’s political success over the past decade has been fueled by his exceptional ability to control the narrative, and his use of rhetoric to warp reality.But those who voted for the president last November put their faith in him to ease their economic burden. Their cost of living – laid bare each time they fill up their cars, pick up groceries and open the latest bills – is not swayed by posts on Truth Social, press conferences or rallies.You might blink a few times, too, before taking action many believe would make that burden heavier.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMexicoCanadaAmericasUS politicsUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Atlanta may have found a way forwardMayor Andre Dickens is turning to Atlanta’s own land and resources to create new development opportunitiesNick RomeoSun 9 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 12.25 ESTShareShortly after his election as mayor ofAtlantain 2021, Andre Dickens realized one of his core campaign promises – to create 20,000 new units of affordable housing – might be hard to keep. Estimates from his staff showed the city would fall more than 4,000 units short.His options seemed limited. The low-income housing tax credit supports the building or restoration of much affordable housing in America, but the federal tax incentive is curbed by volume caps each year, and voters are often skeptical of other potential sources of funding, such as bonds.While researching various models, Dickens and his teamwere inspired by Copenhagen. Four decades ago, officials in the Danish capital created a publicly owned, privately run corporation to redevelop public land and infrastructure.InAtlanta, they inventoried all of the publicly owned land. Cities typically own large amounts of land, but as long as this public land remains siloed in different departments – the fire department here, the school district or transit authority there – it’s hard to see how all real estate assets can contribute to an overarching goal, like building more affordable housing. So they also created a housing strike force to break down silos between departments and then launched a new non-profit corporation, the Atlanta Urban Development Corporation (AUD), to attract private financing and expertise.Atlanta’s homelessness non-profits face ‘daunting’ future after federal grant pauseRead moreThe result has been a surge of development – 40 public land projects are under way, with 10,000 new affordable housing units finished or under construction – that represents a striking example of how cities can use creative strategies to expand their supply of affordable housing. Staff in dozens of other cities around the country are said to be taking note.“Atlanta has definitely cracked the code on public assets,” said Bruce Katz, co-founder and director of the Nowak Metro Finance Lab at Drexel University. “I think this will become a new model that gets repeated all across the country.”In Atlanta’s Thomasville Heights neighborhood, the city owned roughly 100 acres (40 hectares) of vacant land spread across five different agencies. After consolidating the ownership under the new AUD, they rezoned the land. A redevelopment plan includes a new grocery store, a new early childhood education center, an elementary school and about 3,000 units of new housing, of which roughly 30% will be affordable, prioritizing families that make less than 50% of the area median income.“We had a lot of underutilized space in the city, underutilized land,” Mayor Dickens said. “So we started looking at publicly owned assets and underutilized publicly owned assets. When you can take publicly owned land, you have more control. That then can allow for more units of affordability, or more deeply affordable units.”In another neighborhood, West Midtown, a city-owned facility on almost 10 acres of land is used to store new trash cans before they are delivered to residents. “It’s not the highest and best use of the land, but we’ve been doing it for decades,” said Josh Humphries, the mayor’s senior policy adviser on housing. “We have a lot of things like that, which make a lot of sense for housing, or grocery stores, or other key amenities that residents need.”The trash cans will either be moved to a new facility, or an existing storage depot.The model is not without risks. In one high-profile case, CIM, which invests in commercial properties,receivedroughly $2bn of tax breaks and incentives as part of a 2018 deal to redevelop a section of downtown Atlanta known as “the Gulch”. In return, the developer agreed to make 20% of its residential unit affordable, or pay fees to the city for each affordable unit it declined to create. Not only did the group opt against the affordable units, but the fees it paid the city were based on outdated property values for each unit, suggesting that the company enriched itself whileshortchangingthe city.“City officials should conduct extensive research on the private institutions they plan to partner with,” said K Agbebiyi, senior housing campaign coordinator with the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “Deals that the city has with corporations must maintain enforcement mechanisms reflective of up-to-date research on housing value.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Early in the new mayor’s term, Humphries called the chief of a fire station in the city’s bustling Midtown neighborhood. The fire chief wanted a renovation for his station, and the mayor wanted affordable housing. The site of the fire station was less than an acre, but just the land alone was worth nearly $20m because of its prime location.“I called the fire chief and was like, ‘I think there’s a way we could get you a brand new fire station, as long as you’re willing to put 30 stories of new neighbors above you.’ He’s like, ‘as long as I get a new fire station, I don’t care what you put above me,’” Humphries recalled.John Majors, CEO of the AUD, expects the final design for the tower above the new fire station to be completed in 2025. The AUD can offer private-sector partners an exemption from property taxes, so long as at least 30% of the units in new developments are affordable, with 20% of units reserved for people making less than 50% of area median income, and another 10% reserved for those making below 80% of the area median income.The current fire station in Midtown has room for 10 to 12 firefighters and two bays for engines, according to the station chief, Rod Smith. After the renovation, the station will be roughly twice as big and able to accommodate 15 to 18 firefighters. Smith grew up in Atlanta, and over his lifetime he has watched its population explode, leaving behind its past as what he calls a “small big city”. While he thinks growth is ultimately good for the city, the rising cost of housing puts pressure on everyone, including public servants such as firefighters.It’s possible, once the new fire station and housing high-rise are completed, that some of the firefighters could even live in the affordable units upstairs. “That would be a great commute,” Smith said. “They should never be late for work, right?”Explore more on these topicsAtlantaHousingHousing marketReal estateGeorgiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

ESPN and the NFL Network later said their sources confirmed the news.There had been speculation for some time that Rodgers would leave the Jets, with the quarterback and team both refusing to confirm the relationship would continue. Rodgers joined the Jets in the run-up to the 2023 season but his first campaign ended on the first drive of the first game of the seasonwhen he tore his achillestendon. The 41-year-old returned for 2024 but the Jets slumped to a 5-12 record, fired their head coach,were dogged by reportsthat the owner’s teenage son had a say in team decisions and missed the playoffs for a 14th successive season. His QBR of 48.1ranked him 25thamong qualified NFL quarterbacks.Spoiler alert: the Jets’ painful Aaron Rodgers era isn’t going to get betterRead moreHis struggles with the Jets have been in marked contrast to his career with the Green Bay Packers, where he won a Super Bowl and built a reputation as one of the most talented quarterbacks inNFLhistory.Rodgers is due to make $37.5m in the 2025 season. The Jets would be hit with a $49m dead cap charge if they cut him, which could be reduced by $9.5m and spread over two seasons if they release him after 1 June.Suitors for Rodgers, if he chooses to continue playing, may be limited as he is no longer considered to be in the top tier of quarterbacks. The Jets would be left with the 35-year-old Tyrod Taylor as the only quarterback with significant experience as an NFL starter. They have the No 7 pick in this year’s draft, which is not seen as having a particularly strong quarterback class.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersNFLNew York JetsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Morgan Rogers put Villa 2-0 in front before Mathys Tel’s injury-time consolation.Postecoglou lamented how he had carried numerous injuries since mid‑November as his team have fought in four competitions – they exited the Carabao Cup at the semi‑final stage against Liverpool last Thursday. He even cited ­Liverpool’s shockFA Cupexit at Plymouth to illustrate his point; his Liverpool counterpart, Arne Slot, made wholesale changes and watched his team lose 1-0.Superior Aston Villa cruise past Spurs thanks to Ramsey and RogersRead more“How did Liverpool go today?” Postecoglou said. “And they did that for one game. Do that for two‑and‑a‑half months. Any team. Do that for two-and-a-half months in multiple competitions. I don’t care about me. People will judge me. But you can’t judge this group of players on what’s happened. They’ve given everything.“Villa are one of the best teams in the country. They’ve had a week off, they didn’t play last Thursday night against Liverpool [in the Carabao Cup] We did. Same group of players.”“I’m not talking about me. People can judge me. They can say I’ve done a bad job, I’m not up to it or whatever. That’s fine. What I’m saying is you can’t be critical of players or players’ performances at this time. Because if you do, then do that with everyone else. Be as critical of other clubs when they’ve got 9 or 10 or 11 players out. And none of them have.“It can’t be that people think that’s an excuse. That’s just not anywhere near close to objective analysis. That’s just agenda driven stuff. If it’s to get rid of me that’s fine. Good on you. Go for it a million times.

Despite a shock 1-0 defeat against the Championship’s bottom club, Slot argued that his decision to give senior players a rest would pay dividends later in the season.Slot made 10 changes from thewin against Tottenham on Thursday night, with a relatively inexperienced bench and players such as Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo and Virgil van Dijk left out of the squad entirely.“Most of the things we do, we do for a reason,” Slot insisted. “We have many games to play. The ones who played today need game rhythm, for them to be ready in the upcoming months.”Stunned Liverpool sent crashing out of FA Cup in major upset at PlymouthRead moreThe defeat “hurt”, Slot admitted, but he was careful too to give appropriate praise to Plymouth. “They worked incredibly hard,” Slot said.“There were one or two big chances, but I think if a team is working so hard and throws themselves into any ball, maybe you deserve to be a bit lucky as well. The goalkeeper made one or two good saves in the end, but we hardly created anything at all.”Slot also revealed that Curtis Jones, named on the bench, had declared himself unfit on the morning of the game. And he also offered sympathy for Isaac Mabaya, the substitute who was himself substituted on hisLiverpooldebut. “I had to take him off,” Slot said. “He was already on a yellow. To be taken off after an hour is very disappointing for him, of course.”Plymouth are still four points adrift of safety but if they show this kind of defensive resolve they still have every chance. And forMiron Muslic, the Plymouth manager, “the biggest moment in my coaching career” came with a caveat. “So far,” he said. “The biggest moment is yet to come, at the end of the season, when we stay up. This is what I feel, in my mind, in my soul.“We wanted to represent ourselves. To be organised, to be brave, to be full of intensity, to use this huge stage as an opportunity. We had to enjoy defending. And we did. To keep them away from the goal is a huge, huge task.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Calum ­Ferrie, the heroic Queen’s Park goalkeeper, saved James Tavernier’s stoppage‑time penalty on an afternoon of high drama.Queen’s Park last defeated ­Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie in 1882, at that point the second round of the “­Glasgow and Suburbs” section. Scotland’s oldest league club will take a place in the quarter-final draw for the first time since 1983. Their match‑winner in 2025 was Seb Drozd, who danced inside Jefté after Rangers failed to clear a 69th-minute corner, the substitute then slotting calmly beyond Liam Kelly.Stunned Liverpool sent crashing out of FA Cup in major upset at PlymouthRead moreRangers huffed and puffed in response; Tavernier was handed a glorious opportunity to force extra time but the outstanding Ferrie saved high to his left. Five minutes of stoppage time became eight but the Queen’s Park defence would not be breached.Clement was already under pressure with Rangers 13 points adrift in the Scottish top flight. Rangers remain in the Europa League but this result, with close to a full-strength team, is likely to prove fatal in terms of his reputation with ­supporters. The Rangers board have never been inclined to sack their Belgian manager but it would now be a shock if they were not planning for dugout change in the summer.“Super-frustrating,” was ­Clement’s assessment. “We had 30 chances but no goals. We should have scored more. First half not enough tempo, second half too much rush. Thirty chances is nothing to do with tactics.View image in fullscreenQueen’s Park’s Seb Drozd (left) celebrates after scoring the winner.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA“It is unacceptable to lose this.

The players will likely tell me to stay away from the touchline now. You have to enjoy results like this. If you don’t, there is no point being in football.

But London City are a rapidly developing beast with WSL ambitions and big money behind them via the ownership of the American businesswoman Michele Kang, whose heels further pockmarked the pitch post-match as she congratulated her players for their strong performance and chatted with staff.The south London club had an unorthodox start to life. A year after Millwall Lionesses narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2018, the board announced it was splitting from the parent club Millwall to become an independent women’s side.London City Lionesses’ owner Michele Kang: ‘This is a serious investment’Read moreThe last-gasp investment that had salvaged their 2017-18 season came from the blockchain entrepreneur Anthony Culligan and his wife Diane, who was chair of the women’s club. Four years later the club entered its next phase, joining Kang’s growing women’s football club portfolio in December 2023.Kang, already the owner of the NWSL side Washington Spirit and the eight-time Champions League winners Lyon, told the Guardian in August that her purchase of London City was part of her “mission to prove that women’s sports is good business”.In addition to the investment in her football clubs, she has provided a $50m (£40.3m) investment in the Kynisca Innovation Hub, a nonprofit organisation she founded dedicated to improving the health of female athletes, pledged a $30m five-year donation to US Soccer for the development of women’s and girls’ football, and committed $4m to the USA women’s rugby sevens team after watching them win bronze at the Paris Olympics.At London City there has been a steady overhaul of facilities, personnel and players since Kang took charge. At a slick press conference in central London in June 2024, the former Paris Saint-Germain Women head coach Jocelyn Prêcheur was unveiled as the new, the experienced Sweden international Kosovare Asllani was revealed as having signed from Milan, the relocation of the team’s home ground to Bromley’s Hayes Lane stadium was announced and the purchase of a 23-acre training facility in Kent was confirmed.Asllani has been joined by her compatriots Sofia Jakobsson and Julia Roddar (who went closest for the visitors at Meadow Park, curling an effort narrowly wide of the far post in the first half), and the five-time Champions League winner Saki Kumagai. These players are not acquisitions for the long term, ranging between 32 and 35 in age, but they are helping shift the club from last season’s eighth place to challenging for the title and the sole promotion spot to the WSL.View image in fullscreenMegan Campbell (in blue) takes on Arsenal’s Stina Blackstenius in their FA Cup tie.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersAgainst Arsenal, London City showed signs they would be capable of competing if or when they do get there, Laia Codina’s first-half header and Stina Blackstenius’s late strike the difference in a game that was far from easy for the home team. The margin could have been narrower, a lapse in concentration with just under 10 minutes remaining leading to the second goal, the former WSL regular Georgia Brougham robbed by Blackstenius as London City looked to play out from the back in the buildup to the goal.London City increasingly look as if they are building a setup capable of competing with WSL clubs on the pitch and from a financial point of view, but they need bums on seats if they are to give Kang a return on her investment in the medium to long term.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For London City to be successful they need to show a completely different way of doing things can work: that pumping in money providing success and results on the pitch can attract fan interest, commitment and loyalty. That is a big ask.Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesArsenal WomenWomen's FA CupWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Afterwards this man of the Midlands hardly sounded unenamoured of moving back for work despite the Rams being third-bottom and his side sixth in the Championship.“If they’ve made an official approach my first conversation will be with the owners and see where to take it from there,” he said.“I’m away from my family a lot, working my socks off to make sure we are competitive. When I came here we were on the way down and now we’re on the way up [so] we need to discuss with the owners.”Wolves, famous gold strip vivid in the grey afternoon, hoped to stroke possession about yet the wish was disrupted by a Eustace unit that featured three bright attackers behind Emmanuel Dennis. On the right, Amario Cozier-Duberry cut inside and his shot deflected into Sam ­Johnstone’s hands. On the opposite flank, ­Augustus Kargbo, on full debut, swept in, executed a one-two with Yuri Ribeiro, and blasted over.Vítor Pereira’s XI included his alpha-forward Matheus Cunha. Soon, class oozed from the ­Brazilian’s footwork down the left: he found ­Rodrigo Gomes, who relayed to Hwang Hee‑chan, whose effort was blocked.In the elemental conditions the contest’s punch and counter-blow warmed the senses. Kargbo’s pace was chief as he motored down his corridor, casting Jean-Ricner ­Bellegarde as a spectator. Santiago Bueno, also trailing, had to chop down the No 47.What ensued was a lucky escape for the visitors. John Buckley drifted the free-kick into the far post, Johnstone was helpless, Dom Hyam leaped and nodded home but was flagged offside. Replays showed he was almost certainly not but, as with Harry Maguire’s clear offside winner for Manchester United against Leicester, no VAR meant the decision stood.At this juncture, Rovers’ ­gameplan could be called Find Kargbo because the jet-heeled forward was an ­ongoing menace whom Eustace’s men looked to locate constantly. He collected on halfway and launched a raid that took him clean into Wolves’ area. After two mesmeric ­body-swerves he appeared to be felled by ­Emmanuel Agbadou. Kargbo appealed for a penalty but was booked by Lewis Smith. Replays proved the referee correct: the player hit a foot into the Wolves defender’s boot and induced the fall.Kargbo’s day was about to plummet further. Wolves, passing out from the back, fed him the ball but a ­miscontrol ceded possession and Wolves pounced.

Again Rovers imploded, allowing Cunha to finish a front‑to‑back sequence. Up went a punt along the inside-left channel. Collecting centrally, by the Rovers D, Cunha shifted play right, continued in this direction and, when he received once more, the strike was rapier-like, going across Toth into the far corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A ­Buckley cross clutched by ­Johnstone, ­Dennis’s burst on to a Kargbo pass and Todd Cantwell ­blazing over informed Wolves that the game was not over. Yet in all these forays, final-third profligacy was Rovers’ flaw.An abacus would help to keep track of the misses, as Cantwell’s free-kick was next palmed away by Johnstone, before Eustace replaced the No 8 with Makhtar Gueye. Rovers controlled the ball but Wolves controlled them, largely allowing possession in their half’s middle third but no closer to Johnstone.As the seconds ticked away it frustrated Blackburn and a wild 40-yard shot by Buckley was emblematic. At 2-0 up and cruising Wolves had the luxury of patience regarding when to move to prise their hosts open.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Two illustrations came. Rodrigo Gomes probed down the left, cut back on to his right, and stood the ball up for Marshall Munetsi, whose glancing header nearly gave the substitute a dream debut. A little later, Cunha meandered in from the same flank, Rovers’ rearguard slumbered, and the 25-year-old’seffort was palmed out by Toth. At the corner the ball bounced to Munetsi but his radar was, again, off.The story of Rovers’ day, in mic­rocosm, was Gueye failing to beat Johnstone, who saved. Like lightning, Wolves moved upfield and Pablo Sarabia also disappointed in front of goal. At the final whistle this was Rovers’ main emotion. Not for Pereira.“The most important is to answer this ­question: ‘Are you proud of your work?’ And I’m proud of my players,” said the Wolves head coach, who added that Hwang sustained a suspect hamstring issue the player does not think is serious.Explore more on these topicsFA CupBlackburn RoversWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was ejected from the stands and arrested.On Friday, a misconduct panel chaired by the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington, found that Coppin had breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct.He was dismissed from Essex police force without notice and will be placed on the College of Policing barred list.According to the Crown Prosecution Service, tragedy chanting is when fans sing, chant or gesture offensive messages about disasters or accidents involving players or other fans.Harrington said Coppin, who had previously had an unblemished career in policing, was being dismissed as the result of “a moment’s serious stupidity”, but that this was “the only appropriate outcome”.“It is clear that ex-Sgt Coppin was remorseful and may not have been aware of the impact of his words, but he has been criminally convicted of a public order offence,” the chief constable said.“His actions will seriously undermine public trust and confidence and I must send a clear message to officers, staff and the wider public that behaviour such as this cannot and will not be tolerated in policing.“If officers are responsible for upholding the law, it cannot be right that they break it.”Ch Insp Kevin Chatterton, ofMerseysidepolice, said: “This type of behaviour has no place in football. We will take action and identify those who commit hate crime in any form, and this includes unacceptable chanting which causes distress to others.”In a “fan information and chant warning”,published on its websitein January last year, Chelsea FC wrote: “Chelsea Football Club believes hateful chanting has no place in football.”Last season, Arsenal welcomed three-year banning orders handed downto three Arsenal fanswho pleaded guilty to tragedy-related abuse during an FA Cup match against Liverpool at the Emirates stadium, north London.Explore more on these topicsPoliceEssexLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)MerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

A 6-3, 7-5 loss to Alexandrova followedfirst-round defeats by Marketa Vondrousovain Abu Dhabi andCristina Bucsa in Singaporeas well as a third-round defeat byIga Swiatek in Melbourne.The 22-year-old, who again needed a wild card to secure entry to the tournament, has not tasted victory since her coach Nick Cavadaystepped downfor health reasons after the Australian Open. Raducanu’s mentor Jane O’Donoghue flew to Doha to offer support but could not help the former US Open champion engineer a change in fortunes.Alexandrova bounced back from her defeat against Raducanu by winning a WTA Tour title in Linz and the difference in confidence levels between the pair became apparent.As against Vondrousova last Tuesday, Raducanu got off to a strong start, moving into a 3-1 lead, and had she taken any of three chances for a second break of serve things might have turned out differently.But Alexandrova began to really find her range on her big ground strokes and by the time Raducanu won another game she was a break down in the second set. She took advantage of a dip from her opponent to lead 3-1 again but once more could not cement her advantage and Alexandrova claimed the crucial break at 5-5.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after the last‑gasp win on Saturday kick‑started England’s campaignSteve Borthwickrevealed both ­players could yet return for his side’s run-in.Was England’s win a watershed moment for Borthwick or a fleeting slice of joy?Read moreThe head coach heralded the 26-25 victory against France as evidence of his side’s improvement and, after two rounds of the Six Nations, England sit third in the table with six points, fourbehind the leaders Ireland, and can consider themselves in the title race.“I’m really happy for the players that they’ve got the win,” ­Borthwick said. “Everybody does want that thing that is tangible and a win is tangible, and the progress then is tangible.”Feyi-Waboso was expected to have surgery on his dislocated shoulder and miss the Six Nations but, after forgoing the operation he is “rehabbing well”, Borthwick revealed, and will potentially be available next month. The Exeter wing was in two mindswhether to have surgeryand as a recipient of an enhanced England contract, was in consultation with Borthwick and his backroom staff as to the best course of action. The Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, admitted those discussions had slowed the process down but avoiding surgery gives Feyi‑Waboso a chance of featuring in this year’s competition.Furbank could also feature, depending on the outcome of a ­specialist’s report. In his absence, both Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith have started at full-back – the latter moved to the No 15 jersey against France with Fin Smith deployed at fly-half – and could find his place in the side under threat if Furbank returns to fitness.“[George] is going well,” said Borthwick, who could also ­welcome Alex Dombrandt and Jack van ­Poortvliet back to fitness. “He had a re-X-ray on his arm last week and we are waiting on the specialist to give his view on that. Hopefully he might be available at the end of the tournament but we are still waiting for the specialist’s report.”England players have been allowed to return home during the first part of the first rest week and will reconvene at their Bagshot base on Wednesday to begin plotting a first Calcutta Cup win since 2020 on Saturday week. Fixtures against Italy at home and Wales away follow and though ­Ireland have proved the team to beat so far as the only side to win their first two matches, England remain in the hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The inscription had been in place since the racial justice protests that followed the 2020 murder ofGeorge Floydby a white police officer.Trump had campaigned againstNFLplayers “taking the knee” before kick-off in a symbolic gesture against to racism, a practice that has been discontinued.Alvin Tillery, a politics professor and diversity expert at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press that the NFL’s decision to remove “End Racism” slogans was “shameful” given that the league “makes tens of billions of dollars largely on the bodies of Black men”. Tillery said the league should explain who it was aiming to please.In astatementbefore heading to New Orleans from his home in Florida, Trump said he was looking forward to joining fans for a sense of national unity and patriotism.“The coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American dream,” he said.Trump also noted the 14 deaths and 35 injuries from the truck attack inNew Orleanson New Year’s Day: “We remember that 14 families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon Street.”A White House official said Trump will meet with family members of the attack who will be honorary coin toss participants just before the big game.Trump added that the game was an annual opportunity to transcend differences, saying that the Chiefs and Eagles’ coaches, players and staff “represent the hopes and dreams of our Nation’s young athletes as we restore safety and fairness in sports and equal opportunities among their teams”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then I’m going to go, go to the military. Let’s check the military,” the US president told the host from the rightwingFox News, adding: “We’re going to find billions, hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud and abuse.”In the last few weeks, Musk’s “department of government efficiency” has been trying to dismantle numerous federal agencies in Washington DC, going through data systems, shutting down DEI programs, and in some cases, attempting to eliminate entire agencies.Last week, Musk and Trump attempted to put thousands of workers of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) on leave, but a judge on Fridaytemporarily blockedthe effort.0:44Trump tells Fox News he expects Musk to find billions in Pentagon 'fraud and abuse' – videoWithout providing any evidence, Trump said in the Baier interview: “You take a look at theUSAid, the kind of fraud in there … We’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that’s going to places where it shouldn’t be going … It’s crazy. It’s a big scam.”Trump went on to reiterate his wish for Canada to be the 51st state.“I think Canada would be much better off being a 51st state because we lose $200bn a year with Canada and I’m not going to let that happen,” he added. “It’s too much. Why are we paying $200bn a year, essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state, I don’t mind doing it.”0:36Trump tells Fox News Canada 'would be much better off being a 51st state' – videoTrumpis the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, which has served as the finale of theNFLseason since 1966, although it is not unusual for a president to be part of Super Bowl programming.Presidents have traditionally given interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl, although both Trump andJoe Bidendeclined some requests during their first terms.Biden skipped theSuper Bowlinterview in 2024, in a move thatsome Democratic insiderssaw as a missed opportunity to speak directly to Americans. Biden’s aides said he eschewed the interview because he felt voters wanted a break from political news.This year’s interview is somewhat unusual. Fox is hosting theSuper Bowl, and has assigned Baier to host the interview. Baier is seen as less rabidly pro-Trump than some of his colleagues, but the move suggested from the beginning that the interview might not be as adversarial as one conducted by a less-partisan network.Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who moved to his members-only club in Florida after alienating much of his home state, has not indicated which team he will support.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSuper Bowl LIXFox NewsJoe BidenSuper BowlNFLUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That protection went a long way toward swinging the balance in a contestthat went down to the wire.

Joe Thuney has filled in at left tackle well but guards Mike Caliendo and Trey Smith have struggled in the postseason giving up 11 pressures on 58 passing snaps. If blockers aren’t all over their assignments then Philadelphia provide one of the worst matchups possible. Defensive tackles Carter and Milton Williams have the power to burst through the interior while Smith is highly disruptive from the edge. The depth of talent from players such as Jordan Davis and Josh Sweat also ups the ante compared to the defenses they have seen in the playoffs so far.Graham SearlesWhat thePhiladelphia Eaglesneed to do to winPlaster the Chiefs’ receivers.Mahomes has been immune to pressure, but he has struggled this season when forced to hold on to the ball. If the Eagles corners can hang in sticky coverage, Mahomes will be forced to scramble to create on his own. Ordinarily, that’s terrifying. For the Eagles, it would be a win.OCWin first down.If Barkley can get into a rhythm of consistent four- or five-yard gains on first-and-10, the Eagles’ path to victory broadens considerably. By avoiding the difficult second- and third-and-long situations that will allow Spagnuolo to dial up aggressive blitzes, Philadelphia’s playbook will expand to the quick throws, RPOs and designed runs that play to Hurts’ strengths (say nothing of more Saquon). Most important, it will control the clock and keep Mahomes off the field.BAGThen and now: how do the Eagles and Chiefs compare to 2023’s Super Bowl?Read moreGet Saquon going early and often to keep Mahomes off the field.Hurts must be better throwing the ball away if the Chiefs are to get any penetration. Perhaps most importantly, the Eagles’ pass defense, which was top-ranked during the season but has slipped in the playoffs, has to hold off Mahomes’s sweet spot: intermediate throws.MJLikely, Hurts has been thinking about his fumble in theSuper Bowlfor the past two years. It was the only blemish in an otherwise magnificent game which saw him defy expectations and duel throw for throw with Mahomes. If the Eagles want revenge,they can’t sabotage themselves– and Hurts can’t afford another massive mistake, even if it’s just the one.ALIf Hurts is fully healthy then expanding his role with designed runswill keep the Chiefs on their toes as they fixate on Barkley. Not that the running back needs any help to destroy Kansas City. The Eagles need to refrain from overthinking the scenario regardless of how historically great the opponent is. The team is set up for Barkley so just let him fly.GSView image in fullscreenIn Philadelphia’s three playoff games so far, Saquon Barkley has rushed for 442 yards and five touchdowns with three of his scores going for at least 60 yards.Photograph: Eric Hartline/USA Today SportsKey player for the ChiefsTravis Kelce, tight end.Kelce always shows up in the biggest moments. The Eagles’ defense is structured in a way that tight ends get plenty of opportunities to attack the middle of the field. It’s unclear if Philly will designate one of Cooper DeJean, Zack Baun, or Oren Burks (or a combination of two) to track Kelce. Regardless, Mahomes will look Kelce’s way on pivotal downs – and his tight end should have an edge.OCPatrick Mahomes, quarterback.You could make the case for right guard Trey Smith, who most likely draws the unenviable assignment of containing the formidable Carter. But as Mahomes goes, so go the Chiefs. His ability to avoid sacks, extend plays and make off-platform throws when things break down remains unmatched – and there’s nobody better at orchestrating a game-winning drive if the game is close in the fourth quarter.BAGXavier Worthy, wide receiver.Worthy, who scored in his debut, has only become more impactful as the season has progressed. Just the mere threat of Worthy with his all-world speed and explosive playmaking is enough to make Eagles defensive. coordinator Vic Fangio work overtime. If Worthy is successful on a few big plays, this game may not be close.MJKareem Hunt, running back.People forget: Hunt, the 2017 rushing leader, was the Chiefs’ breakout rookie, not Mahomes – who carried a clipboard that year. He just missed out on the beginning of the Chiefs’ dynastic run because of a domestic-violence incident that forced the team to waive him. Back after five years of football purgatory in Cleveland, Hunt isn’t the game-breaking threat he was when he was younger – but he’s still a strong runner and exceptional pass catcher who gets the job done.ALCharles Omenihu, edge defender.An underrated playmaker for the Chiefs has the ability to produce when it counts as he showed with a crucial batted-down pass in the final quarter against the Bills. Spagnuolo can rely on Omenihu to set a rock solid edge as the Chiefs throw everything at containing Barkley’s home runs.GSKey player for the EaglesJalen Carter, defensive tackle.The Chiefs have rejigged their offensive line and now have two clear weak points: left guard and right tackle. The Eagles have to take advantage. It’s over to Carter, a one-man inferno, to take advantage. The Eagles rarely move Carter around, meaning he will probably be one-on-one against Chiefs right guard Trey Smith. If Carter wins a ‘good on good’ matchup, the rest of his teammates should feast along the line. How often do Super Bowls come down to one, decisive sack? Carter is the front-runner to drop Mahomes and tilt the game.OCMilton Williams, defensive tackle.He may not have the same Q Score as Philadelphia’s other young defensive stars, but the 25-year-old lineman will play an important role in the Eagles’ attempt to slow down Kansas City’s offense. With Carter demanding double teams, Williams will have plenty of one-on-one chances against Chiefs left guard Caliendo, who’s struggled in pass protection. Williams’ elite 12.5% pressure rate ranks second among defensive tackles, and his disruptive presence could collapse the pocket, forcing Mahomes into uncomfortable throws. If Williams dominates his matchup, Philadelphia’s defense could replicateTampa Bay’s Super Bowl LV blueprint.BAGJalen Carter, defensive tackle.Carter has been a force all season and especially in the playoffs. In three games this postseason, Carter has 20 pressures, two sacks, three quarterback hits, and five run stops. If he dominates the Chiefs’ interior line as he has most other interiors, the Eagles have a hell of a shot.MJCooper DeJean, defensive back.Don’t judge a book by its cover: DeJean is an exceptional cornerback who hits as well as he covers. Mostly, the Eagles stick him on receivers in the slot, which means he will be charged with locking down another rookie – Worthy, the Chiefs’ primary downfield threat.ALJordan Mailata, left tackle.Mailata’s dominance on the line of scrimmage is the foundation of Philadelphia’s explosive offense. His blocking gives both Hurts an age to throw or scramble and Barkley acres of avenue to skip through. The Australian gunning for a first Super Bowl ring for his country allowed 14 pressures, one sack and no hits of his quarterback in 406 passing snaps in the regular season. And he only started playing the sport seven years ago.GSOne bold predictionThe Eagles score on a fake tush push.It’s time! Enough of creeping the ball along for a yard or two. The Eagles’ short-yardage play is a cheat code, but it’s time for them to spice it up. Philly have toyed with trick plays that leverage the fear of the Brotherly Shove, but they haven’t unveiled the long con in a huge spot.OCTrump at the Super Bowl: how the NFL’s culture war ended in surrenderRead moreDallas Goedert leads all players in receptions ... and rushes for a touchdown.Maybe not as bold a call as, say, Taylor joining Kendrick forBad Blood, but it would be some capper for Philadelphia’s dynamic tight end after injuries limited him to 496 yards receiving during the regular season. Goedert has always stepped up his production in the playoffs, including 4-for-47 with ahighlight-reel touchdownagainst the Packers, 4-for-56 against the Rams and a 7-for-85 outing in the NFC title game (and 13 more yards on two rushes) that extended a streak of nine straight playoff games with four or more catches. They’ve called his number consistently in the biggest of moments during the Hurts-Sirianni era and there will be no shortage of those on Sunday.BAGA profanity controversy will kick offafter Kendrick Lamar performs his Drake-diss track megahit Not Like Us but doesn’t censor quite as many lyrics as theNFLwould like.MJKendrick makes a statement either at Trump or about Trumpthat becomes the next great culture war controversy.ALPhiladelphia add another statue to their hall of backups as Kenny Pickett wins the Super Bowl.Edge defender George Karlaftis is going to aggravate Hurts’ knee injury only for King Kenny Pickett to save the day. If Nick Foles can topple Tom Brady, Pickett can slay Mahomes.GSView image in fullscreenPatrick Mahomes, left, and Travis Kelce have been the cornerstones of a Kansas City Chiefs dynasty that’s one win from an unprecedented Super Bowl three-peat.Photograph: Brooke Sutton/Getty ImagesWhich of these teams is most likely to be here next year?It’s theChiefs. They have the best quarterback and coaching staff and are oozing with young talent that can carry one dynastic run into the next. The Eagles have some tricky free-agent questions to address this offseason; the Chiefs will have all their key players back next season.OCBoth of them, probably.It’s hard to bet against Mahomes and Reid, who have become the Brady and Belichick of the 2020s. But Howie Roseman’sdeft, visionary front-office workhas Philadelphia positioned for long-term success in what appears to be the weaker conference ... and that’s even if arumored trade for Myles Garrettdoesn’t pan out. Whatever happens Sunday, a Chiefs-Eagles threequel is very much in play.BAGKansas City.Isn’t there some NFL by-law that states Mahomes must be in the Super Bowl? They’ve previously made it with a shaky defense, then without Tyreek Hill, and now with a past-his-prime Kelce. Nobody can seemingly stop this juggernaut.MJKansas City.With all due respect to Eagles GM Roseman, the Chiefs have been here five of the past six years.ALKansas City.Philadelphia’s problem is what the future holds at quarterback if they lose. Hurts has helped mould the Eagles into a juggernaut. His 46-20 regular season win-loss record is phenomenal compared to a 2020 draft class where all four QBs picked ahead of Hurts are definitely or at least arguably better passing technicians yet all have lesser CVs – Joe Burrow 38-30-1, Tua Tagovailoa 38-24, Justin Herbert 41-38, Jordan Love 18-15. If the Eagles lose, the knives will be out for a quarterback who at times struggles to make the most of his excellent wide receivers. If you keep Hurts then you risk upsetting AJ Brown and if you twist you throw away one of the most robust and versatile leaders in the NFL away. The Mahomes machine lacks any of this potential noise.GSThe Most Valuable Player will be …Patrick Mahomes.Against an outstanding Eagles defense, Mahomes will need to be near-perfect. The Eagles do not turn the ball over – and they force takeaways. Mahomes cannot afford to cough up a silly interception or fumble. Even without turnovers, the Chiefs will need the quarterback to conjure a moment or two of magic to get over the line. But Mahomes always raises his game on the biggest stage, and I’m guessing he will walk away with his fourth Super Bowl MVP.OCJalen Hurts.Should the Chiefs sell out to stop Barkley from beating them, it will be on Hurts to keep the defense honest by exploiting one-on-one matchups on Brown and DeVonta Smith while prioritizing ball security. The final stat line may not be as splashy as two years ago, when Hurts played arguably the best game of his career in a narrow 38-35 defeat, but the result will more than make up for it. Hurts’ win-loss record as a starter is 42-12 since 2022, second only to Mahomes (48-10) over that span. As a famous Louisianian once put it, it’s time toput some respek on his name.BAGSaquon Barkley.The offensive line will be at its best, and Barkley will showcase the same vision that has defined his sensational season. Barkley’s stats will be so massive - let’s say, 175-plus yards and two scores - that awarding a running back the MVP trophy for the first time since Denver’s Terrell Davis won it in 1998 will be a no-brainer.MJPatrick Mahomes.Picked for the third straight time, Mahomes joins Brady as the only player to win the award four times in a career.ALPatrick Mahomes.When the Chiefs win, by hook or by crook, it will be in large part because of the golden arm and mind of Mahomes. There may be a more decisive turn from Nick Bolton disrupting Barkley, or anyone disrupting him for that matter, but the crown will remain with Mahomes.GSThe final score will be …Chiefs 27-24 Eagles.The Eagles have the setup to disrupt the Chiefs. They can command the time of possession with Barkley and their run game and then release the hounds on defense to chase down Mahomes. But the Chiefs are a more adaptable team. If the Eagles are forced to play from behind or adjust their approach, the game could run away from them. Ultimately, this is a bet on the best quarterback, offensive play-caller, defensive coach and, yes, kicker in the league.OCChiefs 27-38 Eagles.Winning three Super Bowls on the trot is a task so difficult that no team has managed to even come within 60 minutes of it until this year. Both of these clubs are improved versions of the sides who met in that Glendale heart-stopper two years ago, but it says here Kansas City’s charmed postseason run will reach its terminus against a Philadelphia team loaded with talent on both sides of the ball. The deciding factor will be the the Eagles’ offensive line, the tallest and largest in Super Bowl history (average size: 6ft 6in and 338lb) and the secret sauce behind Barkley’s best ever season by an NFL running back. With their front five helping dictate the pace and limit the Chiefs’ time of possession, the Eagles will leave no doubt in bringing home a second Super Bowl title in eight years.BAGChiefs 24-32 Eagles.It’s hard to get as complete a team as the Eagles. The idea of their typically dominant offensive line setting up gaps for Barkley is quite promising, not to mention an extra week for Hurts to get healthy and return to dominating the blitz. Having recent Super Bowl experience should help Philly stave off any early-game jitters, too.MJChiefs 34-20 Eagles.The Chiefs do that thing they always do late in the season and run a bunch of plays out of formations no one’s seen before – and hit on enough of them to stay ahead at half-time. Hurts plays valiantly again, but this time it’s Barkley who mishandles the ball and definitively swings the momentum KC’s way. Throughout, Mahomes shines – not with the game of his life, but with another measured deployment of quick passing and timely running that carries the day. The Chiefs win, Mahomes takes MVP and the greatest ever debate expands from him and Brady to include Andy Reid and Bill Belichick. Trump goes home happy. America braces itself for 10 more years of this.ALChiefs 29-28 Eagles.Kansas City earn an unbelievable three-peat that has strangely also felt entirely expected from the get-go. In what is sure to be a thrilling game Mahomes will come out on top as the master finesser of the finest margins. A stunning two-point conversion from the QB to Kelce, who will then ride off into retirement, will seal history. The next challenge is making the dynasty unassailable with a fourth championship in succession.GSExplore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LIXSuper BowlNFLKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesPatrick MahomesTravis KelcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s a complete guide to the latest digital money maniaVictoria TurkSun 9 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 12.35 ESTShareThree days before his inauguration as US president,Donald Trumpmade an unusual move. He launched $Trump, a so-called meme coin that fans and speculators could buy in the hopes it would gain value. Initially, $Trump soared from a value of $7 to $75 per coin in a day, according to crypto price-tracking website CoinMarketCap. Two days later, it dropped to about $40 – just as incoming first lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, $Melania. Even the pastor at Trump’s inauguration ceremony, Lorenzo Sewell, got swept up in the meme coin frenzy, promoting a $Lorenzo version the same afternoon.So what exactly are meme coins, and why is everyone and their vicar suddenly getting involved?Meme coins are a type of digital asset based on a meme – usually something that has gone viral online. The best known is Dogecoin, inspired by the popular meme featuring a shiba inu dog that speaks in Comic Sans. But Dogecoin is a bit different from the slew of recent meme coins, says Simon Peters, crypto analyst at trading platform eToro. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin has its own blockchain – the decentralised ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The majority of other meme coins are “tokens”, meaning they operate on top of an existing blockchain and so require little in the way of technical development.These tokens are very easy to make; there are millions of them. The only real purpose of most meme coins is speculation: users create or buy them in the hope that their value will soar so they can make a lot of money very quickly.Sounds lucrative, what’s the catch?In reality, the vast majority of people lose money. Most meme coins are volatile and short-lived. They are also susceptible to what’s known as a “pump and dump” scheme or a “rug pull”, says Peters. This is when creators keep a lot of the tokens for themselves, hype up the project on social media to attract other buyers and increase the value, then dump all of their tokens – flooding the market and causing the price to crash. “Then everybody moves on to another one,” says Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at Sussex University. Given the crypto market is largely unregulated, investors have little recourse if something goes wrong.View image in fullscreenThe first lady has also launched her own meme coin, $Melania.Photograph: Beata Zawrzel/ShutterstockNo regulators, no guardrails, sounds iffy…All this hasn’t put people off, and there has been a boom in meme coins over the past year. Alexander compares it to the previousfad around NFTs, another type of crypto asset (you may remember people paying millions of pounds fordigital images of monkeys). There are a few reasons for the recent interest. January 2024 saw the launch of pump.fun, a platform that lets anyone easily create a meme coin (although it was blocked for UK users in December following awarning from the Financial Conduct Authority). The election of crypto-friendly Trump may also have emboldened the community. But a key driver of meme coins, says Alexander, is more of a social issue: “Young men, disillusioned, wanting to try and get rich quick.”They’re basically a form of gambling – an amped-up version of the stock market but with less connection to anything concreteMike Hearn, early bitcoin developerWhich would explain why they are based on internet in-jokes or puerile humour…Indeed. At the time of writing, several top meme coins reference dogs; the shiba inu breed is a particular touchpoint. Others include a Pepe token, based on the cartoon frog meme sometimes associated with the alt-right, and a Gigachad token, referencing an “alpha male” meme. Subjects of memes have also tried to parlay viral fame into crypto gains: in December, Haliey Welch, better known as “hawk tuah girl” after a viral video of her referencing oral sex, launched the $Hawk token, which promptlylost 95% of its value).Are bitcoin and meme coinsessentially the same?Though meme coins have their foundations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,early bitcoin developer Mike Hearnsays they have little to do with the original crypto vision. He left the bitcoin community in January 2016 as he didn’t agree with the direction in which it was headed. He wanted to see cryptocurrency used as a real alternative to traditional finance rather than just a speculative asset. Meme coins are a continuation of this trend, he says: “They’re basically a form of gambling – kind of a more amped-up version of the stock market, but with less connection to anything concrete.”Doesn’t sound any more crazy than an online betting site to me…Then consider the story of New Zealand-based artist Andy Ayrey, who trained an AI language model and set up an X account, @truth_terminal, for it to share its thoughts. Ayrey describes the bot as being like a teenager that “doesn’t have any social awareness of when to be gross and when not to be”. Truth Terminal particularly enjoyed posting about Goatse, a not-safe-for-work meme that has become part of early internet lore.The AI gained an interest in meme coins after interacting with crypto accounts on X, and Ayrey set up a crypto wallet on its behalf. Then things got weird. Inspired by the bot’s posts, a stranger – Ayrey says he doesn’t know who – created a Goatse-themed token on pump.fun and sent some to Truth Terminal. Truth Terminal promoted the token on its account, and “all hell broke loose”, says Ayrey. The market capitalisation of the token – the total value of all tokens – shot up. At its most valuable, around a month after launch, it reached more than $1.2bn, according to CoinMarketCap.The angrier people get about it, especially in traditional finance, the more people think Fartcoin is funny and it goes upAndy Ayrey, creator of Truth Terminal AI chatbotThe AI later became involved in another meme coin, Fartcoin, based on the rather more relatable meme (again, Ayrey says he doesn’t know the creator). Fartcoin reached a peak market cap of more than $2.3bn.SoAyrey was quids in?Not so simple. The whole experience introduced Ayrey to some of the issues around meme coins. He found that their value on paper massively eclipsed what he could actually get for them, owing to low liquidity. As soon as he sold the tokens, their value would decrease and would negatively impact others who held the tokens. Eventually, he worked out a private deal with a couple of investors on the basis that they wouldn’t dump the Fartcoin on the market. He admits it’s been amusing having to talk to finance and tax authorities about “liquidating Fart”. He believes this is part of the appeal for meme coin fans. “The more people get angry about it, especially in traditional finance, the more people think Fartcoin is funny and Fartcoin goes up,” he says.Who is making money then?The main people making money off crypto, says Alexander, are institutional investors – trading firms that use strategies that wouldn’t be allowed in regular stock trading. “All the big professional traders are making billions out of this, and ordinary people are losing their money,” she says.And Trump?Alexander sees his meme coin as being slightly different from many coins in that it has a potential alternative function on top of speculation: users buy it to show their support for the president. In this way, it’s similar to a “fan token”, like those produced by sports teams and players. The Trump token has drawn criticism owing to conflicts of interest; among other concerns, Trumpowns one of the entities collecting trading fees. Alexander thinks the motivation for the coin is simple: “It’s just showing that he can do this sort of thing,” she says. “He can do whatever he likes and he knows it.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesThe ObserverBitcoinDonald TrumpSocial mediaArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

Obstructing justice is not the answerSun 9 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 11.40 ESTShareDonald Trump’sexecutive orderreauthorizingsanctions against international criminal court(ICC) personnel reflects a disgraceful effort to ensure that no American, or citizen of an ally such asIsrael, is ever investigated or prosecuted. Quite apart from this warped sense of justice – that it is only for other people – the president’s limited view of the court’s powers was rejected in the treaty establishing the court and repudiated by the Joe Biden administration and even the Republican party. But that didn’t stop Trump.The US government traditionally has had no problem with two of the three ways that the court can obtain jurisdiction because it could control them. Washington is fine with the court prosecuting citizens of states that are members of the court because it has no intention of joining them. And it accepts that the United Nations security council can confer jurisdiction because it can exercise its veto to block prosecutions it doesn’t like.But the court’s founding document, the Rome Statute, allows a third route to jurisdiction. The court can investigate or prosecute crimes that occur on the territory of a member state, even if the perpetrator is the citizen of a non-member state. That was why Trump in his first term objected to an ICC preliminary examination in Afghanistan (andimposedsanctions – freezing assets and limiting travel – on the chief prosecutor at the time, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies) because the investigation might have implicated CIA torturers in that country under George W Bush. Trump in his new executive order alludes to the prosecutor’s actions in Afghanistan, but it is a non-issue because the current ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has made clear that those past crimes are not hispriority.Here’s how Democrats should fight back against Trump | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe real issue is Israel. That same territorial jurisdiction is how the ICC was able tochargeBenjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for theirstarvation strategytargeting Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Israel never joined the court, but Palestine did, conferring jurisdiction for crimes committed on Palestinian territory, including Gaza, regardless of the perpetrator’s citizenship.Referring to the United States andIsrael, Trump’s executive order says: “Neither country has ever recognized the ICC’s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war.” These claims are legally irrelevant.The US opposition to territorial jurisdiction was rejected by the drafters of the ICC treaty by an overwhelming vote of 120-7. The only governments tojointhe United States in opposing it were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and Yemen.Moreover, there is no ICC exception for “thriving democracies” or governments that purport to respect the laws of war. As any justice institution should, its jurisdiction applies to governments regardless of their character or stated policy. The sole exception is under what is known as the “principle of complementarity”, in which the court defers to good-faith national investigations and prosecutions.But Israel has no history of prosecuting its leaders for war crimes, and despite the ICC charges against Netanyahu and Gallant, it has announcedno investigationof their starvation strategy in Gaza. To the contrary, Israel’s Mossad intelligence agencythreatenedBensouda – the former ICC prosecutor – and her husband. That hardly reflects good-faith pursuit of possible war crimes.For two decades, the US government objected to territorial jurisdiction, but when theICC charged Vladimir Putin, it abandoned that position. Putin was charged for kidnapping Ukrainian children and taking them to Russia. Russia has never joined the court, so the sole basis for the court acting was territorial jurisdiction – Putin’s alleged crime took place in Ukraine, which had conferred jurisdiction.That was a game-changer. Biden called the charges “justified”. Even prominent Republicans such as Lindsey Graham, one of the foreign policy leaders in the Senate, shifted. Joined by a long bipartisan list of sponsors, he securedunanimousadoption in March 2022 of aresolutionendorsing the ICC’s prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. Grahamsaidthat Putin’s “war crimes spree” had “rehabilitate[d] the ICC in the eyes of the Republican party and the American people”. Other Republicansvisitedthe ICC prosecutor to support the prosecution of Putin.Yet this shift turned out to be only tactical. It did not survive theIsrael exceptionto human rights principles. Now that senior Israeli officials have been charged, Trump has resurrected the objection to the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction.There is nothing the least bit radical about asserting jurisdiction over people who commit a crime on foreign territory. If I, an American citizen, murdered someone in London, Washington could hardly object if British authorities prosecuted me. By the same token, Britain would have every right to delegate that power to the ICC if, because of a crisis such as an occupation, it were unable to pursue the matter itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Article 70 of theRome Statuteauthorizes prosecution for what Americans call “obstruction of justice” if anyone tries to impede or intimidate an official of the court because of their official duties. Bensouda essentially turned the other cheek when Trump sanctioned her. I would be surprised if Khan, the current prosecutor, were so understanding. The court would have jurisdiction over Trump because he is interfering with a pending prosecution.What will Trump 2.0 mean for the global world order? | Stephen WertheimRead moreTrump might try to shrug off ICC charges, figuring that no one would dare to arrest him, but he would face other consequences. Because all 125 ICC member states would have a legal duty to arrest him were he to show up, they would probably tell him quietly that he is not welcome. Trump should ask Putin, who had toskipthe August 2023 Brics summit in Johannesburg for the same reason, what it feels like to be a global pariah.Israel has other options.

She disclosed the impact of repeated and distressing delays in court appearances, often at the last minute – which had serious impacts on her mental health and ultimately led to her quitting the job she loved. She told me the prosecuting lawyer had changed multiple times, and often she discovered this only when she turned up to court and was met by a different person.Would you advise a loved one to a report sexual assault? It’s a question that exposes a failing justice system | Lucy ClarkRead moreSarah shared her distress at how, like all sexual violence victims, she had no one in court representing her – our system viewed her merely as a “witness” to her rape. I was shocked when she told me that she is afraid to leave her home alone – not because she is afraid of being raped but because she doesn’t ever want to go through the traumatic experience of navigating our legal system again.I have heard similar experiences from women across the country.Women report inadequate responsesfrom different parts of the system, leaving them further traumatised, disengaged and unable to heal and recover. One woman expressed deep regret about reporting her sexual assault. Another described “being killed slowly and systematically through the destruction of her life, autonomy and basic human rights”.In 2023 the rates of sexual violence reported to police reached a 31-year high. We must do better to change this trajectory.Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tells a grim story. Since 2010 reported sexual assaults against women have increased by 58%, with reported sexual assault against men increasing by 65% in the same period. One in five women and one in 16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15.We are seeing disturbing increases in harmful sexual behaviours in young peopleThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Only 7.7% of women who experienced sexual assault in the 10 years before 2021-22 reported the latest attack on them to police. This makes sexual violence one ofthe most under-reported crimesin the country.Early last year the federal government asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to inquire into justice responses to sexual violence. The ALRC has now provided its report to the attorney general.This inquiry represents a crucial opportunity to improve our justice and systems responses, so they are providing justice and enabling healing. So that we are holding those who commit sex crimes accountable, and intervening to prevent sexual violence happening.Real change will require cultural transformation – within law enforcement, the courts and the broader community. Too often we hear sexual violence minimised, dismissed or ignored. This is not just a failure of our laws, it is a societal failure.Most offenders (97%) are men. If we are serious about ending sexual violence, we need to do more to understand why some men commit it. Understanding the pathways into this behaviour will help us understand the most effective ways to intervene and prevent sexual violence. We are seeing disturbing increases in harmful sexual behaviours in young people and sexual violence being committed at younger ages. We need to understand why this is happening and support evidence-informed interventions to turn this around.We must do better. We have a responsibility to regain the community’s trust – people need to feel confident that if they report to the police they will be listened to with compassion and that they will see action taken to achieve justice.*Name has been changed to protect privacyMicaela Cronin is the domestic, family and sexual violence commissionerInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

I urge my former colleagues to resist themBritain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, former diplomat claimsSun 9 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 13.07 ESTShareMy name is Mark Smith. I am a former diplomat and policy adviser at theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO). I spent my career working in the Middle East directorate and serving in the Arab world. As a lead officer on arms sales policy, I was responsible for assessing whether the UK government’s arms sales adhered to legal and ethical standards under domestic and international law.In August 2024,I resignedover the UK government’s refusal to halt arms sales to Israel amid the bombardment of Gaza. This decision followed over a year of internal lobbying and whistleblowing. My resignation made headlines, and weeks later, the new Labour government announced it would finallysuspend arms sales to Israel. While this was welcome, it came far too late. Israel has continued to commit atrocities in Gaza as the UK stands by, unwilling to act.My time at the FCDO exposed how ministers can manipulate legal frameworks to shield “friendly” nations from accountability. They stall, distort and obscure official processes to create a facade of legitimacy, while allowing the most egregious crimes against humanity to take place. Now, as the US – one of our closest allies – proposes the full-scaleethnic cleansing of Gaza, what will our response be?What I witnessed was not just moral failure but conduct that I believe crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes. The British public deserves to know how these decisions are made behind closed doors – and how systemic dysfunction enables the government to perpetuate harm while shielding itself from scrutiny.As a lead adviser on arms sales policy, my role was to gather information on the conduct of foreign governments involved in military campaigns, particularly regarding civilian casualties and adherence to international humanitarian law. This information formed the basis of reports that advised ministers on whether continued arms sales were lawful.The UK’s legal framework is clear: arms sales must cease if there is a “clear risk” that weapons could be used to commit serious violations of international law. Civil servants are bound by a strict code of impartiality, requiring us to produce neutral, evidence-based advice. Any attempt to alter or manipulate this advice for political convenience is not just unethical – it is unlawful.However, during my tenure, I witnessed senior officials under intense pressure from ministers to skew the legal assessment. Reports were repeatedly returned to me with instructions to “rebalance” the findings – to downplay evidence of civilian harm and emphasise diplomatic efforts, regardless of the facts. I was often summoned for verbal instructions – a tactic deliberately employed to avoid creating a written record that could be subject to freedom of information requests or legal scrutiny.In one instance, a senior official bluntly told me, “This looks really bad,” before urging me to “Make it look less stark.” My protests were ignored. Significant edits were made to my reports, shifting the focus away from credible evidence of war crimes to paint a misleading picture of “progress” by foreign governments. This was not an isolated case – it was part of a systemic effort to suppress inconvenient truths.The most concerning example of this manipulation occurred during my work on arms sales to Saudi Arabiaamid its military campaign in Yemen. The UK government was fully aware that Saudi airstrikes were causing massive civilian casualties. In a high-level meeting with senior officials, including legal advisers, it was acknowledged that the UK had exceeded the threshold for halting arms sales. Yet instead of advising ministers to suspend exports, the focus shifted to finding ways to “get back on the right side” of the law.Rather than confronting the illegality, officials resorted to delaying tactics – extending reporting deadlines and demanding additional information that was unnecessary. This “wait for more evidence” approach created a loophole, allowing arms sales to continue while the government feigned compliance. I raised my concerns repeatedly, only to be overruled. One of my colleagues, equally troubled by what we were witnessing, resigned over the issue. I soon followed.The UK was ultimately forced to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia afterlosing a judicial reviewbrought by civil society organisations. But instead of learning from this failure, the government responded by changing the lawto make it harderto challenge arms exports in court. A year later,arms sales to Saudi Arabia resumed.While the Saudi case was alarming, what I witnessed regarding UK arms sales toIsraelwas even more concerning. Israel’s repeated bombardments of Gaza have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed vital infrastructure, actions that are clearly incompatible with international law. Yet the UK government continued to justify arms sales to Israel, relying on the same flawed processes and evasive tactics.During Israel’s current military campaign inGaza– a campaign marked by unprecedented destruction and the deliberate targeting of civilian areas – I grew increasingly concerned. By this time, I was serving as a diplomat in Dublin, where Ireland’s staunch support for Palestine put me in an uncomfortable position. I was expected to defend UK policy, but I could not in good conscience do so without answers.When I raised questions with the FCDO about the legal basis for our arms sales to Israel, I was met with hostility and stonewalling. Emails went unanswered. I was warned not to put my concerns in writing. Lawyers and senior officials besieged me with defensive instructions to “stick to the lines” and delete correspondence. It became clear that no one was willing to address the fundamental question: how could continued arms sales to Israel possibly be legal?The Foreign Office’s handling of these issues is nothing short of a scandal. Officials are bullied into silence. Processes are manipulated to produce politically convenient outcomes. Whistleblowers are stonewalled, isolated and ignored. And all the while, the UK government continues to arm regimes that commit atrocities, hiding behind legal loopholes and public relations spin.I followed every internal procedure available to me to raise my concerns. I engaged the whistleblowing team, wrote to senior officials and even contactedthe foreign secretary, David Lammy, directly. At every turn, I was met with delays, obfuscation and outright refusal to engage. It became clear that the system is not designed to hold itself accountable – it is designed to protect itself at all costs.The UK’s complicity in war crimes cannot continue. We must demand transparency and accountability in our arms export policies. Ministers must be held to the same legal and ethical standards that they claim to uphold. Civil servants must be empowered to provide impartial advice without fear of political interference, and whistleblowers must be protected, not punished, for speaking the truth.The situation in Gaza could not be more acute. The UK’s closest ally now proposes the mass expulsion of 2.1 million people from Gaza and the demolition of one of the most densely populated civilian areas on Earth – this is ethnic cleansing.I call on my former colleagues – those who still believe in the values of integrity and justice – to refuse to be complicit. Do not rubber-stamp reports that whitewash crimes against humanity. This is not self-defence – it is collective punishment. It is genocide. The time for silence is over. Do not allow ministers to trade human lives for political expediency. The time for accountability is now.Mark Smith is a former Foreign Office policy adviserDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His mother, Laila Soueif, and I have used it to challenge Downing StreetSun 9 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 09.03 ESTShareAlaa Abd el-Fattah knows about hunger strikes. When I was locked up in a cell next to him in Cairo’s notorious Tora prison in early 2014, he and I would stride the exercise yard discussing Egyptian politics, history, political reform, and – yes – forms of protest and resistance, including starving yourself.Hunger strikes, he explained, are the ultimate tool of the powerless. When all other forms of agency are stripped away, all that remains is to exercise control over the one thing left: your own body. That would become my first lesson in strikes.Alaa is Egypt’s best-known political prisoner. He was one of the young, social media-savvy activists who helped move millions of Egyptians on to the streets in the revolution of 2011. Because of his popularity, charisma and capacity to mobilise people, he also has the dubious distinction of being locked up by every regime since he’s been alive (including several that lasted barely a year).Soon after I arrived at Tora, Alaa and a group of other activists launched their own hunger strike to force the prison to respect our rights. We were only allowed two hours of exercise a day, and one family visit every two weeks; both in clear violation of Egypt’s own laws that said prisoners in pre-trial detention were entitled to four hours of exercise and weekly visits. They had already smuggled out letters to the press announcing the strike.At mealtimes, trays of food would clatter to the floor in the corridor outside the strikers’ cells as they shouted their demands. At times it got heated, with the guards insisting they were weighing the food and knew the prisoners were secretly eating (they weren’t). But in the end, after a week of rancour, Alaa and his colleagues won. The prison authorities backed down, fearing a ferocious public backlash should any of the prisoners die.And that’s lessons two and three in hunger strike strategy: there is no point doing it if nobody knows, and limit your demands to what is within your rights. It is vital to hold on to the moral high ground.That is exactly what his mother,Laila Soueif, is doing now. The extraordinarily resilient, stoic 68-year-old grandmother has been on strike since 30 September, the day after her son was due for release.After being arrested in 2019, Alaa was convicted and sentenced in 2021 to five years for “publishing false news”, in an utterly spurious case widely seen as an attempt to silence a prominent democratic voice. That sentence should have ended on 29 September last year. But with astonishing cynicism, the Egyptian government decided it would calculate his term from the day he was convicted, ignoring time served in pre-trial detention as its own laws require, and adding two years to Alaa’s time behind bars.Alaa and Laila are both British-Egyptian dual citizens, which means the British government has a responsibility to make sure their rights are respected. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, advocated forAlaa on a recent trip to Cairo, but so far without even gaining consular access. That is why she and I have been holding daily one-hour vigils outside Downing Street calling on the prime minister to intervene, and why I have also been on my own more limited hunger strike of 21 days to help draw attention to this symbolic case.Laila’s demands are straightforward and entirely reasonable. As Alaa did back in 2014, she is simply asking the Egyptian and British governments to respect their own laws and obligations.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah.Photograph: Omar Robert Hamilton/ReutersBut hunger strikes are grave undertakings. In a quiet conversation during one of our vigils, Laila told me she is doing this because she is convinced the only way she can get the British and Egyptian leaders to act is to precipitate a crisis.“I am not suicidal,” she said. “More than anything, I want to see Alaa again, free and with his own son [also in the UK]. But I also know I must be prepared to keep going to the end if that is what it takes. I have had a good life, and I want him and his sister, who has given up everything to campaign for him, to have their lives back too.”That conviction is something Britain’s most famous hunger striker, Bobby Sands, would have recognised. The Irish nationalist died in 1981 after refusing food for 66 days to demand that he and his fellow republican detainees be allowed to wear their own clothes, get regular visits and mail, and be treated as political prisoners rather than common criminals. (Sands, whose last days were dramatised in the Steve McQueen film Hunger, consumed only water, unlike Laila who is also taking electrolytes and salt – both necessary for vital organ functions.)In the 2008 Steve McQueen movie Hunger about Sands’s last days, Father Dominic Moran pays him a visit. The priest says: “You start a hunger strike to protest for what you believe in. You don’t start already determined to die. Or am I missing something here?”British-Egyptian dissident mulls giving up citizenship over failure to be releasedRead more“It’s in their hands,” Sands replies. “Our message is clear. They’re seeing our determination … Putting my life on the line, Dom, is not just the only thing I can do. It’s the right thing.” Nine more hunger strikers would die before the government granted their demands to the remaining prisoners.Laila’s unyielding love for her children and for justice is her driving force. She is now weak, and her vital signs are well into the danger zone, but she is as determined as Sands and as convinced of the legitimacy of her campaign. She also believes it will be successful, if not before she dies, then perhaps because of the outrage that must inevitably follow.And that may be the final lesson in strikes: a clear-headed, unwavering sense of purpose. As Sands says in Hunger: “I have my belief. And in all its simplicity, that is the most powerful thing.”Peter Greste is a professor of journalism at Macquarie University and the executive director of the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom.He was imprisoned in Egypt in 2013 on terrorism charges while reporting for Al Jazeera and released after 400 days.

The verse speaks of the destitution one embodies before God, pleading for a shred of mercy. Powerful though it is, at the time I did not think of locating the source of the verse. It sufficed merely as a decoration.Months later, I stumbled upon the entire poem from which the line is found. Two verses resonated with me: the verse inscribed on the tableau, and the verse that immediately precedes it:Fasten a goblet to my shroudSo that upon that DayWith the overflowing wineMy heart’s fear I’ll allayI’m in tatters at your thresholdSo have mercy on meFor other than to your great loveI have no place to fleeI knew when I read these verses that I had come across something worth noting and pondering; that I had struck gold with Hafez’s paradoxical imagery. Paradox is the playground of Persian poets and within that arena Hafez reigns supreme.View image in fullscreenThe handcrafted miniature gold tableau Ali Hammoud bought on his latest trip to IranPhotograph: Supplied by Ali HammoudIn the first verse Hafez embodies the nonchalant, carefree attitude of the Qalandar Sufi. The Islamic tradition encourages mourners to tie sacred relics to the shroud of the deceased: inscriptions of prayers and litanies, or perhaps soil sourced from a sacred land. Hafez inverts this procedure, instead imploring his morticians to fasten a goblet of wine to his corpse. As Hafez had committed the Qur’an to memory, he knew all too well that alcohol is strictly forbidden inIslam. His usage of wine here may be read as allegorical but the intended effect is clear: he is intentionally provocative, openly flirting with blasphemy. He holds no fear of the wrath he may incur for his bold actions.In the second verse Hafez adopts a radically different approach. The shift in tone is markedly noticeable in the Persian. Here he becomes the meek, humble servant; the grovelling pauper who seeks but a sliver of God’s mercy. There is no talk of wine, nor any hint of irreverent disobedience. There is only hope and fear.What, then, are we meant to learn here from Hafez?Hafez is illustrating for us, in a way that only he can, the balanced perspective that we should adopt when we think about, or supplicate to, God. Indeed, many who believe in God struggle to conceive of the relationship they should hold with God: what kind of relationship should one hold with an all-powerful entity that is simultaneously capable of great reward and punishment?Hafez answers that we should hold hope and fear in equal measure. Indeed, in our relationship with God, we should strive for a balance between competing emotions. God is to be loved, feared, beseeched and revered.Without any hope in God, despair settles within our souls and we fall victim to the snares of nihilism. Without any fear, we drape ourselves in garments of hubris and become emboldened beyond measure, going beyond all moral limits. Without any love of God, the relationship between creation and Creator that extends beyond time devolves into a long-winded business transaction.It is in the balance of these competing emotions that one gets closer to making sense of our relationship with God. Indeed, for Hafez, these emotions funnel into each other, and at their peak, melt into each other: within hope lies a seed of fear; and within fear lies a seed of hope, each tempering the excesses of the other. Simmering beneath these emotions is love, for love is a precondition to holding any hope or fear.This is my interpretation of the verses of Hafez, based on my own faith tradition and worldview. It represents the ideal emotional state of a believer, one that I rarely achieve in my life.I have often feared God far too little, held on to unreasonable hopes, and uttered words of love that were untethered to actions. But the poetry of Hafez reminds me of what I should be striving for and, thankfully, has become far more than a decoration.Ali Hammoud is a PhD candidate at Western Sydney University.

The public isn’t falling for itSun 9 Feb 2025 08.21 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 11.12 ESTShare“Keir doesn’t engage in the political process. He got this far by not expressing any political opinions … He’s good with people, but he doesn’t debate big ideas.”After 200 pages of a compelling new book about the Labour party’s return to power, the story falls into a run of these quotations.Get In, by the Westminster journalists Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, makes it clear that after he became the Labour leader, Keir Starmer developed an incredible ruthlessness. Casting him as the kind of operator who ought to be renowned for the trail of human wreckage they leave in their wake, the book highlights the “many people whose careers have come to a brutal end at Starmer’s remorseless hand”. His readiness to behave like that, however, does not come from any ideological zeal, but rather its opposite: an absence of convictions and ideals that means he can shape-shift – and dispatch colleagues and allies – with a blithe ease.In 2021, we are told, the Labour leader was visited at home by one of his predecessors, Ed Miliband, and Tony Blair’s old flatmate,Charlie Falconer, who presented him with a handful of challenges: “Are you left? Are you right? Are you middle? Why should we be in power?” No answers seemed to be forthcoming: the problem, among others, was that Starmer was “a leader who did not much like politics”. This revelation explains the other defining feature of his time at the top: the fact that, as Maguire and Pogrund tell it, Starmer has taken his most basic political orders from a coterie – or “project” – centred on his all-powerful strategist and mentor Morgan McSweeney.In that sense, the directionless mess the government has fallen into has two interlocking causes. Having cunningly manoeuvred Labour to victory, Starmer’s advisers have apparently failed to supply him with a coherent governing script, exposing his lack of politics, and leaving him panicked. Onlookers sense this as a matter of instinct: his approval ratings, for what they are worth,have lately registered numberseven worse than Rishi Sunak’s low point. In focus groups,voters reportedlyoffer such opinions as “He looks like a rabbit caught in headlights.” Aside from his obvious liking for international diplomacy, his famed ruthlessness seems to sit alongside the kind of discomfort with his job that people always find troubling – witness the way that such ill-at-ease premiers as Gordon Brown and Theresa May never really connected with the public.There is still – just about – an identifiably social-democratic strand in some of what the government is doing – from Angela Rayner’s mission on new workplace rights, through moves onpublic transport, to plans for new investment in our hospitals and schools. The problem is that the relevance of this stuff to Starmer and his colleagues’ sense of purpose is falling away. Worse still, the resulting vacuum is now being filled by manic, feckless lurches into places that no centre-left government ought to go.Reboots and relaunches now seem to arrive on an almost weekly basis: the latest isall about being “disruptors”, and delivering shocks and surprises that may not actually be shocking or surprising at all. Last week, Labour launched online adverts seemingly purposelycreated to look like Reform UK propaganda, complete with such slogans as “Labour hits 5-year high in migrant removals” – the kind of flimsy posturing that surely makes it look like Nigel Farage is dictating the political weather, and encourages even more people to support him. The same applies to an imminent run of grim campaigning videos thatwill focus on deported immigrants, following them “from detention in early morning raids to transfer from bleak immigration removal centres to waiting planes and … footage aboard flights out of the country”.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner arrives at 10 Downing Street for a cabinet meeting, 28 January 2025.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockAt the same time, the kind of moves that might substantially weaken Reform UK’s insurgency in old Labour heartlands seem to be off limits. Angela Rayner today talked upLabour’s determination to meet its target of building 1.5m new homes, but who sees any signs of that? And amid plansto drastically develop the corridor between Oxford and Cambridgeand build a third runway at Heathrow – eventually – what of the seemingly flatlining prospects of the old coalfields and manufacturing centres where Farage and his party may soon clean up?Which, once we are past a work and pensions secretary claiming that many people on sickness and incapacity benefits are“taking the mickey”while her departmentthreatens cruel cuts, brings us to the current defining feature of Starmerism. The government’s re-energised belief in economic growth at all costs is exactly what people with precious few substantial ideas would pick as their chosen cause. Given that it now entails brazen strides away from the green agenda that Starmer and his allies once claimed was the absolute fulcrum of their politics, it heightens their air of twitchy desperation.Monomaniacal growthism is also making Starmer’s administration sound discomfitingly weird, something highlighted bya quote from a government spokespersonincluded in a recent run of stories about the UK’s childhood mental health crisis: “We are committed to raising the healthiest generation of children ever and recognise the importance of this to our number one mission – economic growth.” The tone suggests one of Stalin’s five-year plans being fronted by Alan Partridge.Get In by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund review – behind the scenes with Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s arch strategistRead moreMore troubling still, growth’s motor will be the government’s latest drive: deregulation. A recent Starmer piecein the Timessuggested that his lack of values is also manifested in an odd historical amnesia, and the choice of language it produces: he compared “a morass of regulation” to “Japanese knotweed”, and insisted on the urgent need to “curb regulator overreach”. Most of us know what that kind of zealotry has led to: the financial crash of 2008, the Grenfell Tower disaster and a country full of sewage-strewn rivers. And flirting with it gifts Labour’s opponents with ready-made attack lines. Watch what happens next time Rayner breaks cover to extol the wonders of limits to zero-hours contracts and restrictions on fire-and-rehire tactics: the right will trill endlessly about new additions to what Starmer calls “thickets of red tape”.At the end of Get In, the authors tell the story of the night that went from 4-5 July 2024, which now feels like it happened a very long time ago. Starmer is caught making a speech at Tate Modern at 5am, to a crowd full ofLabourparty insiders: “Change begins now! … Four and a half years of work changing the party. This is what it is for.”Seven months on, those words have an unsettling quality, centred on how flimsy Labour’s programme now feels, and the glaring political void at the top. Starmer’s emptiness, moreover, is not just a problem for his party: it blurs into the even bigger story of how weak orthodox politics seems in the face of global threats that are still unfolding. As the new right runs riot around the world, does this government feel like it might blaze a trail away from all the chaos, or soon be swept away by it, as another confused relic of a faded political past? Increasing numbers of people seem to know the answer to that question. The fact that it feels so likely is surely terrifying.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

They are two sides of a coin – as our politicians should realiseSun 9 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 12.43 ESTShareIf you care about the world we are handing on to future generations, the news on Thursday morning was dramatic. This January was thewarmest on record; temperatures in 18 of the past 19 months have exceeded pre-industrial averages by 1.5C. There can be no comfort that the epoch-changing climate crisis is 20 or even 10 years away. It is already upon us.Temperatures should have been moderated this winter by cooler air over the Pacific; it did not happen. Scientists are bewildered and scared. James Hansen, doyen of climate crisis research, believes that, unless this pace of deterioration is reversed, warm ocean waters flowing from the southern to the northern hemisphere will be trapped as vast sea currents cease. Sea levels will rise to impose a civilisational threat. It is a global imperative to dial down the rate of carbon emissions.Yet this, according to President Trump, is just climate change fanaticism. Hence his withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, the evisceration of the country’s environmental protection regulation to boost American fossil fuel production by at least another 3m barrels a day, and Friday’s suspension of Biden’s $5bn electric vehicle (EV) charging programme. The injunction is to drill, baby, drill. Burning fossil fuels is somehow manly and pro-economic growth; American banks and investment houses that just a few years ago were signing up for concerted climate action are now taking their cue from Trump and resigning their membership in droves.There are echoes in Britain. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party regards the climate crisis as a scam, derides spending money on it and calls for a referendum to end the statutory commitment to achieve net zero by 2050. Ditto Kemi Badenoch, who talks of “eco-nutters”. Rachel Reeves, not to be outflanked by the right, declares that any tensions between commitments to act on climate change and measures to boost economic growth and secure financial credibility should be resolved in favour of the latter – hence her backing a third runway at Heathrow. On Radio 4’sTodayprogramme, the premise for Friday’s interview with the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, was that tackling climate change necessarily meant less growth – a syllogism he failed to recognise.It is as if events inChinaare on another planet. Here, the leadership – obviously fanatical “eco-nutters” – defines the drivers of its economic growth as the “new three” – solar cells, lithium ion batteries and electric vehicles (the old three were household appliances, furniture and clothing), in all of which it is the dominant producer. Thus the cost of solar panels has fallen by more than 90% in the past decade as China has scaled up production in every component, innovatively transforming the underlying technology; the resulting energy is so cheap that in the Gulf, where there is plentiful sun, solar-produced electricity is regarded as free. Even in Republican Texas, solar energy is taking off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because of the climate crisis, producing EVs was obviously the future: the Chinese EV producer BYD now outproduces Elon Musk’s Tesla, with a better range of cars. Its Seagull, for example, retails for $9,700 (£7,800) and, using solar electricity, is very cheap to run. The production of lithium batteries for EVs is another strategic necessity where China dominates, driving the price down by 90% over the past 10 years. It is not regulation, high taxes and eco-fanaticism that has laid the European car industry so low, as Trump and co like to argue; it is that Europeans did not grasp the growth possibilities of beating the climate crisis fast and aggressively enough. Heading off civilisational disaster and promoting growth are not at odds; they are two sides of the same coin.Here,Labourcould have been the European exemplar, but it has volunteered to box itself in with pledges to appease the right. Some of the pledges that constituted its once bold commitment to the green new deal and just transition still stand – it remains committed to clean energy production by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050 – but the narrative is compromised. Thus, for example, it could have accompanied its support for letting the assessment for a third runway at Heathrow go forward by simultaneously announcing a tax on private jets not using sustainable aviation fuel and huge rebates on increased air passenger duty for commercial operators that do the same. If the exploitation of the Rosebank oilfield is to proceed, then at least insist that the Norwegian operator Equinor restores cuts to its renewable energy programme and hypothecate tax revenues to boost the national wealth fund.In future, British cheap, sustainable electricity will come from two principal sources: renewables and the new generation of small nuclear modular reactors (NMRs), safer and cheaper than their larger rivals and where Rolls-Royce is among the market leaders. The Czech Republic has signed a memorandum of understanding with Rolls-Royce to buy three of its reactors on the private understanding that the British government will buy as well; but even as Keir Starmer rightly extolled NMRs on Thursday at Lancashire’s National Nuclear Laboratory, there was still no commitment. Labour should just declare its intent to buy. Britain could be as dominant in this technology as China is in its “new three”. Meanwhile, the imaginative Xlinks project, proposing to pipe electricity from solar panels in Morocco to Britain, which could supply 8% of our electricity, should be turbo-charged.There is too little sense of urgency; too much fear of offending the right and Trump. When Treasury officials debate the merits of paying for energy resilience by developing British capacity in renewables and NMR, or just buying in from China or the US to get “value for money” and so reduce inflation risk, they lean into the latter, confident they will win the chancellor’s support. But this is Labour’s opportunity to face down its critics. The American and British right are plain wrong. Growth, cheap energy and averting the civilisational threat of the climate crisis are all possible. Labour should recover its convictions and find the courage to act.Will Hutton is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionLabourChinaRenewable energyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsDonald TrumpEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Female employees should not be expected to share changing rooms with male colleagues. They shouldn’t be socially shamed into undressing around them, or being in spaces where male colleagues get undressed in front of them.There is a host of principles and evidence around women’s privacy, dignity and safety to be marshalled in support of this – the charity Sex Matterslays them out– but most people don’t need to read accounts of how uncomfortable mixed-sex changing facilities make some women feel, or statistics showing that voyeurism and exposure are two of the most common male sex crimes, to understand how wrong this would be.But not managers at NHS Fife, it would seem. Despite the law of the land enshrining that commonsense insight – that employers are obliged to provideseparate changing facilitiesfor their male and female employees – female staff working for this Scottish health board have been expected to share changing rooms with a male doctor who identifies as female. One nurse, Sandie Peggie, has brought an employment tribunal claim for harassment, sex discrimination and victimisation against the board, following her suspension after she raised concerns.Peggie shared her account of what happened with the tribunal last week. She initially talked to her line manager on a couple of occasions, including after Dr Beth Upton, the male doctor in question, walked into the room while she was partially undressed. Her manager said she passed on the nurse’s concerns but didn’t get anywhere; Peggie said that if she were put in that position again, she would need to address it with Upton. This is what happened a few months later, when she found herself needing to use the changing room after heavy menstrual bleeding.Peggie says she told Upton she felt embarrassed and intimidated; but the doctor claimed as much right to be there as she did. Peggie says she raised her previous experiences of sexual assault to try to engender understanding, and mentioned a recent case when a male prisoner had been put in a female prison. She described how she was “shaking with distress”. After this encounter, Upton put in a formal complaint, and Peggie was suspended for bullying and harassment.The board put a survivor of sexual assault in a traumatic situationThe facts of what happened will be ruled on by the employment tribunal, which is midway through the hearing. But enough has emerged to be certain thatNHSFife has treated this nurse, who has a 30-year track record, appallingly. The board’s expectation that she should tolerate mixed-sex changing facilities is clearly unlawful, and it put a survivor of sexual assault in a traumatic situation.A senior consultant sent an email to the whole department giving a one-sided account of what happened, to Peggie’s detriment, a few days afterwards. It transpired that Upton – who clearly took strong offence at two previous incidents when Peggie left the changing room after entering tofind the doctor there– later made other potentially career-ending allegations in relation to Peggie and patient safety, which her lawyer has suggested, together with the complaint of bullying,are unfounded.Astonishingly, NHS Fife has failed to comply with a judicial order to disclose all the relevant documents to the tribunal, including some that pertain to when the complaints about patient safety were raised and how they were investigated. Peggie’s lawyers also suspect – based on the incomplete documentation they have seen – that NHS Fife abandoned an original investigation and started a new one, but has not disclosed this to the court. NHS Fife denies this, which will be subject to scrutiny this week. This is highly suggestive of a public body that has conducted itself inappropriately, and may well have prejudged the outcome of a high-stakes complaint.There is no circumstance in which it could have been appropriate for NHS Fife to put Peggie in this position. The attempted justification is that everyone must adopt the minority belief system that someone’s sex is not a scientific fact but a matter of their gender identity, or some sort of gendered soul. As a personal worldview, that’s someone’s own business, but it is wrong – and, in a work context, unprofessional – to try to force it on others in relation to single-sex spaces, services and sports. That is true whether the fact someone identifies as trans is the product of gender dysphoria – feelings of distress about their sex – or, as it is for some men, a cross-dressing sexual paraphilia.It is worrying that in evidence last week Upton did not seem to understand why a female colleague might not want to share changing facilities, and appeared to experience this as a personal affront. But the doctor is unlikely to be alone in that. The greatest responsibility lies with Peggie’s employer, who, instead of making separate accommodations for Upton, expected female colleagues to ignore the fact he is male.Given the bravery required to take a legal case, this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. A group of nurses in Darlington are alsosuing their trustas a result of having to share facilities with a male colleague. In a Sheffield hospital, female staff worried about sharing a changing room with one of their male colleagues were told, incorrectly, that the colleague in question had a right to be there. Outside the NHS, there have been many cases where employers have unlawfully elevated a male desire to be treated as female above women’s established workplace rights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Politicians and women’s rights activists speaking against this have been excommunicated from the left. Slowly, but surely, this is starting to change in the UK: take health secretary Wes Streeting’s admirably principleddefence of the Darlington nurses, for example.Not before time. There is a cautionary tale from across the Atlantic, where Democrats’ stubborn and unpopular defence ofmen’s rights to self-identifyinto women’s sport has dropped the unlikeliest of moral victories into President Donald Trump’s lap, allowing a man accused of serious sexual assault to somehow position himself as a defender of women’s rights. Abandoning basic common sense for unpopular policies that put women at risk does not go well for the left.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Except when it doesn’t. And it doesn’t when another people’s sovereignty gets in the way of your nation’s needs. Then sovereignty (for any other country or people, at least) becomes so much dust blowing in the storm. It is something to which the peoples of theChagos Islandsand Gaza can attest.Last year, Britain finalised an agreementto hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a shabby deal at the end of a sordid history of British rule. Much of the criticism of the deal is equally shabby.Britain wrested the Chagos archipelago from French rule in 1814 and administered it from Mauritius, 1,300 miles away, another colony snatched from France. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Britain retained the Chagos Islands for itself, having already reconstituted them as a new colony – the “British Indian Ocean Territory”. “The primary objective,” according to a confidential government memo, was to ensure that “they could be used for the construction of defence facilities” – notably an American naval base on the island of Diego Garcia – and to “be able to clear it of its current population” without facing “political agitation”. Britain had, in the words of a Foreign Office lawyer, to “maintain the fiction that the inhabitants of Chagos are not a permanent or semi-permanent population”, because otherwise their “democratic rights will have to be safeguarded”. By 1973, acceding to American demands, Britain had forced out all the Chagossians, who were banished to a wretched life of exile in Mauritius and Seychelles, with a sizeable number ending up in Britain.Under a process begun bythe Conservatives in 2022and completed by Labour, Britain will now transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, except for Diego Garcia, home to the US military base. This will remain under UK control, under a 99-year lease agreement, for which Britain willapparently pay £90m a year.The one people who have had no say in all of this are the Chagossians themselves, who were brought to the islands as slaves and indentured labourers, forced after emancipation to work on plantationsunder a “feudal” regime, as a Foreign Office memo put it, forbidden from owning any property (which allowed Britain to maintain the fiction that they were not permanent residents), forcibly deported into poverty, and now being handed to Mauritius, a country in which they have faceddiscrimination and ill-treatment. As Chagossian activist Rosy Leveque has observed: “The same two states who treated my family like cargo are once again negotiating our community’s future without the involvement of theactual community itself.”For Trump, the relationship of Palestinians to Gaza is transactional. Gaza is not “home” to those who live there, nor Palestine to the PalestiniansThe failure to consult Chagossians has been picked up by critics of the Mauritius deal. For most critics, though, it is a minor issue, compared with their real concern, the “self-inflicted blow to the UK’s security andstrategic interests”, as a recent Policy Exchange report put it. “We have just handed sovereign British territory to a small island nation that is an ally of China,” the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told the foreign secretary, David Lammy. “In whose interests does he think he serves: those of the global diplomatic elite or those of the British people andour national interest?”On both sides of the debate on whether British or Mauritian sovereignty should prevail over Chagos, the rights of the Chagossians are largely ignored. Such selective attention to sovereignty is not unique. Consider Gaza. There is something very 21st-century post-politics aboutDonald Trump’s planto bring peace to the Middle East by “relocating” Palestinians in Gaza and turning a mass graveyard into a holiday complex.It is tempting to dismiss this as something very Trumpish, a narcissistic property magnate’s “America first” view of international relations. It is, though, an argument that speaks to a deeper vein of contemporary thinking. For Trump, the relationship of Palestinians toGazais transactional. Gaza is not “home” to those who live there, nor Palestine to the Palestinians. They could live anywhere because they possess no collective national identity of their own.It’s a view espoused by hardline Israeli politicians, from Benjamin Netanyahu to Itamar Ben-Gvir. “There is no such thing as a Palestinian nation. There is no Palestinian history,” Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has insisted. Palestinian nationalism is artificial, runs the argument, whereas the Jewish claim to the land is deeply rooted in a history reaching back thousands of years. Palestinian identity, the historian Rashid Khalidi has observed, like all identities, whether Jewish or American or English, “is not an essential transcendent given”, but has been “constructed”, evolving over time, and assimilating different strands. A distinctive Palestinian sense of nationhood, he argues, emerged towards the end of the Ottoman empire, and has been recast many times over the past century, especially in response to the formation of the state of Israel. Neither the recency of the construction of Palestinian national identity, nor its degeneration with the rise of Hamas, denies Palestinian feelings about their collective being, nor the legitimacy of their aspirations to be treated equally with Jews within Israel/Palestine.The aspirations of Palestinians and Jews could be embodied in two states, with equal powers, or through a single state with equal status and rights for both peoples. Today, though, Palestinians live either as citizens of a state within which, according to Israel’s nation-state law, “the right to exercise national self-determination… is unique to the Jewish people”, and where, in the words of the former justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, that Jewishness must be maintained “even if itviolates rights”; or under occupation in the West Bank; or, until the current war, all but occupation in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir claimed almost half a century ago, since Palestinians “did not exist” as a people, it could not be that “we came and threw them out and tooktheir country away from them”.It’s true that, even with the brutality and humiliation they face, Palestinians fare better under Israeli rule than Jews would in a Hamas-run Palestine. That is no argument, though, for repudiating Palestinian rights or dismissing their aspirations. From the Chagos Islands to Gaza, discussions of sovereignty today are as much about denying certain peoples their autonomy as about asserting one’s own.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now it needs a planAndrew RawnsleyIt will take more than some sharper attack lines to beat back the growing threat posed by Nigel FarageSun 9 Feb 2025 02.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 06.30 ESTShareKeep calm and carry on. Let’s not lose our heads, because the stupidest thing we can do right now is to panic. Thus speak those Labour people who claim to be relaxed about polling thatputs Reformahead of their party, with the Tories languishing in third place. There’s some sense in this warning not to do the headless chicken. Britain’s next general election does not have to take place until mid-2029. No poll taken today is a reliable predictor of what kind of government people will want many years ahead. Voters indicating that they are backing Reform are telling us that they don’t like either Labour or the Tories. That is not the same as saying that they all want Nigel Farage to be the next prime minister.It is also true that the outlook is less immediately frightening for Sir Keir Starmer than it is for Kemi Badenoch. “Reform is not great for Labour, but it is an existential threat to the Tories,” remarks one Labour strategist, noting thatlast week’s YouGov pollreported that one in five of Tory voters in 2024 said they would now back Reform. It is a spine-chiller for the Conservatives to see high-value donorsdefecting to Reform. Another cause for Tory alarm is underlined by theOpinium pollwe publish today: their vote share is sinking to depths even inkier than they experienced at last summer’s election. “Every time we think things can’t get any worse, and then they get worse,” groans one Conservative MP. To have any hope of surviving as leader of her regicidal party, Mrs Badenoch has to convince her colleagues that she can prevail in the fight with Reform to be the right’s main competition to Labour. She is manifestly losing that battle at the moment. Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, has taken to crowing: “We have the momentum and the Tories are now splitting our vote.”That momentum also disturbs the growing number of Labour people who are not staying calm and don’t think they can afford to carry on ignoring Reform. One Labour veteran, usually a phlegmatic sort, recently remarked to me that both his party and the Conservatives “are living in the last chance saloon”. He wondered aloud why we should think that Britain has to be an exception to the rise of the hard right that has been seen across much of Europe. In some ways, the surprise is that Reform is not doing even better against an unconvincingly led Conservative party so badly discredited by its record in power and a Labour government with approval ratings thathave plummeteddownwards so dramatically. Much of Mr Farage’s support may look like protest voting, but that thoughtisn’t consoling in the 89 Labour-held seatswhere Reform candidates came second. Many of these Labour MPs are sitting on terrifyingly precarious majorities. “They’re getting very jumpy,” reports one senior Labour figure. One thing that unnerves them is the torrent of abuse they are receiving from Reform sympathisers on their Facebook pages and other forms of social media. Some of the MPs are responding by trying to get themselves on GB News, also known as Farage TV, because they think a lot of their voters are watching it. Chris Webb, who became the MP for Blackpool South in 2024,recently invited the channel to follow himaround his constituency for an entire day.Labour staffers and campaign groups are now spending a lot of time trying to devise strategies to combat Reform. The topic was on the agenda of the cabinet when it met for a six-hour “away day” at Lancaster House on Friday. One minister present told me afterwards that there was no single “killer” tactic that will do the trick. “I don’t think we’ve figured this out yet, if I’m being entirely honest.” The view used to be that Labour didn’t have too much to worry about because Reform looked more threatening to the Conservatives and would help Labour, as it did at the election, by splitting the rightwing vote. It was also thought that taking on its leader simply gave him the oxygen of more publicity. A shift to a more pugilistic approach was indicated by Wes Streeting when the health secretary recently gave a speech directly confronting Mr Farage withan attack on his “miserabilist, declinist” vision of Britain.Sir Keir doesn’t have the temperament or look the part to be successfully cast as a Trumpesque disruptor-in-chiefThe Reform leader casts himself as an anti-elitist insurgent force against a failed status quo created by the two older parties. Yet one of his recent fundraisers was held at a Mayfair club where attendees were lubricated with Dom Pérignon, and the pleasure of Mr Farage’s company onthe top table cost £25,000 a seat. That’s more than the annual income of a lot of his constituents in Clacton-on-Sea – a seaside town on the Essex coast, if you need directions, Nigel. I jeer, but it is a mistake to think that his brand of nativist populism can be punctured simply by ridiculing the jarring dissonance between his pose as a man of the people and his fondness for the company of multi-millionaires. That kind of line didn’t get much traction against Donald Trump.One school of thought within Sir Keir’s ranks argues thatLabourshould present itself as the more authentic enemy of the status quo and project the government as the insurgents. There’s a powerful advocate of that view within Number 10 in the shape of Morgan McSweeney, a key architect of its election victory and now chief of staff. The prime minister said at the Lancaster House meeting that the government needed to be less cautious and move faster. “We can either be the disrupters or the disrupted,” he told his senior ministers. The snag with trying to be an “insurgent government” is that it is really hard not to look like the establishment when you are in power and the prime minister is a knighted lawyer who used to run the crown prosecution service. Sir Keir doesn’t have the temperament and doesn’t look the part to be successfully cast as a Trumpesque disruptor-in-chief. “We have to be changemakers,” says one member of the cabinet, but adds: “Burn it all down is just not who we are.” If Labour tries to make the struggle with Farageism all about who can hate institutions with the greater intensity, this is not a contest it is likely to win.A potentially promising approach is to subject his beliefs and policies to the scrutiny that he is unaccustomed to. Labour has belatedly started to draw attention to his view that we should move to an insurance-based system of healthcare. Sir Keir won a lusty cheer from his MPs at the most recent session of PMQs when he took on the leader of Reform bywalloping himfor wanting “to charge them (his constituents) for using the NHS”. Says one Labour strategist: “His views on the NHS are like battery acid for Farage. When you put this in front of Labour voters, they run a mile.”He wants an even harder form of Brexit than the one inflicted on Britain by Boris Johnson’s rotten and nowdeeply unpopular deal. What his economic programme would amount to also merits more attention. Other than Liz Truss herself, no one was a more enthusiastic cheerleader for her reckless experiment with the national finances than Mr Farage who hailed her for producing “the best Conservative budgetsince 1986” shortly before it exploded in everyone’s faces.His signature theme is hostility to immigration and this raises the most vexed questions about the lengths to which Labour should go. A newpressure group of Labour MPs, drawn from those 89 seats that are potentially most vulnerable, is urging Sir Keir to toughen up the government’s stance on immigration and be noisy about it. These MPs are broadly cheered to see their party launchFacebook ads, in Reform-style branding, boasting about how many people the government has deported. What pleases them will make a lot of other Labour people extremely queasy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mr Farage is thriving now, just as he did in the years running up to the Brexit referendum, because he is tapping into high levels of voter discontent about the quality of their lives in a country with a stagnant economy and dilapidated public services. Immigration is one of the factors, but so is the cost of living and the condition of the health service. Sorting that is critical to seeing him off. It is not enough to say that Reform has bad ideas.

Naysayers. Traitors. Children take note, why learn oracy when insults will do?Catherine BennettKeir Starmer’s rhetoric against green campaigners appears to have taken a playground turnSun 9 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 9 Feb 2025 13.19 ESTShareBefore the last election, in what was billed as his “most personal interview yet”, Keir Starmer said: “I’m not in the habit of bandying insults around”. It was once part of his appeal, or meant to be, that his speech was polite, even to the point of colourless, in contrast to the ugly gibberish streaming out of Boris Johnson, then Liz Truss. When the Tories went low, Starmer went sorrowful headteacher. “I don’t think Boris Johnson is a bad man,” he said in one speech, “I think he is a trivial man.”His favourite word, these days, is “nimbys”. Starmer uses it so freely he’s personally breathed new life into the original acronym (“not in my back yard”), revealing along the way its largely unexplored potential to create national disharmony. Why restrict such a genius jibe to arguments about ring roads and executive homes? Last week’s headlines about his plan for nuclear power expansion – typically, “Starmer to ‘push past nimbyism’ in pledge to expand nuclear power sites” – are only the latest in which Starmer demonstrates how any opposition to any scheme with environmental consequences can be represented, by a skilled litigator like himself, as nimbyism: purely selfish, irrational and against the common good. Unlike the visionary tech overlords such as Google, Meta and Amazon, which Starmer invited, in the same speech, to profit, with their data centres, from the UK nimbys’ certain defeat. His government’s pro-nuclear press release featured praise from similarly patriotic,non-nimby-infested corporations, such as EDF and Microsoft.It is thanks to Starmer we now understand that Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners – actually anyone with questions about, for instance, the disposal of nuclear waste – are essentially indistinguishable from other varieties of nimby he has been insulting for a while, so as to trivialise in advance any disquiet about Labour’s plans to tear up planning regulations.Look beyond the acronym’s “back yard” element: now any non-local objection to 150 infrastructure projects, all evidently beyond criticism, also identifies a person as, in his eyes, the enemy of his “working people”. Challenge a greenfield development’s non-provision of affordable homes: you’re a vexatious nimby. Cast doubt on Rachel Reeves’ Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor: self-righteous virtue-signaller. Oppose the third runway: call yourself British? In his “plan for change” speech, these irritants were warned, with menaces (“whether you like it or not”), that they were wasting their time. His projects, he said, would “send a very clear message to the nimbys, the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats… The alliance of naysayers, the people who say ‘no, Britain can’t do this’.”Since when, the nimby category has been further expanded to include anyone with a selfish weakness for nature or wildlife. Writing in theDaily Mail, Starmertook aim at, among others, a Green “naysayer” in Norfolk who had carelessly annoyed – woe betide like-minded campaigners – “a top judge”.The nimby category has been further expanded to include anyone with a selfish weakness for nature or wildlife“There are countless more examples of Nimbys and zealots gumming up the legal system,” he wrote, “often for their own ideological blindspots to stop the Government building the infrastructure the country needs.” Anti-growth traitors, the lot of them. “They want to win for themselves,” Starmer raved, “not for the country.” Lurching into the “couldn’t make it up” mode much prized at theMail, he cited the “ridiculous” HS2 bat tunnel (the one that also tickles Rachel Reeves) and a crowning example he knew working people would find hilarious: a system designed toprevent millions of fish being sucked to their deathsinto an EDF reactor’s cooling pipes! “I wish I was joking,” Starmer wrote. He was presumably aware that EDFhas abandoned this deterrent, one nonetheless selected for its absurdity out of “countless” examples.Admittedly, this crude rhetoric has its fans, and not just in the construction, housebuilding, energy and property speculation community. For prominent Tory idealists, there must be validation in Starmer’s promise tofulfil their dreams, never properly realised, of humbling environmentalists and trashing planning restrictions (in places where they don’t live). Not forgetting the satisfaction of seeing Starmer recycle, for Labour, their exact same phrases, sometimes wearing the same accessories – hard hats and hi-vis jackets – for the benefit of vanity photographers recently declassified as a Tory outrage.Since it can’t be plagiarism, only shared passion can explain why Starmer and David Cameron have phrased their ambitions in identical terms, in wanting, say, a “bonfire of red tape” (Starmer 2024;Cameron 2014). Starmer thinks regulations are “suffocating” (likewise Cameron); Starmer says “we are the builders” (ditto George Osborne); Starmer wants to end “dithering” (Cameron, “cut through the dither”); Starmer declares Britain “open for business” (Cameron, same, 2012); Starmer confronts those “talking our country down” (so did Cameron, 2011).To judge by their interchangeable expressions of annoyance, hostility to environmental protections is also common ground for Reeves and Osborne. For him, they placed “ridiculous costs on British businesses”; for her, they make “delivering major infrastructure in our country far too expensive”. In 2012, the vice-president of the RSPB, Britain’s largest nature conservation charity, called Osborne “a bloody idiot”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionImpressively, after only months in power, Starmer and Reeves have already provoked their own RSPB fight. “There is some deeply infuriating and frankly shocking rhetoric coming from the UK government around planning,”says the RSPB’s chair, Beccy Speight. She warns: “The last government’s attack on nature rightly triggered public outrage; Sir Keir and his cabinet should take heed to avoid this path reaching the same dead end.”The teaching of “oracy” in schools was oncea priority for Starmer. Confident speaking, he said, gives “an inner belief to make your case in any environment”. Whatever explains his recent change in style, the debacle is not without educational value. Kids, if you go in for name-calling, offensive misrepresentation and unconvincing assertions of your superior judgement, the finest voice coach may struggle to transform it into persuasive oracy. Even when, as with Starmer’s nimbys, your targets were, only months ago, your friends.Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsNuclear powerOpinionNuclear wasteEnergyGreen economyWasteHinkley Point CEDF EnergycommentShareReuse this content"

What made his article resonate particularly was the sentence, “Did nobody tell them about Stalin?”As a history A-level student, it serves as a reminder of one of the many reasons I chose to study it: having even a vague awareness of the past horrors of authoritarianism can help fight its present stirrings.I am not arguing for GCSE history to become compulsory, but for a low-stakes study of some of the most important events in history in regards to democracy, taught in the style of personal, social, health and economic education.It is peculiar that in a world where Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to reign supreme, the British government mandates a religious education up to age 16, but not a history education. If Keir Starmer remembers his own history education, he would remember that the Nazis used their education curriculum to turn the youth of Germany towards fascism. He must now use ours to turn the youth of this country in the opposite direction and hold democracy high – for it is all we have got.Ed Haines, aged 16Colchester, EssexGeneration Z’s bleak lot in life is due to bad government, blinkered ideology and bad faith, not an overdose of democracy. While lamenting the wrongheadedness of the young, we should consider how often they will have heard their elders bewailing – without qualification or explanation – the absence of “a strong leader”.We should consider the effect of the media-indulged presidential style adopted by prime ministers since Tony Blair; note the power-shifting erosion of cabinet government since David Cameron’s premiership and consider the personality cult that endlessly excused the moral vacuum of Boris Johnson’s tenure. We ought, especially, to consider the corrosive effect of a skewed electoral system rendering the votes of huge swathes of the population redundant. While not excusing the apparent embrace of despotism or diminishing the poisonous influence of online zealots, older generations must bear responsibility for some of the distortions with which the young shape their reality.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkArt lovers must pay their wayI agree with Catherine Bennett that we should be asking visitors from abroad to pay an entry fee to our national museums and galleries (“Macron’s got a point: why shouldn’t we charge tourists to see our treasures?”, Comment). On a recent visit to Paris, there’s an acceptance that you are paying for the continued accessibility to and preservation of these collections. I was also struck by the level of costly security employed by these institutions. We should be paying decent wages to staff and on the security measures that help safeguard the future of our national treasures.Jo DavidsonCambridgeMandelson’s change of heartRather than changing his mind, Peter Mandelson should have stuck to his guns about the appalling prospect of a Donald Trump presidency and refused to become the UK’s ambassador to America (“Peter Mandelson’s U-turn on Donald Trump: it’s easy to mock, but that’s diplomacy”, Editorial). That would have been the honourable thing to do. How can anyone now believe what he says?Mick BeebyBristolHousing crisis solutionsThank you, Rowan Moore, for your excellent survey of ways to speed up the construction of the millions of homes that the UK urgently needs, particularly for poorer sectors of the population (“Peace, permanence and affordable prices: six ways to solve Britain’s housing crisis”, Focus).Leaving aside the crucial issues of a chronic shortage of skilled builders and materials, there is the fact that major developers have no interest in solving the housing crisis. They profit massively from property shortages and ever-higher prices.One favourite tactic is land banking, buying up prime construction sites wholesale and exercising their freedom not to build on them until it suits them. They don’t even need to build on the land because once they have planning permission, they can sell it at several times its original price. The government must get a grip on developers’ practices or there are never going to be enough properties built. One way would be to put a tax on developer-owned land, which would increase, say, every six months if construction is delayed; another might be to decree that if the land is sold on, with or without planning permission, it must be sold at the original purchase price. There may be other methods but, currently, a timid Labour government is only targeting the planning system and local objectors.Carl GardnerLondon EC1Drama at the BBCKate Maltby, writing on the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) and sister unions’ campaign, Save Audio Drama at the BBC, is correct to say that artists have had to face the challenges of new genres, new formats and new masters throughout history, yet omits a more subtle and important point (“Sorry, Dame Judi, BBC Radio’s job is to find listeners, not train playwrights”, Comment).The WGGB works with the BBC and other employers in the best interest of its members. Unions are not dictatorial entities standing in the way of change, disembodied from their members. They are their members, and, as history has also shown, workers standing together collectively to safeguard their jobs, their pay and their working conditions is a precious thing and one that we must hold to.Ellie Peers, General Secretary, Writers’ Guild of Great BritainLondon SE1Celebrating SheilaThank you for your interview with Sheila Hancock, who has had such a fantastic career and is still so full of energy, ideas, wit and opinions (“‘You name it, I did it’”, Magazine).On Radio 4’sJust a Minute, she must have been a trailblazer as a woman on such a male-dominated show, first appearing in 1967. It can help change perceptions to read about what these distinguished and still dynamic figures have contributed to society, especially for a readership who might not have heard of them.Sue EvansBrussels, BelgiumExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleObserver lettersVoter apathySocial trendslettersShareReuse this content"

But here isTamsin Greig, on Zoom in the Donmar Warehouse’s rehearsal rooms, telling me how this behaviour begins as soon as she’s left the house every morning.“I get up at 6.30 to walk the dog so that I can get out and be in the air to start turning my words over in my head. People who see me know not to come near me because I’m always muttering to myself.” Then she gets the tube (“a good place to learn my lines”), but admits she gets recognised – unsurprisingly, given her classic roles in so many shows, fromBlack BookstoGreen Wing,EpisodestoFriday Night Dinner. “But when I’m not speaking I have quite an angry face” – she raises her eyebrows slightly, impishly, as she says this – “which I use to my advantage.”This has beenGreig’s recent routine ahead of co-starring in a radical new play,Backstroke, which opens next weekend at the Donmar. She plays Bo, a woman dealing with work, a struggling daughter and the aftermath of her force-of-nature mother, Beth, having a stroke. Beth is played by fellow TV-to-stage veteran Celia Imrie. “Obviously, Celia thinks it’s incredibly rude that she’s been cast as my mother, but that’s fair enough because she is eternally youthful,” Greig points out (Imrie is 72 to Greig’s 58).View image in fullscreenTamsin Greig in Friday Night Dinner, with Simon Bird, Tom Rosenthal and Paul Ritter.Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4Then comes her London run in Terence Rattigan’sThe Deep Blue Sea, which transfers to the Theatre Royal Haymarket from an acclaimed run in Bath last summer (one critic said she “brilliantly conveys a woman calcified by misery”, another that she was “made for wit”). Then – keep up – she also stars inHappy Valleycreator Sally Wainwright’s new show for the BBC,Riot Women, about five middle-aged women forming a punk band, showing later this year. She plays Holly Gaskell, a retiring police officer who turns out to be “rubbish at the bass but good at being in a band”.I’m a real fan of Nick Cave. He sees performing as a kind of communion with people. I feel like that with the theatreGreig had to learn to play the instrument for it. How was that? She grins, a little proudly. “Well, I actually had to act a bit more rubbish than I’ve become.” She tried to channel Joan Armatrading, and … and … she struggles for a name. “Come on, brain! What’s her name? She’s so famous!” The name arrives delicately on her tongue. “Chrissie Hynde. Honestly. How difficult was it to remember that name when it was so easy to picture her? It’ll be interesting to see if any of my lines come out of my mouth at the Donmar … ”Backstrokeis another female-dominated production for Greig, with five women on stage and an all-female stage management team (“very, very unusual, and very lovely”). It’s influenced by elements of the life of its writer-director, Anna Mackmin, who was brought up in a commune by a formidable woman and with whom she had no clearly defined parent-child relationship. “I’m dealing with a human being who’s very complex and wounded and an incredibly adept survivor,” Greig says. “From the age of five, she had to develop a means of engaging with the world where she is fully alive but also had to learn to be her own bodyguard.”View image in fullscreenIn Green Wing with Michelle Gomez (centre) and Sarah Alexander.Photograph: Channel 4The play spans the characters’ whole lives, including how memory suddenly intrudes in tough times, mixing in filmed sequences behind the actors, which occasionally interact with the script. Greig and Imrie play mother and daughter at different ages without costume or makeup – which means Greig has to act as a child. How does that work? “What we’re discovering is the more I use my voice but just remain faithful to the words that Anna has written, the truer the character is. At one point someone asks, ‘How old are you?’ And Bo says” – her voice goes softer, more precise – “‘I’m pretty close to being six.’ Just through the words, I’m that little girl.”Greig’s childhood was not particularly privileged. Her father, Eric, who was 60 when she was born, was a stay-at-home dad (Greig said in a2012Observer Food Monthlyinterviewthat he was “never able to show affection emotionally or physically”, although he did bring her liquidised coq au vin to the hospital when she was seven, in an isolation ward with glandular fever). Her mother, Ann, worked as a secretary, and at one point the family went bankrupt, living in what Greig once called “a shithole” in Kilburn, north-west London. Still, Greig loved being the middle of three sisters (Dorcas is older, Abigail younger) all born a year apart (“My goodness, we had fun”).View image in fullscreenWith Oliver Chris in The Deep Blue Sea at Theatre Royal Bath, May 2024.Photograph: Manuel HarlanShe encounteredCelia Imriefor the first time with her mother, watching Imrie playing overdramatic shop owner Miss Babs in Victoria Wood’sAcorn Antiques. “My mum was born in Leeds but left as a teenager,” Greig says, “and then sort of transformed herself into somebody very posh and left behind her working-class roots. So when she watched things like Victoria Wood, you could see that she was smelling a different aroma. There was something there about her memories that I didn’t have access to.”Greig’s parents died before she was a household name – her mother in 2001, when Greig was filming the second series ofBlack Books, and her eldest children (of three) were two and one (“it was a very testing time”). Greig is aware that many people of her age are squeezed between caring for elderly parents and their growing children. “And I am very glad, in a way, that I was able to be there to offer the care that I was able to give in my 30s, because so much is required of you, of your heart and your physicality and your mental agility.” She’s passionate about end-of-life care. “We can’t be a fully rounded society without it.”View image in fullscreenWith Bill Bailey (left) and Dylan Moran in Black Books.Photograph: Channel 4But back to Imrie. She and Greig first crossed paths in real life when they starred inThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotelalongside Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton, staying in the same “monstrously beautiful hotels – I just basically jumped on the tails of the dames”. Imrie prepared a welcome party for Greig’s family (Greig’s husband, actor Richard Leaf, to whom she’s been married since 1997, and their children) who were due to arrive for a visit while Greig was shooting her scenes. “She couldn’t bear the idea that they were all turning up and I wouldn’t be there to greet them, including my children, who were quite little then. I was so moved by her doing that. But that’s who she is.”I want to do a show on Broadway – which I’ve come close to a few times – and to let my face be the age that it isWe talk about other things in our lively 40 minutes: how much Greig lovedNick Cave’s recentDesert Island Discs(“I’m a real fan … he sees performing as a kind of communion with people … I feel like that with the theatre”) and how some children seem frozen at younger ages since the pandemic, while others grew up fast. What age do you feel? “I’m in my early 20s most of the time. Like, you know, totally up for it! Then I realise, of course, that after lunch I have to have a nanna nap. I mean, literally. At the Donmar, they’ve had to make sure that there is a room available at lunchtime for me to go and lie down.”Snoozing aside, Greig strikes me as a potential dame, given her stage and theatre credits to date and what’s to come. What does she still wish for? “To do a show on Broadway – which I’ve come close to a few times – and to let my face be the age that it is.” She loved watching Harriet Walter as Thatcher in the recentBrian and Maggie, she says. “To look at an actor and think, ‘You are so brilliant at what you do, and your face has got so many stories in it.’ To see the life! Maybe that’s my ambition, just to keep on getting older and older, challenging the industry to keep on employing me.”Backstrokeis at theDonmar Warehouse, London WC2, from 15 February to 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTamsin GreigThe ObserverTheatreTelevisionCelia ImrieFriday Night DinnerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, ‘Shazza’ is putting his story on the big screenAndrew AnthonySun 9 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareSex positivity, polyamory, threesomes: they may not be universal practices but the extent to which they are more acceptable these days has a lot to do with a largely forgottenBritish polymath called Alex Comfort. In 1972, the physician, expert on molluscs and gerontologist publishedThe Joy of Sex, the first popular book in the English language that explained and celebrated the art of making love.A coffee table how-to guide with tasteful drawings of a naked couple in an imaginative range of sexual positions, it became a huge international bestseller and helped shift perceptions of sex some way along the procreational-recreational axis.The extraordinary story of how the book came to be written is the subject of a comedy film due to go into production later this year from Sharon Maguire, director of the first and thirdBridget Jones films, two of the highest-grossing comedies in British history. Maguire was also the inspiration for the character Shazza, Bridget’s close friend, played in the films bySally Phillips.View image in fullscreenInspiration: Sharon ‘Shazza’ Maguire.Photograph: Isa Foltin/WireImage“In a way, it’s a film about what made the Bridget Jones generation, because her parents would have probably readThe Joy of Sex,” says Maguire. “But we didn’t have it in my house, growing up, because it was Irish Catholic.Sexwasn’t mentioned, never mind a book about it.”The film, also calledThe Joy of Sex, will focus on the love triangle between Comfort, his wife, Ruth, and her best friend from university, Jane Henderson, a librarian who became Comfort’s lover and collaborator in cataloguing the choreography of their sexual adventures.The middle-aged couple took Polaroids of their bedroom exploits, which Comfort, thinking they could be used in a book, proudly showed his publishers, much to their distress. Instead, two illustrators were commissioned to depict the graphic scenes that the writer described, but they struggled to find appropriate models to draw.“They employed some pornographic models but that didn’t work because they kept putting their prices up and pouting at the camera,” says Maguire. That wasn’t deemed suitable for the target audience of loving couples. Eventually, one illustrator, Charles Raymond, volunteered with his wife to re-enact Comfort and Henderson’s sex life, while the other illustrator drew them.“They were trying to do 200 different poses and it was during the power cuts,” laughs Maguire. “Obviously, poor old Charles kept shooting his load. Although it sounds like a sex romp, it was all well-intentioned, because there really was nothing like it. No textbooks, even medical ones, no illustrations, no pictures.”Raymond was hippyishly hirsute, which initially deterred US publishers –Playboythought the images featured a cave-dweller – but he no doubt helped establish beards as a symbol of virility in the 1970s.For a number of years, while Comfort conducted his practical research with Henderson, he divided his time between the two women: Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays with his lover, and the rest of the week with his wife. “It was that tempestuous triangle that led to the creation ofThe Joy of Sex,” says Maguire, “but also, in a sense, to the unravelling of his life. The clashing psychologies of the three characters makes for this fascinating conundrum about love and sex and relationships that’s wrapped up in a comedy.”Maguire is also simultaneously making a documentary about the book, and wants to get in touch with original readers who would now be in their late 70s or 80s. “It’s important to hear first-hand testaments and to bring to life the huge and positive impact of the book,” she says, “because, seen through a modern lens, I’m not sure Alex would appear in the most forgiving light. So I want to hear from couples or throuples or even singles whose lives and relationships were enriched by the book.”View image in fullscreenPublished in 1972,The Joy Of Sexbecame an international bestseller.Photograph: Retro AdArchives/AlamyComfort was certainly enriched financially, although nowhere near as much as his publishers. But it led to the end of his marriage. His wife had tolerated sharing him with another woman but couldn’t bear the public humiliation of what she viewed as his and Henderson’s sex diary. Comfort held back publication of the book in the UK for two years while he divorced Ruth and married Jane.The newlyweds relocated to California, where Comfort, then 53, took up a post at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal thinktank in Santa Barbara.His son, Nick, once said of his father: “He had a suffocating upbringing. When he found what life could be like in California, there was no stopping him.”Comfort was a prodigy who was largely home-schooled. At 14, he blew four fingers off his left hand when an attempt to make his own fireworks went wrong. The accident didn’t stop him, aged just 18, from publishing a well-received book based on a trip he took with his father to South America and Africa.At Cambridge University, where he studied natural sciences, he was seen as a formidable intellect by his peers, but he was clueless about women, marrying the first one who approached him: Ruth Harris.Like many men of his generation, he found sex hard to talk about. While his wife greatly admired his mind, she was not interested in pushing back the sexual boundaries. “The marriage was a ticking timebomb,” says Maguire, who believes that Comfort came to see sex as a liberating antidote to war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he grew to doubt the effectiveness of demonstrations. “I think he genuinely thought that sex was a means of changing the mindset away from fighting and wars,” says Maguire. “At first, when I started researching, I just thought that was his excuse to have a great time having sex. But I think that when he started having sex properly in his 40s, it was an epiphany.”Henderson, Harris’s university friend, had re-entered the couple’s lives, and she seemed to share Comfort’s utopian ideas about the transformative powers of sexual congress. Comfort liked to compare sex to cooking. If knowing what to do in the kitchen results in better meals, he believed that knowing what to do in the bedroom would lead to a happier life.When he moved to California, he became a regular – sometimes with his wife, often alone – at Sandstone, a clothing-optional resort and celebrity sex club in Topanga Canyon that attracted the likes of Dean Martin, Timothy Leary and Daniel Ellsberg.Also in attendance there was the journalist Gay Talese, who wrote: “The nude biologist Dr Alex Comfort, brandishing a cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a lepidopterist strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net.”The sunny libertine days did not last long. The scientist who saw sex as a great emancipating and pacifying force had failed to consider the risks of unlimited promiscuity. He was completely blindsided by Aids.In any case, by the end of the 1970s, Henderson had wearied of orgies and permissiveness and told Comfort that she wanted a conventional marriage. “I think she had pretended she wanted an open relationship,” says Maguire, “but I don’t think she did.”In 1985, they returned to the UK, where Comfort struggled to re-establish his reputation. His studies in gerontology failed to attract the academic interest he had expected. Although he was the author of some 50 books, the only thing people wanted to discuss with him wasThe Joy of Sex, which had become, by his own admission, an albatross around his neck.In 1991, Comfort suffered a massive haemorrhage in his most prized organ, his brain. As he moved in and out of a coma, his wife died of a heart attack. Another stroke left him in a nursing home, living out his last years alone and paralysed but still in reasonable mental shape.Not blessed with telegenic looks, Comfort never became as well known as the bestselling book that bore his name. For all his reservations about its effect on his reputation, he would have been pleased, thinks Maguire, that unorthodox forms of sexuality are now “more out in the open”.Yet the sexual revolution he envisaged never quite materialised.“He must have believed the experiment in his life would become the norm,” says Maguire. “But. of course, it didn’t. For all the complications of sex and love and desire that we all experience, monogamy remains the norm.”If you have a story to tell, please emailJOS@sevenstoriestv.comExplore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverSexBridget Jones' DiaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new biennial competition with a £40,000 bounty for the victor is initially guaranteed to run for 10 editions, by which time it hopes to be on a par with the Booker or Turner prizes, boosting dance’s profile accordingly. It was Greek choreographer Christos Papadopoulos who took home the honour (and a cool Es Devlin-designed trophy) for his piece Larsen C, chosen by an eclectic judging panel, with Christopher Bannerman and Arlene Phillips from the dance world, musician PJ Harvey and poet Karthika Naïr. (There was also £15,000 awarded to an early-career choreographer in the Bloom prize, won by Stav Struz Boutrous.)Papadopoulos is pretty much unknown in the UK, but a darling of the Greek dance scene who’s toured widely in Europe. Larsen C may have been the most divisive piece in the contest. The title refers to an Antarctic ice shelf, and the dance does indeed move at glacial pace, with small, repetitive movements that drove some viewers to distraction (it’s rare to hear a “boo” in a polite dance theatre). It was inspired, the choreographer has said, by how your perception of something can completely alter when the smallest element is changed. There’s an element of illusion that can’t help call to mind Papadopoulos’s compatriot Dimitris Papaioannou, as bodies disappear into the blackness of the stage and flashes of flesh appear, looking like truncated arms or extra limbs – the dancers’ feet in shadow making them seem as if they’re gliding soundlessly. There’s beautiful movement here, boneless limbs like drifting tentacles, as mysterious as the creatures in the depths of the Mariana Trench.View image in fullscreenLives in full swing … Keturah Stephen, Tamisha A Guy, Catherine Kirk and Gianna Theodore in An Untitled Love by Kyle Abraham.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs the music grows from fuzzy white noise to insistent rhythm, rumbling subwoofer to thick drone, the dancers gather into a moving mass with the repetition inviting a sort of trance state. It grows towards a coup de theatre made of copious haze and a piercing light – when a hand penetrates its beam it looks like an arm from the heavens coming to grab a lost soul, a divine intervention perhaps. It’s an impressive effect. But after that the piece doesn’t know what to do with itself and loses its way.View image in fullscreenDeeply primal … Carcaça by Marco da Silva Ferreira.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe three other works on the strong shortlist, presented across two weeks at Sadler’s Wells, were American choreographerKyle Abraham’s An Untitled Love, previously seen in the UK at Edinburgh International festival, Carcaça by Portuguese choreographer Marco da Silva Ferreira and Brazilian Lia Rodrigues’s Encantado. Trying to judge art may seem a futile exercise to some, but it’s an intriguing snapshot of dance right now. The pieces on show aren’t attached to traditional formal techniques and structures, more driven by vibes or viscerality. Three of the works, Larsen C, Carcaça and Encantado are built on long slow crescendos; An Untitled Love, set to the music of D’Angelo, is episodic in nature, as if dropping into lives that are already in full swing. Abraham’s genius is in smooshing together different dance styles – classical, contemporary, social and street – with laid-back ease, presenting a picture of extended family life with dance at its heart.Da Silva Ferreira is also concerned with dance as a social activity, drawing on club, street and folk in a distinctive but unpindownable language. It is part sexy, part military, part silly, strictly rhythmic, not in phrases of steps strung together but cells or riffs, one thing repeated many times, then moving on to the next. It’s very 2020s with its mildly intimidating, androgynous cast, the catwalk and duck walks taken from club culture, but it’s also deeply primal, building to hypnotic effect, which may daze, energise or enervate, depending on the viewer (personally, this could be my favourite piece of the four). It then takes an unexpected swerve into politics, calling out the bourgeoisie in forceful voice, turning this into the people’s dance, harnessing the power of bodies coming together, in escape, in ecstasy and in protest.View image in fullscreenAll of life vividly appearing out of nothing …Encantado by Lia Rodrigues.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLia Rodrigues has long acted on her politics, Encantado was created in the favelas of Rio in the midst of the pandemic. The veteran of this group, at 68, is also the most avant garde. Confident enough in her practice to, for example, start her piece with an empty, silent stage, and to keep that silence for a length of time that some in the audience clearly found uncomfortable (the sound of stifled giggles and shifting in seats). Then have her dancers walk on naked and burrow underneath huge sheets of fabric laid across the stage, mountainous lumps covered in loudly clashing colours, florals and animal prints. But when the dancers slowly start to move, and drape and twist and tie those fabrics around their bodies, they are transformed into innumerable vibrant characters, turbans and robes make gurus and kings, young ladies sunning themselves at the beach or old ones gossiping at the market, animals and raggy monsters; all of life suddenly, vividly appearing out of nothing. Rodrigues became a grandmother during the making of the piece, and here is the magic of life materialising, with joy and effervescence. An ode to the infinite possibilities of some bodies and a stage.Explore more on these topicsDanceAwards and prizesSadler's WellsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, in a unique coup de théâtre, Samuel West will be giving a performance that he has already partially recorded: in fact, he did it 19 years ago.Beckett’s daring short play, one of his most popular works afterWaiting for Godot, revolves around the thoughts of Krapp, who at 69 listens to a recording made by his younger self back on his 39th birthday. Writing in 1958, Beckett gave most of the dialogue to this disembodied voice from the past. A recording is usually played to the audience from a reel-to-reel tape machine.West, now 58, had the foresight to record these taped lines from the play when he was actually 39, back in 2006. So when he eventually reaches the correct age for the older Krapp he can play both parts with true vocal authenticity for the first time in theatrical history, as far as anyone knows.The time-lapse play, West told theObserver, is like “a two-hander”, but with only one actor. “It is all crystallised beautifully by using this technology of the tape recorder, which was a new thing when Beckett wrote it,” he said.The first Beckett Biennale will take place in July next year, split between venues in theplaywright’s native Enniskillenin Northern Ireland and Greystones in County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland, where Beckett walked in the mountains with his father. Run by Seán Doran and Liam Browne of Arts Over Borders, the biennales will pick up the duo’s previous work, steering the Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival, staged in Northern Ireland until 2022.West, who is the son of Prunella Scales and the late Timothy West, made his original recording under the supervision of Katie Mitchell, the acclaimed director, but he remains uncertain how good it will sound to him when he hears it again. “I last listened to it a few weeks after making it, and immediately thought I could do better. I went back to the director and said, ‘I want to re-record them,’ and she, very properly, said, ‘You can’t. That’s the whole point.’”View image in fullscreenSamuel West recorded the lines in 2006.Photograph: David Hartley/ShutterstockDoran took the recording to the BBC, asking it to protect the tape from degrading and stow it away for possible use 30 years later. “To the best of my knowledge this hasn’t been attempted anywhere before,” he said. “Beckett’s play is a perfect miniature that catches that moment we will many of us arrive at, when we suddenly see the years that have gone by and the opportunities lost.” A limited number of Extremely Early Bird tickets for the 2036 productionwill be on salefrom 13 April, Beckett’s birthday.“The first words of the play are ‘39 today’,” West said. “And I thought to myself back then, I can really only do this once. So I asked Katie, who I really admired, if she would consider directing me in it when we were older, if we were still around. She has messaged me recently to say, ‘Count me in’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hope is that Dormer will play the part at the seventh biennale in 2038, when he too reaches 69. “Richard told me then it was his most depressing birthday ever!” Doran said. “Many wonders and surprises await us and, God willing, we’ll look forward to meeting up with Samuel in 2036 and Richard two years later. It’s not all that far off, after all.“I was very fortunate that Samuel and Richard were keen to take part and fulfil the first half of the bargain at least. It’s very exciting, 19 years on, that we can announce, with a little more confidence, what we set in motion back then.”Explore more on these topicsSamuel BeckettThe ObserverSamuel WestTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Their multimedia projectSurge: Side A, about the 1981 New Cross house fire, won the Ted Hughes award in 2017. Their debut poetry collection,Surge, won the 2020Sunday Times/University of Warwick Young Writer of the Year award and was shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize and the Costa book award for poetry. Their new project, The Last X Years, uses AI software to assemble news headlines from the last decade with segments of conversations aboutBrexitthey conducted with people across the UK. They live in Paris.What is the concept behindThe Last X Years?I’ve been really curious about howCambridge Analyticamanipulated the referendum and the elections in Trinidad and Tobago. I wanted to demonstrate that qualitative data was being manipulated, [but] instead of putting the spotlight on the data, I put it on the processes. The piece uses TensorFlow, Google’s open source AI, to make connections between about 2,500 articles and 450 clips from interviews I conducted [about Brexit]. The clips are then played in a six-day loop as a continuous broadcast, and the connections made by TensorFlow are made visible – you can see them all in a kind of mirror world, pulsating and moving. The idea was to make this often invisible process visible. We’re always going to see authoritarianism, tyranny, wars, but do we have the tools that we need to deal with the manipulation of democracy, not only by people, but by computers? If literacy was a problem 100-150 years ago, what’s our problem now? I think it’s technical illiteracy.Why did you choose to discuss Brexit?In the aftermath of Brexit, I found myself being the only person who really wanted to talk about it, who didn’t think it was this horrible, miserable thing that we needed to move on from. I felt as much disturbed by people’s desperation to move on from it as I did by the intensity of it when it was happening. It was this strange political moment, [so] I wanted to do a memory project and hear what people think now that nearly 10 years have passed. The whole political landscape has changed. We’ve got Trump in office again, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we’ve got essentially a genocidal, settler-imperialist thing going on with Israel. I’m not saying that there was ever a moment in history where things were brilliant, but there is something about the manipulation of a population in western Europe [during Brexit] that seems to me as not the catalyst, but an important conjuncture where everything changed.I genuinely think some people saw Brexit as a moment of catharsisHow did you go about conducting the interviews? Did you ask them all the same questions?I [usually began] with: who are you? Where are you from? What do you do? What do you remember about 2016? And then the conversation would go from there. At the end, I would ask: what’s the difference between you in 2016 and you now? How do you feel about the idea of democracy? How do you feel about other people? Do you trust people?Is there a specific conversation that stands out?There was one conversation where one person told the most incredible story. They grew up in a gang-related family. They lost their parents really young. [They talked] about things like peace, reconciliation and how you deal with conflict. They said the most beautiful things about truth and depth and what relationships mean and honesty. I was blown away. I genuinely think some people saw [Brexit] as a moment of catharsis.There is a lot of discussion around the ethics of using AI, especially for artists. Where do you stand?As I was working on the piece, the conversation about [AI] changed. The way it’s changed education, has an ecological impact, and has come at the same time as an authoritarian, right-wing surge and techno feudalism, wasn’t apparent when I started. I started three years beforeChatGPTwas released. If anything, AI was still a little cool and slightly niche. But when you’re working on a piece with an institution, there is always that question – do you have the scope, the time and the money to change course? Rather than only spitting out a result, I wanted to turn my attention to the process itself, to the fact that it is organising and mediating human relations. If using AI becomes untenable, we as artists [have to consider] what our relationship is to time and history and things emerging that you didn’t anticipate before.You recently wrote about leaving London due to gentrification and rising rents. Why do you think things have gotso bad?I think we are the byproduct of choices made by generations above us that were unbelievably myopic. The shift towards neoliberalism was unforgivable, and I don’t just mean that because I can’t buy a house. You haveGrenfell. You have thousands of people [living] in temporary accommodation. You have councils themselves going bankrupt. Council tenants living with rooms full of black mould. Schools that can’t afford to do basic things – children coming in withVictorian-style poverty. All of these things can be addressed in a very simple way [but] for some mysterious reason, there is a taboo around the idea that rich people might need to pay their fair share.How do you think the creative scene will suffer the more unaffordable that London becomes?If I’m completely honest, it will continue to grow and thrive. All that will happen is kids who inherit wealth from their parents will stay in London, and people who don’t will move, that’s it.What does home mean to you now?The word home to me signifies different stratas of society. There was once a time where the idea that everyone might have a home [or] access to social housing, was not a crazy idea. Home for me now is this kind of old-school idea. It’s become a luxury. If you look at what goes for half a million pounds in London – you’re talking about houses that were built for the working class.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The University of Chicago philosophy professor Agnes Callard, who in some moods believes herself to be channellingSocrates, was forced to ask herself that question one afternoon in 2011 when she was discussing with a graduate student a particular thorny problem in Greek thought, the abstract question of why one means something singularly different from two. In the course of unpacking this problem, another related dilemma arose, however: this was the insistent fact that the pair of them – student and teacher – had, in the course of their discussions over that term, fallen suddenly and hopelessly in love, a less abstract kind of coupling.They agreed nothing could happen, but the next day, on a plane journey to visit her parents in New York, Callard, then 35, decided she could be no kind of Socratic disciple, if she could not, in this charged instant, be entirely true to her ideals. The “inner experience of love” she felt for her student, Arnold, 27, she thought, was of a different, higher quality to that she felt for her husband, Ben, though their marriage to that point had been contented and fulfilling, and they had two young sons. She resolved on that flight that the honest thing to do must be to end her marriage, and when she returned to Ben she did what her philosophical hero would have done – she engaged in deep dialogue with him about this problem. Husband and wife talked for a whole day about the different kinds of love (Ben was also a philosopher). “I had never felt so close to him,” Callard recalled. And the following day they decided they must get divorced.View image in fullscreen‘Famously ugly – bug-eyed, snub-nosed, and goatish’: a statue of Socrates outside the Academy of Athens, Greece.Photograph: Anastasios71/Getty Images/iStockphotoThat confrontation and its fallout for Callard and the two men in her life was set out ina profileof the philosopher by Rachel Aviv in theNew Yorkermagazine in 2023, one of the most widely read and shared articles of that year – and almost the perfectNew Yorkerstory with its mix of high seriousness and relationship carnage.At the time that story was published, Callard was working to complete a book about the third man in her life, Socrates. The revelations in theNew Yorkerarticle, when set out in print, prompted her to add a chapter about “Socratising” our ideas about love – that is to say, being constantly alive to their complications, always prepared to examine and discuss them, and to be resolute about the consequences of that quest for honesty.There are moments that pop up in life where I am reminded that the Socratic path is the only way forwardCallard’s – brilliant, compulsive – bookOpen Socratesand what it might mean to live according to his ideals of “hard-line intellectualism” is now published. A week or two ago, Callard was sitting opposite me in a basement dining room of a London hotel trying to explain not only the nuances of that philosophy – but also its effect on her life. One in which she is now married to her graduate student, Arnold, but also living platonically with her ex-husband, Ben, a kind of ideal philosophical throuple.My own grasp of Greek philosophy doesn’t extend much beyond the first verse of the Monty Python drinking song, but one idea I like to think I’ve half-gleaned from Aristotle is that though you cannot choose the life fate gives you, you can, crucially, decide whether to interpret it as a tragedy or as a (sometimes bleak) comedy. Doesn’t Socrates tend to fall, I offer (betraying my millennia of ignorance) into the first – philosopher’s – trap, of always looking for truth and reason where none may exist?View image in fullscreenAgnes Callard: ‘You’re living your life at the same time as not assuming you know how to live it.’Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAh, Callard suggests, shaking her head. And she uses that misunderstanding as a starting point for a somewhat one-sided hour-long dialogue of our own. “It is true,” she says, “that you can view life as a comedy or a tragedy, but I really think that Socrates thought there’s a third possibility. That is, you can refute things. You can investigate them, never settle on an answer. There’s an inquisitive mode of living, in which you’re living your life at the same time as not assuming you know how to live it.”That sounds familiar, I say.Socrates, of course, was convicted and elected to die for his indefatigable “gadfly” questioning – for his “corruption of the youth” of Athens by introducing them to critical thinking, specifically, “failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges” and “introducing new deities” – those of doubt and reason. Callard is good in her book on the difficulties of this heroic refusal to accept received wisdom. “People will announce, ‘Question everything!’,” she writes, “without noticing they have just uttered not a question, but a command.” Although doubt, I suggest, might be a good deal more prevalent these days than in ancient Athens (not least amongObserverinterviewers), does she think that we are generally built to live in constant conversational uncertainty – isn’t it a bit exhausting?“In the last part of the book,” she says, “what I basically argue, is yes, we are absolutely built to do that. And my evidence for it is to look at the parts of life where we have the most problems: romance, death, politics.”What exactly is her evidence?“What I try to do is show that our problems come from trying to manage what must be an essentially inquisitive activity, uninquisitively.”Because we try to seize on half-baked certainties rather than proper questions?“Yes. We’re screwing up because we’re not doing the thing we’re built to do.”In response to my somewhat confused expression, she reaches for an example.“Look at the kind of behaviour we accept as routine in the context of love and romance, and put it in the context of, say, food,” she says. One common idea of love “would be like seeing somebody standing outside a restaurant, and banging on the door, and you’d be like, ‘Oh, that restaurant’s closed.’ And you’d point out that there are these other restaurants that are open. And he’s like, ‘No, I have to go to this one.’ You’d say, ‘Why? Is the food really good?’ And he’s like, ‘No, I hate the food here.’ That’s just what we do when we’re texting the person who broke up with us. ‘He’s a jerk, but I need to have him.’ We don’t hear how insane that sounds because we’ve gotten used to it. Socrates would say there’s a better way. You’re built to do something else.”In Callard’s book, if I’m reading it right, the trigger for that better way lies in the presence of insistent “untimely thoughts”, intimations of death or meaninglessness, that should force us into that Socratic life of restless and playful dialogue with others. The example she gives as a failure in this regard – she is nothing if not intellectually ambitious – is Leo Tolstoy, specifically after he had just writtenAnna Karenina, was 50 years old, living on his vast estate, lauded by all society, but had fallen into grave despair. His undoing was a simple question, an untimely thought, that bounced around his head and would not go away: “What will come from my whole life?”That even the great novelist was almost destroyed by that thought, offers what Callard calls the “Tolstoy problem”: that rather than living lives of denial, we must instead not flinch from looking into the abyss of uncertainty. Socrates, she argues, shows that liberty lies in commitments to the questions themselves, to following them where they lead, without the hope of what Jeremy Clarkson might call final answers.In an earlier life when she was a student, I’m reminded, Callard went through a phase of going up to strangers in the public square, as Socrates would do, and trying to engage with them on the tough questions in their lives. It was not an unqualified success.She came to the US aged five, after her Jewish parents, a doctor and a lawyer, had found a way to escape Soviet Hungary. Her parents were committed atheists but she was sent to Orthodox schools because she could get scholarships “on account of my grandparents being Holocaust survivors”. She would argue constantly with the rabbis about the existence of God (“they were extremely patient” she says).When did she first come across Socrates, I wonder.“I was in high school, on the debate team,” she says. “On a summer course they mentioned there’s this thing called philosophy that you can put into your debate speeches, and you’ll win more.” At 13, she went to Barnes & Noble and bought one book from every major philosopher. Immanuel Kant was her first crush, but Socrates “famously ugly – bug-eyed, snub-nosed, and goatish” – took over.“I was into math and physics at school, because there were clear right answers,” she says. “With other subjects, I felt like the teacher was just making up the rules. But with this world of philosophy it seemed like you could have that same attitude as the math, physics attitude, but it could be about the difficult stuff that shows up in your life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe less directly in relation to the person I fell in love with than in relation to my ex-husband. I felt we were suddenly in a position where there was nothing to guide us. There was no way for us to move forward except to have a conversation in which we each just tried to say what’s true.”If there is one lesson from her book, it is the faith that truths emerge socially, from hard conversations like that, not from internal thought?“Yes. There was no mould for how to manage that situation. But it was like magic. A lot of people, when they hear that story, that’s the part they find the most incredible, the fact that my not yet ex-husband and I were just able to have a conversation about this, where we were like, what’s the best for us? When we got divorced, you know, it didn’t even occur to me that it would ever be possible for us to live in the same house, for instance, but that happened.” Her ex-husband, she says, is probably the person she speaks to the most, usually about philosophy, and often on the phone from separate rooms.View image in fullscreenSocrates’ Speech by Louis Joseph Lebrun, painted in 1867.Photograph: Artefact/AlamyAnd what about Arnold, her current husband, should she have trusted that first flood of emotion?“Did I somehow feel sure that things would work out with Arnold? I think I did, but I think that was a bit of an illusory feeling. But I feel confident that whatever happens with Arnold at any point, we’re going to be able to work it through.”If the tables had been turned, I wonder, and if Ben had fallen philosophically head over heels, would she have reacted in the same way?“I don’t know. I feel like a lot of what I now know about the situation, I learned from going through it.”Callard is 49 now. I wonder if she is still aspirational for the same kind of things as she was at 35?“My experience of my life is a lot like when my son, my oldest, was three or four,” she says. “I remember asking his nursery school teacher about his development. This was at UC Berkeley, I was a grad student, and they did all kinds of research on the kids. The teacher showed me a picture of movements of the child in the classroom over the course of a day. And his movement was like crazy zigzags all over the place. ‘That is what his day looked like in the fall,’ she said. And then she showed me a picture from the spring. And it was all calm and organised. And that’s a bit what my life feels like to me.”I mention something to her I’d read the other day, that the opposite of success isn’t failure, it’s boredom and loneliness. It sounds like, I say, if she’s learned one thing from these experiences it is that we are at our best as social animals…“That’s interesting,” she says. “Philosophy, I think, is a leisure activity. Indeed, it’stheleisure activity, but it’s not a relaxing one, or one that you can do on your own. It’s like sometimes we might watch Netflix or whatever, but we also sometimes need to read a classic novel. In a way, a minimal claim of my book is that you should extend that same generosity to your conversational life. You want to have these hard conversations, because they are some of the best things in life.”At this point in our dialogue, Pen, from Callard’s publisher, pops her head around the door to say I have time for one more question before Agnes has to leave.Socrates, I’m thinking, wouldn’t have liked the sound of that at all.Open Socrates: The Case for a Philosophical Lifeis published by Allen Lane (£25).To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Her acceptance speech was a rare moment when she talked publicly about her work – and, even more unusually, her life. Under the theme ofWhat Moves Me, she spoke about her parents, her teachers, her collaborators, her dancers. She described the impact of the death, at the age of 35, of her partner Rolf Borzik and later meeting Ronald Kay, a poet and professor of aesthetics and literature at the University of Chile, with whom she had a child.She went on: “Since 1981, the year in which our son Rolf Salomon was born, we have been living together in Wuppertal. After having to experience how a person dies, I have now been allowed to experience how a person is born. And how one’s view of the world changes as a result. How a child experiences things. How free of prejudice it looks at everything. What natural trust is given to someone. In general, to understand: a human being is born. Experiencing independently of this how and what is going on in your own body, how it is changing. Everything happens without me doing anything. And all of this then keeps flowing into my pieces and my work.”Salomon Bausch smiles faintly as I read this passage to him over Zoom. He is sitting in his office in Wuppertal, the city in which his mother lived and worked for more than 30 years, and he is gently sticking to his intention to talk very little about his childhood, his father, or his mother on a personal level. “I am happy to be part of that positive,” he says, enigmatically. “I think it speaks for itself.”View image in fullscreenVollmond at Sadler’s Wells in 2013.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The ObserverYet despite his reticence, there can be no doubt of the depth of his commitment to preserving Bausch’s legacy ever since her sudden death in 2009. Whatever his birth gave her in terms of inspiration and understanding, he is repaying by devoting his life to keeping her flame alive as founder of thePina BauschFoundation. “I felt a responsibility,” he says. “In the moment when Pina passed away, I felt I had to contribute something to making her work go on.”Pina Bausch was one of the most significant and influential 20th century dance-makers. From 1973 onwards, working with her own company of dancers on more than 40 productions, she forged a style of Tanztheater, a mixture of dance and theatre, which tackled the great themes of human existence through movement that is both beautiful and visceral, highly complex and yet often apparently simple.Her early pieces, such as her definitive version of Stravinsky’sThe Rite of Springon a stage covered in brown peat, were step-based, and have been danced by ballet companies. But her later pieces relied on the contributions of her dancers, a tight and committed group, who through an intricate process provided the material from which she wove works that operate like tapestries of hope and suffering, happiness and sorrow, violence and loveliness. Her pieces are much imitated but never bettered.Bausch’s influence extends far beyond the dance world and her own lifetime. Whenever a group of women strut in silk dresses across a landscape, or a couple argue about nothing, or surreal moment of beauty punctuates a bleak setting, people think it owes her a debt. Like Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett, she created a world that became synonymous with a particular viewpoint. Like them, she grew up in the second world war and was shaped by the experience.What is extraordinary about her work, however, is that although in the early days performances were punctuated by the sound of people flipping up their seats and shouting abuse as they left, now they are widely appreciated. The quiet German city of Wuppertal where she spent most of her life has become a centre of pilgrimage for people who want to glimpse her genius; the design studio Diller Scofidio + Renfro, creators of major cultural projects including the redesign of Moma in New York, has just been chosen as the architect of a new Pina Bausch Centre on the site of the now-closed Schauspielhaus.“I witness how many people are moved by Pina’s work,” says Salomon. “It happens in so many different parts of the world. There must be something really, really special about it that it gets somewhere so very deep.View image in fullscreenSalomon Bausch: ‘If I see a piece I can feel something of her.’Photograph: Carsten Behler/The Observer“I am particularly interested in those moments where people don’t know about Pina. In Wuppertal, for example, the people who come expect to like it. They know Pina is an important figure and so they get up and clap. But that is a habit, also. It is dangerous in a way. I’m curious to see people who don’t know anything about Pina get in touch with her work and how they react.” One of the “most crucial and delicate things to achieve”, he says, is the preservation of the humanity at the heart of her work. “People don’t want to see great choreography. They want to see human beings; they want to connect to them.”Now in his 40s, Salomon had just finished a law degree when his mother died and was about to start a doctoral thesis on “the right of assembly” as part of his plan to become a civil rights lawyer. But within two weeks, he had left his legal studies behind and set up the Pina Bausch Foundation, to defend and preserve her work.“There was no plan in place for somebody to do this. I try to contribute what I can. I think it’s helpful that I’m not a dancer or choreographer, and that’s how I can probably be in charge of asking the right people and putting ideas and people together.”He is talking as Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch arrives at Sadler’s Wells to performVollmond(Full Moon), premiered in 2006, and full of mystery and water. The company is now run by the French choreographer Boris Charmatz, who is introducing more new work to the repertory while simultaneously reviving Bausch’s originals with a new generation of dancers.“Vollmondis an important piece to Pina’s repertoire and to us,” Salomon says. “It is one of her younger pieces and very much linked to the people who created with Pina, the dancers who brought all their own vocabulary, and a way to move. It’s very individual in that sense; not a piece that’s easy to hand on. But it is important for us to be collaborating with Tanztheater Wuppertal to transmit those roles to new dancers. The last time it was danced in London [in 2013], there was only one dancer who was not in the original cast. Now it is the other way around.”The changes at Tanztheater Wuppertal – Charmatz is the sixth director since Bausch’s death – has made the work of the foundation even more important. It holds the rights to her works and while the home company remains its key partner, Salomon recognises that as new works are commissioned, Bausch’s own creations will be seen less often. So the foundation is expanding the number of companies that dance some of her most important works. “Provided it is well done, of course,” he adds. “But we don’t want Pina’s work to become less visible. If it’s not practised, it will be forgotten.”View image in fullscreenPina Bausch in 2007.Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesIts initiatives have included apowerful touring version ofThe Rite of Springwith specially recruited dancers from across Africa; more recently, a group of students from the Taipei National University of the Arts has been touring Taiwan with the work. The choreography is always taught by approved coaches who have worked with Bausch. The foundation has also been holding “repertory workshops” where dancers can learn a particular solo or part of work – just to give dancers the opportunity to explore the Bausch style. “It is really important for their life as a dancer to have this experience,” says Salomon.The other part of his ambition is to create a rich archive of material that documents all Bausch’s creations, through old footage and memorabilia but also by interviews with her key collaborators down the years. The site,available free to everyone online, is already a treasure trove of photographs, films and conversations, which not only give insight into Bausch’s distinctive working methods but also conjure the mood of her creative process. They offer a snapshot of the Lichtburg, the former cinema where she rehearsed, where everyone sat around amid a clutter of costumes, cigarettes and coffee cups, and saw no separation between their lives and their work.Flicking through the archive, you understand the absolute devotion Bausch commanded. The dancers who worked with her down the years and who continued to dance – distraught though they were – for her after her death were like an extended family. Dancers remember Salomon playing in those spaces when he was a small boy; before he went to school, he used to travel with the company. “Sometimes now I meet people, and they introduce themselves saying they have met me, and I’ve never met them. But I know who they are,” he says, with that slight smile.He has vivid memories of the music that Bausch used – and the sensory impact of Peter Pabst’s sets. “I saw rehearsals and performances a lot, so it always felt very natural to me. One thing I remember strongly is the lawn on stage in the piece1980. I remember entering the theatre and having the smell of the grass. It was something I really loved. That smell is a very deep memory.”View image in fullscreenA scene from Bausch’s Viktor at Sadler’s Wells in 2012.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The ObserverWith his round glasses and shock of dark hair, Salomon looks like a grownup and more sophisticated Harry Potter; he speaks gently, but with conviction and a certain intensity. Despite his immersion in Bausch’s world, he never imagined being part of it – “I don’t know why.” Even now, he prefers a night at home more than a visit to see a different dance company. His interest in dance is tied up with his dedication to the foundation, where his work is a constant voyage of discovery. “Even if it’s a piece I know well, it’s always different to see it. There’s a discovery every day, I would say.”It must be sad too, I suggest, watching his mother dance in blurry black and white, when she is no longer around. “I think it is a great gift for me,” he says, simply. “I can discover many things – and also even if it’s not something new, if I see a piece I can feel something of her. I think that’s a big privilege I have.”ProfilePina Bausch on filmShowPinaThis documentary by Wim Wenders was planned before her death and filmed in 2010 after she had died. Wenders had wanted to cancel the project, but the dancers convinced him to proceed as planned, as a memorial to Bausch and her choreography. It makes an excellent introduction to her work, and to the city of Wuppertal, including extensive excerpts from key works such asThe Rite of Spring,Café Müller,Kontakthof, andVollmond.Available to rent on AmazonPrime Video and YouTubeCafé MüllerOne of Bausch’s key pieces – to the music of Purcell and inspired in part by her upbringing in her parents’ cafe – this performance was recorded in August 1985, and features Bausch herself dancing alongside Malou Airaudo, Dominique Mercy and Jan Minařík, all founder members of Bausch’s Tanztheater Wuppertal in 1973, and Nazareth Panadero and Jean Laurent Sasportes, who joined in 1979.One Day Pina Asked …(also known as On Tour With Pina Bausch)A documentary film by the Belgian film-maker Chantal Akerman, made in 1983, following Pina Bausch and her dancers on tour, recording them at work as a new piece,Nelken (Carnations), finds its final shape. It also contains excerpts fromKontakthofand1980.AHNEN Ahnen/Rehearsal FragmentsA film Bausch made herself, which hasd lain unwatched in the archives for someabout 25 years, this loosely structured documentary goes behind the scenes on rehearsals for her workAhnen. Filmed on cheap cameras and concentrating only on what Bausch was interested in, it provides a remarkable insight into the atmosphere in which Bausch she worked.SCAll available to stream viapinabauschfoundation.orgPhotograph: Ullstein Bild/ullstein bildWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sometimes the archive provides inspiration in serendipitous ways. Meryl Tankard, who worked with Tanztheater Wuppertal from 1978 to 1984, has recently created a piece calledKontakthof: Echoes of ’78. This puts archive footage of the original – and seminal – production ofKontakthof, set in a dance hall, alongside the performances of nine of the original dancers, returning to their roles in a profound conversation between past and present. (It will arrive at Sadler’s Wells in 2026.)For Salomon it was “the most beautiful” way of incorporating archival material into a new creation. This linking of a seminal history with a vibrant contemporary presence is exactly what he is trying to achieve – and sometimes it takes a personal form. “Just yesterday, Meryl sent me a photo she had found of me and Pina which she had taken so that was also nice to discover.”He smiles again. It must be a big responsibility carrying a legacy about which so many people have so many views? “Of course,” he says, laughing. “Of course I worry. But I also see beautiful things emerging and I hope some more will come.” How does he cope with all the conflicting advice he receives? “I take the best and leave the rest.” It must require a lot of wisdom. “Well as you know, Salomon is my middle name. I always listen to what people say. It is not possible to make everybody happy, or just do what they say. But that is something I appreciate a lot because the basis is a feeling of responsibility from people who have a sense of responsibility to something they experienced.“Pina’s work is so accessible because you don’t really need to know anything; you can just experience it. There is such potential in her work. That’s why we want to share it.”Vollmond runs at Sadler’s Wells, London EC1 from14to 23 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsPina BauschThe ObserverDanceSadler's WellsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it has faced opposition from the Twentieth Century Society, which hassubmitted a listing application to Historic Englandthat could prevent its destruction.Built between 1966 and 1970 and designed by Diamond, Redfern & Partners, the building sits beside Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Molineux Stadium and is one ofa small number of brutalist buildingsof its type that remain in good condition.“This is an excellent surviving example of a postwar art school that has remained in its original use and survives in very good condition, and is loved by both staff and students,” a Twentieth Century Society spokesperson said. “It clearly has abundant potential to be sympathetically upgraded or reconfigured to suit whatever plans the university may develop in the years to come. On the other hand, demolition would simply be wasteful, irresponsible and anti-growth.”Historic England is assessing the School of Art and will submit its advice to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which will make the ultimate decision.A listing would mean the arts tower was of “special architectural or historic interest” and would have legal protection from demolition.Gavin Rogers, a senior lecturer in fine art and photography at the university, said many students were “angry, confused and disappointed” by the demolition plan. “Yes, it can get a bit cold in the winter and some double glazing would be nice, but any replacement would never match the spirit that this building offers,” he said.The building was the site of the First National Black Art Convention in October 1982, where many of the most celebrated British artists of the last four decades congregated to discuss what black art was forin the early part of the Thatcher era. Sonia Boyce, who won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2022 for her workFeeling Her Way, was in attendance, as was theBlack Audio Film Collective, including John Akomfrah, who represented the UKat the Venice Biennale last year.TheTurner prize winner Lubaina Himidwas present that day, as were other Turner nomineesIngrid Pollard(who also won the Hasselblad award in 2024) andClaudette Johnson, who had a studio in the building and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 2022 for “her contribution to the arts and creative industries sector”.Other alumni includeCornelia Parkerand the founder of the design website Dezeen,Marcus Fairs.Johnson was part of the Blk Art Group, which formed in Wolverhampton and included Janet Vernon, Dominic Dawes, Wenda Leslie, Ian Palmer, Marlene Smith, Eddie Chambers and Donald Rodney, who is the subject of a major retrospectivethat comes to the Whitechapel Gallery this week.Another member of the group, Keith Piper, whorecently responded to the Rex Whistler mural at Tate Britain, said the building was a site of “massive historical significance”.He said: “As the site of the First National Black Art Convention in October 1982, it will for ever be the location where artists who would become central to the development of British art of the following decades met for the first time and went on to form some of the most important collaborations of the decade and beyond.”The event was commemorated at an anniversaryconference in 2012 and a symposium in 2023, while a research project was set up by Piper and the rest of the Blk Art Group that includesaudio recordings from the eventin which Boyce, Johnson and Himid can be clearly heard.A university spokesperson said that under the current redevelopment plan the School of Art and Creative Industries would be relocated to a different building “where we will develop new, modern, inspiring teaching and learning spaces that help to foster creativity, collaboration, innovation and an enriched student experience.“This is a very exciting time for theUniversity of Wolverhamptonand we look forward to working with our staff, students and partners to deliver this ambitious and transformative programme.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageUniversity of WolverhamptonArchitectureWolverhamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

The star of the popular television dramaThe Splitalso freely admits that he saw his childhood stint as a church altar boy chiefly as a chance to enjoy the limelight.But the really surprising discovery for listeners is that if Mangan had not now been marooned as a guest on the long-runningBBCprogramme by presenter Lauren Laverne, he could never have made his next show.For on 17 February the actor takes to the Radio 4 airwaves again inThe Island, a six-part sitcom set on the fictional, deserted isle that has become famous in the 80 years sinceDesert Island Discswas first broadcast.InThe IslandMangan is washed up on the sands of the tropical haven, although it soon turns out he is far from alone. Alongside him, scrabbling for existence among the palm trees and looking out for rescue, are all the other guests to have appeared on the show so far. As a result, the beach is awash with discarded copies of the obligatory Bible, as well as the coffee machines and broken pianos his fellow inhabitants have each chosen as a luxury item. Worse still is news that these previous arrivals have formed rival gangs and that “it’s all gone a bitLord of the Flies”. It becomes clear over the series, available on BBC Sounds today, that the TV chefNadiya Hussainhas begun to hunt obsessively, that Richard Madeley has gone feral, and that Sandi Toksvig is hanging on to the conch.Mangan, who describes himself to Laverne as having an “itchy brain”, also talks candidly about his Irish immigrant background in London and the impact of the scholarship to boarding school that he won. Mangan later studied law at Cambridge University, finding success in university drama productions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The simmering menace he brought to the screen led one critic to observe that he could “make Hannibal Lecter look like Noddy”.Distinctive for his moustache, smart grey suit and tie, he was ever present inThe Long Good Friday(1980) as Razors, henchman to Bob Hoskins’s brutal underworld property developer, Harold Shand, who seeks to build his empire through the regeneration of London’s Docklands. Moriarty is seen driving Hoskins around on a quest to discover who is threatening this ambition (it turns out to be the IRA).After placing the barrel of a pistol in the ear of a police informer interrogated by Shand (played by Paul Barber), Razors reveals the source of his nickname. As he lifts his shirt to display endless scars on his torso, patched up by what he describes as “65 inches of stitching”, Hoskins says he is known as “the human spirograph”.Picking up a machete, Razors tells Barber: “Now you’re going to feel what it’s like, boy.” Several slashes follow in what proves to be just one of the violent scenes that, combined withBarrie Keeffe’s intelligent script, madeThe Long Good Fridaya high-water mark in the history of British gangster films. Moriarty is also alongside Hoskins when rival gang bosses are suspended upside down on meathooks in an abattoir.The film set him on a career largely typecast playing such characters, but on both sides of the law. “A guy in America saw it just after it came out, rang me up, the next thing, I was over there and starring in Jaws 3-D,” said Moriarty, who played the cockney sidekick toSimon MacCorkindale’s British oceanographer and photographer in that 1983 film.View image in fullscreenMoriarty standing behind Bob Hoskins (centre) in his distinctive grey suit and tie in The Long Good Friday, 1980.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveAt the end of the following decade, he appeared in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), the writer-director Guy Ritchie’s acclaimed gangsters and gamblers drama, as “Hatchet” Harry Lonsdale, a porn seller who bludgeons his enemies to death. When a criminal played by Nick Moran loses £500,000 in a card game rigged by Harry, he is given a week to pay up.The agent Simon Drew said of Moriarty: “The actor in him could make you fear for your life. If you knew him, the scowl quickly changed to a wry smile.”Paul Hugh Moriarty was born in Deptford, south London, the son of William Moriarty, a lorry driver, and his wife, Mary (nee Griffin). On leaving St Joseph’s Roman Catholic school at 15, he trained as a cooper at the Admiralty’s victualling yard for six years – while boxing as an amateur – before becoming a stevedore at Surrey docks, Rotherhithe, where he lost the sight of his left eye in an accident.When the TV producerTony Garnettwas filming there for a 1978 episode of Law & Order, Moriarty’s brother-in-law, GF Newman – the writer of the gritty four-part drama questioning the judicial system – suggested him for a part. As a result, he played a prisoner in the final episode and, as there was already an actor called Paul Moriarty, he took the professional name PH Moriarty.He was then cast as a pub bartender in the cult mods and rockers film Quadrophenia (1979) before growing a beard for the big-screen version of the banned TV play Scum (1979) to play Hunt, the borstal warder checking in Ray Winstone’s young offender in a manner that suggests the staff are as unpleasant as the inmates. “You have heard of us, Carlin, aye?” he asks as his colleague roughs up the teenager, who has assaulted an officer at a previous institution.In a similar vein, Moriarty played one of the prison warders giving a beating to Jimmy Boyle in A Sense of Freedom (1981), based on the Glaswegian gangland murderer’s autobiography.He became a regular on television and was clearly cast to type when he was credited as “Evil Jim Dalton” in a 1990 episode of The Paradise Club. Later, he brought menace to the Sci-Fi Channel series Dune (2000) and its sequel, Children of Dune (2003), as Gurney Halleck, a character distinctive for a whip wound on his jawline. The producers saw that the scar, combined with the actor’s damaged eye, made his face incredibly expressive, angry and sad at the same time.Moriarty’s later films included Evil Never Dies (2014) and Rise of the Footsoldier: Origins (2021).In 1961, Moriarty married Margaret Newman. She, their son, Mark, and daughter, Kathleen, survive him. Another son, Neil, died at three days old.PH (Paul Hugh) Moriarty, actor, born 23 September 1938; died 2 February 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmThe Long Good FridayobituariesShareReuse this content"

And I think what’s been going on with Karla Sofía Gascón is practically a lynching and I have the feeling that the brakes kind of need to be put on that.”The Spanish-Italian actor Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, who won an honorary Goya at the ceremony, said Gascón’s work was as good as it had been before, and that she had been subjected to a “destructive and excessive” backlash.“I don’t wish for her destruction, or for revenge, or for her to be cancelled,” Sánchez-Gijón added. “But I don’t wish this harm on anyone. She’s issued a full apology. She needs to be left in peace and she’s suffered considerably, as have the groups that were insulted by her words.”On Tuesday, Antonio Banderas said Gascón deserved the benefit of the doubt, adding that he felt she had also been the victim of transphobia.“I’m from Andalucía, and in Andalucía, there’s forgiveness for every sin,” he said. “If she’s asked for forgiveness, then she’ll get it from me. But, in any case, I think they’ve gone after her. There’s a lot of transphobia.”Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, a number of senior film publicists raised concerns over whether those working on the film, both during its making and its marketing, had, in the words of one PR veteran, “chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her body”.“Those tweets were despicable,” they continued. “But everyone was on board for this amazing fairytale: an unknown becoming the first ever [out] trans actor up for an Oscar.” That magical narrative, said another, curdled into “the absolute worst-case scenario”.The film, which was shot in France, has also caused controversy in Mexico, where many people have taken issue with its depiction of their country as a place of drugs, thugs and death.One Mexican screenwriter, Héctor Guillén,summed it up with a post on X that read: “This is a message to the Academy: Mexico hates Emilia Pérez” and described the film as a “racist Eurocentrist mockery”.Camila Aurora, a trans Mexican film-maker,responded with her own parody film, Johanne Sacreblu– “a tribute to Emilia Pérez” – which features “French” people in striped shirts, berets and painted-on moustaches dancing in the streets of a “Paris” that was actually Mexico.Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezSpainJacques AudiardEuropeAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The men who have farmed this land for generations protect their grievances as fiercely as they do their traditions, in this muscular English- and Irish-language tale of blood feuds and revenge. Michael (American actor Christopher Abbott, who learned to speak Irish for the film), lives in an uneasy amnesty alongside his sour-spirited bully of a father (Colm Meaney) and the nagging reminders of his own youthful mistakes. Sheep farmers, they share the highland grazing area with a neighbouring farm run by hot-headed Gary (Motherland’s Paul Ready, unrecognisable and frankly rather terrifying), his reckless son Jack (Barry Keoghan) and Gary’s wife, Caroline (Nora-Jane Noone), who happens to be Michael’s former lover. It’s a tricky coexistence at the best of times, but financial pressures, a pair of stolen rams and a disagreement over a gate ignite the long-simmering tensions.Bring Them Downis an impressive first feature from Christopher Andrews, who won the2024 Bifa for best debut director– a bruising tale of vengeance accompanied by a savage, percussive score byHannah Peelthat sounds as though it was played on scrap metal and abandoned farm machinery.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Bring Them Down.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsThe ObserverBarry KeoghanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Asta Olivia Nordenhof’sMoney to Burn, a bestseller and prize winner in Denmark, is the first novel in a seven-part series, inspired by a fire on a passenger ship off the coast of Norway in April 1990 that killed 159 people.The book buzzes with electricity. What animates it initially is a story of love and hate between a couple named Maggie and Kurt. Kurt opens the book but Maggie gets more of our understanding, with the story wheeling around their lives together and apart: their romance, his violence, their daughter, Sofie, the pain of empty-nest syndrome. (Maggie keeps checking the drawers in Sofie’s old room in case she’s left anything behind.)Scenes are short as the narrative dodges back and forth: in one line Maggie is remembering their romance, “where he comes home and lifts her up on to the kitchen counter”; in the next she declares: “No more men, they’re pigs.” Everything is concentrated: when Maggie has sex, she feels “a warm wide road is opening”; when she’s frustrated by worldly trivia, her “rage narrowed and came to a point”.View image in fullscreenAsta Olivia Nordenhof: anger boiling off the page.Photograph: Albert Sanvig MadsenThis approach is representative of the entire book. Its achievement is to be both scattered and focused, jumping from Maggie to Kurt and then the author herself addressing us: “Maggie was 14 the first time she was raped. But raped is my word, not hers.” One person dies, then a few pages later we’re back in their life; elsewhere, characters act as though they know they’re in a book: “I want to be happy on the first page of this chapter, Maggie says.” It’s the emotional depth running through the book that holds everything together, such as the powerful scene where a young Maggie tries to reason with her rapist, pitifully unaware of the forces at play.Then, in the middle, Nordenhof tells us about the Scandinavian Star passenger ferry, the fire, a likely insurance scam – and the deaths. Her anger boils off the page. “If there’s anything rare about this case, it is only that the victims of capitalism … aren’t usually located in Scandinavia.”There are hints to a loose connection between the fire and Kurt and Maggie’s story, but even without this, the energy of the narrative matches the rest of the novel. The overall sense is of chaotic life rushing past. Later in the book, we get a deeper understanding of Kurt – who we thought was a bastard, and maybe still is – as we learn about his youth in more brief scenes. Maggie’s story feels like a whole life; Kurt’s less so. Some readers will want a more traditional flow, but the intensity of the details we’re given would make that hard to sustain. (The same intensity, though, means thatMoney to Burnis a book with almost no room for the release valve of comedy. I counted two jokes.)The next volume of theScandinavian Starseries,The Devil Book, comes out in September, and will be a standalone novel. Will we see Maggie or Kurt again? Will it all connect in the end? It’s intriguing, it’s maddening, it’s exciting. I’m in.Money to Burnby Asta Olivia Nordenhof is published by Jonathan Cape (£14.99).

The mood-painting, with its contrast of village rurality and the sinister spookiness of the witch – invoked by a mother to make her naughty child behave, but only bringing tragedy – was beautifully realised. Chief conductor Tomáš Brauner ensured authentic colouring both for the folk-like Bohemian lilt and the elements of symphonic drama.Gabriela Monterowas the soloist in Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto and, if there was a connection with the Prague musicians, perhaps it was that last year the Venezuelan pianist was awarded theVáclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent. She certainly imposed heroutgoing, outspoken personalityon the work, enjoying the exchanges with the fluent wind players. Prokofiev wrote the concerto for himself, and Montero – who has also recently composed and premiered her own concerto – made light of the huge technical demands, while reminding one that the piano is a percussion instrument, weighting the bass with particularly emphatic force. By way of encore, Montero improvised in her now trademark style, riffing on the opening bars of Beethoven’s Fifth symphony as suggested by an audience member, beginning in baroque style and disarmingly slipping into Latin-American dance mode.After the interval came Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, dating less than two decades later than the Prokofiev and, in its biting dancing moments, occasionally echoing him. It was the central slow largo, conveying a landscape of physical and mental desolation, that came over most expressively, details of instrumentation emerging with clarity, not least the sweet irony of the celesta in its closing bars. The finale’s compelling and insistent energy, convincingly achieved with the PSO’s blazing brass, should have been enough to end on: as it was, the extra piece of unidentified schmaltzy Viennoiserie somehow sat ill with all that had gone before.Appearing inNorwich, 9 February;Nottingham 11 February;Basingstoke 13 February;Manchester 14 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBristolreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mark (James Westphal) is the older, estranged, gay brother who has made a successful life elsewhere while Tiny (Jerome Yates) has never left their faded home town in Hartlepool.We only ever see them coming together on the sands of Seaton Carew, to the cries of gulls and surge of water around them. Tiny feels an elemental connection to this sea and land, believing in its local mythologies, while Mark only sees its merciless qualities.There are lovely switches between humour and solemnity, as well as sadness and scratchiness between brothers: Tiny’s grieving vulnerability contrasted by Mark’s buttoned-up resentments at his father’s homophobic bullying. There are contested memories with gentle shocks and apologies. It is beautifully done through their exchanges on the beach.Writer Tim Foley has won several awards for past works (including the Bruntwood prize) and it is clear, from the love and lyricism in this script, that he is a striking talent. The play captures the brothers’ relationship with tenderness without ever slipping into sentimentality, and also conjures their backdrop in the post-industrial decline of the north-east.Co-produced by Pentabus and ThickSkin, what eclipses the delicacy of the script is the giant screen at the back of the stage, showing a mix of abstract water imagery and landscape shots, which at first seems like a good device for creating atmosphere and watery dread. But this cinematic element swamps the theatricality and feels too literal and overbearing, the evocative sound design by Lee Affen might just as well have sufficed.Co-directed by Elle While and Neil Bettles, there are two wooden beach structures moved around on the stage and in-between scenes but this physicality does not seem clean or distinct enough, the brothers’ movement a little woolly.An environmental message is tied to the prevailing theme of loss, with dead crabs strewn on the beach and polluted water, and a slightly strained analogy between the lies of the father, and that of the government.But the emotional core is full of truth, sadness and beauty, and it is this that brings the quiet magic of this drama.On tour until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSheffield TheatresreviewsShareReuse this content"

The heroine of Julia Raeside’s debut novel has already had a humiliating run-in with the wife of the colleague she’s been sleeping with, and been brushed off by Paul Bonatti, the celebrity comedian she’s supposed to recruit to host a new radio show – a show she’d hoped might signal her breakthrough as a producer. Now, thanks to a backstage tipoff, she’s learned that Bonatti, her boss’s pick, is “not a good choice if any women work at your radio station”.Don’t Make Me Laughis, at its most straightforward, a robustly funny and fleetingly soulful revenge caper, set in a comedy world that’s about to have its (long-overdue) #MeToo moment, but Raeside’s freewheeling style – a perfect match for lonely, lackadaisically flawed Ali – allows her to edge into some discomfiting, provocatively grey areas. Because while Bonatti is clearly a dangerous creep, it’s a certain type of self-styled “good guy” that the author dares to expose here.Ali, retreating to the bar to take stock of her lamentable love life and career, falls into conversation with another famous standup, Ed Catchpole. Older and endearingly shambolic, attentive and eager to listen, Ed quickly comes to embody all the care and devotion that’s missing from her life. He’s even up for presenting that radio show.Early on Raeside delights in dangling, then dashing, the notion that we might be in romcom territoryNo spoilers are required to reveal that he’s not at all the cosy, cardigan-wearing fantasy saviour that he initially seems. That he’s no Bonatti, either (to quote Ed himself: “I’m a cunt, but I’m not that cunt”), makes the ensuing drama all the more arresting. As Ali tries to wean herself off the intense emotional intimacy with which he’s reeled her in, she’s made acutely aware of the overlap between revulsion and residual lust, for instance, and forced to examine the boundary – troublingly porous, in Raeside’s telling – between coercion and collusion.Don’t Make Me Laughis not without missteps. A handful of chapters told from Ed’s point of view are heavy-handed, adding little. And it should probably be noted that the only decent male character here – Ali’s depressive dad – is deceased. On the whole, though, it’s a confident interweaving of action and ethics, building towards an ingenious Edinburgh fringe finale and revelling as it goes in the heavy-drinking grubbiness of a certain kind of unattached London life.It’s also full of droll turns of phrase and genuine laughter – never a given in a novel about comedy, least of all one tackling the industry’s ingrained misogyny. Ali’s married colleague, for instance, appears seductively capable when glimpsed out of the corner of her eye. Looked at straight-on, “he was a furious teacher waiting for a minibus”.Early on Raeside delights in dangling, then dashing, the notion that we might be in romcom territory. It’s not a narrative entirely devoid of romance, however. On the same night that Ali meets Ed, she also encounters two young women who will introduce her to a group of underground activists named Scold’s Bridle. Slowly but surely, Ali falls for that quaint-seeming, still vital concept: the sisterhood. The reader will be right behind her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just the opening of a show, but the launch of a new venue. A 550-seater theatre for dance in London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, part of a cultural quarter alongside a new outpost of the V&A and BBC studios. It’s a beautiful space that hopes to bring new audiences to dance, and as befits the occasion, this opening show is a party.Inspired by her own epiphany on a New York dancefloor, Vicki Igbokwe-Ozoagu’s Our Mighty Groove is set in a club, with all the mini dramas of a night out. The show has appeared in a few different iterations since 2013, but this is a bigger reinvention with an expanded cast. We’re introduced to the characters of the club, the selfie-obsessed influencer, the “mother” of the house, the nervous first-timer, the friendly security guy. It’s all very likable, readable and broadly comedic, and the dancers surge with energy, drawing on breaking, waacking, house and vogue, locked into the beat.Igbokwe-Ozoagu captures the club’s own ecosystem, the friendships, the egos, the self-expression, the possibility for reinvention; a few hours where life’s colours are turned up. It doesn’t go deep, doesn’t build character or drama beyond the surface, but maybe that’s not the point of a good night out. The point is what happens after the lengthy 40-minute interval when the auditorium is reconfigured, seats retracted, so that when we next enter we’re in the club ourselves, crowding around a giant podium and being encouraged into a tentative two-step. (Important: put your winter coat in the cloakroom if you want to feel free.)Your enjoyment of this show might depend on how much you’re in the mood for a boogie, especially at the end when there’s a half hour after-party where you can take to the podium yourself – the superb funk/disco/house/African-influenced soundtrack, by Ghanaian composer Kweku Aacht and British producer Warren “Flamin Beatz” Morgan-Humphreys is designed to get your body moving. Not entirely successful as a piece of theatre perhaps, but a fun, consummately feelgood show that’s a great night out and a great celebration of this welcome new venue.Until 9 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Small plates£7.50-£11.50, large dishes £9.50-£23.50, desserts £6.50, wines from £23, Cobra £6.30At the top of the menu at the Great Indian, a new and thoroughly delightful food pub in London’s Archway, there’s a set of slogans of a sort guaranteed to make my teeth itchy. It says things like “comfy”, “social” and “vibe dining”. I looked up the last one. Apparently, it means the place is, y’know, nice. We can all get behind nice. It was, however, another phrase that really stood out. It said “Indian influenced”. The Great Indian is owned by Aman Dhir who already has a takeaway of the same name in Hackney where they serve chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, aloo gobi and the rest. The executive chef here is Surjan Singh, an experienced restaurant consultant from India known there as Chef Jolly and familiar as a judge onMasterChef India. He has been spending time in Archway, alongside his Indian cooks and the Indian front of house team. The charming head waiter who served us had not long arrived in the UK from India.It speaks volumes about increasing sensitivities around dish origins and cultural appropriation that an entirely Indian team apparently think it wise to open up a little distance between the satisfying and well-executed Indian food they are serving and the mere suggestion that it might actually all be Indian food. Perhaps it’s because, among the small plates section of the evening menu, there are gunpowder Buffalo wings, which the pious might allege, with a performative eye-roll, must come from the upstate New York bit of India. Likewise, there’s a lamb “taco roti”, which might come from the Mexican part.View image in fullscreen‘Served in its own cast-iron pot’: chicken biryani.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThese are dainty folds of flaky, buttery roti, each filled with a hefty spoonful of a hot, dry lamb curry, in which the sauce has almost been cooked out to a crust around the meat. These are topped with crispy deep-fried curry leaves and arrive at the table in one of those zigzagged metal trays used to keep hand-sized tacos in one piece. If these were served as canapés at a party, one to which I would very much like an invitation thank you, anyone with good taste would be loitering by the door from the kitchen to get their hands on them as they arrived. Given all the ingredients, this is clearly an Indian dish. To describe it otherwise would be to set weird, po-faced, and arbitrary boundaries around what fits within a culinary tradition and what does not. We all play with our food. Be thankful that we do. The word “influenced” is happily redundant.View image in fullscreen‘Served with a chutney in the colours of the Indian flag’: smoked poppadoms.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDefinitions can still be helpful. The Great Indian is inside what was the Prince Alfred, an old boozer on a north London residential street. It is a restaurant serving Indian food housed in a pub. I believe we call those gastropubs. It is not, however, a Desi pub, like theYew Treein Wolverhampton, which I reviewed at the end of last year. A Desi pub is one which happens to have an Indian kitchen, generally serving the local Asian community among others; a place where you genuinely could just go for a quick pint or seven. There is a bar here, a pretty one with a jade-green tiled frontage, boasting a collection of gins, alongside Cobra, Guinness and Neck Oil Session IPA on draft. But the two high-tops for drinking at feel solely like places at which to wait for tables in the abutting dining room, rather than somewhere to pass the night. This isn’t a criticism. It’s a description.View image in fullscreen‘Heavy with roasted spice’: Punjabi lamb.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe ceiling is hung with artificial foliage and there are multilayered rattan lampshades. They care about small things. Start with the spiced poppadoms, which have been smoked and come with a chutney in the colours of the Indian flag. At the bottom there’s a date and tomato relish, in the middle, some spiced yoghurt and, on top, of that a dense mess of finely chopped sweet-sour mint. Hilarious amounts of work have gone into this idea, given that digging in with a teaspoon doesn’t quite reveal the full beauty of the flag. But it’s a great accompaniment and a nice story. Alongside the roti tacos we have their tamarind-rich chaat. It surrounds two flaky vegetable samosas, served warm, which peek out shyly from the crust of fried noodles and pomegranate seeds.View image in fullscreenFrom the Mexican part of India? Lamb taco roti.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAt lunchtime there are thalis at £14.90 built around the likes of butter chicken or tandoori paneer. Or there are bigger dishes priced in the mid-teens, which are proof once more of the power and joy, the depth and profundity, of brown food. The Punjabi lamb curry has a thick gravy the colour of freshly turned London clay, heavy with roasted spice and the sort of acidity that opens everything up. The dal makhani is described as having been simmered for 48 hours and there is a buttery-rich quality to it that suggests they really aren’t kidding. Come for the lamb tacos; stay for the lentils. Assume no one is watching and spoon it neat from the bowl. It’s cold and raining out there. Yellow weather warnings are in place. This dal will keep any storm at bayView image in fullscreen‘Tamarind-rich’: samosa and chaat.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe forgo a side of rice in favour of the chicken biryani, served in its own cast-iron pot. Take off the lid and breathe in the hot waves of cardamom and the sweetness of caramelised onions in among each spice-dusted long grain. Lubricate it with a little of the snowy garlic yoghurt with which it arrives. Or scoop it away with a crisp-crusted naan filled with pickled chillies and stringy cheese, which feels like the sort of thing you might order after a long session down the pub, when boozy appetite is fully in charge, rather than before. That one item shows a particular determination to feed. The sense is very much of a kitchen which, given the price point, is putting its back into the cooking rather more than might be expected.View image in fullscreen‘Sweet, creamy’: baked berry doi.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDesserts are sweet, creamy things. Sliced orbs of syrupy gulab jamun, for example, come on a splodge of rabdi, made by simmering sugar-rich milk with cardamom and saffron until it thickens. It’s topped with almonds and pistachios, and serves as a great defence against the miserable, thrashing weather outside. The Great Indian might be a slightly grandstanding name for this newcomer, but it sits comfortably alongside places like the Tamil Prince, only a few miles away, which have helped redefine what the gastropub might be. Doubtless, some locals will feel they’ve lost an old boozer. They should think, instead, of having gained a great Indian restaurant.News bitesThis week’s high-profile closure is perhaps less surprising than some. Café Laperouse is an outpost of a Parisian restaurant group which opened here less than two years ago inside the OWO (Old War Office) hotel on London’s Whitehall. Now it is shutting its doors. Despite the high prices – main courses topped out at £58 – it was dogged by a one-out-of-five hygiene rating at opening and less than favourable reviews, including from thiscolumn.In better news, chef Livia Alarcon, who cooked up a storm atQueens Bistroin Liverpool, has been announced as the head chef of the Dog and Collar, a new food pub on the city’s Hope Street. Alarcon, who is currently representing the northwest on BBC2’sGreat British Menu, says she intends to “celebrate British produce in a pub setting, pulling influence and inspiration from the north, my culture and upbringing,” The new pub opens at the end of the month (dogandcollarpub.co.uk).And news of another chef who made his name in Liverpool. Anton Piotrowski, who wonMasterChef; the Professionalsbefore opening the much-admiredRoskiin the city, is returning to his home town of Lynmouth in Devon.

This time, a couple of less-than-perfect aubergines and a paper bag of tomatoes were turned into a thoroughly satisfying stew, the aubergines fried separately, then added to a turmeric and cumin-scented sauce. The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a last-minute stirring-in of yoghurt and spoonful of crème fraîche brought a silky, almost luxurious note to my fridge-find. A shot of lime at the end made our supper sing.The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a stirring-in of yoghurt added a silky noteWhen I think about it, there is almost always an aubergine or two in the fridge. Like butternut squash, I buy them without having a plan. They are as much a part of a culinary squirrel-store as having a jar of beans and a packet of pasta in the cupboard. Their relatively long life means I can keep them for emergency suppers, those dinners I make when I have had neither the time nor the inclination to shop.The only ingredients I bought that day was a bunch of coriander and several garnet stalks of rhubarb. The latter catch was irresistible. A dozen glowing stalks complete with their (sadly inedible) lemon-yellow leaves. I carried them home like a bunch of gladioli, then cut them into short lengths and drizzled them with honey and cooked them under a hot grill with a very fine dusting of cinnamon.On the side, to bring the gift of a change of texture, I fried some cake crumbs in a little butter and sugar and scattered them over the soft stalks and their puddle of ruby red juice. I used brioche, but there is also a plastic box of cake crumbs in the freezer from a day I was testing cake recipes and froze the less-than-successful bakes, crumbled, with just this purpose in mind.Aubergines with tomato and yoghurtOnce the aubergine is soft and the dish is almost ready, I recommend lowering the heat, even turning it off, before you stir in the yoghurt – the sauce is less likely to curdle. Warm flatbreads or rice would be good here, although I often eat the dish this as you might a stew, with no accompanying carbs.Serves 5.

Put the aubergine in a colander over a deep plate (or in the sink) and sprinkle with salt.Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tbsp of oil in a deep saucepan and stir in the onions, letting them cook over a low to moderate heat with the occasional stir.Peel the ginger, then grate it finely (use the fine side of a grater or, should you have one, a special ginger grater). The result should be a soft paste. Stir this into the onions. Peel the garlic, then very finely slice each clove and add to the onions. Let the mixture cook until the onions are soft and pale gold in colour – a total cooking time of about 20 minutes.Remove the leaves from the coriander and set aside somewhere cool. Finely chop the stalks and add to the pan, with the dried chilli, cumin seeds and turmeric and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.Roughly chop the tomatoes and add, along with 400ml of water, and then bring to the boil.Warm 6 tbsp of oil in a large shallow pan. Tip in enough of the aubergines that will sit comfortably in a single layer and let them soften and lightly brown. As they colour, remove them with kitchen tongs or a draining spoon and drop them into the sauce. Then continue with another batch of aubergines. When they are all lightly browned and stirred into the pan of sauce, partially cover with a lid and adjust the heat, so the sauce simmers gently. Leave to cook for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.Chop the coriander leaves and squeeze the limes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the yoghurt, lime juice, coriander leaves and, lastly, the crème fraîche.Rhubarb, honey and sweet crumbsView image in fullscreen‘I suggest brioche for the crisp element’: rhubarb, honey and sweet crumbs.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverI suggest brioche for the crisp element, the textural contrast to silky stalks of rhubarb.

Reduce the brioche to crumbs, either with a food processor or a coarse hand grater. Toss the crumbs and caster sugar together, then scatter in a single layer in a grill pan. Watching carefully, let the crumbs cook under the grill for a couple of minutes until the sugar starts to caramelise.Transfer the warm rhubarb and its juices into bowls, then scatter the toasted crumbs over the surface.

I’ve heard complaints about how the wines are weird, dirty, mousy, or farmyardy in restaurants and bars, at wine trade events, and when I’ve poured “natural” wines for friends. But the prejudice seems to be so widespread now it even cropped up amid the gentle blokey banter on a recent episode of theGuardian’s Football Weekly. For me, it’s all reminiscent of the way people used to talk about organic wine, which, back in the 2000s, was often seen as being good for the earth, but bad for the palate. Natural winemakers might take heart from the fact, then, that organic is these days an unquestioned part of the mainstream, and even a marker of quality for some – an assumption that is perfectly justified in the case of Reyneke’s lushly inviting Cape claret.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.M Chapoutier Combe Pilate Viognier, IGP Collines Rhodaniennes, France 2022 (from £15,thevinorium.co.ukfrazierswine.co.uk;ndjohn.co.uk)My own position on natural wine is that it’s the next logical step from organics: if you’re not using chemicals in the vineyards, then it makes sense to try to avoid them in the winery. Like all wines, there are good and bad examples – it all comes down to the talent and application of the winemaker and the quality of the fruit they get to work with. And when it comes to the good bottles, I’d rather write them up as “wines” like any other, rather than singling them out as “natural” – it’s funny how many more people will enjoy natural wines when they’re not alerted to the fact (many more, I think, than there are drinkers who will only drink natural). It’s a similar story with biodynamics, the cosmic form of agriculture that requires its adherents to bury cow horns filled with manure in their fields and time their work to the astral and lunar calendar, and which, despite my reservations about the absence of science behind it, is used to make so many of my favourite wines – such as Chapoutier’s gorgeously fresh yet fleshy honeysuckle-and-apricot scented white.Orsogna Padami DOP Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, Italy 2022 (£14.50,vintageroots.co.uk)Michel Chapoutier is one of the world’s most vocal advocates of biodynamics. But he is no one’s idea of a small producer (he’s one of the biggest producers in the Rhône Valley and has interests elsewhere in France and overseas), and his wines are perfectly conventional – frequently delicious as they are, I’m not sure anyone would be able to say “these are biodynamic” in a blind tasting. The same is true of the case of organic and biodynamic red wines sent to me recently by one of the key players in the mainstreaming of organic and biodynamic wine in the UK over the past couple of decades: the organic specialist importer and supplier, Vintage Roots. The company sent me seven wines, of which the highlights for me were the softly plummy, sweetly oaked, superb value Orsogna Padami Montepulciano and the stylishly perfumed and slinky Domaine Bousquet Reserve Malbec, Mendoza 2022 (£15.50) – tasted blind, all of them could act as ambassadors to persuade any remaining sceptics about the merits of organic and biodynamic (if not, in this case, natural) wine.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His previous restaurant, Aubergine (fans included Madonna, David Bowie, Robert De Niro and Princess Margaret), was suing him for £1m for walking out. He’d done ‘everything by the book. It’s just sour grapes… High Court sour grapes.’His temper preceded him, fuelled by the spectre of imperfection. He’d just spotted a chocolate smudge on a dessert plate. ‘It’s upsetting. Yes, I am upset. I don’t employ 14 staff to cook 30 lunches and then send out a dirty plate.’Sunday Timesrestaurant critic AA Gill upset him, too, calling him a failed footballer (he had been scouted by Glasgow Rangers) and saying his clientele were ‘bloated plutocrats’. Criticise his food, fine, but no personal attacks, said Ramsay. When Gill turned up at Gordon Ramsay, Joan Collins in tow, Ramsay kicked him out.His father didn’t rate the new career and Ramsay ‘never stopped wanting that patriarchal recognition and working for it’,Boiling Point, he hoped, would show his father he was a success, but his death put paid to that. ‘Dad never forgave me for not being a footballer.’Ramsay, who had a daughter, wanted a son… ‘Whatever my son wants to do, it will be his choice and never mind, and I will always be there to pick up the pieces.
