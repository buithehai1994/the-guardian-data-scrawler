Brace yourself for copious talk of ‘body energy systems’Lucy ManganFri 20 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTShareHe’s the same! He’s the same!Noel Edmondsis the same! Even if he wasn’t quite your cup of tea back in the day, I promise you’ll be happy to see him. Fixed points in a universe changing unstoppably for the worse have that effect on you.Edmonds bestrode the world of 80s and 90s light entertainment like a Tiggerish colossus, presenting everything from Top of the Pops to Multi-Coloured Swap Shop to Telly Addicts – oh, how well I remember watching the latter as a woman proposed to her boyfriend and how beautifully Noel covered the deafening silence where the horrified man’s acceptance was supposed to go – to Noel’s House Party (let us hope Mr Blobby is ageing as well as his mentor), and more, including his last big hit Deal Or No Deal. He became a bit of a laughing stock when he tried to share with the world his discovery, via his reflexologist, ofcosmic ordering(an iteration of positive thinking woowoo) but never – I think at this point uniquely among his peers – coming a vilely scandalous cropper at any stage.He was last seen on our screens being voted off 2018’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. After that, he used some of the money restored to him after he won a huge case against bankers who had deliberately bankrupted his company group to buy an 800-acre estate in New Zealand and relocate there with his wife (“my earth angel”) Liz. Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure marks his return to television and chronicles their life running what he hopes will become a popular retreat, complete with vineyard, watering hole the Bugger Inn, spectacularly good views and spectacularly bad puns.View image in fullscreenTranquil rocking … Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure.Photograph: ITV/PA“I am rocking!” he says, and is eager to share with us the secrets of his youthful mien; “tranquil power” workouts in the gym, crystal healing (vibrations at 5-8Hz, obviously, or it doesn’t work), structural water (post-electromagnetised, in case you are not au fait), twice weekly stints in a hyperbaric chamber, and a big statue in the garden that watches over him. “All we are is body energy systems,” he … is “explains” the word? “They touch everything around us. Which is how you move into the bigger matrix, the universal energy system.” You know what? I loved Noel’s House Party. And nothing has ever made me cry happier tears than Noel’s Christmas Presents, perfectly-pitched every year on the side of “warm glow” rather than “mawkish sentiment”. He’s earned this.He remains unassailably himself – emotional, childlike, open (the curiosity/credulousness that lets you embrace cosmic ordering is also what allows you to connect with people and find something interesting about them all), confident and professional. The last isn’t an add-on but a part of what made him great. As he puts it at one point, he worked hard and took it seriously. He has an old-school respect for his audience and isn’t about to let them down. To watch him now is to be reminded how much contempt there is threaded through our entertainment, our culture now and what we have been reconditioned to accept as the norm. He also remains unafraid of the long march towards a terrible joke, as attested by the scene in which he lowers himself into a cold plunge bath. “It should have been three degrees! Because when will I see them – Mr Happy and the twins! – again?”If you were anything other than a wholly committed hater of the man before, you will follow him just as willingly as you did decades ago, this time through bad Kiwi weather instead of ill-fated proposals, money troubles instead of swaps, and chaos caused by tabloids instead of Mr Blobby (though we are promised a visit from the latter).When the estate reopens for the season, a local customer is asked for his opinion on the new landlord. “Seems like a good bugger,” he replies. So he does, so he does.Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure airs on ITV1 on 20 June and ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewNoel EdmondsTelevisionEntertainment TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what has caught your ear this yearRead the Guardian’s best albums of the year so farGuardian readersFri 20 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 11.02 EDTShareDoves – Constellations for the LonelyConstellations for the Lonely is a fabulous return for Doves: textured, layered and, as ever, occupying a space and sound all their own. From the futuristic reflection of Renegade to the soulful Cold Dreaming to the thought provoking A Drop in the Ocean, and the devastating realisation of loss in Last Year’s Man ... This is a band confronting the past, to channel hope and find redemption by coming through challenges that can only be overcome through genuine friendship.Steven, WolverhamptonBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosThis is a timely release, coming mere months after the abhorrent anti-Puerto Rican “floating island of garbage” comments by Tony Hinchcliffe at a Trump rally. Bad Bunny’s response at the time was fierce, rebuking all that was Trump, Republican, bigoted, and his first music since feels like a follow-up. In DTMF, Bunny refuses to cede space or stand down. Either from his position as a mainstay of the US mainstream music world or as a proud Puerto Rican. He crafts an album of one summer anthem after another, built to be listened to by everyone while unmistakably a product of the music of his home.Alex, BelfastBon Iver – Sable, FableJustin Vernon is finally happy! And he sounds perhaps more enchanting as a man embracing joy as he did as a lone wanderer in the wintery woodlands of Wisconsin. The album opens on familiar ground with the Sable tracks, and these build beautifully until we reach Fable and Vernon exclaims: “January ain’t the whole world”. From there on the album is a gorgeous celebration of accepting love and happiness through some incredibly vibey and experimental songs in theBon Iversignature. If Only I Could Wait, with Danielle Haim is a standout, alongside Walk Home, and the slow submergence into steady love through the album closers There’s a Rhythm and Au Revoir is simply perfect.Pulkit, ManchesterVukovi – My God Has Got a GunI’m convinced there’s a parallel universe somewhere in which guitar-and-drums-driven rock music still has mass mainstream appeal and Vukovi would deservedly be among the UK’s biggest music stars. On this, their fourth album, the pop-metal leans towards the heavier side, and lyrically perhaps nothing sums up these songs’ exploration of mental health struggles and self-doubt better than opening track This is My Life and My Trauma. But the melodies are strong and front woman Janine Shilstone’s vocals are as fiercely defiant yet beautiful as ever, underpinned perfectly by energetic riffs and tight rhythmical playing from guitarist Hamish Reilly and drummer Martin Sharples-Johnston.John K, BirminghamDavido – 5ive5ive by Davido gives me a new sense of hope and purpose. It helps me get on with my daily activities and to unwind in my free time. As a mum who’s constantly busy caring for a newborn baby, I find listening helps me with my mental health and encourages me to enjoy life and live life to the fullest. The rhetoric in the album is out of this world.Paola Adeitan, Marlborough, WiltshireThe Slow Readers Club – Out of a DreamIt’s such a great commentary on modern times, with real lyrical depth added to a sort of doom-pop atmosphere. I stumbled upon them by chance and saw them at a tiny venue in the Netherlands – they’re as great live as they are on their records. I can’t comprehend how they’re not world famous.Klavdija, Brussels, BelgiumThese New Puritans – Crooked WingView image in fullscreen‘I find it incredibly uplifting’ … These New Puritans: George Barnett, left, and Jack Barnett.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianI hadn’t discovered the band before this album so it was an absolute treat to work through their back catalogue. I love the textures and layers of the music on this album. It’s the perfect soundtrack to my evening walks in my local woods. There is a depth to the music that is spiritual and anything that moves me like this gets my attention. The opening track Waiting has a choral feel. It’s sparse yet such a complete sound with beautiful vocals. It’s not an upbeat album – far from it – but I find it incredibly uplifting. The production throughout is sublime.Ed Olhausen, High WycombeJensen McRae – I Don’t Know How But They Found Me!Absolutely every song on the album is worth a listen and suits an occasion in the day. Praying for Your Downfall and Massachusetts are cathartic for different reasons, while Let Me Be Wrong and I Don’t Do Drugs are cheeky and honest. Overall, the album is so human – it touches many emotional experiences with compassion and clarity, and shows off the very best of musical commitment to songwriting, vocals, composition, guitar and production.Alice, CambridgeSleep Token – Even in ArcadiaA perfect storm of everything Sleep Token does best but distilled and sharpened. It’s not a concept album, but feels like one. The lyrics have never been more deific but Vessel has never sounded more human. An incredible follow-up to a near-perfect album. I’ve never been as obsessed with a band as I am with Sleep Token.Ed, SouthamptonMarina – Princess of PowerAs a young gay man, Marina (FKA Marina and the Diamonds) was the soundtrack to my teenage years. I adored her cult classic Electra Heart album and remember when she was the undisputed queen of Tumblr. She continued putting out great music, including her previous album, the fantastic and pleasingly political Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land. But now, riding a wave of 2010s nostalgia, Marina is back in the charts and at the top of her game. The whole album is delightfully camp and jam packed with Eurodisco-esque gay club bangers. I predict that, just as with Charli, Marina is heading for a comeback.Oliver, ManchesterShura – I Got Too Sad for My FriendsIt’s a gorgeous slice of folk-pop that’s swimming with gentle, lovely tunes. World’s Worst Girlfriend is a great way in; Richardson, which features the warm tones of Cassandra Jenkins, has set up semi-permanent residence in my head.Tom Evershed, Melbourne, AustraliaWilliam Tyler – Time IndefiniteTime Indefinite is a powerful record and seemed to arrive at exactly the right time for me. Tyler finds and collects sounds, ranging from lo-fi and scratchy to pastoral and lush. Individually, they seem dissolute or even anxiety inducing, but by weaving in his own looping guitar it all builds towards something approaching harmony – or beauty. A bridge over troubled waters.Ed Yates, KnaresboroughMorcheeba – Escape the ChaosIt’s a grand return to form with the standout tracks for me the Stone Roses-esque titled Elephant Clouds and the bullet train inspired, anthemic Hold It Down. But the whole LP (I continue to buy black gold from my local store) is a superb sonic renaissance that can match that of their Cool Britannia peers Pulp. Give it a spin, it’s equally chilled and funky, a perfect way to “escape the chaos”.Rudi Richter, Nuremberg, GermanySharon Van Etten & the Attachment Theory – Sharon Van Etten & the Attachment TheoryView image in fullscreen‘Staggering, moving, uplifting and devastating’ … Sharon Van Etten & the Attachment Theory.Photograph: Devin YalkinSharon Van Etten’s work has always been emotionally cathartic, both for her and for us listeners; but I’ve always felt, much as I’ve always enjoyed her previous work, that something was being held back; but no more. Working with her new band and collaborators, the Attachment Theory, she has finally been fully let loose as a singer and communicator, and the results are staggering, moving, uplifting and devastating by turns. Her shows in the spring brought the new record vividly to life, and breathed new vital life into her existing material. Clearly these are the collaborators that she has always needed, and this record will undoubtedly be reckoned as one of the finest releases this year, as it would be in any year.Luke Dixon, LondonExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBon IverDovesBad BunnyThese New PuritansMarina and the DiamondsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The road has been long and hard, and I am very aware that many others have been on that journey since long before I even became an MP. The question of whether to offer choice to people at the end of their lives was first raised inparliament in 1936– almost a century ago.Since then, terminally ill people have pleaded repeatedly with MPs to heed their simple wish to have control and autonomy at the end of their lives. A courageous few have taken their cases to the courts, even while they confronted the prospect of their own imminent and inevitable deaths. The judges said it was for parliament to decide. Now, at last, the House of Commons has responded, and responded decisively to recognise the justice of their cause.Whiletaking this bill throughits Commons stages, I felt the burden of their anguish and that of those who are courageously and respectfully asking that their own death should be a good one, at a time of their choosing. It was for them that I and my colleagues took so much time and trouble to ensure that we put before parliament legislation that wasfit for purposewhile protecting everybody, but especially the most vulnerable in society, from any risk of coercion or pressure.Undertaking that task through the private member’s bill process has not been straightforward. But that is how conscience issues are decided in our democracy. In doing so I have been fortunate to benefit from the expertise of excellent and dedicated government officials, lawyers and parliamentary draughtsmen – the foot soldiers of our democracy whose contributions often go unnoticed. The government is rightly neutral, but its hard work helped give me the confidence that the bill that now goes on to the House of Lords for further consideration is the best it possibly could be.I have also been supported by MPs across the political divides in the House of Commons and that has been a hugely rewarding experience. It proved once again that on this issue, like so many others, it is possible to work with political opponents and that,in the words of my sister, Jo Cox, “We have far more in common … than that which divides us.”I believe that by working together with a shared commitment not just to get this reform through, but to do it carefully, responsibly and openly, we have done the job our constituents send us to Westminster to do. When other political arguments that we have day in and day out are long forgotten, this parliament will be remembered for many years to come for the decision we have made. And it is my genuine belief that in that time thecontroversy over this measurewill fade, just as it has in other countries that took this step long before us. And just as it has over issues that were once fiercely contested but are now accepted as sensible and fair, such as equal marriage or a woman’s right to choose.I hope this is the last piece I ever have to write in defence of assisted dying | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIf this bill finally becomes law later this year it will still take some years to implement, although I hope that delay will be as short as possible. It will come too late for many, including some of those I have met along this journey. Their courage is extraordinary and their selflessness is remarkable. They say to me: “I may not get the death of my choice, but if others coming later are spared the suffering and indignity of a painful death then it will be worthwhile.”Their voices have finally been heard. The journey is not yet over but the end is in sight. I would have been heartbroken if the vote had gone the other way. Not for me and my team and all those who have worked so hard on this bill, but for those whose lives would have once more been filled with despair and trepidation.I recall thewords of Desmond Tutualmost a decade ago when he said: “Just as I have argued firmly for compassion and fairness in life, I believe that terminally ill people should be treated with the same compassion and fairness when it comes to their deaths.” It has taken a long time – too long – for us in this country to heed those words but heed them we have, and I believe this will be remembered as a proud day for parliament and a day of hope for the future.Kim Leadbeater is Labour MP for Spen ValleyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Liverpool and Arsenal have been linked with the Swede. It would take a monumental bid to convince Newcastle to sell their prized asset, and for good reason. Isak scored 23 goals in thePremier Leaguein the season just finished; only Mohamed Salah (29) scored more.With few, if any, clubs prepared to match Newcastle’s reported £150m asking price, those keen on Isak could do worse than make a move for a striker whose style is eerily similar to that of the Sweden international. An Isak-lite, if you will. Hugo Ekitike is hot property on the forward market after he enjoyed a fine campaign for Eintracht Frankfurt, scoring 15 times and providing eight assists.Manchester United monitoring Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo EkitikeRead moreOmar Marmoush took the plaudits in the first half of the season, butthe Egyptian’s £59m move to Manchester City in Januaryallowed Ekitike to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight. He flourished with the added responsibility of leading the line for Eintracht, which was especially impressive given that they changed from a two-man striker approach to playing Ekitike as a lone frontman.Most of the top clubs in England are in the market for a player who can lead the line, so it’s no surprise that Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal andManchester Unitedhave all been credited with an interest in Ekitike. After an indifferent spell with PSG, the young Frenchman’s development is very much back on track in Germany.What stands out about Ekitike is not just his goals return, but the variety of ways he can hurt teams. His eight assists in 2024-25 stemmed from 44 key passes, the 24th best return in theBundesliga. His desire and ability to bring others into play will appeal to buying clubs. Managers no longer want their forwards to just put the ball in the net, but to act as selflessly as possible, whether that means providing chances for others or drifting to the flanks to open up space for wide forwards.The 23-year-old (who is celebrating his birthday this week) does this to a high standard. He likes to pull out wide to allow wingers to cut inside and wreak havoc upon defences. Arsenal and Liverpool, whose wide forwards love to cut in on their stronger feet, would certainly benefit from this approach. When Ekitike pulls wide, he has the requisite low centre of gravity to take on defenders. At 6ft 3in, he has good feet for a big man. Ekitike completed the sixth most dribbles (52) in Germany’s top tier this term.Not only does he look to put opponents on the back foot but his hold-up play and dribbling help to alleviate pressure ​o​n his own team’s goal. He can also press well. Having won possession in the attacking third 20 times – the 11th highest in the Bundesliga – his ability with the ball at his feet, combined with his desire to press hard and high, adds to the young striker’s appeal.View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitike celebrates another goal, but his game is about more than scoring.Photograph: Christopher Neundorf/EPAThat said, Ekitike is far from the finished product, which shouldn’t come as a shock given his age and relative lack of experience at the very top level. He is confident in front of goal – he took more shots (117) than any other player in the Bundesliga this season – but his finishing did not always match his ambition.Only Serhou Guirassy (25.41) and Harry Kane (23.29) generated more xG than Ekitike (22.55); the issue was that Ekitike’s xG underperformance of 7.55 was far and away the largest in the league. A lack of composure in the final third shouldn’t come as a surprise given his age but it is an area in which he needs to improve to fulfil his potential. Manchester United fans may be wary of their club signing another striker who needs a lot of chances to score given their frustrations with Rasmus Højlund over the past season.Time, though, is very much on Ekitike’s side. With the right coaching, his xG underperformance should come down. If he maintains his current approach, and does not dip in confidence like Højlund, he should be more than capable of scoring at least 20 league goals per season from here on out.With a number of high-profile strikers on the market this summer – Viktor Gyökeres, Benjamin Sesko, Victor Osimhen and Rodrygo may leave for pastures new – Ekitike could be part of a major transfer merry-go-round across the continent. Given he may be available for as little as £60m, he is perhaps the best value-for-money frontman in Europe. The rough edges need smoothing but his style of play and ability to operate on his own or with a partner means he should be high on the wishlists of Europe’s powerhouse sides.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFootballWhoScored?Premier LeagueTransfer windowManchester UnitedBundesligaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a site that subjects women to relentless scrutiny, and lo and behold it’s run by a spineless manFri 20 Jun 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 14.26 EDTShareWith as much as two weeks to kill before nuclear winter sets in, many of you will be looking to road-test your new fallout suits. In which case: can I interest you in the sensational unmasking of the founder of Tattle Life? It turns out the guy who operates the radioactively toxic gossip forum is a “vegan influencer” – I think it’s one of those new types of job, dear – and his name isSebastian Bond. From that professional description, Sebastian would never hurt a living creature – unless it’s a mummy blogger, in which case he would gut her like a pig. Metaphorically, of course! Sorry, but that is simply the price you pay for not declaring the nappies you’re unboxing on Instagram are actually sponsored.But I’m racing ahead. If you’re not familiar with Tattle Life, it’s an online forum that claims to be “a commentary website on public business social media accounts” – much in the way the torpedoing of the Lusitania was a commentary on the commercial cruise business. At one point Tattle Life was said to have 12 million monthly visitors. Which, to put it into context, ismore than the Times and Sunday Times websitegets, and considerably surpasses the visitor numbers of something like GB News. The other thing Tattle Life says about itself on its homepage is: “We have a zero-tolerance policy to any content that is abusive, hateful or harmful.” This is a little bit like the Racing Post saying it has a zero-tolerance policy for stories about horses, greyhounds or sports betting.In effect, Tattle Life comprises a pulsating collection of live threads, in which anonymous users spend their lengthy wine time ignoring their own kids in order to obsessively tear down Stacey Solomon for some infinitesimal perceived mistake she’s made with hers that day. That’s it, Tattlers – you crack open another chilled box of rosé and remorselessly slag off, dox or expose this or that influencer/Instagrammer/minor rando for infringements of a code of which you’re the self-appointed enforcers. And if you don’t like that description of yourselves, boohoo. What, NOW you want accuracy and restraint?Anyway, the site has been positively thriving like this for some years, despite regular petitions to take it down and frequent outpourings of distress from celebrities, sublebrities and whatever the class of recognition below even that is, many of whom believe it has either destroyed their professional lives and/or mental health, or had an incredibly good go at trying. Two such victims wereNeil and Donna Sands, a Northern Irish couple with a clothing line and various other small businesses. Donna discovered she had been targeted by site users in 2021, when a friend alerted her to the fact that people in her office were laughing over a 45-page thread about her. Forty-five pages! I guess no snowflake in an avalanche feels responsible.The deranged interest/abuse continued, to the point of posting her whereabouts at any given time, and drove Donna almost to the point of nervous breakdown. The pair sued Tattle Life for defamation and, after a long and complex battle, won. They were awarded a combined £300,000 in damages as well as costs – now estimated to total about £2m. But who was to pay? Tattle Life was run anonymously, and it was only a week ago that the high court of justice in Northern Irelandlifted various reporting restrictions and orders, leading to one Sebastian Bond being exposed as the operator of the site.Many think the floodgates to further legal action will now open, but whatever Tattle Life’s fate, it’s interesting as a period piece. The site sprang up in an era when fame came to be regarded as a grasping business decision and not as a cultural accolade. Anyone who made money in the public eye was fair game for anything. And look, no one likes a grift, we can all have sympathy for people who feel they’re being missold something or other, and most of us would fear the Faustian bargain of explicitly monetising our personal lives, let alone our children. But the elevation of even tiny bits of poetic licence by individuals most people have never heard of to the level of massive consumer fraud is mad – and says so much more about the self-styled cops of our age than the robbers.In the end, investigators got Bond via his own site’s preferred methods – obsessively tracking his public digital footprint, piecing together bits of often contradictory information, searching for chinks in his armour. The biter was bit. And, would you believe, Sebastian had pretended to be a woman on Tattle. Went by the name of Helen McDougal. “I was just not surprised that it was a man pretending to be a woman,”Donna Sands told the Mailthis week, “and pitting these women against each other – driving them to their darkest places.”So where is Sebastian Bond now? Some reports place him in Thailand, while others ran pictures of his parents’ nice house in Somerset. As forwhohe is … he’s a man posing as a woman in the course of drawing profit, an individual dedicated to exposure who didn’t have the nuts to reveal himself, a grifter who’d rather vanish than face his own music. In fact, so vast is the disconnect between who Sebastian really is and who he presented as for his moneymaking activities that there really ought to be hundreds of skin-flayingly vicious threads about him on Tattle Life. And yet, needless to say, there aren’t.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

El Bulli closed in 2011.“Copying El Bulli is over. Now it’s become a huge repertoire of techniques that each person can apply to their cooking,” said Jordi Artal, chef at the two-starred Cinc Sentits in Barcelona. “I wouldn’t say there’s a backlash; it’s part of the natural ebb and flow. We use modern techniques but in ways that hark back to Catalan gastronomic history. That’s the ideal.”Artal said there had always been a schism between those who believe you should only cook what’s in season and Adrià saying: “I’m an artist, find me the world’s best cherry in January so I can make my dish.”View image in fullscreen‘Copying El Bulli is over.’ A dish at the world-famous restaurant in 2002.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverCarme Ruscalleda said: “The concept may have changed but my cooking has always been based in the Mediterranean and its produce.” The chef was speaking in her home town of Sant Pol de Mar, next door to the restaurant where she won the first of seven Michelin stars. “We must embrace new ideas without losing sight of who we are. Catalan cuisine has Roman and Greek and medieval roots. We make many dishes that are basically medieval but with modern techniques.”This year chefs such as the Roca brothers in Girona and Jordi Vilà in Barcelona have opened – running alongside their flagship restaurants – more modest establishments where they offer more traditional dishes.“We are taking a broad but not a simplified view of Catalan cuisine,” said Joan Roca about Fontané, the brothers’ latest venture, where prices are well below those of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world.Vilà, chef at one-starred Alkimia and the more homespun Al Kostat del Mar, said: “Joan Roca and Carme Ruscalleda have always cooked Catalan food but what happened was that what became important was what we callcocina vanguardista[avant-garde cuisine],when what really matters is to use local produce and express yourself in your cooking.“Many young chefs don’t aspire to be Joan Roca or Ferran Adrià but want to cook the dishes their mothers or grandmothers made.”Tradition doesn’t always come cheap, however. The tasting menus at high-end restaurants such as El Celler de Can Roca cost upwards of €200 (£170), without wine.Oriol Castro, one of three chefs – all ex-El Bulli – behind Disfrutar, voted best restaurant in the world last year, said no one expected people to pay those sorts of prices for basic Catalan dishes.View image in fullscreenEl Celler de Can Roca in 2013. The restaurant has twice been voted best in the world.Photograph: Carlos Sanchez Pereyra/Alamy“In Disfrutar we offer many dishes based on traditional recipes, with new techniques but traditional flavours, such as asuquet de peix[fish and potato stew] ormar i muntanya[seafood and rabbit or chicken casserole],” said Castro, who insists there is no backlash against the El Bulli school of cooking.“People come here to eat modern, creative versions of traditional dishes. What’s important is the combination of creativity and tradition. There isn’t a war. All of us want to preserve this tradition.”Artal said that while he was no purist, in keeping with his principles there were only Catalan and Spanish wines on his wine list. “I can’t explain to a customer that a dish was inspired by my great-grandmother and that we’re using locally sourced ingredients and then serve a wine from Bordeaux,” he said. “I love yuzu but there’s no yuzu on the menu because I couldn’t say my grandmother used yuzu.”Everyday Catalan cuisine may be in good health outside Barcelona but in the capital it’s far easier to find ramen, sushi, hamburgers or pizza than traditional fare.“I’m not against ramen or hamburgers, I’m against globalization,” said Vilà, who has published a humorous “self-defence manual” for Catalan cooking. “Here there are 50 ramen places and none that serveescudella,” a traditional Catalan stew containing pasta or noodles.Ruscalleda said: “Young people are attracted to the new, so they order sushi or ceviche but they don’t know about their own culture.” She shares the view that the biggest threat to traditional cuisine everywhere is that people have stopped cooking at home.In the meantime, it seems it is up to the culinary elite to maintain tradition, a paradox that Vilà accepts.“We’re in a transition because the grandmothers of the future don’t want to stay at home cooking, they want to be out in the world,” he said. “Obviously, a top chef is no substitute for a grandmother, but it’s up to us keep the tradition alive.”Explore more on these topicsCataloniaSpainRestaurantsSpanish food and drinkFerran AdriaEuropeFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will head to the House of Lords and peers are not expected to block its progress, though opponents said they would continue to fight the bill there. Royal assent is widely expected by the end of the year.It will give people with less than six months to live in England andWalesthe right to an assisted death after approval from two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer.Opening the debate, Leadbeater said now was the time to seize the moment, to “correct the profound injustices of the status quo and to offer a compassionate and safe choice to terminally ill people who want to make it”.The Labour MP for Spen Valley said it was “not a choice between living and dying – it is a choice for terminally ill people about how they die”. She said rejecting the bill was “not a neutral act, it is a vote for the status quo … and it fills me with despair to think MPs could be here in another 10 years’ time hearing the same stories”.Terminally ill people and families were in the public galleries watching the debate and at a rally in Parliament Square. Dame Esther Rantzen, terminally ill with lung cancer, whom Starmer promised he would make parliamentary time to debate the bill, said she had never quite believed it would come to pass.“It won’t come in my lifetime, I won’t live long enough, but I am so relieved it will help future generations to look forward to a good death. I am astonished I have lived to see the moment,” she said.How did your MP vote on the assisted dying billRead moreConcerns were raised by disability activists, who held a protest outside parliament, and MPs opposed to the bill made passionate pleas that it would lead to people being coerced into ending their lives early.The bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, a former chief nursing officer for England, said it would be a service introduced amid multiple risks to the most vulnerable, including serious shortfalls in social and palliative care.“It does not prevent terminally ill people who perceive themselves to be a burden to their families and friends from choosing assisted dying,” she said. “And it would mean that we became a society where the state fully funds a service for terminally ill people to end their own lives but shockingly only funds around one-third of palliative care.”Opening the debate for those opposed to the bill, the former foreign secretary James Cleverly said he was an atheist but had rejected the bill because he believed the right safeguards were not in place.“We were promised the gold standard, a judicially underpinned set of protections and safeguards,” he said, citing concerns from professional bodies including the Royal College of Psychiatrists. “I disagree with [Leadbeater’s] assessment that it is now or never, and it is this bill or no bill, and that to vote against this at third reading is a vote to maintain the status quo. None of those things are true.”The cabinet was deeply split on the legislation. Cabinet ministers to join Starmer voting in favour included Rachel Reeves, Yvette Cooper, John Healey, Liz Kendall, Pat McFadden, Heidi Alexander, Ed Miliband, Steve Reed and Peter Kyle.Among those opposed were Angela Rayner, Bridget Phillipson, Jonathan Reynolds, Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Darren Jones.The Labour peer Charlie Falconer will take over shepherding the bill through the Lords, with backing from Conservative peers including Michael Forsyth and the former Scottish secretary Alister Jack.Should the bill pass the Lords, there will be no provision in place for a number of years. The government and NHS have four years to implement the bill, though Leadbeater has said she hoped it would be ready sooner. There are no answers, as yet, as to whether the NHS would provide the service or private providers, or whether it would be free at the point of use.Terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months will have be of sound mind to proceed, but MPs rejected an amendment that would have prevented anyone from accessing the service on the basis of feeling too much of a burden to loved ones. There will be criminal sanctions on any family member found to be coercing someone to choose to hasten their deaths.Through the debate, proponents of the bill sought to argue that MPs could not allow the status quo to persist.The Labour MP David Burton-Sampson said his Christian beliefs had meant he was initially against assisted dying but the exertions from constituents who described their loved ones dying in excruciating pain had persuaded him to support it.“In my view, this bill has more controls than it had, the debate has been ongoing for many years, it has gone through hours of scrutiny … I believe in choice and while I believe assisted dying is not for me, it should be a choice for others,” he said.Many speaking in support or against the bill told of some of the hardest moments of their lives, such as the Conservative MP Mark Garnier, who spoke of his mother’s drawn-out death from pancreatic cancer. He said she had endured more suffering and anguish compared with a constituent with the same disease who ended their life under assisted dying laws in Spain.Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh’s voice broke with emotion describing her sister’s death from brain cancer, and her fears her life would have been shortened had such a law existed sooner.From both Labour and the Conservatives there were warnings that the bill would herald a watershed moment that could not be undone. The mother of the house, the Labour MP Diane Abbott, said MPs should oppose the bill on behalf of the marginalised.“I came to this house to be a voice for the voiceless. Who could be more voiceless than somebody who is in their sickbed and believes they are dying? I ask members in this debate to speak up for the voiceless one more time,” Abbott said.Two MPs, the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat and Labour’s Chi Onwurah, said they were deeply concerned about the fundamental shift in the role of the state, giving it the power to end life.The Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft, whoresigned a whip on Thursday nightin protest at the government’s disability cuts, spoke against the bill citing her fears for disabled people, as many campaigners protested outside parliament.“The vast majority of disabled people and their organisations oppose it,” she said. “They need the health and social care system fixing first. They want us as parliamentarians to assist them to live, not to die.”2:04MPs deliver powerful speeches in assisted dying bill debate – videoStarmer, a strong supporter of the law change, had made his decision to vote at third reading some time ago, but No 10 declined to disclose it in advance on the prime minister’s insistence, conscious that making a firm commitment to do so might be too leading when the government was neutral.Before the final vote on the bill, MPs passed several new amendments, including two from opponents of the bill. One would bar those who refuse food and water from being classified as having a terminal illness, though MPs concerned about anorexia said it may not prevent that slipping through the gap. The other would commission the health secretary to report on the state of palliative care.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHealth policyEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

We support the continuation of discussion with [Britain, France, Germany and the EU] and express our readiness to meet again in the near future.”Late on Friday, Donald Trump said he was unlikely to press Israel to scale back its campaign to allow negotiations to continue.“I think it’s very hard to make that request right now. If somebody is winning, it’s a little bit harder to do than if somebody is losing, but we’re ready, willing and able, and we’ve been speaking to Iran, and we’ll see what happens,” he said.Araghchi said he was willing to continue talks with his European counterparts since they have not supported Israel’s attacks directly. But he said Iran was “seriously concerned over the failure of the three countries to condemn Israel’s act of aggression” and would continue to exercise its right to “legitimate defence”.Israeli strikes have not knocked out Iran’s nuclear programme - or its nuclear ambitionsRead moreHe also said Iran’s capabilities, including its missile capabilities, are non-negotiable, and could not form part of the talks, a rebuff to the French president, Emmanuel Macron,who in an earlier statement said they should be included in the talks.With Israelidiplomats and military commanders warning of a “prolonged war”, the route to direct talks between the US and Iran remains blocked, leaving the European countries as intermediaries.After Friday’s talks between Araghchi and his British, French and German counterparts, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don’t see regional escalation of this conflict.”The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said there “can be no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem. Military operations can delay it but they cannot eliminate it”.The talks are being held against the backdrop of Trump’s threat that the US could launch its own military assault on Iran within a fortnight – a step that would probably turn the already bloody war into a full-scale regional conflagration.European diplomats said they came to talks to deliver a tough message from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and special envoy, Steve Witkoff: that the threat of US military action is real but that a “diplomatic pathway remains open”.But without direct talks between the US and Iran it is hard to see how an agreement can be reached to curtail Iran’s nuclear programme in a way that satisfies the US headline demand that Iran must never have a nuclear bomb.Trump suggested that European efforts would not be enough to bring any resolution. He said: “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this.”The European ministers said they had expressed their longstanding concerns about Iran’s expansion of its nuclear programme, “which has no credible civilian purpose and is in violation of almost all provisions in the nuclear deal agreed in 2015”.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Today the regional escalation benefits no one. We must keep the discussions open.”Earlier on Friday, Macron said the European offer to end Israel’s war would include an Iranian move to zero uranium enrichment, restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and an end to Tehran’s funding of terrorist groups.The proposals were surprisingly broad, spanning a range of complex issues beyond Iran’s disputed nuclear programme, and appeared likely to complicate any solution unless an interim agreement can be agreed.One proposal recently aired is for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment for the duration of Trump’s presidency. The concept of uranium enrichment beingoverseen by a consortium of Middle East countries– including Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – remains on the table.Macron, already accused by Trump of publicity seeking this week, set out a daunting agenda. “It’s absolutely essential to prioritise a return to substantial negotiations, including nuclear negotiations to move towards zero [uranium] enrichment, ballistic negotiations to limit Iran’s activities and capabilities, and the financing of all terrorist groups and destabilisation of the region that Iran has been carrying out for several years,” he said.In the previous five rounds of talks, the US insisted that Iran end its entire domestic uranium enrichment programme, but said it would allow Iran to retain a civil nuclear programme, including by importing enriched uranium from a multinational consortium.Iran claims that as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, it has an absolute legal right to enrich uranium, a position neither the European nor American powers have endorsed. In the past, European negotiators have proved more adept than their US partners in finding compromises, including the temporary suspension of domestic enrichment, a principle Tehran reluctantly endorsed between 2003 and 2004.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranIsraelTrump administrationEuropean UnionIran nuclear dealMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The deputy district judge Lee Marklew remanded her into custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 24 June.He told her: “You will meet your barrister and will be given some advice in the coming weeks. This is an administrative hearing. You will be remanded in custody until then.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It said there might be a chance of flooding after the ground had hardened during the dry weather.A number of areas could reach heatwave thresholds on Friday if high temperatures are recorded for a third consecutive day.The Met Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey said: “There are scattered thunderstorms coming through. Some of the rain could be quite intense, and frequent lightning, hail, gusty winds and some heavy downpours, which we haven’t seen for a while.“Some of the ground is quite hard at the moment, and when you get heavy rain hitting hard ground, it can cause surface water issues. You might find surface water on the roads, drains finding it difficult to cope, and a small chance of homes being flooded.”An official heatwave is recorded when areas reach a certain temperature for three consecutive days, with thresholds varying from 25C to 28C in different parts of the UK.Temperatures reached32.2C in Kew, west London, on Thursday, with an amber heat-health alert in place for all regions in England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The newborn’s heel is pricked to collect a few drops of blood on a card that is sent away to be tested.Along with a greater focus on prevention, the 10-year plan is expected to include Streeting’s other “shifts” in the NHS, from hospitals towards more community-focused care and from analogue to digital services.Last week the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced that the government would increase NHS funding by £29bn a year in real terms over the next three years.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan will be published soon and will set out details for a range of initiatives to advance the NHS and make it fit for the future.”In October, the NHS in England announced it was toscreen 100,000 newborn babiesfor more than 200 genetic conditions in a world-first scheme aimed at bolstering early diagnosis and treatment.Explore more on these topicsGeneticsNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Italian coastguard said the recovery was scheduled to begin on Saturday morning.A spokesperson for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation, said the vessel had been slowly raised from the seabed, 50 metres (165ft) down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel.The operation – which has cost approximately $30m (£22m) - was made easier after the vessel’s 72-metre mast was detached using a remote-controlled cutting tool and placed on the seabed on Tuesday.The vessel will be transported to the port of Termini Imerese, where investigators are expected to examine it as part of an inquiry into the cause of the sinking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nine other crew members and six guests – including Bacares – were rescued.The salvage operation was very complex, and was temporarily suspended in mid-May after Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died during underwater work.The British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which oversaw a consortium of salvage specialists undertaking the project, said the hull would be lifted on to a specially manufactured steel cradle on the quayside once it had been transported to Termini Imerese.Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues to the causes of the sinking. A forensic examination of the hull will seek to determine whether one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The boat’s captain, James Cutfield, from New Zealand, and two British crew members,Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths, have been placed under investigation. InItaly, this does not imply guilt or mean that formal charges will necessarily follow.According to a preliminary safety report released last month by the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch, the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds when running on its engine and that these “vulnerabilities” were “unknown to either the owner or the crew” as they were not included in the stability information book carried onboard.The MAIB said a possible “tornadic waterspout” headed towards the boats in the harbour. The docks seemed to divert the whirlwind, which went straight towards the Bayesian, and the vessel sank in the space of a few seconds.In September, Italian authorities requested additional security around the wreck of the Bayesian, after fears were raised that material in watertight safes onboard might be of interest to foreign governments.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She tried on sunglasses and a swimsuit for their first family holiday two months later.The following morning, Genevieve’s mother, Katie Wheeler, took her to Tiny Toes nursery for only her second full day. Wheeler told staff that Gigi, as she was known, had been a bit “snotty” but was otherwise fine. And with a goodbye, she said: “I love you, sweetie.”Just over seven hours later, Genevieve was pronounced dead. In what was supposed to be the safest place in the world, she had beenstrapped face down to a beanbagfor an hour and 37 minutes and her cries of distress ignored. She was eventually found lifeless and blue, having died of suffocation.Kate Roughley, the deputy manager of the nursery in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, was last yearfound guilty of manslaughterandjailed for 14 yearsafter a trial at Manchester crown court. But the fight for justice continues.In their first national newspaper interview, Genevieve’s parents said they had been left distressed and shocked by what they had learned since – about the practices of that nursery but also wider “systemic” safety lapses they believed risked further tragedies in early years settings across the country.John Meehan, Genevieve’s father, said his daughter’s killer would not have been convicted without CCTV footage, which they are nowcampaigning to be made mandatoryin nurseries.View image in fullscreenKatie Wheeler and John Meehan, the parents of nine-month-old Genevieve.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianVideo played in court showed Roughley impatiently handling the baby girl before she died, muttering: “Vile” and singing: “Oh Genevieve. Genevieve go home, Genevieve go home, go home Genevieve,” as the she cried on the play mat.The CCTV also disproved the nursery worker’s claim that she had checked on Genevieve every couple of minutes. And it later led to the conviction of one of Roughley’s colleagues, Rebecca Gregory, for the “deplorable” neglect of four other babies. An ongoing health and safety inquiry could result in further prosecutions.“But for the CCTV, we would have had absolutely no way of knowing about the way Genevieve was placed on a beanbag, about the infrequency of the checks, or about the general conduct towards Genevieve on the day. We really only got an answer because of the CCTV,” said Meehan, 39.This week, Roksana Lecka, 22, wasconvictedof abusing 21 babies at a nursery in Twickenham, south-west London, after footage showed the worker pinching and scratching children and kicking one boy in the face. In that case, as Genevieve’s, CCTV was essential to the prosecution.View image in fullscreenLife without Genevieve was ‘agonisingly painful’, her mother said.Photograph: Katie WheelerMeehan said: “Many responsible nurseries are already using CCTV very effectively, so all we’re saying is to make it so that all nurseries have it. It’s good for the nursery, it’s good for the parents, it’s good forOfsted.”Figuresobtained by the BBClast year, and described by the couple as “horrifying”, show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England’s nurseries in the five years to March 2024 – up 40% on the previous five-year period. The law firm Farleys Solicitors has said the number of legal claims involving injuries to children in nurseries has increased tenfold over the past decade.Wheeler, 40, said Ofsted should be given greater powers to undertake more frequent announced and unannounced inspections of nurseries. At present, the regulator is only obliged to inspect nurseries in England once every six years, compared with once every four academic years for schools.Tiny Toes nursery, where Genevieve was killed, was rated “good” by Ofsted five years earlier, but the trialheard evidencesuggesting it was run “shockingly”. On the day Genevieve died, Roughley was one of only two members of staff looking after 11 babies. The previous weekday there were 16 babies – far in excess of the one-to-three ratio for under-twos in England.“I think the system definitely fails parents,” said Wheeler, who wants Ofsted to increase its number of unannounced inspections – which it currently only does when a specific concern has been raised – and to review CCTV when it is available.“You’re never going to get a true snapshot of what a place is like and how safe it is unless you go out on a no-notice inspection and when you look at it regularly. A lot changes over six years. It’s life and death – and it’s not overstating it to say that.”View image in fullscreen‘Many responsible nurseries are already using CCTV very effectively, so all we’re saying is to make it so that all nurseries have it,’ said John Meehan.Photograph: Katie WheelerLife without Genevieve was “agonisingly painful,” Wheeler said, describing the nine-month-old who relished her world full of cuddles, singing, dancing, food, her favourite green toy tambourine and “her everything”: her big sister, who is now nine.The parents are planning to meet Labour’s early education minister, Stephen Morgan, later this month to press for improved safety in nurseries, including CCTV, more Ofsted inspections and a new legal framework to ban unsafe sleep practices, supported by the Lullaby Trust.Failing to enact the changes, Meehan said, risked further tragedies: “There could be more deaths. There is absolutely that risk.”The Department for Education said it was boosting safety in nurseries with new measures from September, including strengthening whistleblowing and recruitment, but that it would closely monitor whether further changes were needed.It added: “Genevieve’s death was a tragedy and should never have happened. This government is committed to doing everything possible to keep children safe, as part of our mission to break down barriers to opportunity and give every child the best start in life.”Ofsted said it would be inappropriate to comment during an ongoing investigation but that “our thoughts remain with Genevieve’s family and we are deeply sorry for their loss”.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationCrimeOfstedSurveillancenewsShareReuse this content"

This mechanism was due to end next April, creating a “cliff-edge” that threatened to bankrupt scores of councils.‘Ticking timebomb’: how Send spending could bankrupt English councilsRead moreThe override will now run until April 2028, the government announced aspart of its wider reformsto revitalise local government funding in England.Iain Murray, director of public financial management at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the changes have not fixed the fundamental pressures facing local governments.Murray said: “Without urgent solutions to both existing and future Send deficits, those councils grappling with unsustainable high-needs costs and rapidly growing cumulative deficits may, at best, be forced to make further reductions in essential services, and at worst, risk declaring themselves effectively bankrupt.”The Local Government Association has said more than half of councils risked becoming insolvent if the override ended next April. AGuardian investigationrevealed in March that their combined deficits would reach £5.2bn by the end of this year.The additional borrowing is likely to reach £200m a year in interest payments and associated costs, as well as lost income from investments and assets as councils use up their reserves to cover the deficits and loans.Tim Oliver, chair of the County Councils Network, said: “Council leaders can breathe a sigh of relief knowing they no longer face a financial cliff edge in nine months’ time.View image in fullscreenHelen Hayes, the Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, chairs the Commons education committee.Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian“We now need to ensure that the government’s commitment to support councils to manage their Send deficits rings true.“Despite the extension of the statutory override, many councils still face a number of issues, including rising debt outstripping reserves, mounting interest payments and lost investment income. For some, this could mean reducing services elsewhere or running into extreme financial difficulty.“Therefore, it is critical government sets out a comprehensive solution later this year. This should include writing off deficits and compensating councils … ensuring that the slate is wiped clean.”Helen Hayes, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons education committee, said the extension was a “temporary fix”, and warned: “The government should not delay a permanent resolution to local authorities’ long-term Send deficits beyond 2028 and it must work to devise a solution that helps councils to achieve long-term financial sustainability and does not damage their finances further.”Council high-needs budgets have been under pressure from the sharp rise in children with special needs, with the number requiring extra resources detailed in education, health and care plans (EHCPs) rocketing in recent years.Nearly one in five schoolchildren in England now have recognised special educational needs, according to Department for Educationfigures, including 482,600 children with EHCPs.The government said it will use the two-year delay to reform how the Send system works and is funded. In that time ministers say they intend to deal with the high-needs deficits, despite only raising central funding for local government 1.1% a year on average until 2028-29.A government spokesperson said: “This government inherited a Send system left on its knees, which is why we are looking at changes through our plan for change to improve support for children and stop parents having to fight for help while bringing about financial sustainability for councils.Councils in England warn of mass bankruptcies as Send deficits soarRead more“We will set out our full plans for reform in the autumn, including our approach to supporting councils with their deficits, to deliver excellence everywhere for every child.”Othermeasures in the consultationwill see government grants moved away from wealthier urban centres such as London towards to places with higher deprivation levels, as well as rural authorities and tourist hotspots where funding does not account for surges in visitors.Officials say the move will not lead to higher council taxes, in part because the government’s financial forecasts assume councils putting council tax up by 4.99% – the maximum increase without holding a referendum.Jack Shaw of Manchester University, an expert in local government, said: “The longstanding failure to reform council tax has had a more detrimental impact on councils outside London and the south-east, so it’s right that funding is corrected to take that into account. Some authorities will lose out, but there are transitional arrangements to mitigate that.“Council cuts under the Conservatives mean that it’ll take some time to put them on a more sustainable footing. Funding reform will improve the fortunes of many councils, but they’ll continue to face acute financial challenges.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSend crisis: a system at breaking pointLocal governmentSchoolsCouncil taxEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

It said it was now transferring ownership of the project to the independent production company that produced it.Anger and frustration had been building for months over the status of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, with some involved in the film believing it was originally due to be broadcast at the start of the year. There have been concerns that some of those featured in the programmecould withdraw their supportover the delays.The BBC formally paused its broadcast after an investigation was launched into the making of another documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone. That programme waspulled from iPlayer earlier this year afterit emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The review into its production continues.However, the BBC said that after attempting to find other ways of using parts of the medics programme, produced by the independent Basement Films, it had concluded there were impartiality concerns and it would no longer be shown by the broadcaster.Susan Sarandon among hundreds to urge BBC to release delayed Gaza filmRead more“We wanted the doctors’ voices to be heard,” the BBC said in a statement. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review was published. For some weeks, the BBC has been working with Basement Films to find a way to tell the stories of these doctors on our platforms.”It added: “Yesterday it became apparent that we have reached the end of the road with these discussions. We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC. Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world’s most trusted broadcaster.”It also challenged claims the film had ever undergone the BBC’s final pre-broadcast signoff processes. “Any film broadcast will not be a BBC film,” it said.The decision comes after the founder of Basement Films, Ben de Pear, took aim at the BBC during a documentary festival this week, saying BBC journalists were being “stymied and silenced”. He directly criticised the BBC director general, Tim Davie, whom he described as “a PR person”.“All the decisions about our film were not taken by journalists; they were taken by Tim Davie,” he said. “Tim Davie is taking editorial decisions which, frankly, he is not capable of making.“The BBC’s primary purpose is TV news and current affairs, and if it’s failing on that, it doesn’t matter what drama it makes or sports it covers. It is failing as an institution. And if it’s failing on that, then it needs new management.”The decision also follows an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme by one of the journalists involved in the documentary, Ramita Navai, in which she described Israel as “a rogue state that’s committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, and mass-murdering Palestinians”.Challenged about her statement by the presenter Amol Rajan, who said that it was her opinion, she said it “isn’t my opinion” and that she had collected evidence during her work on the documentary.The BBC said it had produced “powerful coverage” of the Gaza war, including documentaries. “We have also investigated allegations of abuse of Palestinian prisoners and Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s hospitals,” it said. “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

It was here where they first started to date when the then 16-year-old Shikot asked Chorny, 15, to walk her home.Chorny had a whole speech prepared but in the moment – with his friends and prospective mother-in-law looking on – he was overcome, barely managing to get out “Will you marry me?” as he got down on one knee.Or you might ask about the love letters – there were hundreds of them – that Shikot sent week in week out, stubbornly ignoring the lack of replies.None got through to Chorny in the first two years but when a prison guard handed him a folded piece of paper a few months ago he could make out the outline of a heart even before he opened it. His face ran with tears as he stood silently among the others in the cell, all in their blue boiler-suit prison uniforms.View image in fullscreenDmytro Chorny in captivity.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianShikot and Chorny, who married last Saturday, are all smiles today. Shikot says that Chorny is the same man who left her as a 19-year-old on 1 January 2022 to continue his military training as a driver in the marines. “He’s not changed to me,” she said.That is difficult to believe. Three psychologists have worked with Chorny since his return. With limited success so far, he admitted.More than 5,000 Ukrainians have been released from Russian captivity under swap agreements since February 2022 and for all the joy and relief that this has brought, the impact of captivity on the mental health of these often young men and women can be profound.Chorny feels anger bubbling up inside him sometimes. A trigger came when a shop assistant refused to respond to him when he spoke Russian, the language in which he feels most comfortable. “I held it in but I get angry because I was there, and you are sitting here,” he said. “And why the hell are you going to tell me what language to speak?”View image in fullscreenUkrainian emergency workers at a war-damaged maternity hospital in Mariupol in March 2022.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThen there is the anxiety triggered by any sound that resembles that of an aeroplane.And he is, at times, still irrationally jealous of Shikot’s time with others.That jealousy began between the beatings in the Russian cell when he considered what he had lost and obsessively thought about how Shikot must surely have moved on.She had instead been campaigning hard for his release, joining public demonstrations every week, writing to anyone who would listen and lobbying the Russian authorities for word of his health.Chorny joined the marines in late 2021 after deciding that his initial idea of a law career was not for him.He was brought up by his grandparents after his father walked out when he was two, followed by his mother five years later. Something about the discipline and comradeship drew him to the army.His basic training was in Kherson in the south but next was a nine-month tour on the outskirts of the Black Sea port of Mariupol.The war came hard and fast at Mariupol, now occupied and a byword for Russian terror.At 4am on 24 February 2022 he heard the Russian Grad rocket launchers fire and Chorny’s 501 brigade was one of the first to engage in direct battle.He was ordered to gather shells in a truck and drive them to a former prison that was being used as a military base.As he arrived, he heard the sound of a fighter jet swooping low.“I thought it was our fighter,” he said. “I heard him coming back. And I saw rockets. Everything was in slow motion. I was just standing there and watching. The missiles begin to fall everywhere.”He threw himself to the ground: “There were screams, everything is black. I can’t breathe, everything is in smoke. I run and see torn bodies, legs. One man had been in the toilet, he had been thrown from it and was just twitching on the ground.”Survivors made their way to a bunker from where they were told to gather at the Azovstal metallurgical plant.View image in fullscreenAn explosion at the Azovstal site in Mariupol in May 2022.Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersBy now the Ukrainian artillery was all but destroyed and Chorny was ordered to join the infantry as they established a doomed perimeter around Mariupol’s city centre.Russian fighter jets, bombers and artillery destroyed every building, Chorny recalled. There was no hiding place. He resigned himself to death.A Starlink terminal providing internet access offered a chance to send what he believed would be a final message on the Telegram social media site to Shikot on 12 March.“Everything is fine with me,” he lied. “I love you so much and miss you. I hope everything is OK with you. I hope you will send me a message x.”Shikot said she had no idea what was happening. “All good, Dmytro? Call me as soon as possible. I also love you very much. I’m looking forward, waiting for you.”But the Azovstal plant was surrounded and attempts to break out ended in disaster. Its defenders were forced to retreat underground. Food was so scarce that dogs were killed for their meat.Chorny’s phone was smashed when he dived for cover during a helicopter attack. He asked to use a comrade’s mobile to send a message to Shikot: a plus sign, a military way to confirm that he was alive. At this point his commanders concluded that they would have to surrender.On 12 April, the Ukrainian troops were ordered to lay down their weapons, remove their protective vests and walk out with their hands in the air under the gaze of Russian snipers and machine gun operators.View image in fullscreenChorny is taken prisoner by Russian forces in Mariupol in April 2022.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianSchool buses took them to an old farm where they were herded into large chicken sheds. The soldiers’ documents were taken and they were given food and tea.It was to be almost Chorny’s last humane experience for three years.The following day they were transported on trucks to Olenivka, a notorious prison in occupied Donetsk.“Our truck arrives, the door opens, you say your name, rank, date of birth,” Chorny recalled of his arrival. “You jump, and the first baton hits you in the back of the head. They stand on the sides, and while you are running, they beat you.”The soldiers were ordered to sit in lines in a yard where prison guards screamed in their faces. “If you move, you’re screwed,” Chorny said.They were hurried to a barracks and beaten again with batons as they ran.There they were kept for three days before buses arrived to take them to a prison in Kamyshin, southern Russia.“Someone came on the bus and said, ‘Guys, I advise you not to fall. It will not help you. If you fall, you will harm yourself,’” Chorny said.It was a prelude to another barbarous reception party. “We were beaten again as we ran, with rubber batons with spikes and electric shockers,” he said.Chorny was put in the star position and interrogated. They wanted him to admit to firing on civilians or stealing from them. “And if they didn’t get the right answer, there were more beatings,” he said.He was housed in a barracks with 70 other men. They had to stand all day and were given pieces of paper on which were printed the Russian national anthem and the Soviet-era song Katyusha, to learn by heart.Those who failed were hit at the knees. Others were bitten by guard dogs let off the leash.They were filmed singing the Russian songs but banned from talking. The only distraction was schoolbooks on Russian literature on which they were randomly tested at mealtimes.After a few weeks Chorny was moved to a punishment cell. And in a cell he stayed – for three years. Then there were the interrogations. “It was not a questioning process, it was torture,” Chorny said.View image in fullscreenChorny and Shikot at their wedding.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianHis head was covered with a bag, still soiled by the snot, saliva and blood of the last victim. Wires were attached to his fingers that led to a military phone that the guards called Igor. When it was wound up, it created an electric charge.Chorny said: “They said, ‘This is Igor, let’s get to know each other. He loves the truth. When you tell him the truth, he recognises it.’”He was interrogated on one occasion for three hours. “They shoved a stun gun between my legs, you know, a stun gun that kills cows,” he said. “They said, if it drops from your legs, we will use it on you.“I came back in the evening, I was just thrown into the cell. My whole body was atrophied. My mouth didn’t work. The guys who were with me, they took a spoon and fed me.”In the end, he told the Russians what they wanted to hear. “I can’t talk about it,” he said of his filmed “confession”.Then it was to a prison in the Volgograd region from 27 May to 1 October 2022. He was put in a cell for four and thankfully the prisoners were allowed to sit during the day – but not to talk.“A camera was right next to your face,” he said. “The slightest movement of the mouth, immediately a call on the speaker and they start to pump you [beat you up].”After that it was Ryazhsk, 300 miles south of Moscow, where he stayed until February 2023 and then on to the Russian republic of Mordovia, 400 miles east of the capital. Until his release he was put with 10 men in a cell made for four.“You just had to stand in the cell, you couldn’t turn your head, you couldn’t even look someone in the eyes, just head down to the floor,” Chorny said.There were no seasons in jail. The prison guards said nothing of the world outside, he added.A Russian radio station blasted out from 6am to 10pm, playing history lectures and patriotic songs. Those who spoke, or faltered as they stood, would provoke a collective beating.Some felt so guilty at this that they smashed glass in the windows to cut their wrists, Chorny said. Their colleagues rushed to their aid.Each man had his own way of dealing with the pressure. Chorny dried out a few chicken bones from his lunchtime soup and whittled them down to become sewing needles. These he used to tighten his prison trousers around his withering frame. He also tried hard to avoid thinking of home, to dispense with any hope of release.On two occasions, when Russia’s human rights ombudsman was visiting, he was allowed to write letters to his grandparents. But the words were scripted: “I’m good, they are feeding me well, I have good treatment.”View image in fullscreenDmytro and Diana pose for a portrait.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianHe was able to add that he wished to “say hello to my beloved princess Diana, I love her very much. Let her remember me and know about me.”Shortly before his release, Chorny was also allowed to take part in a six-minute video call with Shikot. But it was not until 19 April that a bag was put over his head for the final time and he was put on a plane to Belarus for a prisoner swap of 246 soldiers on each side.Chorny spent a month in a rehabilitation centre and said he now felt well physically and hoped the psychological scars would heal with time. But it may prove difficult to accept the world at it is instead of the idealised version he held in his head for three years.“The very first rule is to forget that you were once a citizen,” Chorny said of dealing with captivity. “Forget about your girlfriend, forget about your grandparents, completely separate yourself from your past. That is, you have never been there, you were born in captivity, you live in captivity.“I completely forgot for a month. I forgot her face, I forgot her voice, I forgot the faces of my grandparents, I forgot the voices, I forgot everyone. But, of course, you dream.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The interruption in electricity supply was likely to have ruined many of the delicate centrifuges spinning at very high speeds enriching uranium hexafluoride gas in the underground facilities, according to an assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The nuclear complex outside the ancient city of Isfahan was also pounded in one of the opening salvoes, which hit its uranium conversion plant and another facility for making nuclear fuel for reactors. Satellite images emerged showing these sites pockmarked with holes.NatanzIshafan damageThe regime in Tehran, with all its pretensions of being a regional power, had told its population that the privations it had suffered over decades were a necessary sacrifice for the nation’s defence against its enemies, near and far. But under fire, the Islamic Republic was impotent to protect its own people, or even its top generals.The Iranian leadership appears to have stuck to the conventional wisdom that Israel could not destroy Iran’s deeply buried facilities such as the underground chambers at Isfahan and more importantly the Fordow enrichment plant, built into the side of a mountain, without US help.FordowThat assumption, at least, did turn out to be half true. By Monday, Israeli bombs appeared to have burrowed their way down to the Isfahan subterranean facility, but after a week, Israeli officials were still saying they needed US help to do significant damage to Fordow.What Iran did not expect was that Benjamin Netanyahu would start the war without US participation in the attack. Israeli officials said they had received a tacit green light from Donald Trump and guarantees of assistance in defence, though not in offence.By defying expectations and going to war anyway, Israel’s prime minister gained the great advantage of total surprise. Iranian intelligence had been lulled into complacency by plans for a sixth round of US-Iran negotiations due to take place last Sunday, and by Trump’s public remarks warning that an Israel attack would “blow” the chances for his own diplomacy.Iran’s spies would have also noted thatNetanyahu’s son’s weddingwas due on Monday, and that the prime minister was planning to take a few days off. Surely the long-threatened war would wait.View image in fullscreenMourners attend a funeral in Ahvaz for those killed in Israeli strikes.Photograph: Alireza Mohammadi/ISNA/ReutersWhen the bombs began to fall on Friday then, the shock was absolute. The first wave killed the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen Hossein Salami, and the army chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, the nation’s top military commanders, among several generals targeted.Six of Iran’s nuclear scientists were also killed, most if not all by airstrikes on their homes. By the end of the week, the Israelis claimed to have killed 14 scientists in an attempt to wipe out Iran’s nuclear knowhow.In the first sortie, 200 Israeli warplanes hit 100 distinct targets in part of an intricately planned operation, codename Rising Lion, which had been at least eight months in the making.The success Israel had in destroying Iranian air defences in a previous missile strike in October convinced the Israeli leadership that it had opened up a window of opportunity, during which Iran would be uniquely vulnerable, but the window would close over time.Latest strikes on IranNetanyahu said this week that Rising Lion was originally planned for April. However, the timetable was set back two months to allow Trump an opportunity to strong-arm Iran into giving up its enrichment programme at the negotiating table, so he could claim to have averted a new war in the Middle East.Ina letter in March to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Trump gave diplomacy 60 days to produce results and the clock began to tick with the first meeting between American and Iranian negotiators in Oman on 12 April. Last Thursday 12 June, was day 61 on that calendar, and that night the Israeli fighter-bomber squadrons took off for targets 1,000 miles (1,600km) away.Trump later claimed to have been in the loop all along. He bristled at the suggestion that he was merely given a “heads-up”. It was far more than that, he claimed.View image in fullscreenThe damaged headquarters of Iranian state television in Tehran.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APIt now appears that, having decided to attack after Trump’s 60-day pause, the timetable for Rising Lion was locked in by military requirements. The Mossad special forces and drones had been put in place inside Iran, specifically to target the sinews of Iran’s ability to strike back – its air defence and its ballistic missile launchers. They could not be left behind the lines for long. Their discovery would have compromised the whole operation.In the preceding days, as the rumours of war swirled around the region, Iran boasted it was primed to strike back with devastating effect. In the event, it was hamstrung. The generals who were supposed to give the orders were already dead by the time Iran knew it was under attack.The only Iranian response in the first hours of the war were 100 drones, which were easily shot down by Israel and the US before they reached Israeli territory. By the end of last Friday, Iran’s hastily appointed replacement commanders had scrambled to launch 200 ballistic missiles.Israel was able to intercept mostwith its multi-tiered, US-supported air defences, with Israeli interceptors rising up in clusters to meet the incoming threat, lighting up the night sky.A handful of Iranian strikes hit home, however, killing Israelis in Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion who had not sought shelter.Strikes on IsraelOver the course of the first week of the war, the confirmed Israeli death toll had reached 24, less than a 10th of the number of Iranian civilians killed by Israeli pilots striking residential areas in their hunt for regime figures and scientists.In response to the first Israeli casualties, the defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed that “Tehran will burn” if Khamenei continued to fight back with missiles. The Iranian missile salvoes kept coming throughout the week, however, though with smaller numbers in each barrage, as Israel hunted down and destroyed Iranian launchers.View image in fullscreenIsraeli security forces inspect destroyed residential buildings that were hit by a missile fired from Iran.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APBy Friday, IDF briefers claimed to have destroyed two-thirds of the estimated 400 launchers Iran had started the war with, suggesting Israel could be winning the race to blunt Iran’s primary deterrent before Israel ran out of stocks of its most effective and expensive missile interceptor, the Arrow 3.Meanwhile, it was Iranian civilians who took the brunt of the war. Over the course of the week, the roads out of Tehran have been clogged by families using their 25-litre fuel rationto try to flee the capital. The obstacles to leaving the city were doubled when one of the main routes out, the road to Qom, was blocked by bombing.Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’Read moreFrom the first day of the offensive, it was clear that Israel was aiming at more than Iran’s nuclear and missile programme. A gas refinery on the coast was hit, as was an oil storage facility on the outskirts of Tehran. Israeli leaders have referred to these as “ayatollah regime targets”, the pillars of the Iranian economy.Netanyahu has been increasingly clear that, while regime change was not a formal war aim, it was the desired outcome. Visiting a damaged hospital in Beersheba on Thursday, the prime minister called on Iranians to rise up against their rulers, while Katz declared that Khamenei “cannot continue to exist”.For all the Israeli grandstanding in the wake of a week of constant military successes, the ultimate outcome of the war hung in the balance on Friday.Trump declared he would take up to two weeksto decide whether he would send in US bombers into the fray, to target Fordow and other hard targets, potentially including Khamenei himself.View image in fullscreenA baby is evacuated from the site of a direct hit from an Iranian missile strike in Ramat Gan.Photograph: Oded Balilty/APThe announcement appeared to create an opportunity for diplomacy, with foreign ministers from the UK, France and Germanymeeting their Iranian counterpart in Geneva. It was questionable whether anything short of a complete Iranian surrender of the right to enrich uranium would satisfy Trump, and it would definitely fall short of Israeli demands.With US involvement, the damage inflicted on Iran would undoubtedly be more profound, but it is far from evident it would bring down the Iranian regime.The only real certainty as the war enters it second week, regardless of whether American planes join the Israel air force in the skies over Iran, is that the misery of ordinary Iranians is sure to deepen.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Back and forth between the extreme temperatures they go, until an hour later they depart dreamy-eyed.The sauna secret: why Finland is the happiest country in the worldRead moreThe sauna – a mobile unit parked up at Wellington’s Worser Bay – is running a roaring trade. Six days a week, from before dawn to well after dusk, Wellingtonians converge there to heat up, relax and socialise.View image in fullscreenGordon Baker dries off after a sauna.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/The GuardianUntil recently, New Zealand’s saunas were largely tucked away in upmarket spas, grimy gyms and public pools. But in a new – and perhaps a surprisingly late – addition to the nature-loving nation, saunas are popping up on beaches and in back gardens across the country as New Zealanders embrace the steamy ritual.Over the winter months, temperatures in the North Island top out at 10-15C, while in the South Island it’s more like 8-10 degrees. Some regions dip below zero while in Wellington the fierce southerly winds can make a cool morning feel Arctic.“In the winter, you crave that feeling of being warmed to the bone,” says Natalie Keegan, who is sipping on homemade kefir in a patch of sun after a sauna session.But she says it is about more than escaping the winter cold. Keegan loves the sauna because it fosters community, is good for her health and helps her connect with nature.Keegan runs an informal WhatsApp group for roughly 40 women who come together every full moon to sauna and ocean swim.“It’s like a coven,” she laughs. “You’re in a space together sweating, your body is feeling extreme heat, you’re able to talk about things you might not usually bring up. It’s an environment that creates deeper connection and you’re in touch with nature.”View image in fullscreenSauna Project, Lyall Bay.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/The GuardianKegaan is not alone. Google searches for saunas have tripled in the last five years and new operators are seeing sessions book out immediately.Michael Burrell started Scenic Sauna two years ago.Initially, locals were suspicious about the sauna and its benefits but that attitude has changed dramatically in the past eight months, he says. His business has gone from relying on a group of diehard sauna goers to flourishing with new converts who are spreading the word.“We’re on the cusp of a boom here,” Burrell says.View image in fullscreenView of Worser Bay from the sauna window.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/The GuardianNew Zealand’s burgeoning love for the sauna follows a global trend –Australia,the UKandthe UShave similarly embraced the culture in recent years.Researchers in Finland – home to 3.3 million saunas – havefound regular sauna usemay be linked to decreased blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease. Other studies have shown regular use maydecrease risk of psychosisin a middle-aged male population, while hot and cold sessionscould reduce risks of dementiaand Alzheimer’s disease.‘Turning into little Finland’At Lyall Bay – 15 minutes from Worser Bay – a woman stands in a towel, coils of hair slicked down on her flushed face. Behind her, a low rain cloud renders the sky and sea milky in the twilight, and another mobile sauna – run by the Sauna Project – glows.“Its very relaxing, and I always feel more clear-headed afterwards – its a really nice way to start or finish a day,” says the woman, who comes every two weeks with friends.“Instead of going for a coffee or a catch up after work, we come to the sauna,” she says.View image in fullscreenNatalie Keegan (L) and Melody Thomas take a dip in the sea before heading to the saunaPhotograph: Hagen Hopkins/The GuardianThe Sauna Project started three years ago in Mount Maunganui on the North Island’s east coast, and now has 17 locations across the country.

But that does not mean the bloc of 27 countries will impose sanctions on Israel anytime soon.What has happened?The EU’s foreign policy service has reached the cautious conclusion that “there are indications” that Israel is in breach of human rights obligations, in a review of its association agreement with the Middle Eastern country.The EU-Israel association agreement, which came into force in 2000, underpins the relationship between the EU’s 27 member states and the Mediterranean nation, not only concerning trade but social and environmental cooperation.Under pressure from EU member states appalled by the humanitarian blockade of the Gaza Strip, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, Kaja Kallas, launched a review last month.The review was based on article 2 of the agreement, which states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is an “essential element”.What next?The report, which is a leaked unpublished draft, is expected to be presented to Israel’s government by Kallas.More immediately, she will outline the findings to the EU’s 27 foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday. She wants to assess how far governments back the review and what to do next.While the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic – with near daily fatal shootings of people queuing for food rations, warnings of famine and the collapse of water systems – EU processes move slowly.How slowly?Kallas is expected to present a list of possible options to foreign ministers in July. In theory these could include full suspension of trade with Israel, or freezing its participation in EU programmes, but nobody knows.Such measures to put pressure on Israel would require further legal processes and their approval is highly uncertain.Even hedged in the low-key, caveat-laden language of the EU, the leaked document marks a significant moment in EU-Israel relations. But it is far from clear if it will change the calculus for the Israeli government.Explore more on these topicsIsraelEuropean UnionGazaWest BankEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesexplainersShareReuse this content"

For its legions of admirers, the Japanese studiohasn’t just held its own against the American powerhouses, it has surpassed them with the impossible beauty of its hand-drawn animation and its commentary on the ambivalence of the human condition.Although he would refuse to acknowledge it, much of Studio Ghibli’s success is down to one man:Hayao Miyazaki, a master animator whose presence towers over the studio’s output. Making a feature-length anime the old-fashioned way may require a large and multitalented cast, but Miyazaki is the thread running through Ghibli’s creative genius.Now, as the studio marks its 40th anniversary, it faces an uncertain future, amid renewed speculation that its figurehead auteur really has wielded his pencil for the last time.Roland Kelts, a visiting professor at the school of culture, media and society at Waseda University, said Ghibli had failed to anticipate a time when Miyazaki, who is 84, would no longer be at the helm, even after the succession question grew more urgent following the death in 2018 of co-founder Isao Takahata.The Glassworker: Studio Ghibli’s legacy lives in Pakistan’s first hand-drawn featureRead moreInstead, the studio shifted its focus to commercial activities. “The studio failed to produce heirs to Miyazaki and Takahata, and now it’s a merchandising monster,” says Kelts, author ofJapanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the US.In 2013, Miyazaki announced that he would no longer make feature-length films, citing the difficulty of living up to his own impossibly high standards.View image in fullscreenA frame from My Neighbour Totoro.Photograph: Studio Ghibli/Kobal/ShutterstockBut four years later, Ghibli said its co-founder had had a change of heart and would make “his final film, considering his age”. The result was The Boy and the Heron, winner of the 2024 Academy Award for best animated film.While Ghibli performs alchemy on the screen, there is nothing it can do to shapeshift itself clear of the march of mortality: Miyazaki’s main colour designer, Yasuda Michiyo, whose work appeared in most of his films, died two years before Takahata, while another co-founder, producer Toshio Suzuki, is 76.As a result, the studio is finally looking ahead to a future without its leading creative light, notwithstanding persistent rumours that Miyazaki is not quite done yet. “Miyazaki is 84 and may not have time to make another movie,” says Kelts.A cultural phenomenonThe studio was formally established by Miyazaki, Suzuki and Takahata in 1985 – a year after it released the post-apocalyptic Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. It has since become a cultural phenomenon, winning an Oscar in 2003 for Spirited Away, and asecond Oscar in 2024for The Boy and the Heron.Told through the prism of the fantastical, and featuring characters and themes that defy the pigeonholing that underpins much of Hollywood’s output,Studio Ghibli’s films are widely considered masterpieces of their genre, earning two Oscars and the devotion of millions of fans across the world.Watching a Ghibli movie is like reading literature, says Miyuki Yonemura, a professor at Japan’s Senshu University who studies cultural theories on animation. “That’s why some children have watchedMy Neighbour Totoro40 times,” she says. “Audiences discover something new every time.”In some ways, Ghibli shares certain values withDisney, says Susan Napier, a professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University in the US, believes. “Both are family oriented, insist on high production standards and have distinctive worldviews.“But what is striking about Ghibli is how for the last 40 years the studio has reflected and maintained a set of values and aesthetics that are clearly drawn from its founders and not from a corporate playbook,” adds Napier, author of Miyazakiworld: a Life in Art.View image in fullscreenHayao MiyazakiPhotograph: Chris Pizzello/APMiyazaki has made no secret of hisprogressive politics, informed by his experience living through conflict and postwar austerity, and has publicly criticised attempts by conservative politicians toreviseJapan’s war-renouncing constitution. His films address the themes of war and the environment, but stop short of distilling the narrative into a simple battle of good versus evil.TheBoy and the Heron, for example, opens with Mahito Maki, the 12-year-old protagonist, losing his mother in the US’saerial bombardment of Tokyoin March 1945, in which an estimated 100,000 people died.However, Ghibli’s decades of independence ended in 2023 when the studio wasacquired by Nippon TV– a move that the studio conceded came amid uncertainty over its future leadership.Speculation that Miyazaki’s eldest son, Goro, was heir apparent has dampened since the latter voiced doubt about his ability to run the studio alone, and amid reports that artistic differences had contributed to “strained” relations between father and son.Now it will be up to Nippon TV to develop a pool of directors to gradually replace the old guard, including those with expertise in computer animation, considered anathema to Ghibli’s fierce commitment to hand-drawn frames.Ghibli has at least overcome its squeamishness towards broadening its commercial brief. The Ghibli Museum has been a huge success since it opened in western Tokyo in 2001, while visitors flock to Ghibli Park in centralJapan, whose launch in 2022 was seen as an acknowledgment by the studio that it needed to build a brand that went beyond film-making.Now Ghibli merchandise is ubiquitous, from My Neighbour Totoro T-shirts and cuddly character toys to high-end leather handbags inspired by Spirited Away and Levi’s branded Princess Mononoke jackets.Totoro, Miyazaki’s 1988 film set in 1950s rural Japan, was turned into aplayby the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2022. Last year a stage adaptation of Spirited Away received afour-star reviewin the Guardian.While computer-generated animation and AI make the painstaking, aesthetically stunning animation that Ghibli is renowned harder than it was a generation ago, Napier is not convinced the octogenarian auteur is ready to retire.“I can’t imagine someone like Miyazaki, with his intellectual and artistic vivacity, simply being content to sit around, so who knows?”Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsStudio GhibliJapanAsia PacificAnimation in filmHayao MiyazakifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then his book Don’t Call Me Urban captured the energy of the grittier first wave – and an expanded edition is finally hereDan HancoxFri 20 Jun 2025 10.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 10.38 EDTShareIt’s an overcast Thursday morning, and photographer Simon Wheatley is doing a soft-shoe shuffle through Roman Road in Bow, eastLondon, as a market stall blares out exquisite 70s funk. “That’s more like it,” he says, with a grin on his face. “A bit of energy.” This was once grime’s artery, its chaotic central hub, even its muse – a street Wiley once told me was “the nurturer” of local talents like him and Dizzee Rascal. And it was here, in the 2000s, that Wheatley would create a vivid and intimate document of grime in its frenzied flush of youth, and of working-class neighbourhoods like this before they became considerably more sedate. Fourteen years after the release of Don’t Call Me Urban, Wheatley’s long-sold-out photo-book from that era – once described by Vice as “grime’s Old Testament” – it is finally getting a rerelease, at almost double its original size.I have arranged to meet Wheatley outside the bougie Roman Road coffee shop that was once legendary grime record shop Rhythm Division. This leads to some confusion – there are simply too many bougie coffee shops in succession. “Back in the day it was absolutely thronging with people,” Wheatley recalls. “You’d turn a corner and down a sidestreet there’d be six guys doing an impromptu cipher [a freestyle MC-ing performance] – everywhere there were youths hanging out, wheeling around on their bikes, spitting over some tinny beat playing off a Nokia. This was the heartbeat of grime.”Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclassWheatley became grime’s documentarian simply by walking out of his front door in Limehouse when he was “just a broke photographer” in his 20s, and daring to take an interest in his young neighbours. He did so at a time when the media and MPs were condemning the same kids as delinquent “hoodies” or “chavs” – as if they were somehow morally culpable for the social problems they were enduring. Photographing rising underground artists for Black music magazine RWD gave Wheatley his “hood pass”, with now-famous images such as Roll Deep’s “ice-cream van” shoot, Skepta in a chip shop, Crazy Titch and his terrifying dog, Dizzee in the studio, Kano dressed as Scarface, or Tinchy Stryder and his crew Ruff Sqwad when they were still in school.View image in fullscreenOne of Wheatley’s famous images … Roll Deep, east London, 2005.Photograph: Simon WheatleyThose shoots opened the door – although some suspected he was an undercover cop when he first showed up. “I remember [Roll Deep’s] DJ Target invited me to the When I’m ‘Ere video shoot, and I saw this gaggle of youngsters hanging about, looking at me suspiciously. I realised that there was a whole world to uncover, with their lives.”Over time, he won the trust of his subjects. It helped, he thinks, that he is a “a bit of an odd case, a bit of a weirdo” – an outsider among outsiders. Wheatley insinuated himself into the pirate radio studios and youth clubs that provided the DIY launchpads for so much talent. He shot not just microphone clashes and radio sessions but fights, drug deals, hectic street-corner tableaux and intimate domestic moments; teenagers watching TV, daydreaming, having breakfast, rolling spliffs, writing out lyrics longhand, doing each other’s hair.“For me, the texture of grime is there in the real world,” Wheatley says. “It’s there on the estate, or in the radio stations at 2 o’clock in the morning, where some deeply underground crew would have a slot – the bin bag in the corner overflowing with fast food boxes and drink cans, Rizla packets and rave flyers scattered everywhere.” Don’t Call Me Urban is a social document of youthful energy, boredom, angst and joy, as much as it captures a generation of musicians on their way to fame and fortune.View image in fullscreen‘For me, the texture of grime is there in the real world.’Photograph: Simon Wheatley“I always felt that grime was a reflection of that post-Thatcherite social breakdown,” Wheatley continues. “It was that very coarse expression of a kind of individualism.” The paradox is that it was also “very much about the community”, about mates looking out for each other when nobody else would. He is defensive of the bright, creative young people who went on to change the face of UK music, some of whom have become his close friends; I have been with Wheatley while he buys nourishing groceries for a hungoverHak Baker, the charismatic singer-songwriter Wheatley was shooting in 2006, when he was a 14-year-old MC called Swift Leng.It was this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me“Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclass,” Wheatley says. “Grime now is just regarded as a musical genre, rather than a sociological phenomenon. But it was both of those things: an incredible sound, but also this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me, and that’s what I really went hard after, chasing.”At times, this chase would lead him into sketchy situations, with people pulling out long blades at pirate stations (also caught on camera), and the police rarely far away. One night, he found himself in the middle of an empty field by the Docklands Light Railway, shooting a pre-arranged fight – football hooligan style – between boys from the E3 and E14 postcodes. Some of them weren’t wildly impressed when his flash went off.View image in fullscreenTinchy Stryder & Ruff Sqwad, 2005.Photograph: Simon Wheatley“That was very early on in my grime experience. Naivete has always been my greatest shield,” he laughs. “I didn’t really know what I was doing half the time, or where I was going. Crazy Titch said recently: ‘Simon was so brave.’ I wasn’t brave; I just didn’t know!” Wheatley’s mentor was Philip Jones Griffiths, the late war photojournalist, and as a photojournalist himself, Wheatley has taken deliberate risks – going through military roadblocks in Chiapas, Mexico, disguised as a peasant while on the trail of the Zapatistas in the late 1990s, or plunging into the Paris banlieues during the 2005 riots.He is a physically dynamic photographer, well-suited to capturing the restless, fidgety energy of teenagers. “I was a sports fanatic as a teenager,” he says, demonstrating some capoeira moves, “and photography replaced sport for me as a passion. I can’t really teach photography, but I can teach martial arts: I teach a combination of capoeira Angola mixed with yogic breathing and tai chi. I also fast before I shoot, just for a few hours, so my senses are sharper.”View image in fullscreenDizzee Rascal in the studio.Photograph: Simon WheatleyFirst published in 2011, Don’t Call Me Urban was quickly out of print and in demand, its price soaring on resale sites as the genre exploded into the mainstream. “It became almost like a relic that was appreciated by the connoisseurs of the culture, and it became this cult book,” he says – both as a rare visual document of Black British music heritage, and a source of creative inspiration. One of those connoisseur-fans is Clint Ogbenna (known as Clint 419), founder of streetwear clothes brand Corteiz, who turned one of Wheatley’s famous shots of Crazy Titch into a jacket, and gave Wheatley the push and financial support to finally rerelease the book.As well as providing a unique document of grime in its heyday, Wheatley’s work is a valuable visual record of every day life in east London, before the 2012 Olympics arrived and changed it beyond recognition. He is keen to avoid fetishising the pre-gentrification city: “Who’s to say all those changes are bad?” he asks. “I’m sure some people are happy their flats have been refurbished. But artistically, texturally, there was something very gripping about a run-down block in a state of disrepair – it almost felt as if it was abandoned to the youth, to make their playground of hope, frustration and despair. There was much more atmosphere – nowadays everything is a bit cleaner.”The expanded edition of Don’t Call Me Urban!

Yet it was all but impossible not to cast a glance sideways as Brad Pitt nonchalantly strolled out to face the microphones and cameras of his own, entirely staged, media scrum.None of us in the media pack openly goggled at the fact that Hollywood’s A-list had joined the sweaty throng, because Pitt was there filming what would becomeF1 the Movie. And we, as with everyone else, were under strict instructions to behave normally.Indeed, as farcical as it might sound, by this point we had become almost inured to the presence of the stars and their crew after several years of being part and parcel of the F1 circus. Almost but not quite. I mean, itwasBrad Pitt…The resulting film, released next Wednesday by Apple Studios, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Top Gun: Maverick’s Joseph Kosinski, stars Pitt as the veteran driver Sonny Hayes, who makes a comeback to the sport after a 30-year absence to rescue the ailing and also fictional APX team. The film, which has hadlargely positive reviewsso far –including from the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw– came about through an unusually proactive collaboration between the filmmakers and the sport. F1 bent over backwards to ensure it went well.View image in fullscreenBrad Pitt and Lewis Hamilton at the F1 premiere in Times Square, New York City.Photograph: Dave Allocca/ShutterstockThe production filmed at circuits on real race weekends for over two years. The APX team enjoyed their own pit garage, their own hospitality and their own uniforms. With Pitt being filmed alongside real drivers and indeed the media around the grid and the “paddock” (the working area of an F1 team), the filmmakers were effectively embedded within the sport as its 11th team – perhaps as deeply as it is possible for an entity to go without actually being a real team.They have also used real cars, albeit less-powerful Formula 2 models modified to look as close as possible to F1 cars by the Mercedes F1 team. Pitt and his co-star Damson Idris have filmed in cars, with Pitt doing all his own driving. He’s been praised by Hamilton for picking up the skills quickly.Hamilton is both one of the producers and a special adviser to ensure the picture is as authentic as possible. For the producers, the collaboration is relatively straightforward. They wanted to make as authoritative, exciting and immersive a film as possible. And for the sport the movie is a key part of its global strategy.For many years F1 enjoyed a strong but undoubtedly niche-based support, largely centred on Europe and with a notably ageing, white-male demographic. But since Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017 from its former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, who had been in charge for nearly 40 years, it has undergone a rapid and dramatic transformation.Liberty has expanded its reach, notably using social media and promotion to actively target a younger, more diverse audience. The enormously successful Netflix seriesDrive to Survivefollowed, its dramatic and sharply edited retelling of each season proving a huge hit with a market previously indifferent to F1. Drive to Survive is now in its seventh season since 2019.View image in fullscreenDamson Idris with Brad Pitt in the film.Photograph: Warner BrosSuddenly the sport had an entirely new, enthusiastic fanbase; younger, excited and building momentum across the world – notably in the market every non US-based sport craves, North America. F1 has moved from one moderately well-attended race in Texas to three sellouts a year, now also including Miami and a night-race promoted by F1 itself on the streets of Las Vegas.Tyler Epp, the Miami GP president, noted that their audience is “growing most aggressively in the 20- and 30-year-old buyer. Our data does not tell us that this is an audience of 30- to 60-year-old white men”. Instead, Epp says, there is a 60-40 male-female split – an “eclectic, diverse group”.Recently, both golf and tennis have tried, with a lesser degree of success, to emulate the enormous surge of interest F1 has enjoyed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sylvester Stallone tried to make an F1 film in the late 1990s but, given a lack of cooperation from Ecclestone, ultimately switched the story to the US-based CART series and the commercial and critical flop Driven was the result.Stefano Domenicali, a former team principal at Ferrari and president of the Italian car manufacturer Lamborghini, is the chief executive of F1, an accomplished operator with an easy-going persona. He is relaxed with F1 teams and Hollywood moguls and has been at the heart of the resurgence. “I think that if Netflix was big, that the movie will be massive,” he said this year. “We’re going to hit a target that is not yet present.”View image in fullscreenF1 now has three US races a year, including one on the streets of Las Vegas.Photograph: Rick Scuteri/APPurists will sniff at some of the picture’s deviations from certain aspects of F1’s realities, and its concessions to dramatic and narrative convention to propel it as entertainment. But it was meant to be a blockbuster not a documentary and that’s what matters to F1 and the producers.After the film’s screenings in the US, Apple’s senior vice-president, Eddy Cue, said that “very few” of those attending had previously seen an F1 race but their reactions were instructive.“When we finish and we ask how many of you would like to go see a race now, literally every single hand goes up,” he said. “We think there’s a huge, huge opportunity to grow the sport all over the world with this movie and I think it will do that.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportBrad PittfeaturesShareReuse this content"

See SJP for Sarah Jessica Parker, ALT for the fashion editor André Leon Talley and – particularly relevant right now – CBK for Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.The wife of John F Kennedy Jr whodied in a plane crash in 1999is sometimes seen as America’s answer to Diana, Princess of Wales. Like Diana, she was loved for her style – called minimalist, chic or “quiet luxury”. Instagram is full of accounts posting archive images of her, influential brands such as The Row, Toteme and Gabriela Hearst design clothes that channel her approach to dressing and there have been books and auctions in recent years.The full extent of the deification became clear this week when images of the actor Sarah Pidgeon as Bessette Kennedy in Ryan Murphy’s forthcoming Kennedys Netflix series American Love Story were seen for the first time.Inone image on Murphy’s Instagram, Pidgeon is pictured wearing a rumpled knee-length brown coat, cropped trousers and black polo neck, with a Birkin bag and bright blond hair, whileon-set imagesshow her in a satin midi skirt, Converse and leathery jacket.There was an immediate reaction online, and it’s fair to say fans do not approve. “This is fashion murder,” wrote one in the comments on the Murphy post. “Whoever styled cbk needs to be fired,” wrote another. Details seem to particularly irk – from the wrong shade of blond (Bessette Kennedy’s hair colourist Brad Johns described it as“too 2024”) to the bag. Eagle-eyed observers have noticed it’s a Birkin 35, a slight variation from her preferred Birkin 40.View image in fullscreenThe ‘wrong’ hair shade: Sarah Pidgeon as CBK and Paul Kelly as JFK Jr.Photograph: NetflixSuch is the outrage that Murphy, in aninterviewwith the fashion industry newsletter Line Sheet, described the images as a “work in progress” and clarified that the “right” items would be swapped in, including that Birkin bag. He admitted that the reaction had taken him by surprise. “I had no idea that people cared as much as they do, but I guess that’s a good thing,” he said. Twenty online experts on Bessette Kennedy’s style have been approached to consult on the wardrobe.Murphy, whose work has often taken on real-life figures, from Truman Capote to Joan Crawford, is no stranger to fashion on screen. He made The Assassination of Gianni Versace in 2018 andHalston, about the 70s designer, in 2021. This is the first time, however, that one of his productions has taken on a fashion icon who has citizen archivists logging her every look online. This contrast is the issue, argues the fashion writer Liana Satenstein. “I don’t know if you can include the painstaking research in a miniseries that has such an element of camp to it,” she argues. “It would be this bizarre dichotomy.”The legend around Bessette Kennedy’s style has reached mythical level in the 26 years since her death. A publicist at Calvin Klein, she began dating Kennedy in 1994. The two became the focus of paparazzi, with photographers snapping Bessette Kennedy on the streets of New York wearing labels such as Calvin Klein (then designed by Narciso Rodriguez), Yohji Yamamoto, Prada and Comme des Garçons, but also staples such as jeans, white shirts and polo necks.Fans talk about the way she tailored her jeans and how she removed labels from designer clothing. In an era when personal style is seen as the ultimate status symbol in fashion, it’s these details that have made Bessette Kennedy a lodestar.“It was ‘this is me, this is Carolyn, take it or leave it,’” says Sunita Kumar Nair, the author ofCBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, a Life in Fashion. Amy Odell, who writes the fashion newsletter Back Row and is working on a biography of Gwyneth Paltrow, says it’s in contrast to now. “Many ‘It girls’ today have stylists and personal shoppers,” she argues. “Now, personal style is bought and sold. This was just her taste, how she put herself together every day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says the popularity of Bessette Kennedy archive images grew because they were a tonic to the existing aesthetic. “Instagram was a barrage of logos and colourful glitz up until about five years ago, when her image started popping up again alongside references from the show Succession,” he argues. “When the term ‘quiet luxury’ went viral, who could have possibly been a better poster girl? The striking images we all know resonate with an entirely new generation because of their elegant simplicity.”But with close to three decades of interest in her style, it’s become a “get the look” commodity. “It goes from real woman to paparazzi shot to an image you see on your screen to a flat lay [of clothing items] to the product that you ultimately buy online,” says Daniel Rogers, the fashion news editor at Vogue.Satenstein agrees. “We’ve been taking this woman’s existence and putting it on a Pinterest board [for a long time],” she says. “It’s a little sad, because I don’t think she had a say in it. [It happened to] Jane Birkin [too] but she passed away later in life, and had some agency over herself.”How should Murphy and his team improve Pidgeon’s outfits before the show debuts next year? When asked if she will be consulting on the project, Kumar Nair replies: “No comment.” But she does say it’s “very smart” to speak to online experts, and suggests also involving those who knew Bessette Kennedy, such as Rodriguez, Calvin Klein and her sister, Lisa. “I would be semi-humble about it and ask them to talk,” she says: “[Bessette Kennedy] was a major curation herself. So that’s how you would have to approach it.”Explore more on these topicsFashionThe KennedysRyan MurphynewsShareReuse this content"

He doesn’t like Britain any more, he says. It has “changed”.But Noel – as his new programme, Kiwi Adventure, makes blisteringly clear – has not changed. He looks like a child’s sand drawing of Aslan. He believes in “the universal energy system”, wears combatively tight linen T-shirts and has baths so cold he fears openly for the future of his scrotum. He is a deeply odd man.And yet.From the depths of the oddness re-emerges an imperishable truth: Noel Edmonds, for better or worse, is clinically incapable of making uninteresting TV.Here, then, are seven of the most notable emissions from the man’s party cannon.Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82)View image in fullscreenDream team … Swap Shop presenters Keith Chegwin, Maggie Philbin, John Craven and Noel Edmonds.Photograph: RGR Collection/Alamy“Swap Shopppp,” bugled the theme tune, heralding the all-too-brief golden age of Saturday morning TV, an inflatable neon wonderland in which a jubilantly youthful Noel Edmonds could ask Kate Bush how she got her hair to go like that.Telly Addicts (1985-98)Ferociously watchable studio quiz in which square-eyed families went cardigan-to-cardigan over questions about Blue Peter and Keith Chegwin. The winner? Knitwear. The runner-up? Telly. Noel’s stewardship – aggressively serviceable action-slacks, smirk like the judgment of Zeus – would lend much-needed tension to the soft furnishings, thus plunging the McPerms of Perth and the Vauxhall-Cavaliers of Nantwich into a perpetual Scooby Doo-based deathmatch. Bring it back!Noel’s House Party (1991-99)View image in fullscreenMr Blobby: partner in crime for the House Party.Photograph: Geoff Wilkinson/Rex FeaturesWelcome ye to “Crinkley Bottom,” an illusory fiefdom in which unsuspecting celebrity visitors (Dave Lee Travis, Edwina Currie etc) were greeted with mockery, gunge and often startlingly physical “gotchas”. Pivotal to the chaos were Noel (presentational style: giggling necromancer) and bubonic familiar Mr Blobby, whose monosyllabic distress and sudden bouts of confused violence would attract audiences of 15 million. The House Party manifesto was as simple as the era in which it was conceived: hysterical conviviality for all, unless you’re Dave Lee Travis, in which case we’ll break your legs.View image in fullscreenSpecial delivery … Noel’s Christmas Presents.Photograph: Sven Arnstein/Sky TVNoel’s Christmas Presents (1989-99;2007-11)Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël / Born is the King of Bra-aa-aaacknell. And Hove. And Ipswich, Canada, Finland and Crewe. The premise whispered of doom and seasonal biliousness but in reality the annual sight of Edmonds guffawing around the world to deliver festive reunions and white goods to the sickly and deserving was … not great, precisely, but also, crucially,not cack. The reason? Our host’s unique ability to sidestep mawkishness while dressed as, variously, Santa, a Victorian dignitary and a garden gnome. He’s called Noel for a reason, you know.Deal or No Deal? (2005-16)The concept? Simple. The Noel? Guarded; tightly bearded; visibly uncomfortable around pensioners. The subsequent, sweltering tension – will Doris from Thanet attempt to engage him in a conversation about her dead husband for longer than her allotted 30 seconds? – would turn a daytime gameshow about cardboard boxes into a potentially lethal game of chance.View image in fullscreenBoxing clever … Deal or No Deal? attracted audiences of around 5 million at its peak.Photograph: Channel 4Noel’s HQ (2008-09)Emboldened by the success of Deal or No Deal?, Edmonds’ (brief) return to Saturday night TV found our subject very much in “Noel’s narked off” mode, sprinting through the obligatory “members of the public rewarded for charitable deeds” bits in order to address the vexed issue of “Broken Britain”. And lo, Noel didst upbraid bungling councils, bellow about bylaws and deliver sudden, snarling exhortations toknow thy consumer rightslest the heavens split asunder and ye be cast into the eternal fire of implied warranty (Hotpoint 3:11-13). The subtext? I (Noel Edmonds) am angry, thus you (the viewer/Broken Britain/God) must pay. It was, in a very real sense, Brexit’s patient zero.Noel Edmonds’Kiwi Adventure (2025)View image in fullscreenEdmonds as Edmonds … with wife Liz on Kiwi Adventure.Photograph: ITV“I am rocking,” intones Noel, emerging from his hyperbaric chamber like a blow-dried Christ. “I. AM. ROCKING.” Broadcast this sort of stuff from a regional news studio and viewers would be lunging for the nearest mallet. But here, buttressed by a gasp-inducing mountain range and a preternaturally tolerant wife, Edmonds takes on an air of … vulnerability?Likability?Besides, the man’s 76. If he wants to say “I am Jesus” while wearing utility shorts in an outdoor shower, who are we to object? After six decades of televisual brilliance, awfulness, jumpers, Alan Partridge-esque hubris and comb-through hair colour, Noel Edmonds, perhaps more than anyone, has earned the right to be Noel Edmonds.

A good camping or festival trip lives or dies by one thing, though: a decent tent. You need somewhere roomy, waterproof and comfortable to sleep and hang out in, especially if the weather isn’t looking so balmy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Tents come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny one-person models aimed at wild campers to more palatial shelters that will sleep the whole family in different bedrooms. And even if you’re bringing a teeny-tiny tent backpacking, bikepacking or wild camping, it needs to be comfortable and weatherproof, with room for all your kit. I’ve selected 10 of the best camping tents to suit every adventure, from ultralight backpacking tents to more spacious family tents.At a glanceBest tent overall:MSR Hubba Hubba NX£476 at Cotswold OutdoorsBest budget tent:Easy Camp Sarek 2£89.95 at LigoBest family tent:Outwell Montana 4 Air£849.95 at Outdoor ActionBest four-person tent:Big Agnes Big House£412.39 at AlpinetrekBest bell tent:Boutique Camping Luna BellFrom £409 at Boutique CampingWhy you should trust meI’m a seasoned camper. I love wild adventures on my own with a backpacking tent, but equally love long weekends spent in a palatial bell tent with family and friends in a sunny field, packing everything but the kitchen sink. I’m also a festival frequenter each summer. As an outdoors journalist, I’ve tested hundreds of tents in rain and shine over the years – and I think the options below are the best picks for every kind of camper.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I looked for easy, quick pitching and simple-to-follow instructions.’Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianI put these tents through their paces over a few weeks in mercurial May weather. I slept in each tent for a few nights at campsites (and in my friend’s handy field) in a mixed bag of weather conditions. I looked for easy, quick pitching and simple-to-follow instructions, space inside each model for people and kit, and that perfect balance of good waterproofing to guard against wet weather and decent ventilation for more balmy days.I also checked if each tent really could sleep the stated number of people it advertised in comfort. I had plenty of help from my husband, outdoorsy friends and my toddler, who rates all these tents as playrooms, and tested a few for durability too.I’ve owned some of my top-recommended tents for years, so I can personally attest to their endurance. As well as recommending tents based on their quality, waterproofing and hardiness, I also looked for variety – I’ve included a great bell tent, backpacking tent, family tent and budget options to suit all sorts of adventures under canvas.The best tents for campingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianBesttent overall:MSR Hubba Hubba NXView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£476 at Cotswold Outdoors£476 at Valley and PeakMSR’s adventurous tents are a bit of a cult classic in the camping world for their light weight, durability and weatherproofing, and you’ll spot them everywhere from lonely mountain passes to moorland campsites. The brand’s bestselling Hubba Hubba is aimed firmly at backpackers – it’s lightweight and compact, but with plenty of space for two.Why we love itAll the MSR tents I’ve tested over the years have proved well made and durable, and are worth the money if you’re looking for something that will see you through years of adventuring. The Hubba Hubba is my pick of its backpacking offerings, and this NX model is pleasingly quick and simple to pitch – even on your own – with poles that click together easily and hold their shape brilliantly, even in heavy winds.View image in fullscreenThe Hubba Hubba fits easily into a rucksack when it’s packed down.Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianThe inside of the Hubba Hubba is roomy (the mesh material keeps bugs at bay), with plenty of space for two people plus gear, and the porch area provides even more space for spare kit or muddy boots. The whole thing is quick to pack down and fits easily into a rucksack. I’ve used the original Hubba Hubba for hundreds of nights under the stars, and it’sstood the test of time superbly. Top marks.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive.Tent size:two-personWeight:1.5kgDimensions packed:46 x 15cmDimensions up: 100 x 120 x 210cmWaterproofing:1,200mmBestbudget tent:EasyCamp Sarek 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£89.95 at Ligo£109.99 at John LewisEasy Camp’s Sarek 2 has been made with cyclists and backpackers in mind. Its compact pack size easily fits into panniers or a rucksack, and it includes thoughtful features such as a gear hook for bike helmets and even a drying line for wet clothing.Why we love itThe Sarek 2 punches above its price point in lots of areas. It’s made of lightweight yet durable polyester fabrics, and boasts robust 3,000mm waterproofing, which I found kept the rain at bay reliably well – even during an all-night downpour. Colour-coded poles make setup quick and intuitive.View image in fullscreenThe Sarek 2 is compact enough to fit into panniers or a rucksack.Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianThis tunnel-style tent has a low profile, and while it technically sleeps two, there’s limited room for kit, so it’s better suited for one person. Note too that head height is limited, with not much room inside for anything but sleeping. Nevertheless, if you’re travelling solo, the Sarek 2 is a good deal.It’s a shame that …head height is limited.Tent size:two-personWeight:2.2kgDimensions packed:46 x 12cmDimensions up:260 x 170 x 95cmWaterproofing:3,000mmBest family tent:Outwell Montana 4 AirView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£849.95 at Outdoor Action£849.99 at B&QOutwell’s Montana 4 Air has proven popular with families since its launch, thanks to inflatable poles, lots of living space and a highly waterproof outer fly.Why we love itRecreate your home sitting room inside the roomy Montana, which has an airy living space to hang out in as well as two blackout bedrooms. These work well when sharedby a family of four, keeping little campers in the dark well past daybreak. Big windows and a porch made this tent far less claustrophobic to spend time in during spells of bad weather than most models I tested. I also liked the wide main door and additional side door for ventilation on warm days and easy coming and going.View image in fullscreenThe packed-down Montana 4 Air is a little larger than some of the other tents on test.Photograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianI found pitching the Montana 4 Air fiddly – it’s best attempted by two people – and it’s heavy at 23kg, despite the inflatable “air” poles. This tent had one of the highest waterproof ratings I tested at 6,000mm, and it was reassuringly waterproof in heavy rain. It also felt reasonably windproof considering its larger size.It’s a shame that …putting it up is a little fiddly.Tent size:four-personWeight:23kgDimensions packed:97 x 47 x 43cmDimensions up:510 x 220 x 350cmWaterproofing:6,000mmBest four-person tent:Big Agnes Big HouseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£412.39 at AlpinetrekAll-American brand Big Agnes (it’s named after a mountain in Colorado) created the Big House for car campers who are packing all their weekend’s kit in the boot. This family-friendly, four-person tent is lightweight and portable, with enough headroom to stand fully upright in.Why we love itBig Agnes’s tents and outdoor gear might be expensive, but it shows in the quality of its looks and finish. Pitching is quick and easy, thanks to three intuitive poles that clip together and hold their shape well. While a porch for storing kit would have been useful, there are plenty of pockets inside for bits and bobs – plus you get proper standing height here, which feels revolutionary for a compact tent. At 5.7kg, this tent is too heavy for backpacking, although the carry case is helpful for lugging it from thecar to where you might be pitching.Its 1,500mm of waterproofing kept me dry in wet May weather, while the mesh kept air moving in hot spells. This tent is marketed as four-person, but we’d say it’s more comfortable for three if camping for more than a night or two. Go for the six-person if there are four of you. All in all, a nice all-rounder for weekends away, car camping and festivals.It’s a shame that …if it’s more than a few nights, it will be a bit of a squeeze for four.Tent size:four-personWeight:5.7kgDimensions packed:18 x 41 x 66cmDimensions up:230 x 220 x 180cmWaterproofing:1,500mmBest bell tent:Boutique CampingLuna BellView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianFrom £409 at Boutique Camping£421 at Mountain WarehouseBoutique Camping stocks a range of canvas and polycotton glamping tents and tipis, with the Luna Bell among its most popular designs. It has wide windows, lots of headroom and enough space for a proper bed, if kipping on the ground isn’t your thing.Why we love itFor years now, my own Luna Bell has been a constant companion at festivals, weddings and family camps over summer. This tipi-style tent offers lots of room for three or four campers to share, with tons of head space and big circular windows that give it a light and airy feel inside.It’s made from weather-resistant polycotton, which means it’s not fully waterproof, and so is best used in summer – and if it does get wet, you’ll need to ensure it’s properly dry before storing. The Luna Bell is heavy, and it will require two people to put up; but good guy ropes and aluminium poles make the whole thing feel reassuringly sturdy once it is up. I own the four-metre Luna Bell, but five-, six- and seven-metre versions are also available.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and bulky, plus there’s only one room.Tent size:four-personWeight:16kgDimensions packed:95 x 28 x 28cmDimensions up:250 x 400cmWaterproofing:water-resistant polycottonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The downside is that “air” tents can be pretty pricey, but Easy Camp’s Genus 400 can currently be picked up for the reduced price of £229. This four-person tent is big and roomy, but its weight is perfectly portable. Plus, it’s simple to pitch – on test, it took about 25 minutes to get it up and ready for use with the included pump.Step inside and you’ll find a large bedroom, a living area with big windows, and a porch. Only the living room offers standing height, and it’s a pity the bedroom can’t be divided so that kids can have their own room. Nevertheless, this is still a good-quality air tent if you fancy giving inflatable tents a try without blowingyour budget.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s only one bedroom.Tent size:four-person;weight:9.8kg;dimensions packed:73 x 35 x 28cm;dimensions up:450 x 190 x 250cm;waterproofing:3,000mmVango Savannah Air 600XLView image in fullscreen£899.95 at Outdoor Action£899.99 at DecathlonBest for:a six-person tentI’ve always found that Vango tents offer decent bang for your buck, and the Savannah Air is one of the best larger inflatable tents around. Once inflated with the included pump, you’ll have a roomy tent with three blackout bedrooms, plus a central living space and a big porch. It took me about 20 minutes to pitch, although you’ll need two people to lug it all into place.This tent sleeps six in three bedrooms, although it would prove nice and spacious for a family of four or five, with room to spare for all your belongings. I love the huge windows, which make the Savannah comfy to hang out in, even on rainy days.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s bulky and heavy, so only suitable for longer family holidays.Tent size:six-person;weight:31.7kg;dimensions packed:80 x 50 x 50cm;dimensions up:715 x 385 x 21ocm;waterproofing:4,000mmQuechua 2 Seconds Fresh&BlackView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianFrom £119.99 at DecathlonBest for:a pop-up tentHate putting up tents? Then get yourself a pop-up one. Decathlon’s 2 Seconds is surprisingly sturdy, offers decent waterproofing, and really does take only a few seconds to pop up and peg into place. Free this circular design of its straps, and it springs into shape instantly, forming a roomy tent for one or two. It’s lined with blackout material, which keeps the tent cool and dark for longer – great for lie-ins at festivals, or for attempting to stop little ones from waking up at the crack of dawn.If only it were as easy to take down as it is to put up – I had to watch the instruction video multiple times to get the folding technique down. Note, too, that pop-up tents are less windproof and durable than traditional designs.It didn’t make the final cut because …space is limited, and it’s tricky to fold down.Tent size:three-person;weight:4.9kg;dimensions packed:86 x 10cm;dimensions up:109 x 88 x 180cm;waterproofing:2,000mmColeman Cortes OctagonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian£250 at HalfordsFrom £224.98 at AmazonBest for:a festivalThe rather futuristic-looking Coleman Cortes Octagon is as fun to camp in as it looks, although it can be fiddly to put up until you’ve pitched it a few times. Inside, one huge octagonal room offers up an airy living space – although this might make it unsuitable for families where individuals need their own space.Those who aren’t fans of dark, cramped tents will love this tent’s generous standing room and wall-to-wall windows, which can be fully opened and offer a 360-degree view. The Octagon also works brilliantly as a playhouse in the garden or as a beach shelter. It’s heavy at 20.7kg, but its carry case has handy wheels for easy transportation.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s fiddly to put up, and has only one room.Tent size:eight-person;weight:20.7kg;dimensions packed:85 x 30 x 30cm;dimensions up:429 x 396 x 215cm;waterproofing:2,000mm‘A godsend at 5am’: the ultimate, sometimes surprising, festival kit list, by the expertsRead moreRobens Settler SkyView image in fullscreen£1,449.99 at RobensBest for:a luxury tentThe Settler Sky is the most expensive tent in this roundup – but you do get the quality you pay for. This eye-catching tipi-style tent sleeps up to 10 in one huge central space, and there’s plenty of head height. The polycotton material looks like canvas but is breathable and fully waterproof (unlike most glamping-style tents, which are often just water-resistant), and it has huge windows with mesh panels and privacy curtains, so you can let the light in during the day or even do a spot of stargazing at night.Pitching this behemoth was surprisingly easy, but do note that it’s heavy to transport and cumbersome to store. For glampers, bell tent gatherings in the back garden or festival fun in groups, the Settler Sky would be worth the splurge.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s eye-wateringly expensive.Tent size:10-person;weight:26.3kg;dimensions packed:33 x 33 x 95cm;dimensions up:500 x 460cm;waterproofing:10,000mmWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jacob Little/The GuardianHow can I tell if a tent is waterproof?Bad weather can make or break a camping trip, so it’s important to pay attention to the specs when making your choice. Look for a “twin skin” tent – this means it has a separate inner layer and an outer “flysheet” layer – and pick a model that has a fully waterproof fly (outer layer).The waterproof rating will sometimes be listed as a “hydrostatic head” (HH) rating, a measure of how waterproof a tent’s fabric is. It’s expressed in millimetres (as listed underneath each product above) and indicates the amount of water pressure the fabric can withstand before it starts to leak. For example, a 1,500mm HH rating means the fabric can hold a 1.5-metre column of water before leaking. Generally, 1,000–1,500mm is suitable for light rain, 1,500mm is waterproof and above 3,000mm is highly waterproof and more suitable for winter or mountain conditions.If you’re buying a canvas tent, look for one that’s made with water-resistant polycotton. Good tents have built-in waterproof nylon groundsheets, which stop any wet seeping in from the ground.What features should I look for?Think about how and where you want to use your new tent. For a multi-week family camping trip with the car, the size and weight of a large tent with multiple rooms or a canvas glamping tent will be worth the roomy living space you’ll get in return. Big family tents have traditionally been a nightmare to erect, but there are now more “air” tents coming on to the market, which you can inflate with a pump. Those with children might be better going for a two-bedroom tent, to ensure you all get a good night’s sleep, and one made with blackout material to stop little ones waking up at dawn. If you’re just off for a weekend, look for more compact models, and if you want to carry your tent any distance backpacking or bikepacking, pick something that weighs 4kg or less.How many people does a tent really sleep?Be wary of the number of people a tent claims to sleep – I’d advise you halve that number if you don’t fancy sleeping like sardines. Solo campers will find a one- or two-person tent fine, while a six-person model will make a good fit for a family of two adults and two or three children, with plenty of space left over for cooking gear and clothing. If you’re shopping for a family tent, look for multiple bedrooms and a roomy porch, so there’s plenty of space for storing kit or to sit under shelter.How to clean and store your tent to make it last longer – and recycle it when it’s time to replaceStore your tent indoors somewhere cool and dry when not in use. Tents can go mouldy or end up smelling musty in storage, so make sure they’re bone-dry before packing away. If you’ve just returned from a swampy trip to Glastonbury, scrub off any mud and dirt with a damp, soapy sponge, then hand-wash your tent’s outer and inner flies in a bath filled with warm water, using a technical tent washsuch as this one from Nikwax. Rinse well, then erect your tent outdoors on a warm day, out of direct sunlight, and leave until fully dry. If you own a canvas glamping tent, consider sending it off for a professional clean every few years.When you get to the point of replacement, recycle your current tent at a household waste centre, or if it’s still functional, donate it to charity or give it away on a local freebie group such asFreecycle. If you buy a Decathlon brand tent this summer, such as theQuecha pop-upfeatured above, you’ll be able to return it at any point until 14 September as part of the brand’sNo Tent Left Behind campaign– useful for any festivals.Sian Lewis is an award-winningoutdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces while hiking, swimming and wild camping.

This proved to be anything but a routine sendoff for the Lions coaches and players, who already have a good deal to reflect on as they head for Perth this weekend to embark on their eagerly awaited Australian tour.Should they win the Test series 3-0, of course, this pre-departure ­wake-up call will rate as only a minor footnote in the great scheme of things. The Wallabies, nevertheless, will have taken due note of both the historic result and the positive manner with which Argentina approached the ­contest. The Pumas, despite the absence of some first-choice players, led by 11 points at half-time and were good value for their history-making win.Freeman and Van der Merwe miss chance to make impression in tough Lions opener | Brendan FanningRead moreMaybe, one day, the Lions will find it in their hearts – and wallets – to agree to a full tour of South America which, on this evidence, would be a guaranteed crowd pleaser.As for the Lions, playing in Ireland for the first time, it is too early to draw hard and fast individual ­conclusions, but Tadhg Beirne and Sione Tuipulotu will both be influential figures in Australia and the two starting props, Ellis Genge and Finlay Bealham, showed up well in the set scrums.Pre-departure games, though, can give and take away and this result was another example. “We made it a tough game, didn’t we?” the Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. “Congratulations to Argentina, who thoroughly deserved to win. [But] the story of the game is that we made too many errors. We need to be better than that. Losing hurts, especially in this jersey. We need to find a solution pretty quickly and be honest with ourselves.”At least the post-game injury ­bulletins were OK. Four years ago,Alun Wyn Jones was ruled out of the early stagesof the tour after damaging a shoulder against Japan at ­Murrayfield and the possibility of being sidelined before the plane south has left the runway inevitably hung in the humid evening air.View image in fullscreenBundee Aki drives over to score the first try of the Lions’ tour, although Argentina ended the first half in front.Photograph: Peter Morrison/APThe calibre of the opposition, though, created little margin for error. The Pumas may not have been absolutely at full strength but whenever Pablo Matera, Juan-Martín González and Julián Montoya take the field they are never less than fully committed. The pace of the game certainly bore little resemblance to a gentle friendly.Luke Cowan-Dickie came close to an opening try only to lose control of the ball in the act of scoring and, after Tomás Albornoz and Fin Smith had swapped a penalty apiece, it was the Pumas who seized the initiative thanks to a nicely taken 11th minute try by their speedy left wing Ignacio Mendy.The Lions also had a second potential score by Tuipulotu correctly ruled out for a prior knock-on but their cohesion was steadily improving, helped by the established England half-back pairing of Alex Mitchell and Smith. Both were involved, along with full-back Marcus Smith, in ­keeping a promising move alive before the physical Bundee Aki took the most direct available route to the try-line.These are clearly early days but Tuipulotu looks to be the kind of player any centre would love to play alongside and the calmly assured Smith also looked at ease in the same red jersey worn by his grandfather, Tom Elliot, on the 1955 tour to South Africa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was another example on the stroke of half-time when Duhan van der Merwe, desperate to impress, lost the ball and the Pumas took gleeful advantage, Carreras releasing ­Albornoz for a swallow-dive score 75 metres upfield.The 21-10 interval scoreline demanded a swift response, which duly materialised within five minutes of the restart. The Lions opted to trust their driving maul with the line in sight and a concerted surge gave the opposing pack little option but to drag it down, costing them a penalty try and 10 minutes in the sin bin for Mayco Vivas.The raft of Lions subs also brought fresh energy and, soon enough, they were back ahead. Genge came charging through the middle in proper rhino fashion and, eventually, Beirne added the finishing gloss. The Pumas, though, also found a second wind and another daring break-out raid from deep yielded their third try of the night courtesy of the pacy Santiago Cordero. If the Australian leg of the tour is equally full of thrills and spills, the next few weeks will be excellent viewing.It was also a more than decent occasion which further underlined the power of one of rugby’s most evocative brands. Even Munster fans would have been impressed by the sea of red jerseys all around the Aviva and, despite some punchy ticket prices, the attendance was a 51,700 sellout. The final result, though, will inevitably be the abiding memory.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsArgentina rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Gill is one of those rare athletes who works in a different rhythm to the rest of us, so that even when a ball’s coming down at 90mph he seems to be able to take a beat to whistle a bar of Jim Croce’s Time in a Bottle while he thinks about what he’s going to order for dinner that evening, finally decides how to meet this latest delivery and then, at the last possible moment, follows through. He is, as any number of players and coaches say, someone you only need to see hit one shot to know exactly how good he is.England, unfortunately for them, got to watch a lot more than one on thefirst day of the opening Test.India’s Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal make tons to leave England toiling in first TestRead moreIn style, Gill is a throwback batter. He plays the game with patrician disdain, waiting for the ball like it’s his butler, then, sending it scurrying away with a casual flick of his wrist, to fetch him a cold drink from somewhere the other side of the covers. It’s all done with the bare minimum of apparent effort, he pulls his bat up shy when he drives, and stops halfway through his pull shot. But in substance he is the very model of a modern middle order cricketer. He had scored more centuries in T20 cricket than he had in Test matches, and still has a higher top score in the shorter format. Just.He was in many ways, still unfulfilled as a Test match batter when India decided tomake him their new captain. He had scored five centuries, but they were all made in the subcontinent (four in India, one in Bangladesh) and his top-score elsewhere was a 91 he made in Brisbane four years ago. Coming into this Test, it was the only score of more than 50 he had made across tours of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England and the West Indies. His nickname, Prince, suits him for lots of reasons, not least that it felt like his defining achievements are all ahead of him. The hundred he made here was the first of them.View image in fullscreenShubman Gill receives the acclaim for his century against England.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersGill is the youngest man to captain India since Sachin Tendulkar got the job in 1996. If he carries on in the way he played on the first day at Headingley, he will, unlike Tendulkar, have it for a long while yet. It helped that England made the hardest decision of the day for him. Judging a toss before the end of the match is like counting a chicken before it’s hatched, or damning a pitch before both teams have had a bat. Generally it pays to wait before you make your mind up. But after just half an hour, it was hard to avoid the creeping feeling that England had got it wrong here.Gill said he would have done the same thing in Ben Stokes’s position. It turned out to be good for him that he didn’t get the opportunity. England may yet be vindicated, there have been a lot of good fourth-innings scores at Headingley in recent years, and the last six Tests here have all been won by the team bowling first, but the first day’s play was hot work for bowlers and the wickets were hard-earned. By midway through the morning session, Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse had both had a go from either end, Josh Tongue tried both sides of the wicket. It already felt as if Stokes had turned out his pockets searching for England’s first wicket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England eventually got one, then two, wickets, in the run-up to lunch. So it fell to Gill, batting at No 4, to reassert control of the innings. He was waiting for England when they came back on to the field, having spent most of the break patting back throwdowns from a couple of the squad players.He carried on that way through the rest of the day, Carse, who goes about his bowling like the batter is a stray nail that needs to be hammered back into the crease, troubled him some. But the rest of England’s attack hardly mustered a chance worth appealing for between them. So Gill moved imperiously to his hundred, as unruffled, and regal, as Cleopatra along the Nile, the only blemishes in his innings were the one bungled single on 97, and the pair of black socks peeping out from beneath the hems of his white trousers.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, this was also a dreadful afternoon for Enzo Maresca, who got his tactics wrong and somehow found a way to produce the self-sabotage of treating the Lincoln Financial Field to a masterclass on how to neutralise Cole Palmer.So much for all the hype about Palmer taking the No 10 shirt. Why leave him isolated on the right? Palmer yearned for his normal central role and he did not look impressed when he went off in the 82nd minute, by which point Flamengo were 2-1 up, in possession of a one-man advantage and presumably very happy to see Maresca remove Chelsea’s likeliest source of salvaging something from the wreckage of their six-minute implosion midway through the second half.Club World Cup didn’t start the fire – it didn’t light it but we’ll try to fight it | Max RushdenRead moreNot that Chelsea deserved anything other than a defeat that leaves their hopes of reaching the knockout phase of theClub World Cupas winners of Group D in peril. Maresca’s lineup was weirdly clunky – he decided to forgo width by dropping Noni Madueke and moving Reece James into a stolid midfield – and he was outsmarted by Flamengo’s manager, Filipe Luís.Some substitutions win you games; some lose them. For Flamengo there was a stunning contribution from Bruno Henrique, who was thrown on in the 56th minute and in the right place to equalise six minutes later. Chelsea, on the other hand, were left trying to make sense of Jackson’s indiscipline. The striker came on for Liam Delap in the 64th minute, watched Danilo give Flamengo the lead moments later, and then picked up a red card for a crude lunge on Ayrton Lucas four minutes after entering the field of play.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson trudges off after his red card minutes after coming on as a substitute.Photograph: Chris Szagola/APIt seems nothing has been taken on board in the six weeks since Jackson was sent offfor elbowing Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, in a game that threatened to derail Chelsea’s push for Champions League qualification. This was the Senegal forward’s second red card in four appearances and if this is how he intends to respond to competition from Delap then he cannot expect Maresca to trust him with the responsibility of leading the line for Chelsea.A heartfelt apology on Instagram did little to repair the damage caused by Jackson, whose one-game ban could be upgraded by Fifa. “It happened against Newcastle, it happened today,” Maresca said. “I am not 100% sure it is a red card compared to the Newcastle one. It is a bad moment for Nico. He will be out for a while. Nico apologised.”The folly typified Chelsea’s lack of control. Flamengo, who are top of the Brazilian league, played with more balance and imagination. Wesley flew forward from right-back and Gerson was outstanding in attacking midfield. Gonzalo Plata finished with two assists and Jorginho, the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder, pulled the strings with his clever switches of play from deep.The South American sides are not to be underestimated. They remain unbeaten and Chelsea only needed to look at Botafogo beating Paris Saint-Germain to appreciate that this was going to be nothing like their opening win over Los Angeles FC.Flamengo’s fans were out in force in the Philadelphia sun. The intensity rattled Chelsea. Their passing was erratic and Maresca’s tweaks backfired. He brought Malo Gusto in at right-back, started with James next to Moisés Caicedo in central midfield and pushed Enzo Fernández forward.It left Chelsea without a clear way of going from back to front. They took an early lead when Wesley and Danilo failed to deal with a speculative punt from James, enabling Pedro Neto to race through and score, but there was no flow to their football. Delap, who was handed his full debut, faded after drawing a save from Agustín Rossi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They pushed again at the start of the second half. Caicedo, Fernández and James were out-thought. Gerson and Plata went close. The warning signs were obvious.

The German will cost a club record £100m and his pricecould rise with add-onsto £116m, which would make him the most expensive British transfer.Leverkusen had wanted €150m (£127.6m) for the 22-year-old, who also attracted interest from Bayern Munich, but weeks of talks brought down the price. Wirtz, an attacking midfielder, scored 16 goals and provided 15 assists in the past season in 45 club appearances. He has signed a five-year deal at Anfield.Wirtz, who has played 31 times for Germany, succeeds Darwin Núñez as Liverpool’s record signing. Núñez arrived from Benfica in June 2022 in an£85m dealbut the forward is for sale after an underwhelming spell.“I feel very happy and very proud. Finally it’s done and I was waiting for a long time,” Wirtz said on Liverpool’s website. “I’m really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of theBundesligaand to join the Premier League.“I will see how I can perform. I hope I can do my best. I spoke also with some players who played [at Liverpool] and they told me that it’s perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game.

Some are good, some are bad: some can even prove to be a false dawn and merely turn out to be indifferent. But if St Helens are to achieve anything this year, there is one moment here that will certainly rank as season-defining.Paul Wellens’ side, just as they have been for most of 2025, were nothing special in the opening half-hour against a Leeds team with genuine Grand Final aspirations once again. These two sides have 18 Super League titles between them but recently, there has been only one who has looked like claiming another.Leigh solidify top-four spot after Ofahengaue’s late try sees off WakefieldRead moreMaybe that perception will not change over the summer. But if it does, you can pinpoint one particular moment in this win. Not a try, not a kick, but a sensational tackle from the Saints’ newest teenage sensation, Harry Robertson, that denied Ryan Hall an interception score which would have put Leeds in front here.Had that happened, it was not outlandish to suggest the Rhinos would have gone on to win and inflict more misery on Wellens and the Saints. But in truth, Robertson’s effort summed up the many positives about thisSt Helensdisplay which was built on effort, grit and determination: qualities they have lacked too often this year.Those traits proved to be enough to capitalise on an off-night from the Rhinos and reduce the gap between the two sides to just a solitary win. One tackle does not make a summer, as it were, but this is at least a start in convincing the doubting St Helens public that Wellens has the credentials to turn this team around.“I thought we were really tough, really gritty and we needed to be,” Wellens said. “To keep a team as potent to Leeds as four points is exceptional. Huge credit to the boys.”Two penalties from Kyle Feldt and a well-worked Deon Cross try were enough to put the Saints 8-0 ahead at half-time, but the big moment came in between all of that.View image in fullscreenOwen Dagnall scores St Helens’ second try against Leeds.Photograph: Nick Potts/PATristan Sailor’s loose pass was scooped up by Hall and Leeds, who hadn’t really had a sniff to that point, looked certain to level the scores, with a kick to go ahead. The Hall of a few years ago perhaps would have finished with ease, but Robertson seared across the pitch and made an exceptional cover tackle to bundle Hall into touch.The reaction from the Saints players said it all about the mood they were in. From that moment on, you always felt they would do enough. Riley Lumb’s try seven minutes after the break briefly halved the deficit for Leeds and gave them hope, but they were some way below the standards we have come to expect from the Rhinos this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s a reflection of our attitude.” Lumb’s try proved nothing more than false hope in the end, as the Saints responded in style.A perfectly executed scrum play saw another exciting homegrown product, Owen Dagnall, cross for his second try in as many games. How Wellens, himself a junior product of this club and one of their great players, must have enjoyed a moment like that – as well as Robertson’s incredible try-saving heroics.Dagnall’s score made it 14-4 and in truth, an error-strewn Leeds never looked capable of overturning that deficit with 10 minutes remaining. In fact, it was the Saints who finished stronger, as Sailor crossed for a deserved try on the hooter.We will only know in the weeks ahead what this result means for the Saints. That is now four wins in five for them. But they needed a scalp against a real contender to make people notice that all is not lost yet for one of Super League’s great clubs in 2025.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSt HelensLeeds RhinosRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Will it ever reach breaking point?From heat to unrest: how five major Club World Cup storylines are shaping upRead moreTo legacy fans (who liked football before the start of June) the Club World Cup may feel like the moment where you switched off, or just didn’t switch on in the first place. If football began yesterday, you’d probably plan it with a tournament with club sides from all over the globe. But football didn’t begin yesterday.Jonathan Wilsoncan tell you exactly when that was. And of course you don’t have to watch this shoehorned land‑grab of a tournament, but sometimes it would be nice to not even have the option.The inflated prize money, where that wealth has come from and the impact huge sums of money going to individual clubs will have on leagues around the world are the start of the problems. Then there’s the fear of the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement service coming to deport a couple of players (or some of those coming to watch). The crowds are, to quote Gennaro Gattuso, “sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit” – more than 400,000 empty seats so far (BBC), 1.5m tickets sold so far for the tournament (Fifa). The tournament overlapping with the Women’s Euros is disgraceful.Careers may be shorter, and we should care about this issue – but how many of us will just support the next guy in the shirt? The reality will be the same whenever players with the potential to reach the peak of the game suffer injury or loss of form. Take Dele Alli or Ansu Fati: we just stop calling them elite and then let them drift from our minds. There will always be top players playing for top clubs. There will always be the best player and so on and so on. Unless players strike it will carry on down the same path.It is obviously easier for neutrals to ignore it. But if you happen to be, say, a Chelsea fan, then part of deal is that you follow your team in their games. Sure there’s a hierarchy of importance – Premier League over Carabao Cup – but it doesn’t feel like you can just keep this file closed. It might the most obvious thing ever written, but if your team is playing, your team is playing.View image in fullscreenBotafogo sparked ecstatic scenes when they defeated PSG at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersTo criticise the Club World Cup is to be accused of having a Euro- or Anglo-centric view of the game – and that might be fair. “Try telling those Botafogo fans that this doesn’t matter.” The scenes at full time aftertheir win over PSGwere wonderful. Who wouldn’t want to see Lionel Messi score another great free-kick? Do you know what, I’m probably OK.Fifa, the guardian of the game, is plonking this in with little care for elite player welfare or the fans or the women’s game. It is not alone. Uefa enlarged the Champions League; the prize money there already distorts smaller European leagues. The Premier League won’t filter enough money down to the EFL. League Two clubs won’t vote for more teams to come up from the National League. TheClub World Cupis just the ultimate example. The notion of the football family is a nice one to cling to. But it only really exists when you can tweet that you care about something that has no material impact on your prospects.This tournament will grow as its history grows. There will always be people who want to watch football because, well, football is great. The danger as always is what comes next: franchise football teams, franchise footballers, a world league, the end of the pyramid. You can’t blame people for just wanting to watch a game without thinking of the greater good, or bad. This is the football you are given, you can watch it if you like.Those of us lucky enough to work in the game should constantly recognise the privilege, and even when I’m complaining about the amount of football, I’m watching Cambridge United’s shirt-reveal video over and over (not because I’m in it, but because Paul Wanless is at the chippy! Steve Fallon is in the Cambridge Blue!) and I’m checking the Spurs transfer gossip. The game has that hold over us, and it is a shame that there are too many people right at the top who want to exploit that.Surely a month off would be good for everyone?

If I want to do something, I’m going to do it.”In March Lewis-Skelly, at the age of 18, became the youngest player toscore on his England debut, and life has changed considerably for Lewis since she received a call from an agent who wanted to represent her son when he was 11.Lewis-Skelly had recently excelled at a youth tournament in Japan, along with Ethan Nwaneri, another Hale End academy product who has progressed into the first team under Mikel Arteta, and suddenly found himself in demand.“That’s when you start to know about the industry so that you can say: ‘Hang on, we’re not there yet. Let me find out more …,” Lewis says. “Because there is no race. There is no rush. My mum always used to say to me: ‘If something feels urgent, that is a sign to slow down.’”Lewis, who had experience of working for an investment bank in the City, took matters into her own hands. She qualified as a Fifa-registered agent and completed a master’s degree in football business, focusing her thesis on the parent experience in elite football academies – an area in which she was quickly gaining first-hand experience. “It can be a really lonely journey,” she says.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly scores for England against Albania.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat proved to be the inspiration for setting up, in 2022,No1Fan.club, which has been providing support and education for parents of children in the academy systems and is due to become part of the Premier League’s life skills programme next season.“We’re only one of two organisations that do things specifically for parents,” she says proudly. “Everyone else is providing workshops for the players. But no one’s actually focusing on the parent support that helps the kids. So that’s a big win for us, that they finally realised that we’re here to help, and we’re not here to bash the industry but we are here to help them help parents with the realities of the journey, which inevitably will help them and their staff. It’s just taken them a while to realise that.”Lewis has also approached the Professional Footballers’ Association and wants to work with the Football Association on changing regulations that can restrict academy players from joining other clubs if they move home, with some effectively shut out if their former side demand compensation.“These are things which some parents have to seek legal advice for,” she says. “It’s tricky, but as grassroots parents that’s the last thing you’re even thinking about. It’s important that we help parents understand the journey. Signing the paper is the easy bit, but it’s what comes next: the expectation, the juggling of education, the messaging to our kids. The amount of people that say to me: ‘I bet you can retire because Myles is this.’ Or: ‘I bet you can buy a house.’ And I’m like, that’s the language that’s not helpful.”Lewis admits her son’s meteoric rise over the past season has been a steep learning curve but says a strong support network has helped to keep his feet very much on the ground. “Having to deal with going out in public, all of that is new,” she says.“I’m still learning. I think for us, the most important thing is having the right team around you, not putting him on a pedestal at home. ‘No, you’ve still got your chores to do. You still need to empty the dishwasher, tidy your room.’ He still lives at home and I like it, because obviously I enjoy his company a lot. But also, he’s a child – 18 does not make you an adult. It might do by the law. But he’s not ready to go out and live on his own.”View image in fullscreenMarcia Lewis completed a master’s degree in football business as Myles worked his way through the academy system.Photograph: Yolanda de VriesThat were rumours of interest from Real Madrid this summer with Lewis-Skelly due to enter the final 12 months of his first professional contract, signed in October 2023, but he ispoised to extend his dealand become one of the world’s best-paid teenagers. Lewis expresses admiration for Trent Alexander-Arnold’slevel of Spanishat his Madrid unveiling and says her son “loves” studying the language for his AS Level, but suggestions Lewis-Skelly might have left the club he joined at the age of eight are given short shrift.“Rumours are rumours, aren’t they?” Lewis says. “I mean, everyone would always have something to say, you know; that’s fine. We don’t engage in all of that. Myles is enjoying his football. I would want him to enjoy his football wherever he goes, at whatever stage. And, you know, that’s the most important thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am not walking this path alone. We have the right people to support Team Myles. And I think that’s the one thing that we would love to encourage parents to find out more.“We have a workshop called ‘Finding the right agent’. And it isn’t about, OK, go here. No, it’s about, do you know the role? The part that they’ll play? What questions should you ask? You know, even around the approach, around having a meeting, how do you show up to feel on an equal playing field with someone who wants to sell you a service? What are the signs? What are the red flags? Equally, parents, how do you need to adjust your behaviour? You know, it’s not about paying off your house.”The self-belief Lewis-Skelly showed in performing Erling Haaland’s Zen celebration after scoring inArsenal’s 5-1 thrashing of Manchester Cityin February at the Emirates comes not only from his mother but also from Marcia’s mum. “She is a very confident woman – don’t take no shit!” Lewis says.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly displayed his self-confidence with his ‘Zen’ celebration after scoring against Manchester CityPhotograph: Javier García/ShutterstockShe is happy to take credit for her son’s physical prowess, which has impressed Arteta, Thomas Tuchel and so many pundits. “I’d like to say so!” she responds when asked whether her cooking is responsible. “Even as a young child he always ate well. As a kid, he always loved pasta. But it’s not like Myles has been on this nutritional health fix since he was 10. No, he’s been a child. Let him eat what he needs to eat.”No1Fan.club will host its firstparent conference, Changing the Game for Football Families, on 5 July at Stormzy’s Mercy HQ in south London. It will feature workshops from experts in areas such as career planning for young footballers and digital health, and talks from speakers including Les Smith, the father of Fulham’s Emile Smith Rowe. For Lewis, it is another opportunity to help break down some of the barriers in the sport.“I’ve witnessed some of the misogyny in football and how, from an agent perspective, I’ve been approached before, quite disrespectfully, quite frankly. Almost preyed upon … So I think that’s the other thing about having someone like myself, who is a Black woman, reaching parents, who finally feel that there is someone who either looks like them or is the same sex as them that is challenging the status quo. When I see the diversity of our workshop groups, it’s amazing.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lifetime’s ambition’Greg Woodat AscotFri 20 Jun 2025 13.43 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 17.14 EDTShareA lifetime of hope and endeavour enjoyed a glorious reward here on Friday as Joseph Murphy, who is two years short of a half-century with a trainer’s licence, finally added a Group One winner to his record as Cercene, at 33-1, edged out the 6-4 favourite, Zarigana, in the Coronation Stakes, the feature event on day four atRoyal Ascot.“It’s 50 years of work by the family,” Murphy said afterwards. “Going from a small yard, switching from National Hunt to the Flat and always believing, buying horses and believing that they’re going to be good. It’s a lifetime’s ambition to have a Group One winner.”Cercene had to dig deep for the win, as Zarigana headed her at the furlong pole but then failed to put the race to bed. Cercene, though, did her trainer proud, pulling out more all the way to the line to get home by half a length. Francis-Henri Graffard, Zarigana’s trainer, suggested afterwards that he might “need to buy a pair of blinkers”, but the will to win that Cercene showed when it mattered is a vital part of a true Group One winner’s makeup.Royal Ascot 2025: Cercene claims major Coronation Stakes shock on day four – liveRead moreCercene went off at a big price, but she had finished a four-length third behind Lake Victoria – a warm ante-post favourite for this race until injury intervened – in the Irish 1,000 Guineas in late May. She settled well in fourth for Gary Carroll, her jockey, as Falakeyah, the second-favourite, cut out the running, and as Falakeyah faded in the straight, Carroll was perfectly positioned both to strike for home and then take advantage as Zarigana’s momentum faltered.“Decent horses are very hard to come by and I’ve been lucky enough to find one with a huge heart,” Carroll said. “If I was ever to ride a Group One winner, I’m delighted it was for Joe Murphy. He’s been supporting me since I was a 7lb claimer, a long, long time.“The French horse [Zarigana] came and she actually got headed, but she’s very tough, she stuck her head out and really went to the line for me.”It was very much a day for smaller family operations as earlier in the afternoon, Harry Eustace’s Time For Sandals, another outsider at 25-1, had taken the Group One Commonwealth Cup, and since Eustace also won the Queen Anne Stakes on Tuesday, the yard now has two more Group Ones at this year’s meeting than Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle.“The most concerning part was her draw [in stall one],” Eustace said. “When Karl Burke’s filly [Venetian Sun in the opening Albany Stakes] came out of one, everyone just stuck there [and] we had plenty of pace.“It’s the first time she’s had a fast horse to follow. We were … I don’t want to say very confident, but we just felt we hadn’t seen the best from her for one reason or another. We were always confident in a race like this, where there would be fast horses taking her along, that’s really what she needed.”James Eustace, Harry’s father, trained at the family’s Park Lodge Stables for 30 years before passing on the licence in 2020, and his other son, David, has enjoyed a successful training career in Australia and Hong Kong, highlighted by a Melbourne Cup success with Gold Trip in 2022.“If we did anything, we instilled a work ethic in them,” Eustace said, “hopefully by example rather than by a long tom, but we were so lucky from day one that they loved the whole thing.View image in fullscreenVenetian Sun ridden by Clifford Lee wins the Albany Stakes.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“We tried to make Harry go to university, he went to Edinburgh for two years, enjoyed himself immensely and then dropped out and went to Australia to work in racing, and hasn’t looked back.”Venetian Sun will be aimed towards next year’s 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket after her decisive win in the opening Albany Stakes.“I think she’s a very special filly,” Karl Burke, Venetian Sun’s trainer, said. “The work she’s done at home, I haven’t had a two-year-old filly work like that. Just the last couple of months, six weeks, she’s kicking all the Group horses out of the way at home.”Venetian Sun was backed from 12-1 to 7-1 before her win – “given the confidence Karl gave us, we had to have a decent bet,” Tony Bloom, Venetian Sun’s co-owner, said afterwards – and is a 25-1 shot for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May 2026.The fourth day concluded with Aidan O’Brien and the John & Thady Gosden stables tied on five winners each ahead of tomorrow’s seven-race card. The race for the jockeys’ award is also just about in play, as Oisin Murphy’s win on Adrestia in the last was his fourth of the meeting, two behind Ryan Moore’s tally of six.Satono Reve can deliver overdue win for JapanA dozen runners from Japan have tried and failed to become the country’s first winner at RoyalAscotsince the turn of the century, but the 13th could finally make the breakthrough on the final day of this year’s Royal meeting, when Satono Reve will go to post with a leading chance in the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes.Noriyuki Hori’s six-year-old is a Grade One winner in Japan and also finished within a length of Ka Ying Rising, the world’s top-rated sprinter, in a Group One at Sha Tin in December.He was two-and-a-quarter lengths behind Ka Ying Rising at the same track in April before heading to the UK, and has been given plenty of time to acclimatise after arriving in Newmarket on 2 May.View image in fullscreenSatono Reve at Newmarket earlier this month.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockSatono Reve (3.40)is up against a deep and international field, with fancied runners from France and Ireland as well as a strong local defence led by last year’s Commonwealth Cup winner, Inisherin.At his best, though, he is the equal of any of Saturday’s runners and it is also a positive sign that João “Magic Man” Moreira, who was in the saddle for his big run in December, has flown in to take the ride.Royal Ascot 2.30:Aidan O’Brien is going for a sixth win in nine years with Moments Of Joy but she may struggle against the €2m Frankel coltTreanmor, who was sent off at 1-3 for his debut in May and powered four lengths clear with minimal encouragement.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowRedcar1.10 Try Storm Cat 1.43 Jungle Monarch 2.14 Paco’s Pride 2.49 Tiva 3.21 Azure Angel 4.05 Lima Sierra 4.45 Park StreetNewmarket2.03 Crowd Quake 2.38 Commander’s Intent 3.10 Elarak 3.45 Circe 4.25 Red Flyer 5.05 Diamont KatieRoyal Ascot2.30 Treanmor 3.05 Rebel’s Romance 3.40 Satono Reve (nb) 4.20 Remmooz 5.00 Purosangue (nap) 5.35 Ernst Blofeld 6.10 SoberBangor-on-Dee3.55 Barranco 4.35 Obsessedwithyou 5.15 Leading Force 5.50 Solent Gateway 6.25 Bellbird 7.00 Chillhi 7.30 Lord CauvelliereAyr4.10 Mo Of Cairo 4.50 Lion’s House 5.25 Oneforthegutter 5.55 Enchanting 6.33 Superior Council 7.08 Pinjarra 7.38 Coeur Jaune 8.08 WoohooLingfield5.45 Laser Focus 6.20 Skimming Along 6.53 Lovethiswayagain 7.23 Latynina 7.55 Blue Collar Lad 8.25 Banksman 8.55 BeelzebubHaydock6.00 Burj Jabeel 6.40 Sugar Hill Babe 7.15 Gold Dawn 7.45 Duke’s Command 8.15 Arkhalia Flynn 8.45 Pomme PommeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Royal Ascot 3.05:Rebel’s Romancehad enough class to win last month’s Yorkshire Cup without being ideally suited by the step up in trip, and the return to 12 furlongs here will play to his many strengths.Royal Ascot 4.20:The progressiveRemmoozhas shown enough in two wins this season to suggest he can improve past more exposed opponents.Royal Ascot 5.00:Oisin Murphy’s mountPurosanguewas less than two lengths behind likely favourite More Thunder at Newmarket last time without being given a hard time, is 8lb better off today and has been drawn well in 22.Royal Ascot 5.35:Ernst Blofelddoes not have much to find to take a hand in the finish on the basis of his handicap debut at Newbury and cheekpieces could eke out the necessary improvement.Royal Ascot 6.10:Willie Mullins’sSoberwas a dual Group Two winner for André Fabre in 2023 and has several pounds in hand of his rivals.Explore more on these topicsRoyal AscotHorse racingAscotnewsShareReuse this content"

There were, after all, quite a few self-sabotaging concentration lapses, his forehand was sometimes too erratic and he did not always seem comfortable moving on the slick grass.In the most important moments, however, when the match hung in the balance, the 23-year-old locked in and produced his best tennis. Once again, the British No 1 held his nerve in the final stages of a tough three-setter as he defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals at Queen’s Club for the first time in his career.The victory means Draper will return to his career-high ranking of No 4 on Monday, securing him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. At a time when almost every player wishes to avoid an early meeting withCarlos Alcarazor Jannik Sinner, he cannot face either of the world’s top two before the semi-finals.However, a meeting with Alcaraz here remains on the cards. One day after his own dramatic three-set win, as he recovered from 2-4 in the final setto defeat Jaume Munarin a three hour, 26-minute marathon, Alcaraz, the top seed, returned to the semi-finals at Queen’s Club with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Arthur Rinderknech. Alcaraz has won 16 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career.Alcaraz stressed how difficult it was to recover with less than 24 hours after such a tough match. “Could be better, honestly, but I thought I was going to feel much worse than I feel right now,” the world No 2 said. “But we are tennis players, we have to do whatever we have to do just to recover, to be in good shape the next day. I’m just feeling great. I’m glad that today was one hour, 20 minutes. Today was more grass [than clay], so I’m just happy and hopefully tomorrow I’m going to feel much better.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz has now won 16 matches on the bounce after his victory over Arthur Rinderknech.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersFor Draper the past few days have, in some ways, emphasised just how much things have changed over the past year. Although he has broken new ground this week by reaching a first semi-final at this venue, he still feels some way from producing his best. “The level of what I’m playing could be more consistent, definitely better,” he said. “I think it will come. The more I practise, the more I play, I’m getting a little bit better each time. I don’t know when it will come together, but still doing well to be in the semis. Day by day, we’ll see.While he has previously been able to produce his best level from the beginning of the grass season, Draper is still finding his feet after enduring his first full clay-court season and the significant efforts it took for him to adapt his game to suit a completely different surface.“It’s just such a hard adjustment,” said Draper. “I really tried on the clay to play a certain way, to be aggressive in the back court, to be tough from the back of the court, and I spent probably like a month and a half on the clay.This is still [early] because I didn’t practise too much before the tournament with certain things. I’m sort of going by ear out there a little bit, and I’m trying to become more and more comfortable on the grass. When you get more comfortable in the movement, more comfortable in what you’re trying to do out there, it just starts clicking.”During the decisive moments, though, the confidence that Draper has gained over the past few years has been plain for all to see and every match affords him the opportunity to further improve his level on grass as he attempts to peak in time for Wimbledon. Draper will next face the talented Czech Jiri Lehecka, who ended the excellent run of the British No 2, Jacob Fearnley, with a 7-5, 6-2 win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had his father’s money, but when he saw the tide of people pushing towards a food distribution site in Rafah, hunger pulled him into their flow.Almost immediately, the site descended into chaos. Gunfire. Drones. Then in a flash, shrapnel from a tank shell ripped through his little body. When I met him at a hospital in Khan Younis – where painkillers, like food, are scarce – the 13-year-old was in agony. “I have shrapnel inside my body that they couldn’t remove,” he told me. “I am in real pain; since 6am I have been asking for a painkiller.” As he recounted the chaos, his father’s composure shattered, and tears rolled down his face. Was he going to lose his son simply because Abed Al Rahman wanted his family to eat?Abed Al Rahman had been trying to get food from a new private and militarised distribution site in Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is funnelling aid through a handful of southern sites guarded by private contractors and Israeli soldiers. With so few distribution points, those who can make the trek are forced to travel long, dangerous distances – risking their lives for grossly inadequate amounts of supplies.In the first week of the GHF’s operation, there werefive mass-casualty eventsin the vicinity of distribution sites as desperate civilians were met by gun and tank fire. Children have been killed. The UN’s aid chief,Tom Fletcher, saidthe sites made “starvation a bargaining chip” and were “a fig leaf for further violence and displacement”. A system that bypasses the UN has, in fact, bypassed humanity. Indeed, politicised aid distribution is unsafe for everyone involved – last week, the GHF said eight of its local team members and volunteers had been killed.And while it’s critical that there is a focus on this lethal lack of aid for Palestinians, the daily killing and maiming of children has become an afterthought. This is my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of 7 October, and in all that time almost nothing has been done to stop the world’s deadliest conflict for children in recent memory. There have been more than50,000 childrenreported killed or injured in 20 months. Fifty thousand.On the same morning I met Abed Al Rahman, I spoke with 24-year-old Sheima, also hospitalised. She, too, went to one of the GHF distribution sites. Different day, same story: her family was denied humanitarian aid for months. Consumed by hunger, her father too sick to travel, Sheima reached a site. Again, gunfire. Boxes of food thrown to the dirt. “I saw dead bodies on the ground,” she told me. “People stepping over them, just trying to get some food.” In the mayhem, Sheima became entangled in wire – her leg and arm torn open as she tried to flee. She didn’t get any food. “Even though I almost died, I would go again,” she said. “I’m the eldest in my family – we need food to survive. I wish to die with a full stomach, not from starvation.”These raw testimonials reinforce two critical questions. First, when UN and international non-governmental organisations warehouses outside Gaza are jam-packed with lifesaving supplies, why is there still a lethal lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza? And second, will these few sites run by private contractors solve the crisis?On the first point, after a total blockade on all supplies going into Gaza from early March until 19 May, Unicef and the World Food Programme are now permitted to bring in limited quantities of only a few selected items. Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classificationwarned last monththat all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza are facing life-threatening food insecurity. Lack of access to clean water has been pushed to lethal levels.Amid incessant bombardments, drastic aid restrictions and mass displacement of the civilian population, the risk of famine is not just possible, but increasingly likely for families in Gaza. From the end of the ceasefire to May this year, malnutrition admissions among children aged under fivesurged by nearly 150%, with a steep rise in severe cases. This isn’t just a trend – it’s an urgent warning.And to the second question, can the GHF prevent famine? The reality is, far too little aid is being distributed from far too few distribution points, all amid concerns that families travelling from northern Gaza to reach sites in the south will not be allowed to return.This is not how you avert famine. Before the collapse of the most recent ceasefire, the UN operated a highly effective aid delivery system in Gaza. And during the ceasefire, we were delivering assistance from more than 400 distribution points across the territory. Access to food, safe water, medicines and shelter skyrocketed. Unicef even went door-to-door to reach malnourished children.Unicef continues to call for a ceasefire, protection of children, the release of hostages and full aid access. We know what it takes to deliver for children in emergencies – it is the same in every crisis and every conflict since the second world war. Children need nutritious food at scale, safety, clean water and dignity. Not security operators. Not indiscriminate fire. Not chaos.There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.Abed Al Rahman died of his injuries on 17 June 2025, after this article was written.James Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump must be stoppedFawaz GergesThis is a war of choice, based on misinformation. If the US and UK join it, they risk a rerun of the Iraq debacle of 2003Fri 20 Jun 2025 07.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 08.42 EDTShareLike the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, Israel’s war on Iran is neither legal nor just. It is a war of choice, not of necessity – and should the US or its European allies, particularly Britain, join in, they risk being dragged into another disastrous and unlawful conflict in the Middle East.A US military intervention would be in direct contravention of international law. Already, the US, once the architect and guardian of the international order, is now among its chief violators. Instead of pressuringBenjamin Netanyahuto end his siege and destruction of Gaza, Donald Trump has fully sided with Netanyahu and called Israel’s attacks on Iran “excellent”. He has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender”. Trump is considering military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Doing so is explicitly prohibited under article 56 of the additional protocol to the Geneva conventions because of the danger of nuclear contamination.Britain, meanwhile, must tread carefully. The attorney general hasreportedlywarned that any UK military involvement beyond defensive support would be illegal. Richard Hermer, the government’s top legal adviser, is said to have raised internal concerns about the legality of joining a bombing campaign.The foundation of Israel’s justification for launching pre-emptive strikes and of Washington’s quiet complicity is alarming. The core claim is that Iran was rapidly taking steps to “weaponise its uranium”, with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, repeatedly warning that Tehran was approaching a point of no return in developing a nuclear bomb.But Netanyahu’s narrative flatly contradicts the US intelligence assessment, which found that not only is Irannotactively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it remainsat leastthree years away from having the capability to do so. The CIA disputes the Israeli claim that Iran is close to crossing a nuclear threshold.Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,testifiedin March that Iran wasnotbuilding a nuclear weapon and that the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had not authorised a nuclear programme, one that was in fact suspended in 2003. Even if Iran was making a bomb, international law doesn’t give Israel and the US the right to bomb Iran. The UN charter is clear on the use of force in international relations.Yet, when pressed about this contradiction, Trump dismissed the intelligence outright. “I don’t care what she said,” he told reporters. “I think they were very close to having it.” Netanyahu and Trump’s narrative also stands in direct opposition to findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose director general, Rafael Grossi,confirmedon 17 June that there was “no proof” Iran was systematically developing nuclear weapons.Set against this backdrop, US military intervention would rupture the rules-based international order further and make future conflicts more unpredictable and dangerous. Other powerful states could launch offensive wars under the pretext of pre-empting real or imagined threats to their national security. Today, it’s Israel and the US. Tomorrow, China could use the same rationale to justify attacking Taiwan.The echoes of the Iraq war should also raise alarm bells. Then, as now, war was sold on manufactured intelligence. Netanyahu was a vocalsupporterof the neoconservative movement that led the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq and justified it with claims about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism. George W Bush sold that war with the now-infamous line about Hussein’s “massive stockpile” of biological weapons, despite the CIA stating it had “no specific information” on quantities or types. Bush went further, claiming: “We do not know whether or not [Iraq] has a nuclear weapon,” contradicting his own intelligence. He knew, and he lied.Trump, for his part, publicly criticised that very deception,sayingBush’s decision to invade Iraq was “the worst decision any president has made in the history of this country [the US]”, adding: “There were no weapons of mass destruction, and they knew there were none.” Yet Trump today appears to borrow a page from Bush’s playbook.Although there is no plan for a US ground invasion ofIran, any attack on Tehran risks spiralling into a full-blown regional war. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against US bases in Iraq, Bahrain and the wider Gulf. A mission creep could easily escalate, triggering a cycle of strikes and counterstrikes.Trump sets deadline of two weeks to decide if US will join Israel’s war on IranRead moreFor example, Iran could mine the strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point for global energy flows. The effects could reverberate globally, hitting energy markets and causing an inflationary cycle, weakening confidence in the US dollar, and potentially plunging the US economy into stagflation.Even the Houthis, with far fewer military capabilities than Iran, have managed to severely inflict damage and disrupt shipping in the Red Sea. If the US joins Israel’s war, Iran could cripple global trade routes and send oil pricessoaring.If the US joins Israel’s war on Iran, it could backfire spectacularly, and potentially strengthen the regime rather than weakening it. One likely outcome is that the clerics will dash forward towards making a nuclear bomb, pointing to Israel’s attack and attempt at regime change as justification. Meanwhile, in the UK, Keir Starmer would do well to remember the bitter legacy of Tony Blair, who led Britain into Iraq alongside the US.Fawaz Gerges is professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.

But that doesn’t mean constant online immersionFri 20 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.02 EDTShareThe threat of a world war. Political assassinations. Federal raids on unsuspecting migrants.There seems to be no end to terrifying news these days. In fact, it comes at us so unceasingly that numbness can set in. Or even depression or melancholy, like a black cloud over every part of our lives.The “gloomcycle” is what Rachel Janfaza, who founded the gen Z-oriented site known as the Up and Up, has dubbed what’s going on. In a recentpiece,she quoted one 23-year-old from Alabama: “I am really overwhelmed by all of the bad news I am seeing right now.”Whatever generation we’re from, that’s a familiar sensation.The question is, how to deal with it? After all, particularly because ofDonald Trump’s chaotic ways, it shows no signs of slowing down. And while it’s important not to tune out altogether, it’s also important to stay grounded.America is sleepwalking into another unnecessary war | Eli Clifton and Eldar MamedovRead moreWhere’s the balance?I’m certainly not a life coach but as someone whose work requires me to stay connected and informed, I’ve developed some coping resources.Here are three recommendations to manage the firehose of bad news and to protect your spiritual and emotional health while still staying engaged in the world.Set thoughtful limits. Can you put your phone in another room or in a drawer for a period of each day? Can you pledge never to sleep with it nearby? I have a friend who has made a pact with her spouse to have an hour after waking and an hour before going to bed in which they don’t talk about current events, and certainly never utter the name of the 47th president.Can you decide not to be on social media during significant hours of the day? And maybe even to ignore your email unless it’s during loosely defined business hours? (This is an especially tough one for me; I always want to respond immediately, which only elicits another response.)Engage in self-care.Maybe you go to the gym or for a run. Maybe it’s a bubble bath. Maybe it’s listening, without any other distractions, to Mozart – or Jon Batiste. For me, it’s daily yoga (the challenging ashtanga practice) followed by meditation. And it’s reading fiction or memoirs unrelated to politics – most recently, Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses, Fredrik Backman’s My Friends,Molly Jong-Fast’s How to Lose Your Mother, and, in galley form, Susan Orlean’s not-yet-published memoir, Joyride.A friend told me recently that she’s rereading all six novels of Jane Austen as an antidote to these fractious times. I like to read books in print, not on a device, since screens are already too dominant in my life. Can you slow down enough to give your full attention to literature for an hour? It will help, and it will also help to build back your undoubtedly frayed attention span.Rely on trusted voices and sources of news.I think the Guardian is one of these, and I would think so even if I didn’t write here almost every week. I know a lot of people who count on the perspective of Heather Cox Richardson, the history professor who writes a dailynewsletter, Letters from an American.Robert Reich, a former labor secretary, is one of my go-to sources of perspective, as are a few columnists, including Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Inquirer and Lydia Polgreen at the New York Times.While traveling in Asia recently, I read the Japan Times and the international edition of the New York Times each morning; they were bundled together and delivered to my hotel room. There was something about that well-organized news – delivered in old-fashioned print form – that was incredibly calming. A prominently displayed column about Israel by Thomas Friedman gave me more context than a freaked-out social media thread, no matter how smart. While it’s unlikely that we’re going to return to reading a print newspaper as a major news source, the daily pacing and the sensible curation of what’s important has a lot to recommend it.The anti-Trump camp was in disarray. How has No Kings managed to unite it? | Emma BrockesRead moreIn Chris Hayes’s recent book, The Sirens’ Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource, the political commentator identifies what’s going on for all of us – and the dangers. Hayes confessed in aVox interviewthat despite his knowledge about the “attention economy” and its personal costs, he still struggles.“I’ve written a recovery memoir,” Hayes joked that he told his wife, “and I’m still drinking.”The bad news will keep coming. As citizens, we need to know what’s happening so we can act – in the voting booth, at a protest rally, in conversations with our neighbors or loved ones.But that doesn’t mean constant immersion. A little of the gloomcycle goes a long way.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionSmartphonesDigital mediaSocial mediaUS politicsMental healthMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

Of a bunch of white settlers enjoying pink gins on the terrace, she writes, “the glasses made a tinkle that was not of the substance of glass, but of bottles wrapped in tissue paper. Sometimes, for a moment, a shriek or a cackle would hang torpidly in space, but these were unreal sounds as if projected from a distant country.”This week, much of Britain enjoyed an unbroken run of 30C days and we were all yanked back to that distant country – the one in which we sat in hot classrooms clad head to toe in polyester, wilting to LP Hartley’s The Go-Between. “In the heat,” wrote Hartley, “the commonest objects changed their nature,” and no matter how many summers we’ve been through, this fact seems to surprise every time.What struck me this week as temperatures soared was how particular each heatwave is to its locality. In New York, summer comes with light as harsh and unshaded as fluorescent strip lighting and the sky is an angry blue. In the southern hemisphere, where the sun is at its strongest, you can walk down the street and feel the heat on your back like a hand, pushing. In Britain, however, the country remains pale and watery in even the hottest weather, an apparent mildness of light and sky that somehow makes the trees seem more green, the effect of high temperatures more surreal and the people, after three consecutive days of hot weather, inclined to completely lose our minds.TuesdayThe English dream is not of nice weather but of any weather that provides a pretext to talk about it. This week, on top of the thrill of the heatwave, the Met Office gave the nation more fuel for its pastime with a warning that in the current climate, the chances of Britain experiencing 45C heat in the next 12 years have risen to 50/50. (In 2022, temperatures hit 40C for the first time on record.)You could talk about the terrible consequences of this, or the failures to date of world leaders to staunch global heating, but really what most of us wanted to do was to say “45 degrees!” and pull a series of cor-blimey faces. There was more: in what pushes us close, surely, to a record-breaking week in opportunities for weather chat in this country, the Met Office went on to issue aninvitationto the public to come up with suggestions for storm names for the 2025/26 season.Last year, you may recall, Storm Bert wreaked havoc on the west coast, and there was also Storm Darragh and a series of storm backup names, such as Storm Conall, Mavis and Tilly. But precedent won’t help us here. Opening up submissions to the public this year is a terrible idea given how hilarious everyone in this country finds themselves and we all know how this ends: with Storm Stormy McStormface and Storm Stormzy.WednesdayCommentary around the joint appearance of Donald Trump andKeir Starmerin Canada this week focused on the dismaying optics of our prime minister scrabbling about on the ground to pick up papers the more powerful leader had dropped. What better illustration of the literal grovelling required to get on the American president’s good side?It was a little mortifying to watch, I agree. But when you stop to think about it, what strikes me about this vignette from the G7 is Starmer’s entirely normal human instinct, when someone standing beside you drops their papers, to bend to the floor to help pick them up. It’s not Starmer’s subservience that stands out in this scene, but Trump’s psychopathy as he stands there like a boulder, not helping to clear up his own mess.Of course it was only about the fourth weirdest thing the American president did this week, as he continues to extemporise and jazz-hand his way to the brink of war with Iran. A clear winner was the message Trump put out on Truth Social about Iran’s leader: “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding … We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.” A thoughtful clarification, here, for Trump’s slowest followers, that “take out” in this context doesn’t indicate the president’s desire to buy the Ayatollah dinner.View image in fullscreen‘Mr President, this is what we call a small act of human kindness.’Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/APThursdayWoo, ahatchet jobof a superstar novelist beloved by everyone in Gen Z and above! If you are someone who takes an interest in other people’s bad reviews, you will probably already have received, from multiple sources, a link to Tom Crewe’s amazingly unequivocal takedown of Ocean Vuong in this week’s London Review of Books.“I groaned my way through The Emperor of Gladness,” writes Crewe of Vuong’s new novel, a prequel to his million-selling debut On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous and an Oprah Book Club pick that is selling very briskly. “I writhed. I felt real despair every time I forced myself to open the covers. It was one of the worst ordeals of my reading life.” He went on: “This is because, while it is bad in all the ways that On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeouswas bad, it is also bad in new and unexpected ways.”For example, wrote Crewe, this novel, “has a much higher proportion of dialogue, for which Vuong has no talent. It tries, and fails, to be funny.”It is also, he writes, “inordinately long and almost entirely filler”. I haven’t read the new book, but I thoroughly enjoyed Vuong’s debut and disagree with much of this 5,000 word review. Although not enough, of course, to undermine the pleasure of reading an example of a critic telling us what he really thinks.FridayLet’s end the week in a happy place, with theweddingof Alex Soros, one of the five children of billionaire George Soros, and Huma Abedin, former political aide to Hillary Clinton whose wretched ex-husband, Anthony Weiner, arguably bears a greater responsibility for putting Trump in the White House than any other individual. (It was Weiner sending crotch photos to young women that, in a series of unlikely events, delivered a hard drive with Hillary’s emails to the FBI boss, James Comey).But after all, here’s a fairytale ending – or, depending on your view, the kind of nightmare that wakes you up at 2am in a cold sweat: you are getting married in a huge tent in the Hamptons in the presence of 500 people including Kamala Harris, Anna Wintour, Hillary Clinton and – the icing on it – Jimmy Fallon, who will be making some jokes.

Liberal cities have become targets for politicians looking to stir up their voters elsewhereFri 20 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTShareFromLos Angelesto London, Istanbul to Warsaw, cities are making rightwing populists angry. Their liberal elites, immigrants, net zero policies, leftwing activists, globalised businesses, expensive transport infrastructure and outspoken municipal leaders – all are provocations to populist politicians whose support often comes from more conservative, less privileged places.Three years ago the founders of national conservatism, the transatlantic ideology on which much of modern rightwing populism is based, published a statement of principles. One of these, surprisingly little noticed at the time,declaredwith some menace: “In those [places] in which law and justice have been manifestly corrupted, or in which lawlessness, immorality, and dissolution reign, national government must intervene energetically to restore order.”This month, Donald Trump’s administration identified the first American city – and almost certainly not the last – tomeet these ominously broad criteria. “Los Angeles has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens,” he said. It was “a city of criminals” and “socialists”, said his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. “Mob violence” was so disrupting the work of the federal government there, claimed his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that an “insurrection” was under way. Trump promised: “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean and safe again.”That this “liberation” involved an ongoing, expanding and legally contentious military occupation – almost unprecedented in American history – is one indicator of how deep the populist animosity towards liberal cities and their leaders runs. Another is therecent imprisonmentof the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu, a challenger to the authoritarian Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for the Turkish presidency. Another is the level of security required for London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, which is similar to that for Keir Starmer and King Charles.The death threats, public abuse and state aggression endured by such municipal figures in supposedly free democracies – along with slightly more subtle anti-urban interventions, such as Nigel Farage’scomplaintin 2014 that he could not “hear English” on an inner London train – reveal much about rightwing populism, its anxieties and fundamental values. Cities are where the future often starts, and populism is often about holding on to the past.While conservative populism reveres, or says it reveres, the nation state, the countryside, community, social continuity and the traditional family, cities are often places of more fluid loyalties. While populism presents politics as a simple battle between “the people” and their enemies, cities, by gathering so many interest groups in one place, show that politics is in fact a more complex process: involving competition but also cooperation, contests over space and resources, and many social forces, including class, gender, sexuality, local pride and race.More enraging and disorienting still for conservative populists, over the past 30 years many big cities have changed. Trump acknowledges this bydescribingLos Angeles as “once great”. As Mike Davis laid out in hispioneering historiesof the city, for most of the 20th century Los Angeles was, behind its laid-back image, a highly conservative place: racially segregated, repressively policed, ruled by Republican mayors as much as Democrats. Immigration, radical activism, more progressive administrations and liberal gentrification gradually altered the city so that now, while still often shaped by inequalities, it is a stronghold of the centre left.A similar shift has happened since the 1990s in Paris,Londonand many other European and North American cities. For the right, the loss of these prestigious places has been a bitter defeat – hence their insistence that they have been ruined by liberals and the left. Khan’s centrist mayoralty in London has used its very limited powers to provide free meals for primary schoolchildren and give the capital cleaner air, yet is routinely described by the rightwing press as a dogmatic and disastrous experiment.Such caricatures of cities and their government are all the more unconvincing because they ignore the political complexity of these places. Forty percent of Londonersvoted for Brexit, and many of the city’s immigrants are social conservatives. Some of its supposedly most rigid leftwing areas have, or have had, well-known rightwingers as residents: Boris Johnson and Paul Dacre, the ferociously illiberal former Daily Mail editor, used to live in Islington, north London. Dominic Cummings still does. At a Turkish greengrocer in the borough, I sometimes see the Tory MP Nick Timothy – who recently told the House of Commons: “Diversity is not our strength: it is a very serious and difficult challenge” – queueing seemingly quite happily as the shop hums with different languages, before returning to his home in the even more diverse borough of Hackney.For all the aspects of city life that infuriate those on the right, there are others you might expect to please them: the emphasis on work, the entrepreneurialism, huge importance of property and endless hierarchies. These priorities and divides could push cities back to the right. In the 1980s, much of London elected Tory MPs. Paris had a conservative mayor, Jacques Chirac, from 1977 to 1995.Yet a return to urban conservatism feels less likely with the right in populist mode. As the Economist magazine – not usually an ally of the municipal left – recently pointed out, city government needs “pragmatic politicos who keep … the roads free of potholes … [and] buses running on time”. The broad-brush, administratively chaotic politics of Trump, Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives don’t seem well suited to such tasks.Perhaps that doesn’t matter to the populists. They can go on attacking cities, in order to stir up their voters elsewhere, without actually having to run them. Meanwhile, liberal and leftwing municipal politicians keep key economic and tourism hubs functional, leaving populist national politicians such as Trump free to promote less practical policies. He may hate contemporary Los Angeles and California, but the state’s economyrecently overtookJapan’s to become the world’s fourth largest – helpful for a president whose own economic plan is misfiring.Yet the urban resistance to rightwing populism shouldn’t be written off as just playing into the enemy’s hands, as some political pessimists have done during the protests in Los Angeles. Whether on the street or from a grand mayoral office, defying today’s intolerant, reactionary populists has a value – as an act in itself and as an encouragement to others. City life can be grim and disappointing. But one of its virtues is that while trends come and go fast, rebellions are rarely forgotten.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionLos AngelesLondonDonald TrumpFar right (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Is it about to repeat it in Iran?Stephen WertheimIf the United States joins Israel’s fight to try to finish Israel’s job, it will enter into a war of unknowable scope against a country of 90 million peopleFri 20 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 12.05 EDTShareTwo decades ago, as Americans debated whether their country should invade Iraq, one question loomed the largest: did Saddam Hussein possess weapons of mass destruction? If so, the implication was that the United States should disarm and overthrow his regime by military force. If not, Washington could keep that option in reserve and continue to contain Saddam through economic sanctions and routine bombings.In time, the implications of the Iraq war far exceeded the boundaries of the original debate. Saddam, it turned out, had no weapons of mass destruction. But suppose he had possessed the chemical and biological agents that the war’s advocates claimed. Invading his country to destroy his regime would have given him the greatest possible incentive to use the worst weapons at his disposal. The war would have been just as mistaken – more so, in fact.For the same reason, the matter of WMD hardly explains the war’s genesis or its ultimate consequences. The advocates of invasion, it is true, didn’t want Saddam to build his supposed arsenal and potentially go nuclear. More important, however, theysaw an opportunityto assert America’s dominance on the global stage after the country was struck on 9/11. They wanted to remake the Middle East and demonstrate American power. That they did, just not as they hoped.Today the United States government, under President Donald Trump, is again weighing whether to use military force against a Middle Eastern country that was not preparing to attack the United States. This time the decisive question is supposed to be whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon and reaching some ill-defined point of no return. If you answer yes, you therefore favor US strikes on Iranian enrichment facilities and possibly much else. After all, the United States has long maintained that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, and if that goal cannot be achieved by diplomacy – even if America’s ally Israel may have spoiled that diplomacy – it must be attempted by force.The American public should resist such thinking, which does not make sense. Iran, according to US intelligence, was not on the verge of producing a useable nuclear device. It was giving itself that option, producing highly enriched uranium, but had not yet decided to obtain a weapon, much less undertaken the additional steps needed to construct one. For the past two months, Iran had been in diplomatic negotiations with the Trump administration, and both sides appeared to be getting closer to a deal that would drastically curtail Tehran’s enrichment of uranium and prevent any path to the bomb.Then Israel attacked. It acted less to pre-empt an Iranian bomb than to preempt American diplomacy. A new nuclear deal would have lifted sanctions on Iran’s battered economy, helping it to recover and grow. A deal would have stabilized Iran’s position in the Middle East and potentially strengthened it over time. Precisely by succeeding in preventing Iran from going nuclear, a deal would have advanced Iran’s integration into the region, accelerating the wary rapprochement Tehran had achieved with its historic rival, Saudi Arabia, over the past two years.The specific deal under discussion, which envisaged bringing Iran into a regional consortium to enrich uranium, would have kick-started the process. From there, who knows: perhaps the United States might normalize relations with Iran and, having rid itself of its main regional enemy, finally act on the desire of successive bipartisan presidents, Trump included, to pull back from the Middle East.This was the outcome that would have best served the interests of the United States. This was the outcome Israel acted to prevent. To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a formidable, normalized, and non-nuclear Iran was the threat that mattered most. Attacking Iran, by contrast, presented an opportunity – to cripple and perhaps even overthrow the Islamic Republic, whose best air defenses Israel had disabled the previous year, after Iran’s strongest regional allies in Lebanon and Syria crumbled in spectacular fashion. Israel does not know, because no one can, what kind of Iran will emerge from the wreckage: whether it will be more aggrieved or less, nuclear armed or not, a functioning state or a cauldron of chaos. Netanyahu took a gamble nonetheless, figuring the United States would finish his job, clean up his mess, or both.Even if Iran were speeding toward a nuclear weapon, even if diplomacy had been exhausted, the threat of a nuclear Iran should not be inflated. Suppose for a moment that Iran went nuclear, which it may well do now that the absence of such a deterrent left it vulnerable to attack. If Iran got the bomb, the United States, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Israel, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Iran would go nuclear to ensure the survival of its regime. Firing nuclear weapons at Israel would assure Iran’s destruction. Iran is unlikely to do that.Make no mistake: for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons is entirely undesirable. It could trigger the further spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and beyond. Iran could resume its destabilizing and destructive activities, targeting US interests and allies, assured that no one would dare to strike at the regime. The United States has rightly invested considerable effort, over decades, to prevent an Iranian bomb. But is that objective worth war?Ourwar?Thiswar?If the United States joins Israel’s fight to try to finish Israel’s job, it will enter into a war of unknowable scope against a country of 90 million people in a region of marginal strategic significance. Iran may well retaliate against Americans, triggering a large-scale, open-ended conflict. In the absolute best-case scenario, the war would quickly end in an Iranian capitulation so complete that Israel would be content to stop shooting. What then?Iranians won’t forget being attacked. Israelis won’t trust the country they attacked but left intact. And Americans will see that no matter whom they elect – even on the slogan of “America first” – their leaders refuse to take control of events and act on the national imperative to leave Middle East wars behind and focus instead on the great many unsolved and worsening problems that will actually decide America’s fate.If, on the other hand, the United States steps back from the brink, it will open up new possibilities. Of valuing the well-being of Americans over the hatred of distant demons. Of no longer living in permanent, insatiable fear. Of getting out of the position from which a rogue ally can obstruct America’s efforts, determine its national agenda, and damage its civic life.Those are the possibilities worth fighting for.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

In aspeechthis week to an Institute for Government conference marking the 30th anniversary of theNolan reporton standards in public life, the former prime minister went straight to the heart of the matter. “For many decades,” he said, “Britain enjoyed a global reputation for being free of corruption and bad practice. That is less true today. It is in our national interest to regain that reputation.”That is indisputably true. But it is not just the global reputation that matters. It is also, at least as significantly, the domestic one. Trust in British public life has diminished, is diminishing and urgently needs to be rebuilt. Confidence in politics and government to change lives is draining away.As Sir John said, the trend needs to be reversed before the damage is “beyond salvage”. That point may, indeed, have been reached already.This is an issue that transcends political parties. So there is no enduring virtue in pointing out thatthe Nolan committeehad to be set up by Sir John precisely because of the Conservative sleaze scandals of the 1990s, the decade of David Mellor and Jonathan Aitken. Or in pointing out that most of the reputational damage highlighted in his speech was committed in more recent Tory years, under the shameful premiership of Boris Johnson in particular.All of that is true. ButLabourgovernments have not been without sins of their own – some of them serious – either in the past or more recently. It does public life no favours at all to turn this into a partisan issue. Both major parties (and smaller parties too) like to pretend that they alone are virtuous and that all blame rests with the others. But that is not true.There is a real danger that the Starmer government and the Labour party are giving way to this self-deceit. Since they, they tell themselves, are good people trying to do good things, the system is safe and trust will be restored. That is not true either. It is the system that is at risk, and which needs to be rebuilt and safeguarded. The clock is ticking.The Nolan report’s seven principles for public life – selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – provide a rock on which to rebuild. But, as Sir John’s speech underlines, the increasingly extensive network of ethical supervision, advice and enforcement within parliament and government is complex, fragmented, uneven and sometimes ineffective.Labour’s2024 manifestopromised some reforms, including the creation of an independent ethics and integrity commission across government. Yet the manifesto remained unclear on key points. These included whether the enforcement processes would be statutory, and whether the commission would replace the network of existing machinery or be grafted on to them in some way.A year on from Labour’s election victory, the plan is still no clearer. The government seems to be stalling on the commission and is considering a more “principles-based” approach to regulation. Sir John thinks “stiffening up” Nolan is the key. But both approaches risk reinventing an only slightly better version of the “good chaps” system of regulation that broke down so badly under Mr Johnson. That is simply not good enough. Merely tweaking the system risks leaving it a scandal away from a fresh outbreak of public contempt for politics that can only help Nigel Farage.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was the UK’s warmest springon recordand its driest in more than 50 years.Communicating the urgency of our predicament without provoking despair and hopelessness is an intractable challenge, especially when it comes to children. But two trail-blazing theatre experiences are bringing the breakdown of the natural world into urban metropolises, and raising the alarm with such immediacy that even those of us fortunate enough to live in places that have so far been relatively unaffected by the climate crisis must pay attention.Our Story WithDavid Attenboroughis a breathtaking 50-minute immersive history of the planet, from the team behind the recent filmOcean. Thanks to 24 projectors and 50 speakers, the Natural History Museum’s Jerwood Gallery is transformed into the solar system, prehistoric caves, the ocean and the jungle. As in Maurice Sendak’s children’s classic Where the Wild Things Are, “the walls [become] the world all around”. We swim with whales and come face to face with gorillas – as Sir David did in Life on Earth in 1979. We look from space: like last year’s Booker prize-winning novel,Orbital, by Samantha Harvey, Our Story inspires the feelings of awe and protectiveness towards our planet that astronauts call “the overview effect”.In the past, Sir David has beenaccusedof not speaking out strongly enough on human-made ecological disaster. But the Guardian writer George Monbiot, once one of his fiercestcritics, described Ocean, released forSir David’s 99th birthdaythis year, as the film“I’ve been waiting for all my working life”. In Our Story, we journey through mass extinctions of the past and, speculatively, in the future. Without change, “the prospect for the generations that follow is grim”, the audience is warned.Next Friday, hundreds of lifesize elephants, giraffes, gazelles and animal puppets of all kinds will stampede through London’s streets on their 20,000km journey from central Africa to the Arctic Circle.The Herdsis the follow-up project toThe Walk. In 2021, a 12-foot puppet girl, Little Amal, travelled from the Turkey-Syria border to London, to raise awareness of the refugee crisis. Little Amal reached 2 million people in 17 countries. Now her creators hope to do the same for the climate emergency. As the herd fleesnorth, it will be joined by puppets of native species from each country it visits. Manchester is its next destination, before continuing on to Scandinavia.The project’s artistic director, Amir Nizar Zuabi, has acknowledged that all such endeavours, however ambitious, are just“water dripping on a stone”. But, as he says, over time enough drips can reshape a stone.These are visceral, sensory immersions. Like Olafur Eliasson’s climate art installationThe Weather Projectat Tate Modern in 2003, such spectaculars invite us to reflect together – they are collective experiences. This is the theatre of the Anthropocene: vast, cataclysmic, beautiful and yet ultimately hopeful as well. They help us visualise what a different world might look like – if only politicians and corporations were made to act. The next chapter is up to us. As Sir David says at the end of Our Story, we must work towards a time when Earth becomes a planet “with not only an intelligent species, but a wise one too”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The watchdog has the power to fine a company up to 1% of turnover if it is found to have broken the groceries code.The adjudicator, Mark White, said: “Delays in payment can significantly harm suppliers. The alleged delays could expose Amazon suppliers to excessive risk and unexpected costs, potentially affecting their ability to invest and innovate.”The company sells groceries in the UK through its Amazon Fresh branded stores and online retail operation, as well the Whole Foods chain, which itbought in 2017 for $13.7bn(£10.2bn).Suppliers raisedmore issues with Amazon than with other retailers, according to a survey for the GCA carried out in 2024.After the warning to Amazon last July, the GCA said it had monitored the retailer’s actions and heard detailed evidence about suppliers’ experiences.The GCA said on Friday it had grounds to suspect Amazon had breached paragraph 5 of the groceries code between 1 March 2022 and 20 June 2025, but would focus its investigations on the period from the start of 2024 to gain the best understanding of Amazon’s current practices.The watchdog is calling on suppliers to send in evidence by 8 August. It added that all responses would remain confidential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are they like that?Read moreThis shifting network, the researchers said, became more stable as the academic year went on.FeldmanHall said it is not clear what made people influential early in the study, but the students who rose to become the most influential by the end were those who had early insights about how all their peers were connected.“To become influential, you need to know who is friends with whom, and you need to have a bird’s eye view of how people cluster into different social groups or cliques,” said Aslarus.Individuals, she said, can use that knowledge to become more influential – for example by making new friendships or being an effective matchmaker.Aslarus added that it is only after becoming influential that people develop more detailed knowledge about individual friendships.“Knowing about your network predicts becoming influential over time, more so than just having lots of friends,” she said.“So, social knowledge seems to be a key first step toward becoming better-connected in your network.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mobilityStudentsHigher educationFriendshipSocial etiquettenewsShareReuse this content"

While it is impossible to say for sure what the challenger’s motives are in this case, the James Bond trademark portfolio and its legacy value does make it an enticing target for opportunists, and further cancellation attempts can’t be ruled out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spinoffs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould steer the next Bond film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named.Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.

Anyone using more than 20 cubic metres a day needs a licence from theEnvironment Agencyor Natural Resources Wales, setting limits on how much water they can take. Similar rules apply in Scotland.River abstraction now accounts for 61% of all water taken from the environment, up from under 40% at the turn of the century. Groundwater use has also risen sharply, up 53% since 2018. Meanwhile, use of tidal water has plummeted, falling from almost half of total abstraction to just over a quarter.“Our rivers are under threat,” said Nick Measham, the chief executive of the conservation charityWildFish. “We are putting extra demands on water resources when the rivers are running dry. When it does rain after persistent dry periods, we often return our water polluted, which means that river habitats for animals and plants are in serious trouble.”Some of the increases are the result of existing activities being licensed for the first time. Some water use is classed as non-consumptive because it is returned shortly after, such as in navigation, hydropower or power station cooling, but campaigners say this is not harmless as water is lost in the process, and what is returned is often polluted.The maximum volume of water licensed to be taken from rivers and lakes has increased by 6% over the past decade, from 25.5bn to 27bn cubic metres. Meanwhile, caps on groundwater and tidal abstraction have fallen 4% and 42% respectively since 2013.View image in fullscreenThe Environment Agencyhas faced legal actionover water abstraction for farming at Catfield Fen in Norfolk.Photograph: Si Barber/The GuardianThe Environment Agency, which issues the licences, has long warned that without intervention an extra 5bn litres a day will be needed for public water supply by 2055, plus another 1bn litres for industry and farming.Initially, 80% of this shortfall will need to be made up by making people use less and by fixing leaks – water companies still lose about 19% of the water they supply, or roughly 3bn litres a day, through leaky pipes.Experts say this could have been avoided if investment in new infrastructure had come sooner. “We should have been building reservoirs 10 years ago,” said one industry source, blaming successive governments for “a lack of appetite” for it.Due to the lack of storage, during droughts water companies plan to draw even more water from rivers – precisely when they are most vulnerable.Measham said: “There has been a woeful lack of forward thinking to cope with demand. Depleted and polluted, rivers that were once abundant in fish, invertebrates, mammals and birds turn into a line of fetid pools that eventually dry out completely.”On theRiver Itchen, the impact is already showing. In 2022 and 2024, returning adult salmon numbers hit the lowest and third lowest levels ever recorded – just 133 and 187 fish respectively. If another drought hits, the river and its endangered salmon could be pushed to the edge.“The cost is to the rivers, they are paying the price, and fish are paying the price,” said WildFish’s Janina Gray.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If another drought hits, the river’s endangered salmon could be pushed to the edge.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe water sector is clear about the urgency of the problem. A Water UK spokesperson said: “The threat to our water security is not a distant risk, it’s a looming challenge. After not building a single reservoir in over 30 years, we’ve finally been given initial approval for 10, plus seven water recycling schemes.These projectswill help reduce pressure on abstraction.”Some parts of the country are seeing extreme increases in water use. In the Midlands, abstraction has soared 132% in a decade, from 1.6bn to 3.6bn cubic metres, now rivalling that in the north-west. Meanwhile, the southern region has seen a 26% drop. InWales, Powys alone holds 42% of all authorised abstraction volumes, with water supply and energy as the main drivers. Conwy, Ceredigion and Gwynedd follow.The Environment Agency says about 15% of rivers and lakes and 27% of groundwater bodies have abstraction rates that damage the environment and that by the 2050s summer river flows in England could fall by up to 33%.An Environment Agency spokesperson said the nation’s water resources were “under huge and steadily increasing pressure”. They said: By harnessing the latest technology and intelligence, upgrades to the licensing system will allow us to focus inspections on the highest-risk abstractions and provide real-time information to water users.“New powers under theWaterSpecial Measures Act mean we can enforce licensing more effectively and ensure water companies are held accountable when they fall short of expected standards.”This week the government published its national framework for water resources, in which it set out plans for reform. A Defra spokesperson said: “Rapid population growth, crumbling infrastructure and climate change mean we need a major water overhaul. The government has secured £104bn in private investment for nine new reservoirs and new pipes, and is modernising the abstraction system to protect the environment.”Explore more on these topicsRiversWaterFishEnvironment AgencyEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The state has separately stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be able to sold there by 2035.Although states are typically not allowed to set their own standards aside from the federal Clean Air Act, California has been given unique authority to do so via a waiver that has seen it become a pioneer in pushing for cleaner cars. Other states are allowed to copy California’s stricter standard, too.But oil and gas companies, as well as Republican politicians, have complained about the waiver, arguing that it caused financial harm. The waiver was removed during Donald Trump’s first term but then reinstated by Joe Biden’s administration.Last week, Trump again moved to end the waiver,signinga congressional disapproval of California’s move to cut pollution and shift new cars and trucks to become electric over the next decade. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor and a Democrat, who is in a hugehead-to-head battlewith the White House over theLos Angeles protestsand state power, amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, has called this move illegal and has said the state will sue.The justices’ ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit by a ValeroEnergysubsidiary and fuel industry groups.The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 EPA decision to let California set its own regulations.“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the decision.The lower court had previously ruled that the oil and gas industry didn’t have legal standing to attempt to topple the California waiver but a challenge to this reached the supreme court, which appeared sympathetic to the claim when the case was heard in April. “It’s not that high a burden,” Amy Coney Barrett, one of the justices, said about proof of the alleged harm.California and the federal government have been allowed to “stretch and abuse” the Clean Air Act, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the groups challenging the waiver, has complained.But environmentalists and California’s Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it has helped push forward vehicle innovation and help cut greenhouse gases. Transportation is responsible for more planet-heating pollution in the US than any other sector.“California and other clean car states cannot achieve federal clean air standards and protect communities without reducing harmful transportation pollution,” said Andrea Issod, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. “We stand with these states to defend their well-established authority to set standards for clean cars.”The supreme court’s ruling on Friday does not in itself end California’s standards to cut pollution from vehicles, said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.“The standards have saved hundreds of lives, have provided enormous health benefits, and have saved families money,” Patton said.“While the supreme court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court, the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does it alter the life-saving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaDemocracy and justiceWest CoastPollutionFossil fuelsEnergyUS supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

We hope that now Shell will stop these shenanigans and sit down with us to sort this out. People in Ogale are dying; Shell need to bring a remedy. We thank the judicial system of the UK for this judgment.”A Shell spokesperson said that the company also welcomed the judgment. They said: “For many years, the vast majority of spills in the Niger Delta have been caused by third parties acting unlawfully, such as oil thieves who drill holes in pipelines or saboteurs.“This criminality is the cause of the majority of spills in the Bille and Ogale claims, and we maintain that Shell is not liable for the criminal acts of third parties or illegal refining. These challenges are managed by a joint-venture, which Shell’s former subsidiary operated, using its expertise in spill response and clean-up.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNigeriaOil (Environment)ShellOil and gas companiesOil (Business)AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Just 2,000 pairs are left, a decline of 98% since the 1970s. This is because their habitats in scrubby areas have been destroyed and thousands areshot on their migratory routeacross Europe.But their distinctive purr can now be heard on estates in Somerset, Exeter, Suffolk, Lincolnshire and Norfolk as an audacious plan to breed and release hundreds of birds gets off the ground.King Charles has become involved by allowing theTurtle Dove Trustto build an aviary onhis Sandringham estate. He can enjoy the sight of 200 birds when he visits because he is using his land as a breeding ground. The estate says the land is ideal because its coppices, meadows, ponds and waterways are a suitable habitat for the birds as well as rich in food.Ben Goldsmith, a conservationist and financier, has been working with the trust to release 200 birds on his Somerset farm this year.“Where I am in Somerset, no turtle doves have been seen in living memory,” Goldsmith said. “None of my neighbours ever remember seeing turtle doves there. Now, all of our oak trees seem to have a pair of turtle doves purring away. It makes me supremely happy. It’s as if this sound was designed to calm the human soul.”He obtained his doves from Trevor and Deborah Lay, who for years ran a breeding business, selling swans, cranes and other birds across Europe. However, bird flu and Brexit meant they had to shut this down because it became impossible for them to export. Instead, the couple have been using their skills to breed hundreds of turtle doves for the trust at their Suffolk base.Last year, they reared 800 young doves, most of which have been given out to aviaries across the country.Trevor Lay thinks the birds migrate to Africa and back and this year has a chance to prove it: “This year we fixed trackers on 20 birds so that hopefully this autumn we will be able to see the birds flying, migrating. They are nesting locally too. They have spread out around the area and we have had a lot of sightings reported of our birds on our website.”Because of their rapid decline, Lay believes it is imperative to breed and release the birds now, before they vanish from the English countryside completely: “Farmers have been improving their land for turtle doves in the last decade, planting wildflowers and hedges. We are putting them back so everybody can see, hear and enjoy them again sooner and hopefully in their lifetimes and not in 50 or 100 years. We wanted to put something back.“They are lovely little birds – they are beautiful – and this is something we can do to help them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They always move in pairs and take every opportunity to kiss and preen each other. I knew they were a symbol of love but now I really know why.”He wants everyone to be able to experience this wonder: “Now I realise what we have lost – it’s a birthright that’s been robbed from us. I can’t believe I’d never heard them before and this was the sound our ancestors heard as the sound of summer in England. The bird is on the brink of disappearing so we need to roll the dice and have a go, and just get on and do it and release them.”Lay agreed: “We have the advantage of doing it on a shoestring and getting on with it and not having to spend decades doing feasibility schemes like some larger nature organisations have to. The environment is so much better than it was 10, 20 years ago because of what farmers have been doing to improve their land for wildlife and nature. So we are putting that nature back.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsEnglandWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

WhileEnglish Heritage, which manages the siteand offers controlled, free “open access” to the stones for the solstice, said people would need to use an app to pay for parking.There is a poignancy, too, as it is 40 years since the Battle of the Beanfield, the notorious clash between police and new age travellers. Four decades on, there are stillcalls for an inquiry into the actions of Wiltshire policeas they halted a free solstice festival at Stonehenge.Some still feel the anguish of the experience and do not like the way the “open access” is policed and limited.Alan Lodge, who was there that day, said: “They want to putStonehengein a glass case but they wouldn’t do that with Salisbury Cathedral.

Now, 17 years after Beryl Cook’s death, her home city ofPlymouthwill this week announce a major exhibition that will include previously unseen works as well as much-loved humorous paintings with larger-than-life characters.Cook was chronically shy and avoided her exhibition openings – and would probably have stayed away from the show atThe Boxfrom January 2026.Spanning her entire career, it will feature loans from private and public owners, including her family. It will explore her significance in portraying “ordinary people enjoying themselves”, with both comedy and compassion.Among the paintings that have not been publicly exhibited before is Bingo, in which a woman in a bingo hall has just won a game, raising her hand in glee as a nearby woman gives her a classic Cook side-eye.It was acquired last year by The Box, whose collections include a film and television archive, on which its curator, Terah Walkup, has drawn, linking Cook’s images to actual places.She has, for example, identified the Plymouth bingo hall and the exact moment of inspiration for Bingo: “It was from a news clip on local television about the popularity of bingo. In one scene, a woman throws her hands up in the air celebrating a winning card, while women behind her cast a side-eye …“Beryl had a notoriously photographic memory, so it could have been that she remembered this particular scene or seeing it on the local television. It changes the way that we might think about this classic humorous work.“This particular film clip wasn’t just about bingo halls. It was actually about the sociability of older women. It was about how women found space in order to meet each other, socialise, spend money and have a sense of independence in the 1980s.”View image in fullscreenBeryl Cook in 1979.Photograph: Chris Capstick/ShutterstockThe artist had in fact worried that her caricatures would offend the real-life people who had inspired them, according to her daughter-in-law, who in the early 1970s lived in the basement of Cook’s modest terrace house on the Hoe.Teresa Cook told the Guardian: “She did worry to start with.

People can recognise themselves or they feel they’ve seen somebody that looks like that … Beryl realised that there was no offence in the art and people were genuinely so happy to see her art.”Sophie Cook, the artist’s granddaughter, said that because the caricatures were never cruel, “people loved being in the paintings.”Recalling an earlier exhibition, she said: “The major comment from every staff member was the laughter that everyone could hear … You can be having a bad day, you go and have a look at a Beryl Cook exhibition and I guarantee your day just got better.”View image in fullscreenThe Lockyer Tavern (c 1974), a painting of a bar in Plymouth.Photograph: John Cook/Beryl CookShe spoke of a new fanbase for Cook’s art, that the family receives correspondence from people – particularly young people – who love it.The family hopes it is only a matter of time before the Tate shows her properly.

What an earthy response to a gallery visit … She was, I thought, a genuine artist of our time.”Teresa Cook said: “She did a few paintings of me, and I loved them all.”They include Elvira’s Café, about which Cook once said: “This is a picture of my son and daughter-in-law’s cafe, in which they serve sausage sandwiches, amongst other things … Here you see one about to be tackled by the lady in front, with Teresa enjoying the view she had of one of the many handsome marines who frequent the cafe, for they are stationed in barracks just around the corner. In the summer they sometimes arrive in sporting gear, like this vest and tiny shorts.”Walkup noted that the Tate had been supportive of this exhibition: “This is the most extensive exhibition of Beryl Cook’s work to date, a landmark show.“It’s all about recasting Beryl’s career and showing that she’s quite radical, particularly to do with identity and representation. Beryl was painting those who have been overlooked by society.”The exhibition draws on Cook’s previously unpublished letters. In one, she wrote: “Instead of doing housework, I go upstairs and start painting.”Explore more on these topicsPlymouthPaintingArtnewsShareReuse this content"

About 13 high-risk types of HPV are known to cause 99.7% of cervical cancers.Each year, about 3,200 women in the UK are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 850 die from it. It is the 14th most common cancer affecting women in Britain, with women aged 30 to 34 most likely to receive a diagnosis. Last year, NHS Englandpledged to wipe out cervical cancer by 2040.Globally, it is the fourth most common cancer in women, with about 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths every year, according to the WorldHealthOrganization.The disease develops when abnormal cells appear in the lining of the cervix and grow, eventually coming together as a tumour. If the cells are not caught early, the cancer can spread to other parts of the body.In June, NHS England said that women aged between 25 and 49 who test negative for HPV, meaning they are at very low risk of cervical cancer over the next 10 years, will safely be invited at five-year intervals instead of three.Fiona Osgun, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said the declining rates were due to a combination of factors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This coincides with the state visit to London of Emmanuel Macron, the French president.Over the past few days, French police have waded into the sea to stop asylum seekers from boarding boats, increasing speculation that police are already using the tactic.In one incident this week at Gravelines beach near Dunkirk, officers were shown waist-deep in water, using CS gas, riot shields and batons, as they attempted to force a boat to return to the beach.Dos Santos said the French plan to harden its tactics against asylum-seekers and smugglers would result in more deaths.“When police enter the sea, it will cause more deaths, more people will drown as they try to get away before being caught and forced back to the beach. There will be more violence, as some people fight back, and the people attempting to reach England will find other ways to try to get to the UK. This will not stop them, but it will make the crossings much more dangerous,” he said.The scheme is intended to give the French authorities the power to halt dinghies that “taxi” up to beaches from nearby waterways. Until now, guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water.Dos Santos said the tactic would face legal challenges in the European courts, with lawyers examining human rights laws and the UN convention on the law of the sea.“This policy will be taken to the European courts. We will look very closely at this, as will other organisations,” he said.A British charity that operates inFrancetold the Guardian two weeks ago it planed to explore possible legal challenges to stop the tactic.Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: “When the last Tory government tried to do pushbacks in the Channel, Care4Calais initiated a legal challenge and won. Any attempt to introduce interceptions in French waters must face the same level of resistance.”In 2024, 73 people died trying to cross the Channel in small boats, more than in the previous six years combined. Nine people this year have so far been reported dead or missing in the Channel.Nearly 17,000 people have crossed in small boats so far in 2025, according to Home Office figures, higher than at the same point in 2022, the overall record year for crossings. On Wednesday, Downing Street acknowledged that the situation in the Channel was “deteriorating”.The French police union Unity has expressed concern that officers could face legal action if people die during an intervention.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There were women, children and young people among the injured because the people who went to receive the aid … came from all walks of life,” Abu Nasser said.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying either to reach aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a secretive US- and Israel-backed organisation that recently started to hand out food in the territory or, more recently,to offload the limited number of UN and commercial vehicles carrying flour and some other basics.Such reports are difficult to confirm independently but appear corroborated in many details by interviews conducted with witnesses by the Guardian.Khaled al-Ajouri, 33, of the Jabaliya refugee camp, said he had travelled early in the morning in the hope of getting supplies from the aid trucks.“I decided to stay a bit away to protect myself. I convinced myself that I was in a safe area. Suddenly … there were explosions and I was hit in my leg and chest,” Ajouri said.There were also reports of other casualties on Friday in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, with at least 12 people killed in an airstrike on a house belonging to the Ayyash family in the central town of Deir al-Balah.Mohammad al-Mughayyir, the director of medical supply at the civil defence agency in Gaza, told AFP: “Forty-three martyrs have fallen as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip since dawn today, 26 of whom were waiting for humanitarian aid.”Israeli military officialssaid on Fridaythat warplanes had attacked 300 “terror targets” in Gaza during the week, including individual militants, weapons caches and positions used to attack Israeli forces.One of the strikes killed a senior militant in the territory who had helped bury the bodies of two hostages seized during the attack led by Hamas into southern Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, they said.Israeli military officials say troops have fired at “suspects” they claim pose a threat to them.James Elder, a Unicef spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva that he had many testimonials of women and children being injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.“There have been instances where information [was] shared that a [distribution] site is open, but then it’s communicated on social media that they’re closed, but that information was shared when Gaza’s internet was down and people had no access to it,” Elder said.The GHF releases information about opening hours of sites primarily on Facebook, which many in Gaza cannot access.Food has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy. Many shipments have been stopped by ordinary Palestinians in Gaza and offloaded.There is also an acute shortage of fuel, which is needed for pumps on boreholes and Gaza’s sole remaining desalination plant. None has been allowed into Gaza since the collapse of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in March.Elder added: “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water for people in Gaza. Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40% of drinking water production facilities remain functional.”Fuel reserves built up during the pause in the 20-month war are now almost exhausted, aid officials said.Most of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems, reservoirs and pipeshave been destroyed. In March, Israel cut off power supplies to the main desalination plants, a vital source of water for Palestinians in Gaza.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell aid.UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of the war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.On Wednesday, the GHF said it had provided more than 30m meals to the people of Gaza “safely and without incident” since it began operating last month.Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage during the 7 October 2023 attack, of whom they still hold 53.The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached more than 55,600, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Failure to comply could have lead to sanctions including fines or the blocking of the websites.France has gradually introduced requirements this year for all adult websites to have users confirm their age with details such as a credit card or ID document. The aim is toprevent minors from accessing pornography.But the Paris administrative tribunal on Monday suspended a government decree while investigating whether it was compatible with EU legislation. The French government has shared its intention to appeal to the Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court.Aylo said the decree’s suspension was an “opportunity to reconsider more efficient approaches” to age verification. The company argued that this was an ineffective mechanism that exposed people’s data to bad actors, hacks or leaks.“Requiring you to repeatedly provide sensitive personal information creates an unacceptable security risk that we refuse to impose on our users,” the company said in a message displayed on the sites’ homepages earlier this month.About 40% of children in France access porn sites every month, according to a 2024 study by France’s Arcom audiovisual watchdog.In a bid to preserve privacy, the government decree also required operators to offer a third-party “double-blind” option that would prevent the platforms from seeing users’ identifying information.Aylo, which reports seven million visitors in France daily across its various platforms, has called instead for governments to require makers of operating systems such as Apple, Microsoft and Google to verify users’ ages at the level of individual devices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is very serious,” the exiled Nicaraguan writer Gioconda Belli wrote on social media.Neither Ortega nor his government commented on the case.Samcam, who was a political analyst, had spoken out frequently against the government in Managua, which he fled in 2018 to live with his wife in Costa Rica.That year, protests against Ortega’s government were violently repressed, resulting in more than 300 deaths, according to the UN.In January last year, another Nicaraguan opposition activist living in Costa Rica, Joao Maldonado, was shot while driving with his girlfriend in San José. Both were seriously wounded.Former Costa Rican president Luis Guillermo Solís called Samcam’s murder “for his frontal opposition to the Ortega and Murillo dictatorship” an “outrageous and extremely serious act”.“I feel thatDaniel Ortegaand Rosario Murillo are initiating a ‘night of the long knives’ … due to the regime’s weakening,” Dora María Téllez, a former comrade of Ortega turned critic, said from Spain, where she too is in exile.The Night of the Long Knives was a bloody purge of rivals ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in 1934.“They resort to the execution of a retired ex-military officer, who they believe has a voice that resonates within the ranks of the army,” Téllez told the Nicaraguan news outlet 100% Noticias.Ortega, now 79, first served as president from 1985 to 1990 as a former guerrilla hero who had helped oust a brutal US-backed regime.Returning to power in 2007, he became ever more authoritarian, according to observers, jailing hundreds of opponents, real and perceived, in recent years.Ortega’s government has shut down more than 5,000 non-governmental organizations since the 2018 mass protests that he considered a US-backed coup attempt.Thousands of Nicaraguans have fled into exile, and the regime is under US and EU sanctions.Most independent and opposition media operate from abroad.Pro-government media in Nicaragua did not report on Samcam’s killing.Explore more on these topicsCosta RicaNicaraguaDaniel OrtegaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The legislation promised byMark Carney, the prime minister, during the federal election, is meant to strengthen Canada’s economy amid a trade war launched byDonald Trump.The bill removes interprovincial trade barriers and aims to prioritize infrastructure projects, such as energy pipelines and mines deemed to be in the national interest.It is the latter portion of the bill that has caused concern among Indigenous communities over fears the government, granted broad powers, could speed up approvals for infrastructure and energy projects and override protest from Indigenous communities.Ahead of the vote, Carney defended the legislation, which was amended earlier this week to ease concerns from Indigenous leadership.“At the heart of this legislation is… not just respect for, but full embrace of, free, prior and informed consent. It has to be seen in parallel with very major measures that this government is taking to not just support those partnerships, but also to finance equity ownership in these nation-building projects forIndigenous peoples, Indigenous groups, Indigenous rights holders,” said Carney.Under Canadian law, the crown has a “duty to consult” Indigenous communities on projects that could adversely affect them. “Consultation, co-operation, engagement, participation is at the heart of C-5 and that is how you build a nation. And that’s very much how we’ve designed it,” Carney said.While the bill says the government must consult Indigenous communities in cases where their rights are affected by a fast-tracked project, it also allows the Liberal cabinet to overrule pre-existing laws to speed up permits for major projects.The federal legislation comes as provinces also pass bills that speed up infrastructure projects. Ontario plans to create “special economic zones” that would bypass all provincial laws, amid tensions between the premier and First Nations chiefs in areas slated for mining.Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, provoked criticism earlier this week criticized for saying First Nations communities “keep coming hat in hand all the time to the government” for more money. He apologized the following day after meeting with chiefs from the Anishinabek Nation, which represents 39 of Ontario’s 133 First Nations chiefs.“I get pretty passionate. And I just want to say, I sincerely apologize for my words, not only if it hurt all the chiefs in that room, but all First Nations,” said Ford. “I get passionate because I want prosperity for their communities.”Both the federal and provincial legislation reflect the friction between speedy resource and infrastructure development and the need to consult with affected communities that have beenhistorically marginalized, both socially and economically.Earlier this week Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the Assembly of First Nations national chief, warned the federal bill was being “rammed through” parliament.“First Nations are united,” she told CBC News. “They want prosperity, but they don’t want it at the expense of our rights.”Woodhouse Nepinak says she and other leaders across the country want the government to pause the bill for more study. But Carney is eager to pass the bill, fulfilling a campaign promise that his government would eliminate internal trade barriers by 1 July. Indigenous leaders have warned a failure to fully consult on the bill could lead to widespread national protests, akin tothe Idle No More movementin 2012.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyIndigenous peoplesInfrastructurenewsShareReuse this content"

How do you follow up a 50-year-old record that’s hurtling through space?The Golden Record – launched in 1977 on the Voyager space probes – contained everything from Chuck Berry to Chinese dialects and the sound of humpback whales. But what would we put on it today?Tim JonzeFri 20 Jun 2025 06.27 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.53 EDTShareIt’s almost 50 years since one of the strangest records ever made was launched – not into the pop charts but into the farthest reaches of outer space. Known as the Golden Record, this 12-inch, gold-plated copper disc was an album compiled by astronomer Carl Sagan featuring everything from classical music and spoken-word greetings to the sounds of nature and a blast of Chuck Berry’s Jonny B Goode. Humans could enjoy it, of course, but they weren’t the target audience. Rather, a copy was placed on Voyager 1 and 2, the two space probes launched in 1977, in the hope that they would one day be discovered and listened to by an alien life form.View image in fullscreenEarth Rising: Messages from the Pale Blue Dot album cover.Photograph: ArtangelThe Golden Record came with various diagrammatic instructions on how to play it correctly. But as to what aliens might make of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto, the sounds of humpback whales and a greeting in the Chinese dialects Wu, we will never know. Both Voyager probes are still intact, currently hurtling through the Kuiper belt in interstellar space, but we are likely to lose contact with them in around a decade’s time. This means we will miss the Golden Record’s first realistic chance of being discovered – when it’s expected to pass within 1.6 light years of the star Gliese 445 in 40,000 years’ time.And yet the record continues to inspire. It’s certainly the key influence behind Earth Rising: Messages from the Pale Blue Dot, the first in a series of three audio works by arts organisation Artangel that are being released on digital platforms in the run-up to the Golden Record’s 50th anniversary.“I visit artist studios and hear what they’re grappling with,” says Artangel director Mariam Zulfiqar. “They worry about what digital technology has done to human connection, this looming fear of climate, the state of geopolitics. Yet, within that fear, is also an enormous hope for what they believe humanity could be – and a desire to keep making new work that shows us a different perspective on ourselves.”View image in fullscreenContinuing to inspire … astronomer Carl Sagan compiled the original Golden Record.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyZulfiqar has been fascinated with the Golden Record ever since she was a child growing up in Pakistan. “To send this out there without knowing what would happen is quite romantic, especially in today’s outcome-driven world,” she says. So she came up with an idea: what if we made a modern version of the Golden Record that was less concerned with introducing ourselves to aliens and more about introducing humanity to itself? She got to work inviting artists from around the world to contribute.The result is a collection of poems and experimental compositions that grapple with our present moment. Sebastián Riffo Valdebenito creates a track from the sounds of rock carving at the petroglyph site of Valle del Encanto in Coquimbo, Chile, while Michel Nieva contributes The Alien Mother, a short story set in a future where humanity has colonised Mars. Elsewhere, there are poems about US turmoil, ethereal songs created using just the human voice, and what is described as a “sonic invocation” that honours the calabash, a hard-shelled type of fruit used to make instruments. It’s almost as diverse and confounding as the Golden Record itself which, along with its various audio recordings, featured 115 images encoded in analogue form (a circle, a track athlete, etc) and a condensed recording of Sagan’s wife’s brainwaves, captured while she thought deeply about the Earth’s history and various human experiences such as falling in love (I’d like to see you work that one out, aliens!).View image in fullscreenA retro sci-fi feel … Max Cooper.Photograph: Ella Mitchell“What surprised me is the connections,” says Zulfiqar. “There’s a beautiful line in Nigerian poet Ofem Ubi’s piece Family Tree that says, ‘In my attempts at tethering, I have loved many people, countries, ghosts.’ That sense of lost love is echoed in some of the other works. Similarly, Emilia Álvarez and Max Cooper both made music using sounds from the human body.”The latter’s track, Rhythm of Harmony (A Representation of Music), is the contribution most likely to have worked on the original LP. Inspired by some of the more withering responses to the Golden Record by philosophers of the time, who mocked the idea that other life forms would have a clue how to read the instructions, never mind appreciate, say, the traditional Aboriginal song Devil Bird, Cooper set about making a record that would have the best chance of making sense to an alien.His piece is based on a series of rhythmic clicks that gradually speed up until they make the sound of a tone, at least to human ears. “I’ve assumed the alien that discovers this is spacefaring, so they’re probably more advanced than us and their transition from individual sounds to tones maybe happens at a much higher frequency than ours,” he says. “So they won’t hear these nice tones like we do – what they’ll hear is the relationship in terms of the rhythms of the clicks. I wanted to break music down to the simplest source of sound that an alien might be able to understand.”Cooper has a science background – he holds a PhD in computational biology and previously worked as a geneticist – which he puts to good use when I ask questions such as: what if aliens haven’t evolved hearing in the same way we have? “There’s a thing called convergent evolution,” he says. “On Earth, the eye has evolved multiple times independently. It’s the same with other senses like hearing. That gives us reason to believe that aliens would have similar senses. It’s not watertight but you can definitely make that argument.”Cooper’s track is embellished with huge 1980s synth chords that give it a brilliantly retro sci-fi feel, a concession to the fact that it’s currently only going to be heard by humans. “Originally, the plan was for it to be made only with sounds made by the body, but the chords that came from just the body were pretty nasty,” he says. “I love conceptual music but I wanted to make something that was nice to listen to as well.”Trying to empathise with the sensory evolution of an alien race is an act of optimism that chimes with the original spirit of the Golden Record. But other contributions to Earth Rising strike a bleaker note: dehumanisation, fascism and grief are all picked over by the various artists. Porsha Olayiwola’s scathing In Alignment With the Women Before Me documents the horrors that have taken place on American soil in recent years, namechecking Amber Thurman, the 28-year-old medical assistant whodied of septic shock in Georgiaafter a medical abortion. It also references Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-oldserviceman who set himself alightoutside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC.View image in fullscreen‘What can I do with my voice’?’ Porsha Olayiwola is Boston’s poet laureate.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images“I struggle with my role as a poet/writer/artist/witness,” says Olayiwola. “Part of me always wants to do more than write – I want to organise and protest and mobilise. I ask, ‘What can I do with my pencil? What can I do with my voice?’ I thought, if anything, we must begin to speak about these things. Acknowledge and witness and document these atrocities. And perhaps we will begin to intervene.”I wonder if the despair of today is a little jarring considering the hope and optimism of the original project, but Zulfiqar disagrees. “Even when somebody is saying something quite bleak,” she says, “it reflects that they believe things could be better.”Olayiwola agrees: “We only leave the bleakness behind if we elect to look it directly in the eye, and shape our future accordingly. My poem serves as a reflection of the abyss. May it be as dark as the night sky in which we may see a glimmer of a star.”Earth Rising: Messages from the Pale Blue Dotis out nowExplore more on these topicsMusicArtPoetrySpaceNasafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was to become  his cherished friend, inspirational collaborator and valued mentor for many decades. Simon Rattle remembers the great pianist’s wit, wisdom – and a particular pair of scissorsSimon RattleFri 20 Jun 2025 11.51 EDTShareIt’s hard even to know where to start with Alfred: for any musician of my generation he was simply always there, the very definition of integrity and a kind of unique probing humour.I heard him first in Liverpool, playing Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 22, K482, an unforgettable concert for an impressionable 14-year-old. I could never have imagined then that my first collaboration with him would be in the same city when I was 20. That Beethoven – his first piano concerto – began a long journey of learning and friendship over the subsequent decades. I cannot stress how much I learned from him, or how painfully obvious it was to me just how steep the climb was to be able to come anywhere near to being an adequate partner for him. I remember clearly the sense of being kindly but firmly stretched to beyond my level of musicianship. Immense freedom within a strict framework. I am profoundly grateful that he was willing to carry on pulling me upwards for nearly 40 years!I visited him often in his Hampstead home. I met his friend Isaiah Berlin there, terrifying enough on its own, and he said to me, “you know, I don’t think Alfred has ever had an unoriginal thought”. An astonishing but probably accurate observation from an intelligence that could recognise its equal.But often it was just the two of us, listening and discussing. He was happy to listen to interpretations I brought, as he was with surely countless other musicians, and my scores are full of his insights and recommendations. In the middle of one of my evidently lugubrious accounts of theEroica symphony’s funeral march, I noted his devastatingly honest comment “Simon, have you never considered that there might be such a thing as active grief?”But often it was his wisdom about how to turn harmonic corners more eloquently. Difficult to achieve but vital for the music. Plus generous, challenging encouragement.Contemporary art, one of his quiet passions, politics, literature were also there in the mix. But it is his humour, an almost surreal amusement at the world around him, that remains the strongest memory, and the reason it is impossible to recall him without smiling, even in this time of sadness.The Alfred who, as a young man performing in Vienna, brought a tortoise on stage with him to walk around the concert hall floor, “just because I like funny things.”This friendly devil would sometimes make an appearance.He loathed piped music: I remember him in one Birmingham restaurant spying a thin wire leading to what seemed to be an unstoppable sound system.“I have just the thing” he said, producing a small pair of scissors from his jacket pocket. Seeing our astonishment as he quickly snipped through the wire, he said. “Don’t worry, they won’t even notice until tomorrow and it may be weeks before they discover the wire!”As ever, unique and unexpected. And even the occasional sharp edges deeply lovable. What a privilege to have had him in our lives.Explore more on these topicsAlfred BrendelClassical musicSimon RattlefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, Britain’s biggest alfresco bash is about to kick off again.Glastonbury 2025is set to be an extra-special one. There will be no 2026 event as the festival takes a fallow year. This year’s Glasto-goers could go large to compensate.As always, the BBC will provide wall-to-wall coverage of all the action. So fear not if you failed to secure a ticket, which sold out in a mere 35 minutes. Watching along at home will be almost as much fun and a lot less sweaty. From lineup highlights to secret sets, controversies to crowd-spotting, here’s your ultimate viewing guide.The headlinersView image in fullscreenThe oldies … Rod Stewart all set to rock the stage.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesIt’s a year of first timers …It’s a right old ragbag at the summit of the bill. Most rumoured names (Oasis! Springsteen! Rihanna! Stevie Wonder!) failed to materialise. Instead, two of the Pyramid stage’s three top spots go to first-time headliners. Friday is the biggest night of their careers for the 1975, fronted by Matty “son of Denise Welch” Healy. No pressure, lads. On Sunday, it’s the turn of US pop-punk princessOlivia Rodrigowho, as far as we know, isn’t related to any Loose Women.… but there are still plenty of golden oldiesSandwiched in between on Saturday is grizzled guitar goblin Neil Young and his band the Chrome Hearts. The coveted Sunday teatime “legends slot” will be occupied byRod Stewart, joined by former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. Sir Rod the Mod might be 80 with health worries but insists he’s “more than able to pleasure and titillate”. Do ya think he’s sexy? Actually, don’t answer that.On the Other stage, the headliners are homegrown hip-hopper Loyle Carner, pop polymath Charli xcx (dress code: lime green) and dance veterans the Prodigy – their first Glastonbury appearance since the death of frontman Keith Flint, shortly before the 2019 festival.

Is it too hot for skinny jeans?Surprise secret setsView image in fullscreenIs it Patchwork … or is it Pulp?Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesThere’s always frenzied speculation about A-list acts playing secret sets. This year’s rumour mill has been busier than usual. Slated for a plum Pyramid stage spot at 6.15pm on Saturday is a mystery act called Patchwork. There are also tempting “TBA” slots on the Woodsies and Park stages.Chappell Roan, Lady Gaga and Sabrina Carpenter have been optimistically mentioned. More realistically, Haim, Lorde, Green Day, Kings of Leon and Pulp are widely predicted. The other Britpop band on the comeback trail, of course, are Oasis. Their reunion tour kicks off in Cardiff a week after the festival. Could the Gallaghers be plotting a stealth warmup gig at Worthy Farm?

There were calls for the Belfast trio to be axed from the lineup after footage emerged of them allegedly telling fans to “kill your local MP”. The band were investigated by police and member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh wascharged witha terrorism offence. Expect them to respond “robustly” during their set.Later on Saturday night comes Neil Young, who caused a kerfuffle in January when he accidentally announced his headline slot – by cancelling it. Young declared that he was dropping out due to the BBC’s “corporate control”. Two days later, he backtracked, blaming “an error in the information received”. I wonder if corporation executives will cut short his coverage in retaliation?How to tune inAs is traditional, Glastonbury’s official broadcast partner will infuriate BBC bashers with copious coverage. With live streams of the five biggest stages, there will be more than 90 hours of performances on iPlayer’s dedicated Glastonbury channel.On broadcast TV, there’s extensive programming across BBC One, Two and Four. A tag team of Clara Amfo, Lauren Laverne, Jack Saunders, Huw Stephens, Jamz Supernova and Jo Whiley will guide viewers through the standout sets, while introducing intimate performances at their vantage point overlooking the Park stage.Audio-wise, 6Music’s schedule is devoted to All Day Glastonbury for six days (see what they did there?). Radios 1, 1Xtra, 2 and 4 will also broadcast live from Worthy Farm. There are three visualised episodes of Sidetracked, the hit music podcast hosted by Annie Macmanus and Nick Grimshaw. Other BBC “brands” doing special editions on-site include The One Show, Woman’s Hour and CBeebies Bedtime Stories.

Piles of stolen trousers were eventually found in a ditch. It remains a mystery.Muddy hell (1997)There have been many soggy Glastos, so imagine how biblical it must have been to go down in history as “the year of the mud”.

Towns lie in ruins, trains rot on the rails and the EU has severed all ties with the place. Some residents are stuck in the past and congregate under the tattered flag of St George. The others flail shirtless through the open countryside, raging about nothing, occasionally stopping to eat worms. You wouldn’t want to live in the land that Boyle and the writerAlex Garlandshow us. Teasingly, on some level, the film suggests that we do.Boyle and Garland first prowled zombie Britain with their 2002 hit28 Days Later. It was an electrifying piece of speculative fiction, a guerrilla-style thriller about an unimaginable world. Since then we’ve had Brexit and Covid, and the loomingthreat of martial law in the US… The story’s extravagant flights of fancy don’t feel so far-fetched any more. “Yes, of course real world events were a big influence this time around,” Boyle says, sipping tea in the calm of a central London hotel. “Brexit is a transparency that passes over this film, without a doubt. But the big resonance of the original film was the way it showed how British cities could suddenly empty out overnight. And after Covid, those scenes now feel like a proving ground.” Where Cillian Murphy first walked, the rest of us would soon follow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vlad Vdk/Contour by Getty Images28 Years Later review – sprinting zombies take evolutionary leap forward in badass threequelRead moreTense and gory, 28 Years Later is a fabulous horror epic. I would hesitate to call it a sequel, exactly: it’s more a reboot or a renovation; a fresh build over an existing property. Newcomer Alfie Williams plays 12-year-old Spike, who defies his parents (Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and flees the sanctuary of Holy Island for an adventure on the infected mainland. Along the way, he tangles with berserker zombies and smirking psycho-killers, and encounters Ralph Fiennes’s enigmatic, orange-skinned Dr Kelson, reputedly a former GP from Whitley Bay. All of which makes for a jolting, engrossing journey; a film that freewheels through a gone-to-seed northern England before crashing headlong into the closing credits with many of its key questions still unanswered.The hanging ending is the point, Boyle explains, because the film is actually the first part of a proposed trilogy. Sony Pictures has put up two-thirds of the budget. The second movie – The Bone Temple, directed by the Americanfilm-maker Nia DaCosta– is already in the can. Boyle has plans to shoot the final instalment, except that the future is unwritten and the industry is on a knife edge.View image in fullscreen‘It showed how British cities could empty out overnight’ … Cillian Murphy in 28 Days Later.Photograph: Ronald Grant“Sony has taken a massive risk,” the director tells me happily. “The original film worked well in America to everyone’s surprise, but there’s no guarantee that this one will. It’s all because of this guy, [Sony Pictures’ CEO] Tom Rothman. He’s a bit of a handful, a fantastic guy, runs the studio in a crazy way. He’s paid for two films, but he hasn’t paid for the third one yet and so his neck’s on the line. If this film doesn’t work, he’s now got a second film that he has to release. But after that, yeah, we might not get to complete the story.”Good directors reflect the times they work in, but they’re at the mercy of them, too, hot-wired to the twists and turns of history; up one year and down the next. And so it is with Boyle, who’s travelled from the sunny Cool Britannia uplands ofShallow GraveandTrainspottingthrough the imperial age of Slumdog Millionaire and the London Olympics, right down to the shonky doldrums of today, when a cherished project might collapse under him like an exhausted horse. He’s 68 now, and battling to get his films across the line. I don’t know why he’s so cheerful. Hasn’t everything gone to hell?“Well, I’m an optimist,” he says. “So I don’t despair about things the way I know that a lot of people do. Also I’m slightly more outside the media than you. That allows me a slightly different view on things. And increasingly, as I age, I become more wary of the obsessions of the media. That constant catastrophising and sense of perceived decline.”View image in fullscreenCool Britannia uplands … Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor, Kevin McKidd and Ewen Bremner in Trainspotting.Photograph: Channel Four Films/AllstarIt’s particularly noticeable in the US, he thinks. “Much of Trump’s dominance is undoubtedly down to his appeal to the media. He is so media friendly. His soundbites, everything about him, fit hand in glove with news and entertainment to the point where it’s damaging. Whereas in this country, we’re quite fortunate. We’ve dodged the far-right bullet for the moment and we elected Keir Starmer against the tide of what’s been happening elsewhere.” He reaches for his tea. “It could be a lot worse.”In 2012, Boyle devised and directed Isles of Wonder, theopening ceremony of the London Olympics. The show was a triumph: a bumper celebration of British culture that made room for James Bond and the queen, Windrush migrants and the NHS, Shakespeare and the Sex Pistols. “But my biggest regret was that we didn’t feature the BBC more. I was stopped from doing it because it was the host broadcaster. Every other objection, I told them to go fuck themselves. But that one I accepted and I regret that now, especially given the way that technology is moving. The idea that we have a broadcaster that is part of our national identity but is also trusted around the world and that can’t be bought, can’t be subsumed into Meta or whatever, feels really precious. So yeah, if I was doing it again I’d big up the BBC big time.” He laughs. “Everything else I’d do exactly the same.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m proud of the film, but it wouldn’t even get financed today’ … Dev Patel and Freida Pinto in Slumdog Millionaire.Photograph: APIsles of Wonder has safely passed into legend. These days it’s up there with James Bond and the queen. I wonder, though, how history will judgeSlumdog Millionaire, his Oscar-winning 2008 spectacular about a ghetto kid who hits the jackpot. Boyle shot the film in Mumbai, partly in Hindi, and with a local crew. But it was a film of its time and the world has moved on.“Yeah, we wouldn’t be able to make that now,” he says. “And that’s how it should be. It’s time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we’ve left on the world.”Is he saying that the production itself amounted to a form of colonialism? “No, no,” he says. “Well, only in the sense that everything is. At the time it felt radical. We made the decision that only a handful of us would go to Mumbai. We’d work with a big Indian crew and try to make a film within the culture. But you’re still an outsider. It’s still a flawed method. That kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be. I mean, I’m proud of the film, but you wouldn’t even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn’t even get financed. Even if I was involved, I’d be looking for a young Indian film-maker to shoot it.”View image in fullscreenA bumper celebration of British culture … the Windrush scene during the Boyle-directed opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianA waiter sidles in with a second cup of tea. Boyle, though, is still mulling the parlous state of the world. He knows that times are tough and that people are hurting. Nonetheless, he insists that there are reasons to be cheerful.“Have you got any kids?” he asks suddenly. Boyle has three: technically they’re all adults now. “And I think that’s progress. I look at the younger generation and they’re an improvement. They’re an upgrade.”The director was weaned on a diet of new wave music and arthouse cinema, Ziggy Stardust andPlay for Today. He began his career as a chippy outsider and winces at the notion that he’s now an establishment fixture. “It all comes back to punk, really,” he says. “The last time Lou Reed spoke in public, he said: ‘I want to blow it all up,’ because he was still a punk at heart. And if you can embrace that spirit, it keeps you in a fluid, changeable state that’s more important than having some fixed place where you belong. So, I do try to carry those values and keep that kind of faith.” He gulps and backtracks, suddenly embarrassed at his own presumption. “Not that my work is truly revolutionary or radical,” he adds. “I mean, I’m not smashing things to pieces. I value the popular audience. I believe in popular entertainment. I want to push the boat out, but take the popular audience with me.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to push the boat out, but take the popular audience with me’ … directing Alfie Williams and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya MizunoI suggest that this might be a contradiction. “Yeah, of course it is,” Boyle says, snorting. “But I’ve found a way to resolve it – in my own mind, at least.”If 12-year-old Spike played it safe he’d have stayed on Holy Island beside the reassuring flag of St George. Instead, the kid takes a gamble and charts his own course to the mainland. He’s educating himself and embracing a fraught, messy future. He’s mixing with monsters and slowly coming into his strength. That’s what kids tend to do, Boyle explains. That’s why they give us hope. “Maybe hope is a weird thing to ask for in a horror movie,” he says. “But we all need something to cling to, whether that’s in films or in life.”28 Years Later is in UK cinemas now"

How the Sex and the City spin-off finally got it right on raceIn its third season, the show leans into the cringe again – and rings true when it allows its white liberal characters to mess things upEllen E JonesFri 20 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 02.49 EDTShareAre any of the writers onAnd Just Like That(AJLT) reading this? Because I have several helpful suggestions to bring the current series of your Sex and the City reboot into 2025: Charlotte’s husband, the hitherto harmless Harry, could start pressuring her into an open marriage, involving whatever passes for wild sex parties on the Upper East Side. Miranda could soon enter her Chappell-Roan-power-ballad era by hooking up with a sexually captivating, but emotionally unavailable, decades-younger woman. And what about a big reveal involving Aidan, who has been draining Carrie’s bank accounts all along (because he’s secretly a Reddit-radicalised, misogynist crypto bro now). I’d also suggest we see and hear a lot less from the children. The existence of Brady, Brock, Tilly and Twerp should only ever be referenced occasionally and obliquely, for form’s sake. Y’know, like how people of colour were treated all the way through the original Sex and the City series?Ironically, racial politics is the one area in which AJLT is doing just fine, even without my help. This is not the consensus view, I’m aware. Many fans entered a state of full-body cringe during the first season, when Miranda wondered aloud if she was having “a white saviour moment” when fighting off a mugger attacking her Black friend, and are yet to regain full use of their sphincter muscles. But the fact is, AJLT understands the specific whiteness of wealthy white women, in a way that not only vastly improves on the original show’s run, but which could also teach other contemporary TV shows a thing or two about “diversity” and “representation”.Principally, this show gets things right by allowing its characters to get things wrong. The Mirandas of this world – and I can say this, because I am such a Miranda – often get to ride the righteous train all the way to Smug Town without so much as a ticket inspection. But the truth is, even the well-intentioned – especially the well-intentioned – have blind spots, and most of us could do with some practice at keeping our cool when those are brought to the fore. AJLT leans into the cringe and, as such, acts as a kind of anti-racist exposure therapy for its middle-aged, white, liberal core audience. The secondhand embarrassment it generates is healthy, productive and funny.View image in fullscreenExploring race … Nicole Ari Parker as Lisa Todd Wexley and Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOBecause imagine the alternative: this show could have remade its central trio as ever-elegant, socially confident “sheroes”. Girl bosses who get it. Women who never miss a beat and are always at one with the sensibilities of the age. It could have shielded them from ever looking uncool or out-of-touch, or jaw-droppingly oblivious, in the way that Carrie does in the episode where her new Indian-American friend, Seema (Sarita Choudhury), takes her sari shopping in preparation for the Patel family’s Diwali party. Upon entering the shop, Carrie’s eyes widen in wonderment. “OK …” she says, “These clothes … This holiday … I need to know everything about it!” Thus revealing that she is a fiftysomething woman, who has spent her entire adult life living in one of the most diverse cities in the world and yet – somehow – has never heard of Diwali, a festival celebrated annually by around a billion Indian and South Asian-descended people, worldwide. Get a clue, Carrie.When that episode aired, some commentators (mostly white women) bristled at the depiction of their carefree, curly queen. They said it wasn’t plausible. It was doing Carrie dirty. But some of us (women of colour and the other white women) recognised the truth in that characterisation. It’s Lana Turner in the classic 1959 film Imitation of Life, expressing surprise when Annie (Juanita Moore), her Black maid of several decades – and, essentially, her closest confidante – refers to a rich social life outside work. Annie’s response? “Miss Lora, you never asked.”Seema takes this in her stride. I suspect she too has met plenty of Carries in her time. The scene only begins to strain credulity when, moments later, Carrie follows up by asking her if she’s ever considered an arranged marriage – What? Because she’s Indian? – and Seema still betrays no hint of irritation. It wasn’t the writing of Carrie’s character that was flawed in that moment, but the writing of Seema’s.View image in fullscreenSet free? Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes and Sara Ramirez as Che Diaz in And Just Like That.Photograph: WarnerMedia DirectIt’s because of moments like these that I’m glad the characters of Professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) and Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez) have been phased out for season three. Or, as I prefer to understand it, set free to share a chilled bottle of chablis and/or weed vape with other friends who actually get it. I’m glad for their own sakes, because no human being wants to feel like a walking BLM reading list for someone on their solipsistic journey toward belated political consciousness.It was always clear why Miranda would want to be friends with Nya, the stylish, self-assured professor on her policies and principles of humanitarian law course – if only to improve her grades. But what is Nya getting out of the arrangement? After a long day of battling the ingrained racism of Ivy League academia, tending to her needy Gen Z grad students and her own underwritten IVF storyline, why would she want to spend her evenings further exerting herself by explaining micro-aggressions to Miranda “give me a gold star” Hobbs? How is that relaxing?Nya and Che’s departures also leave more room for AJLT’s other two characters-of-colour to be fully realised. Lisa Todd Wexley, played by Nicole Ari Parker, is an upper-middle-class Black woman (she would probably prefer “African American”) with a busy career in documentary film-making and her scenes in the edit offer a way for AJLT to make meta-commentary on media depictions of Blackness – worshipful references to Michelle Obama are a leitmotif, for instance. Something similar was previously attempted in season two, when Che decamped to Los Angeles to get their semi-autobiographical sitcom off the ground and the Italian-American actor Tony Danza was cast as their Mexican father. Sadly, by that point, nobody watching cared about Che’s tedious travails, so nobody cared about the politics of colour-blind casting either.View image in fullscreenBad’n’bougie … Karyn Parsons as Hilary Banks on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.Photograph: NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesLisa isn’t just a working mother with an impressive collection of oversized jewellery. She is also a classic example of the bad’n’bougie princess, a trope which allows TV to explore the intersections of race, gender and class, and has a noble lineage stretching back to Lisa Turtle on Saved by the Bell, through Hilary Banks on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Dionne Davenport in Clueless, all the way to reality star Gizelle Bryant on Real Housewives of Potomac. Here, I detect the hand of Susan Fales-Hill, proud descendent of US “afrostocracy”, creator of original bougie princess Whitley Gilbert from A Different World, and a writer on AJLT since season two.Seema’s type is more obvious. She is a new Samantha, brought in to replace our dearly beloved Kim Cattrall from the original SATC, a woman with so much charisma she could almost – but not quite – get away with wearing an afro wig to a post-chemo social gathering. Seema has Samantha’s confidence and fondness for animal prints, but to that she adds her own top-note of vulnerability. Being a professionally high-flying, never-married, child-free woman in your 50s is fabulous. But, in a world that likes to constantly remind women of how they’ve failed to please the patriarchy, an occasional wobble of self-doubt is to be expected.It’s in this wider context of the third season, with more screen time and better storylines, that Seema’s ethnicity can be just one aspect of her character; neither defining, nor denied. Now, when Seema’s cultural heritage is referenced, it’s usually on her own terms, and in her own words. As she cautions bossy date-finder Sydney Cherkov (Saturday Night Live’s Cheri Oteri): “I’m Indian, we invented matchmaking”.And just like that, through an ever-enjoyable, show-your-workings process of trial-and-error, this show has landed on what it can most usefully add to the pop culture discourse about race. And that isn’t shoe-horning in badly written POC characters to offer a hastily bodged version of racial diversity and representation. Rather it’s exploring the whiteness of Miranda/Charlotte/Carrie as they move through this changed and changing world, but – crucially – always with a tad more self-awareness than the characters themselves possess.Now, back to more pressing matters: Should Charlotte order specially monogrammed stationery from Tiffany’s for those sex party invites? And who’s telling Anthony he’s been cut from the guest list?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRace & religionAnd Just Like ThatRaceSarah Jessica ParkerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the very least, the film will remind you that when politicians smugly announce they wish to make a bonfire of regulations, they should be taken, under police escort if necessary, and made to stand at the foot of the tower. As for the housing secretary at the time of the tower’s refurbishment, the abysmally arrogant Eric Pickles, he was made a life peer in 2018.With the very considerable help of thehousing-issues journalist Peter Apps, the film shows how the horror was created by a perfect storm of incompetence, mendacity, greed, and (that heartsinking phrase) systemic failure. The local council were keen to spruce up its brutalist, concrete (but safe) Grenfell Tower because it was a “poor cousin” and depressing property values. Decorative cladding was just the ticket and the council allowed the installation of the cheapest tiles,made of aluminium composite material which was terrifyingly flammable. A US aluminium firm’s French division sold the council those tiles; in the subsequent inquirythey were accused of suppressing their own researchinto how dangerous another of their products was.The coalition government of David Cameron, dominated by red-tape-burners, had ignored the terrible warning of the2009 Lakanal House fire, also in London, with comparable cladding which killed six. Other cladding-related fires in other countries had resulted in tighter regulations – but not in the UK. Andsenior officers of the London fire brigade had not been aware of the cladding issueand so failed to update the policy of “stay put”, asking people in tower fires to stay in their flats. Firefighters were courageous, though this was a fatal flaw in their managers’ approach.Among the government figures, Theresa May, then prime minister, at least has the courage to be interviewed on camera here, though there is something slippery in her statement: “There was regulation there, it just wasn’t up to purpose.” Brian Martin, the civil servant in charge of building regulations at the time, was notoriously dismissive but did have the grace to sound embarrassed at the inquiry. The same can’t be said for Pickles, whohigh-handedly told the inquirythat he didn’t have all day to answer the questions and talked about the “96” deaths – apparently confusing Grenfell with Hillsborough.Criminal proceedings and convictions and class-action lawsuits seem as far away as ever. What is there left for us in the meantime? To establish a database of all UK buildings that still have the unsafe cladding, always to make sure we know where the stairwell is whenever we check into a hotel or enter any high-rise – and to support the continuing campaign of the survivors.Grenfell: Uncovered is onNetflixfrom 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGrenfell Tower fireGrenfell Tower inquiryFirefightersNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

New compilation Telepathic Fish documents the 90s south London ambient night; Logic1000’s latest DJ-Kicks mix would barely register on an ECG; there’s none more languid than even the summer’s flagship pop album,Addison by Addison Rae. New York producer and musician James K has been dabbling in trip-hop – and various shades of experimental pop and club music – for more than a decade, but nonetheless, her new album, Friend, arrives right on time for summer’s wind down. (What is autumn if not the chill out room to escape the year’s most hectic season?)James K: Play – videoWhile the accompanying text around the record speaks impenetrably of “oneiric fogs” and a “gaseous halo”, its many pleasures are in fact immediate and enveloping. These songs bob along on sleepy breakbeats wreathed in liquid, shoegaze guitar and angelic atmospherics; K’s melancholy falsetto is self-possessed, tracing its own hypnotic path through the blissed-out clouds she spins like candyfloss. (Fans of the more evanescent end of Caroline Polachek’s catalogue will find lots to get lost in.) Over repeat listens, this dreamy record leaves stronger impressions, of soft Balearic ecstasy on Peel; a little dank post-punk on pop gem On God; liturgical awe on Rider. Seductively slow it may be, Friend nevertheless seems primed to accelerate this cult hero’s emergence from the underground.Laura SnapesThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSymphonic trip-hop … Zuli.Photograph: Malak El SawiZuli – CareFollowing up his acclaimed 2024 album Lambda, the title track of the Egyptian producer’s new EP is skittering, splintered, symphonic trip-hop, with bells and whispers reaching across the uncanny valley.BBTTitanic – GoteraMabe Fratti’s duo with Héctor Tosta returns, channelling the astonishing metal energy of their recent live sets into an epic where Fratti’s ragged voice pierces ceaseless rounds of artillery-fire drums.LSSophie– OohA deep cut from the 10th anniversary reissue of Product: “I’m your Play-Doh baby / Push me to my knees,” a female voice pleads, starkly melancholy against the rubbery bass and ecstatic synth blurts.LSCass McCombs – PeaceA riff that’s like sunlight on the broken surface of a pond powers the latest stunner from an artist who, coming up to 12 solo albums, has amassed one of the great bodies of American song.BBTMark William Lewis – Still AboveAfter May’s beautifully brooding Tomorrow Is Perfect, the enigmatic London songwriter lets the light in, splicing strangely sweet, jazzy harmonica into his deep-voiced lyrics on off-kilter relationships, whether narcotic or romantic.LSSombr – We Never DatedThe lad with the sharpest cheekbones in pop made the heartbreak anthem of the year with Back to Friends.

First, bandleader Will Anderson is in love, which alleviates some of the gloom that pervaded earlier records. And while the lyrics don’t amount to much on the page, when sung in unaffected deadpan and robed in artfully embellished shoegazey noise, Anderson’s elliptical poetics carry a compelling weight.View image in fullscreenRaspberry Moon’s artworkSecond, and more importantly, Anderson invited his bandmates into the studio to record Raspberry Moon. Where previous albums had been one-man affairs, with Anderson overdubbing layer upon layer of guitar and synth on his lonesome, the presence of other musicians in the room has shaken up the paradigm. Their trademark walls of fuzz remain, but Raspberry Moon also fields tracks such as Break Right, on which the happy/sad melodies flourish with space to breathe, and the lush Lawnmower, which is practically unplugged (save for a keening thread of feedback in the distance) and utterly lovely for it.Other tracks hew closer to the Hotline blueprint, but with renewed sophistication. Their sound remains rooted in 90s indie-rock’s fusion of noise and tune (the closing track even shares its title with a landmark Dinosaur Jr LP), but Anderson’s articulacy within this soundworld is impressive. The Scene may recall the corrosive buzz of Sugar and the tremolo swoon of My Bloody Valentine, but Anderson’s mastery of dynamics is thrilling. And the way he weaves acoustic and distorted guitars and blasts of needling feedback into something as beguiling as Julia’s War is evidence of a unique talent operating in a crowded field.Explore more on these topicsIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Playing with the texts and repetitive motifs ofrunosong, a form of traditional oral poetry specific to the Baltic Finnic languages, their music holds a glistening minimalism in its rhythms and a crossover sheen in its sound. Rebane and Kivi’s voices help – often sweet, but also sharp when required.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Ilmateade.Photograph: Mia TohverTheir ambitious second album Ilmateade (Weather Report) explores the powerful yet under-sung connections between the weather and emotion. It begins with the minute-long Intro, a track that builds gorgeously on the scratchy, dying notes of their 2021 EP, Kulla Kerguseks (From the Lightness of Gold), implying both continuity and metamorphosis.Then we’re in Udu (Fog), lulled along on thick, beautiful clouds of shifting time signatures, before Vastlalaul (The Sledding Song) slows and speeds, glossily, through the snow. These songs are rhythmically complex and have solid, ancient roots, but fans of ambient, Balearic dreaminess and the softer sides of indie pop and psych-folk will find woozy comforts here.Good entry points include the earwormy melancholia of Vilud Ilmad (Gloomy Weather) and the itchy handclaps, in five beats to the bar, propelling us through Suvi Rannas (Summer on the Beach), in which we’re told, in Estonian, of days hot with horseflies and a sky broad and bare.Other Estonian artists brought into the fold provide different depths. Guitarist Erki Pärnoja’s solos swirl around the women’s wordless melodies on Interlude, while poet EiK 2509 adds spoken-word contributions to the mesmerising Enne Ööd (Nightfall). All together, these 12 tracks create a hypnotic shipping forecast transplanted to the Baltic Sea, carrying us along on its eddying tides.Also out this monthJennifer Reid’s The Ballad of the Gatekeeper (self-released) is a full-blooded fantastic debut from a singer who researches 19th-century broadside ballads, has acted in BBC Two’s The Gallows Pole and supported Pulp and Eliza Carthy on tour. Mixing centuries-old working songs with new material about fast fashion, climate breakdown and Covid, she’s a striking talent – her a cappellas especially full of bite.Brìghde Chaimbeul’s Sunwise (Tak:til/Glitterbeat) eerily transports us from high summer to songs of midwinter. Her smallpipe drones are less abrasive than on 2023’s brilliant, abrasive Carry Them With Us, but hercanntaireachdsinging (a style deliberately vocalising bagpipes) is more propulsive, heavy and completely compelling.

I must have been six or seven when I managed to read The Mountain of Adventure by Enid Blyton. I know she is no longer in fashion but I still remember the thrill of the world she created and the excitement of the plot.My favourite book growing upI adored the Flambards series by KMPeyton, probably because it felt slightly adult and a little bit sexy, but my absolute favourites were Grimble and Grimble at Christmas by Clement Freud. They were anarchic and knowing, in a way I hadn’t encountered before but more than anything else they were very funny. It also introduced me to the inspired illustrations of Quentin Blake.The book that changed me as a teenagerWhen I was around 15 or 16 we had a supply teacher and he brought with him plastic bags of novels and just threw them out to us sitting at our desks. I randomly caught The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath which really did change how I felt about books. It was funny, sophisticated and raw in a way I didn’t know novels could be. But more than that, as people say now, I felt seen. Esther Greenwood contained so many emotions and qualities that I recognised. I’m also happy to say that the supply teacher Niall is a good friend to this day!The writer who changed my mindWhen I was about 19 I remember reading the very start of Daniel Martin by John Fowles. He describes a German plane crashing into the British country side and it was so perfectly written that I resolved to never write books. What was the point? They would never be as good as these few pages. I took me more than 30 years to get over that feeling.The book that made me want to be a writerPrior to my John Fowles experience I had wanted to write and was scribbling down short stories, but I have no recollection of a moment or novelist that lit the spark. I think it was more the joy I found in telling tales and setting the scene. Everything I was reading just taught me that there was a way to do that and a world I could be a part of.The book or author I came back toI think I was exposed to Charles Dickens too early and found him very dark and dense. It was only many years later, when I had to read Oliver Twist for work, that I realised how incredibly engaging and entertaining his books are. There is a passage towards the end of A Tale of Two Cities where Carton roams the streets of Paris contemplating his death, which is as beautiful and profound as anything I’ve ever read.The book I rereadI very rarely reread anything but if I do it is probably during the summer in Ireland and it would tend to be a classic, like Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park or Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. There is such pleasure in finding out how much you’ve changed as different characters and plot points speak to you differently. Interesting how much we all bring a point of view to every novel we read.The book I could never read againI can’t imagine I will ever go back to the Just William series by Richmal Crompton. I loved them as a preteen but I fear I might find them a little less charming now.The book I discovered later in lifeThe novels of Elizabeth Taylor were a fairly recent discovery for me. Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont is a stunning book. Wry, funny and heartbreaking, but never cruel. Maybe you have to be a little older to really enjoy it? I was also recommended the works of the late Octavia Butler recently. I rarely read sci-fi, but Kindred is the most visceral novel about the horrors of slavery that I’ve read.The book I am currently readingI’ve just finished Long Island Compromise by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. A sprawling saga about a damaged family which I really enjoyed.My comfort readAgatha Christie, what else? Grisly murders and neat solutions.

An influential theatre critic finds out in this smart story of #MeToo-era revengeToby LittFri 20 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen Jesus is pressed to condemn the woman taken in adultery, he says, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” No one does, and a lesson in critical generosity is learned. Judge not, that ye be not judged.Is giving an artist a one-star review an act of abuse – casting the first stone? Is it worse when the reviewer is male and the artist female? That’s the starting point of this entertaining and very timely debut novel from Charlotte Runcie, an arts journalist who, as a young intern, was lambasted on stage by a successful standup to whom she’d given a bad review.Alex Lyons, chief theatre critic for a national newspaper, is known for his hatchet jobs. It’s the Edinburgh fringe, and he’s sitting through a one-woman standup show. “The solo performance artist, Hayley Sinclair, had a lot to say about the climate emergency, the patriarchy, and the looming end of the world, which was fair enough, but unfortunately her show was so terrible that, by half an hour in, Alex had decided that he actually wanted the world to end as soon as possible.”Instead, immediately after bashing out his one-star review, he goes to a bar, encounters an emotionally exhausted post-show Hayley, and invites her back to the flat he is sharing with another journalist, Sophie Ridgen. It is only the next morning that Hayley, after spending the night with Alex, reads the eviscerating, career-ending words he has written about her: “a dull, hectoring frump, like one of those 1950s cartoons of housewives beating their husbands with a rolling pin”. Alex blithely walks in from his morning shower to find Hayley with his brickbat in her hands.Am I tempted to cast the first stone? Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety make this impossibleIt is a delightfully excruciating scene, setting in motion one of the most enjoyable novels I’ve read in a long time. Although as a male reviewer of a female artist, for a national newspaper, who by chance read much of the book on the train south from Edinburgh, I experienced moments of very meta-terror and mischief. Wouldn’t the most fun review to write, but even more to read, be an absolute slating? Wasn’t I, too, being tempted to cast the first stone?Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety rendered that impossible. Alongside a fringe festival retelling of the history of the #MeToo movement, we also get a will-they-won’t-they plot and an inside account of so-Alex-has-been-publicly-shamed. Because, in reaction to her awful one-star review, and the one-night stand, Hayley transforms her one-woman show into “The Alex Lyons Experience” – a one-star review of Alex’s entire life and an immediate star-making media sensation. She retells the story of her encounter with Alex, then opens the stage for other women to share the appalling things Alex or other Alex-like men have done to them. And as clips from the show go viral, resonating far beyond a small function room below a pub and bringing forth similar stories from thousands of women, it starts to seem as though most men – all men? – are deserving of similar humiliation. And if not that, then a good digital stoning.As the Black Mirror episode Nosedive foretold, these days we are all but forced to participate in a culture of constantly rating one another. Midway through the novel, Sophie finds herself getting self-hatingly drunk at a festival party.There was an interactive customer feedback device propped up on the bar. Tell us what you think of our service, it said, and underneath there were two buttons you could press: an angry red face or a smiling green one. Excellent or worthless, nothing in between. Review your experience, share your thoughts, recommend us to your friends, swipe left, swipe right, leave a comment, have an opinion.Everyone’s a critic. But shouldn’t we be more forgiving?

Fox chooses his victims carefully: his “little kittens”, all in his preferred 12-to-14 age group, have literary leanings and absent fathers, and feel validated by the attention he pays them. When the parts of Fox’s body that haven’t been consumed by wildlife are pulled out of a local swamp, it falls to world-weary detective Horace Zwender to work out what’s been going on. Peppered with exclamation marks, breathless and febrile, this is an utterly mesmeric account of how one man’s crimes can affect an entire community.View image in fullscreenA Schooling in Murderby Andrew Taylor (Hemlock, £20)Taylor’s latest also centres on an educational establishment, Monkshill Park School for Girls, a crumbling mansion in Monmouthshire, Wales. It’s the end of the second world war, the country is exhausted, and several inhabitants are waiting for news of loved ones who are missing, perhaps dead. Also missing is teacher Annabel Warnock, who disappeared during the Easter holidays. It’s presumed that “Warnie” simply walked out on her job, but she remembers being shoved off a nearby cliff. Now a trapped spirit, she is determined to discover who killed her and, able to move about the school and grounds unobserved, finds herself privy to all sorts of secrets. Taylor’s ability to conjure time past is second to none and here he blends a school story for adults, a ghost story and a mystery for a sublime evocation of a closed world in which the adults are, in their way, as powerless as their young charges.View image in fullscreenDeath of a Diplomatby Eliza Reid (Sphere, £20)Reid is a former first lady of Iceland, and her debut novel is set on Heimaey, the largest of that country’s Westman Islands. Canadian ambassador Graeme Shearer and his wife Jane are paying a visit with the dual purpose of opening an art exhibition and forging business links with a large fishery. Beneath the standard-issue speechifying, subtle power plays and general buttering up, trouble is brewing. Not only is the island’s mayor grieving the unexpected death of his husband, but the Shearers’ marriage is in crisis and the increasingly stormy weather means that the island is isolated until further notice – and then deputy ambassador Kavita Banerjee is felled by a poisoned “Flaming Viking” cocktail. Told from multiple points of view, the story rewinds to 13 hours before Kavita’s death, before taking us forward to the projected killing of an unnamed second person. Despite a fair bit of exposition, this classic “closed world” mystery moves at a good pace, making excellent use of its claustrophobic setting and delivering a final sucker-punch twist.View image in fullscreenActually, I’m a Murdererby Terry Deary (Constable, £18.99)The Horrible Histories writer’s first novel for adults begins in 1973, when four strangers meet on an early morning train from London to Newcastle upon Tyne. There’s Tony, a struggling actor; Claire, who works in the fledgling computer industry; Edward, prosperous lawyer and adviser to the prime minister, Edward Heath; and last “Mr Brown”, who tells his new acquaintances “Actually, I’m a murderer”. In the next few days, one of the company will be killed, another will turn to blackmail, and a third will be forced to commit a crime … All this is recounted 50 years later by Tony, the professional killer and self-styled sociopath “Mr Brown”, and police officer Aline James. It’s by no means all hijinks – the institutional misogyny young Aline has to contend with rings appallingly true – but this smart, funny and deftly executed page turner is sure to please.View image in fullscreenCan You Solve the Murder?by Antony Johnston (Bantam, £14.99)“Solve it yourself” titles aren’t new. In the 1930s, Dennis Wheatley’s “murder dossiers” came complete with clues ranging from telegrams and photographs of cigarette ends to little bags containing human hair, and in recent years the Murdle puzzle collections have become a publishing phenomenon, but a superior interactive crime story is always a delight. This is Cluedo-type detective fiction in which you, the reader, are the presiding DCI, presented in “choose your own adventure” gamebook style. In order to solve the murder of property developer Harry Kennedy, whose corpse has been discovered at the luxurious Elysium spa, you must choose which of the available suspects to interview and which locations to explore, with each decision leading you to a fork in the narrative road as the chapters fan out to a series of different conclusions, only one of which is correct. Park your need for emotional resonance and sharpen your wits: this clever, intricate book is a highly entertaining mental workout.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupCrime fictionThrillersFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

She recalls her early struggles – and explains why her beloved classical music fits best with RPGsFri 20 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareAlfred Hitchcock, David Attenborough, Harold Pinter, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Hideo Kojima – these are just a few of the recipients of the Bafta fellowship, the highest honour the academy can bestow. Japanese composer Yoko Shimomura is the latest to receive the accolade; one of only 17 women and four Japanese people to have done so. She is also the first video-game composer to be recognised by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and the first composer recognised at all since John Barry in 2005.It is with good reason that the academy has honoured her. Shimomura is an icon. You’ll know her music from Street Fighter,Final Fantasy, Super Mario, Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana, Streets of Rage and more than 70 other games she has contributed original compositions or arrangements to. Her 37-year-long career has seen her record at Abbey Road Studios, have her music played by symphonic orchestras around the world, and work in genres ranging from rock to electronica, ambient to industrial, pop to opera. And yet Shimomura seems unchanged by her success.“Certainly, over the course of my career, there have been a number of times – a lot of times perhaps, compared to other people – where I have struggled. Enough to think maybe I want to give up.” She tells me that even as far back as her first job at Japanese developer Capcom, she thought she had maybe two or three years in her before she’d quit. She also says she applied for that job with “barely any hope of getting accepted” – with a modesty that still seems a core part of her character.“Even though I love this job, there have been plenty of times when it was really hard for me to continue. I couldn’t sleep, and I would especially struggle as deadlines would approach.”View image in fullscreenThe first video-game composer recognised by Bafta … Shimomura collects her fellowship.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty Images for BAFTAPart of her fatalism came from the culture of video games in Japan in the late 80s. Despite the thriving arcade and development scene later leading to the mainstream success of the PlayStation in the mid-90s, pursuing a career in video games was seen as a dubious prospect by Shimomura’s peers and family. “This is something I think most gamers who were around at the time will understand,” she laughs. “Generally, my friends and people I hung out with were not big gamers, so they weren’t too familiar with what games really were. At the time, a lot of them were confused about what a job in video-games music even was! Certainly, my parents were not of the generation who would have played the Famicom [the NES], so they would say things like: ‘Oh, video-game music? Is that a job? Is that real?’ There was a lack of knowledge and understanding about the profession, really.”People used to say: ‘Video-game music? Is that a real job?’Surprisingly, given the male-dominated western world of video games in the 80s and 90s, Shimomura tells me that a lot of her colleagues in the sound department at Capcom were women. The developer split its composers into corporate and consumer divisions, where the top staff were all female. “I felt that since the head staff were women,” she says, “it was easier for other women to join the department.”Her peers began to understand how serious Shimomura was about her musical career with the release of Street Fighter II in 1991, the ninth game she worked on. “That’s when the tide started to turn. It sold so much, and so many people knew it and became familiar with my music, that it was a really significant title for me. I certainly think it’s why I ended up working with Square on titles like Live a Live and Front Mission – because the bosses there knew me from Street Fighter.”For Street Fighter, Shimomura would study the character designs and personalities of the fighters, then design themes for them. She would also pore over the detailed pixel art stages for each character, and draw out details from their “home stage”. She would then compose music based on the character’s ethnicity and culture, often to striking and unusual effect. The best example, to my ear, is the use of a major key rhythm track for the Brazilian fighter Blanka, while the main melody playing on top of the rhythm is in minor. It’s odd but it works, and gives the green-and-orange fighter a musical identity as as much as a visual one.View image in fullscreenAmazon River Basin in Street Fighter II … the inspiration for one of Yoko Shimomura’s most notable early tracks.Photograph: CapcomShimomura’s classical background gave her the tools to work techniques such as this into her music. She eventually departed Capcom for Square, the most famous RPG developer in the world, because she wanted to work on games where she could utilise classical composition techniques.“Why is classical music such a good fit for RPGs? I think it’s because so many of those titles are set in medieval, European-style worlds where that music naturally belongs,” she says. “But even if an RPG is set in a more modern take on a world, they’re very rarely close to reality; the game world is of another age. And classical music is of another age too, so it’s a very good fit.”The first project Square set Shimomura to work on was Live a Live, a 1994 RPG that takes players on a fantastical journey as eight characters across nine scenarios. “There are so many different worlds and different settings in there, and very few of them actually needed classical music, so it was completely different to what I was expecting,” she laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Music in Live a Live had to align with the characters. For Parasite Eve, I had to work with what was established in the original game. Mario RPG, of course, is set in the world of Mario and had to be ‘Mario music’. I was not free to create something from the ground up until Legend of Mana.”View image in fullscreenLive a Live … working with an eclectic cast of characters and giving them a unique aural identity is Yoko Shimomura’s bread and butter.Photograph: Square EnixLegend of Mana would be foundational for the rest of Shimomura’s career. Three years later she would work on Kingdom Hearts, the now-mainstream success that trades on the unlikely idea that the worlds of Final Fantasy and Disney could somehow become merged.“When it first released, Kingdom Hearts wasn’t a big hit,” Shimomura recalls. “After it was released, it was one of those hard times I mentioned before: I left Square, and I wasn’t sure if I was going to continue in this job or not. But then they came back to me and asked if I wanted to work on Kingdom Hearts II, and that was significant for two reasons. One, it proved I couldcontinue doing this as a freelancer. And two, it was the first time I’d been asked to come back and work on another game in a series.” Even at that point, 17 years into her career, Shimomura was uncertain about her standing in the world of video-game music. “I think, both professionally and in a sense of personal growth, that’s why Kingdom Hearts means so much to me.”Now, 37 years since her first job at Capcom, Shimomura has been lauded with Bafta’s highest honour, and she is still as polite, humble and respectful as the young woman poring over Street Fighter’s stages. “I was blessed to have mentors and seniors who really helped me grow as a composer and taught me a lot of what made me who I am,” she says. “I feel very lucky, and it is down to all those people that I am here talking to you today.”And her advice to other young women hoping to break into making music for games today? Be tenacious, persevere and work through that self-doubt. “I think the reason I haven’t given up is because I always make myself think of the love I have for music and for games. I cherish that feeling. And so if people do ever think they want to give up, please, cherish that feeling of love yourself, and keep going. I hope I can be an example for people when times are tough. If I can get over that, I hope that they can too.”Explore more on these topicsGamesHigh scoresFinal FantasySuper MarioJapanAsia PacificAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Great artworks jostle for space on the walls – Picasso, Velázquez, a handful of impressionists, and a banner reads “Happy birthday boss”. Guests pour in from a pinging elevator: a maelstrom of big skirts in Disney princess colours, high-rise hair, three-piece suits and pork pie hats. Out of the window: skyscrapers.In singer turned directorJohn Savournin’s latest production for Opera Holland Park – a collaboration with Scottish Opera and D’Oyly Carte Opera – Franz Lehár’s hit operettaThe Merry Widowswitches fictional Pontevedro andLe Gai Parisfor New York’s mafia underworld and its Sicilian homeland. The plot’s patriarch becomes a pinstripe Manhattan godfather, title character Hanna Glawari the widow of a Sicilian lemon-tree racketeer.In their energetic English version, Savournin and David Eaton have fun with Dolmio-level Italian (no less authentic than Lehár’s original Balkan Neverland) and these mafiosi reach as often for the TV gangster phrase book – “Bada bing, bada boom”, “schmuck”, “capeesh?” – as for their guns. Dialogue is delivered in 90% faux mafioso (“family comes foist, bowss!”), 10% operatic RP. In the mostly excellent singing those proportions were reversed. And where the spoken passages were largely shrieked or shouted, the balance in the sung numbers swung in favour of the orchestra: most of the action played behind the pit thus vastly increasing the demands on singers already working in tent-acoustics.View image in fullscreenHigh-camp melodrama … The Merry Widow.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSo much high-camp melodrama may leave some yearning for a calmer take on Lehár’s classic. But, for those with a higher tolerance for hyperactive kitsch and national stereotyping after Lehár’s own model, this mid-century Merry Widow is enormously enjoyable. Come for the big tunes, stay for the straight-legged “Russian” folk dance performed unsmiling in dark glasses, the stage hands in white tie, lemon trees on wheels and the “birthday cement mixer” (don’t ask). For Acts 2 and 3,takis’s streamlined set spins to take us from a cypress-equipped villa to the crimson interior of Maxim’s – now a “respectable performance bar” in New York.Bass-baritoneHenry Waddingtonis ideally cast as “Don” Zeta and evidently had a ball, his comic timing impeccable;Rhian Loiswas a vivacious stage presence as his wife, Valentina.

But this is also a piece with a big heart. Along with the warm, stylish playing from the orchestra of Scottish Opera underStuart Stratford, it was the suavity and occasional tenderness ofAlex Otterburn’s Danilo andPaula Sides’s Hanna that made this performance more than the sum of its gags.AtOpera Holland Park, London, until 28 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its charisma is reminiscent of his previous rollicking production at this venue,The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, which featured some of the same actors.This is not as successful, despite its infectiousness. Ultz’s set design is loose, initially bearing a coffin at its centre. The premise is that 11 travellers must embark on a quest across all 54 nations inAfricawithin a week, spurred on by ancestral mother Mama Africa (Suzette Llewellyn). It is not altogether clear what will happen if they fail despite the symbolic coffin; the play does not dwell on raising the stakes. The job of the characters is to “demystify and justify” the continent.Based on writer-director Elufowoju’sown travels, the collective odyssey encompasses personal, political, social and even environmental history along with myth and ideas around belonging. Spoken scenes are accompanied by interludes of exuberant song and dance. The performers are always entertaining: Munashe Chirisa oozes comic talent as a shopkeeper in Uganda and a traffic warden in Seychelles; Liana Cottrill is an astounding dancer; The Ganda Boys (Denis Mugagga and Daniel Sewagudde) weave music around scenes; whileElufowoju, following an illness in the cast, does a fine job of reading a part.We briefly hear about the colonial history of Cameroon and at one passport control, an officer challenges a traveller’s dual African/British identity. We sweep reverentially into Robben Island, briefly stopping inside Nelson Mandela’s former cell, and push through to Tunisia and a bristling encounter in Libya.Sometimes it is hard to work out what is happening. Scenes are often brief – giving little time to connect with characters – and heavy-handed in their messages. The drama feels baggy and more like sketches or riffs that contain little tension, story or characterisation. Maybe it is a deliberate endeavour to disrupt or diverge from a – western? – dramatic narrative so it is not led by these traditional elements.What takes their place is joyful but broad-brush, maybe too ambitious in what it is trying to achieve. Where it shares the same inventive staging and bubbling joy as The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, there is little of its magnificent storytelling, despite the 11 adventuring storytellers.At theArcola theatre, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

His compassionate work transformed perceptions, and helped galvanise social change.In 1966, a new charity was launched:Shelter, the National Campaign for the Homeless. That same year, Ken Loach’s revelatory drama documentaryCathy Come Homehighlighted the problem of homelessness in a country that complacently believed in the rose-tinted idea of the swinging 60s.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Nick Hedges in his garden in Shrewsbury, 2020“I always maintain I was fortunate to be born when I was, because in the 60s we believed a revolution was possible,” Hedges told the British Journal ofPhotographyin 2023. “I was working with people who thought it was possible to change the situation the country was in. It was invigorating and exciting.”Those people worked for Shelter. In 1968, they commissioned Hedges to document the brutal environment in which poor people lived, some in slums that had been due for demolition before the second world war. The charity wanted to use the images in their campaigns, reports and literature that was designed to educate the public about the inequality on their doorstep: to use documentary photography as political activism – demanding more social housing.Hedges photographed families in many neglected inner cities, including in Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London. Sometimes he would be introduced to his subjects by social workers or housing association workers, and sometimes he would just knock on doors in run-down areas. He always explained himself, and what Shelter was trying to do. He had no intention of disrespecting the inhabitants by trying to take “candid” photographs. The responsibility weighed heavily on him: “Part of my duty as a photographer is to honour the trust placed in me by people with no voice.”He said it was “essential to develop a relationship of trust: nothing was ever forced, nothing was ever staged. Your own presence had to be reduced to the minimum. I used a 35mm Leica camera and available light and, in the small rooms, I often found myself crouching down in a corner listening and watching, just allowing things to develop and occur in front of the camera.”View image in fullscreenMrs Thomas in her cellar kitchen, Toxteth, Liverpool, 1971.Photograph: Nick HedgesShot in grainy, dark monochrome; the results were raw, poignant and powerful. Those few men who were present “often demonstrated an uneasy guilt”, Hedges said. They “were more reluctant to be photographed, as if the image itself would become a signature of failure”. Many of the women also turn away from the camera as if somehow responsible for their own straitened circumstances, resigned to their powerlessness.It is left to the children to issue a challenge to society – staring into the lens, straight at the viewer, with an accusatory gaze.Part of my duty as a photographer is to honour the trust placed in me by people with no voiceNonetheless, what pours forth from Hedges’ sensitive images is dignity, resilience and the unbreakable bonds between parents and their children, and between siblings – the depiction of unconditional love in unspeakable conditions. Family, wrote Hedges, “provides meaning to our lives and rewards us with comfort in an uncertain world”.Nick was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to Norman, a timber merchant manager, and Dorothy (nee Chapman), an arts and crafts teacher.He attended Stourbridge Road junior school, followed by King’s school, Worcester. As a teenager, his political conscience, sense of purpose and love of jazz music were awakened. In 1965 he joined the photography course at Birmingham School of Art, where he embraced sixties radicalism. He was inspired by the work of the American Farm Security Administration photographers, such asDorothea Langeand, most profoundly,Walker Evans, whose book with James Agee, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, documented the lives of impoverished tenant farmers during the Great Depression in the 30s.View image in fullscreenChild waiting outside her flat for her parent to return home, Glasgow, 1971.Photograph: Nick HedgesFor his final year project, Hedges worked with BirminghamHousingTrust on an exhibition about the city’s poorly housed low-income households. He was in the trust’s offices, having just signed on as unemployed, “pasting large 6ft by 4ft photographs I had taken for them on to panels that were to be displayed outside in Birmingham city centre”, Hedges recalled in an interview. “Someone popped their head around the door, looked at the images and said: ‘Nice photographs.’ About two weeks later, I had a phone call from Shelter asking me whether I’d like to join them to document bad housing across the country. Accident and chance play such a large part in our lives – we often don’t admit to it.”Having completed his four-year assignment, Hedges left Shelter in 1972. He then worked as a freelance photographer for Mencap, the BBC, Penguin Books and many other organisations; a commission from one, the Royal Town Planning Institute, resulted in an exhibition, Problem in the City, at the ICA, London, in 1976.View image in fullscreenThe wife of a retired caretaker living in a slum clearance property in All Saints, Birmingham, 1971.Photograph: Nick HedgesHe was awarded an Arts Council fellowship to make a three-year study of working lives in the factories and steelworks of the West Midlands. Those images were exhibited in London and Paris in 1979, and a book, Born to Work, was published in 1982. Hedges produced a series on different religious groups in Wolverhampton, rural life in Worcestershire, and in 1979 he documented the local fishing industry for Newcastle’s Side Gallery.His active life as a photographer came to an end in 1980, when he became the head of photography at West Midlands College of Higher Education and later of the University of Wolverhampton. Hedges left teaching due to ill health in 2003, and in his later years developed a passion for collecting old hand-tinted picture postcards, a selection of which were published in the collection Painted Ladies in 2006.Hedges had long imposed a restriction on the use of the photographs he took for Shelter to protect the identity of the subjects, particularly the children. However, as the 50th anniversary of the charity approached, the photographer lifted the curb: he felt it was important that people could view our shared social history, as “understanding our past is crucial to shaping our future”. In 2014, his work for Shelter was exhibited asMake Life Worth Living at London’s Science Museum, to great acclaim, and led to the award of the 2016 Hood medal from the Royal Photographic Society. In 2021 the Shelter photographs were published as Home, alongside another book, Street.Loach said that Hedges’ “work is not only deeply human, an expression of our shared humanity, it is also important as evidence. This is how life is, and how it was.”He is survived by Ruth and Annie, his daughters from his marriage to Diana Roberts, a social worker (which ended in divorce), four grandchildren, and two siblings, Roger and Julie.Nick (Rupert Nicholas Wilmore) Hedges, photographer, born 31 December 1943; died 8 June 2025Explore more on these topicsPhotographySocial exclusionPovertyHousingInequalityobituariesShareReuse this content"

In 1972, he became the first Black artist to represent the US at the world’s most prestigious art festival, the Venice Biennale. He had overcome poverty and prejudice in the south to study art at one of the first desegregated universities, and, after settling in Washington, was hailed as a radical innovator within the group of abstract painters dubbed the Color School.Pushing his medium in new sculptural directions, he broke convention by taking his canvases off their wooden stretchers. His best-known colour-drenched works have an improvisatory quality, never installed the same way twice, whether they’re draped on the wall or hung tent-like from the ceiling.When the art world turned away from abstraction in the following decades, however, he was all but forgotten. He was approaching 80 in 2012 when the young art star Rashid Johnson championed his work, curating an exhibition that led to a fresh slate of big international shows and museum recognition. Yet as Gilliam said in an interview two years before his death in 2022, in art, “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I’ve never lost entirely. We just keep on keeping on.”Sewing Fields, a new exhibition featuring unseen work from Gilliam’s residency at the BallinglenArtFoundation on the west coast of Ireland in 1993,reveals how he never stopped making and innovating.“He was so prolific,” says the show’s co-curator, Mary Cremin. “There’s still a huge amount of his work that’s never been shown.” One of the biggest surprises is that he worked in Ireland at all. The isolated rural location with its sea cliffs and rolling hills must have been a major change for an artist who spent his life in cosmopolitan Washington’s creative community.He wasn’t afraid of mixing things up, though. Prohibited from flying across the Atlantic with petrol-based paints, he was compelled to paint, print and dye materials in his Washington studio in advance, and pursue new processes in Ireland. It resulted in a fresh approach with cut-up collaged fragments of paintings including screen-printed cloth and paper and material thick with paint. “Needs must is the mother of invention,” says the curator.It was the experience of being captivated by laundry billowing on a line that first led Gilliam to set the canvas free from wooden stretchers to create his characteristic draped works. His approach to painting was expansive, underlining art’s connection to lowly cloth while nodding to histories of Black female labour. In Ireland, he worked with a seamstress to stitch his layered compositions of collaged painted fabrics with distinct zigzagging lines of thread. “He supposedly had six sewing machines in his Ballinglen studio,” says Cremin. She points out that Ireland’s light and unpredictable weather fed into Gilliam’s explosive use of colour, too. “The sky changes, the seasons change in a single day,” says Cremin. “In these works, the tone changes all the time.”One reason given for Gilliam’s art-world wilderness years is that, during the rise of identity politics in the 1980s, his work didn’t foreground Black experience. Today, it’s his commitment to constant experimentation within his medium that the curator sees as crucial to his legacy for younger artists. Says Cremin: “If there’s a rule, he tries to break it.”Look of the Irish: five works from Sewing FieldsView image in fullscreenSam Gilliam’s Folded Cottages II, 1993.Photograph: Sam Gilliam Foundation/Mark Gulezian/QuickSilverFolded CottageII, 1993This kickstarted the experimental body of work Gilliam produced on Ireland’s west coast and, as the title suggests, it took formal inspiration from its coastal dwellings. There’re all kinds of painterly techniques on the fragments he collaged, including stained and splashed paint, as well as his signature method of raking lines in pigment.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sam Gilliam Foundation/Mark Gulezian/QuickSilverDoonfeeny Lower, 1994Gilliam pushed painting into sculptural territory with works that spoke to the human body and the world beyond the gallery. With its loops of fabric across its top edge, this collaged painting looks almost wearable – or like curtains.

I gallivanted through the Staffordshire countryside with my stepbrother, Greg. We used to pick a point in the distance and create “missions” to walk towards it. It was a mischievous challenge that saw us hopping fences, wading through rivers and sneaking around farmers.I was also obsessed with maps, and even read the Birmingham A-Z for fun. When Google Earth came out in 2005, I spent hours studying satellite images.As I got older, countryside adventures became rarer. In 2018, I was working as a van driver but made videos about geography and map-based games in my spare time. I found myself craving a challenge.I thought back to my hedge-hopping days. What if, instead of walking across a few fields, I could cross the width of a whole country – and in a perfectly straight line? I had no idea if it was possible, but using mapping software, I plotted a line across Wales from the English border to the west coast.Following a straight line might sound – literally – straightforward; the reality is anything but. Plot the wrong course, and you’ll end up reaching rows of houses that are impossible to pass.You’re forced to shimmy or climb over every obstacle. Trips would take multiple days, so I would carry food and toilet roll in my backpack and a tent to camp in at night. I would have to eat, sleep and “use the toilet” without leaving the line. And even if I managed to navigate all these, there was still a risk being thrown off private farmland.On one trip, I got trapped up to my waist in a peat bog. I barely escapedMy parents and my girlfriend, Verity, were sceptical and also concerned for my safety. They may have had a point. I didn’t train for my first attempt, in early 2019. I got stuck on a mountain with no signal, darkness falling and hypothermia setting in. I had to abort the mission.Nonetheless, when I posted the footage online, I was blown away by the response. Viewers loved the silliness and originality of the concept, and recognised my joy as I scrambled over barbed wire, across rivers and through fields of startled sheep. I’d failed but knew I had to keep trying.After another failed Wales attempt in 2020, I decided to try Norway. The north of the country is less than 30km wide, with few farms and a right to roam – so no risk of angry farmers. But the landscape was alien to me. On one occasion, I barely escaped from a peat bog after being trapped up to my waist.Still, after two days, I finished it – crossing an entire country in a straight line for the first time. Verity was there at the finish line. It felt amazing to share the moment with her. But I couldn’t stop there. After my first video, others began to try their own missions. In 2023, two straight-liners told me they planned to cross Wales. By that point, a GPS malfunction had caused my third attempt to fail; the idea of someone else doing it first was devastating.Experience: I travelled the world delivering letters to strangersRead moreI devised a new route, prioritising mountains over farmland. It was longer, but I felt that avoiding farmers gave me the best chance of completion. I was right, and finished it in February that year, after four days. The satisfaction was incredible.Next came England, something I’d long thought was impossible. The route was more than 100km, twice the length of most of my previous walks. I travelled lighter and a crew followed me in a support van. We met whenever my line crossed a road, and I’d restock my supplies and sleep.It was my toughest challenge yet. Much of the route was forest, and on the last day I hit a sea of fallen trees. The height of the pile, and sharpness of the branches, meant a single slip could be fatal. I faced a gut-wrenching decision: abandon the mission after six days of pain or risk my life to continue. Miraculously, I found a route avoiding the worst of it and got to the end. Still, I’m glad I won’t have to do it again. Since then, I’ve become a father, and my appetite for danger has changed.I’m incredibly thankful to my viewers, whose support has enabled me to do these challenges full-time. I’m certainly not your typical adventurer. But if I were to have any label, that’s the one I’d choose – after all, isn’t it every kid’s dream?As told to Ed HardingDo you have an experience to share?

And turn things off and take a cool showerSamuel GibbsFri 20 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.33 EDTShareOpen windows (at the right time)It’s tempting to throw the windows open all day in the hope of a breeze, but when it is really hot outside, you only let in hotter air.Open the windows nice and wide overnight (if it is safe to do so) or early in the morning to let cooler air in, then shut them as the outside temperature climbs.Try to generate a through breeze by opening windows on opposite sides of your home or from top to bottom.Close the curtainsA lot of heat comes through windows as thermal radiation, which warms the surfaces and air in a room, raising the ambient temperature.Closing the curtains or blinds acts as a barrier, helping to prevent the heat from going further into your room beyond the window.View image in fullscreenKeeping windows covered helps prevent thermal radiation from entering your room.Photograph: Oleksiy Boyko/AlamyCover windows from outsideIf you can, hanging a sheet or other barrier over the outside of the window helps prevent thermal radiation from entering your room, which can keep it significantly cooler on very hot days.There’s a reason homes in hot and sunny climes have shutters on the outside of their windows.The British Blind & Shutter Association says research it commissioned at a London block of flats found that temperatures reached 47.5C in rooms without shading, whereas rooms that had external blinds fitted reached a maximum of 28C.The best fans to keep you cool: 14 tried and tested favourites to beat the heatRead moreGet a fan …Using an electric fan to move air around your home can help cool you, as long as the air temperatureis less than 35C. It will not cool down a room.Of course, fans come in various shapes and sizes, including pedestal, tower and desk versions, and with varying price tags.This week the Guardian published an article that includedour pick of the best fans. The best overall was named as the AirCraft Lume, a pedestal fan costing (at the time of writing) £119 from the online retailer AO. The one named as best budget fan and best desk fan is made by Devola and was available this week for £49.99.Buying an energy-efficient model will help with running costs and reduce the amount of heat that the fan’s motor creates.You can also position it in front of a window when it is cooler outside to encourage air to enter your home.View image in fullscreenNo fan of the heat? You could try blowing air over ice or bottles of frozen water to lower the temperature.Photograph: Tommaso Altamura/Alamy… or an evaporative coolerA step up from a standard fan is an evaporative cooler, which is essentially a fan that blows through a damp material. The water evaporates into the air, absorbing some of the heat energy and cooling the resulting breeze from the fan by a few degrees.They work best in dry conditions, though, so can struggle in relatively humid British summers.This week’s Guardian articleon fans also looked at evaporative coolers, and the one our writer liked the best was the Swan 5 Litre Nordic Air Cooler (£69.99).For a free version, you could – in theory – try pouring some cold water across a sealed, tiled floor, which will then evaporate to cool the tiles, though this could damage flooring material and will increase the humidity in your home.Use a dehumidifierDehumidifiers are usually associated with the wet winter months, but one of the factors that makes heat less bearable is high humidity, because it reduces the body’s ability to cool itself effectively by sweating. A dry heat is much easier to deal with than a humid one.If it is really humid in your home a dehumidifier can help keep you cool, though many generate their own heat as part of the process, so it is a balancing act.DIY air conditioningIt won’t be nearly as effective as actual air conditioning, but to make a DIY air cooler, all you need to do is blow air over something cold. There are many YouTube videos showing different ways to create your own air conditioning surrogate, but the most basic is a bowl of ice water in front of a fan. Just be very careful with water and electricity.Another popular technique is to use an old coolbox or polystyrene tub with a fan. Cut a hole in the top of the box big enough for a fan to blow into it, then cut an exhaust hole for the air to leave. Fill the box with ice packs or bottles of frozen water and let the fan blow straight down into the box over the bottles to pump colder air into the room.View image in fullscreenFire up the barbie? You could take your cooking outside.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBuy a portable air conditionerGetting a proper “split” air conditioning system installed can be very expensive, but portable air conditioning units aren’t nearly as pricey. They are usually the size of a small filing cabinet and contain the compressor and the fan in one unit. They have the downside of generating heat in the place you are trying to cool, which has to be pumped through a tube and out of a window.For short-term use in a heatwave, they can effectively cool one room, such as a bedroom or lounge. Cheap units cost from about £130, with good ones more in the £300 range. They consume a lot more electricity than a fan and are rated in British thermal units (BTU) for cooling power, so make sure you buy one powerful enough for the size of your room.Turn things off and cook outsideWhen it’s very hot, turn off anything that generates heat.Electrical appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, TVs, stereos, games consoles and computers can all generate quite a lot of heat over time when in use, while other devices such as your router or lights also emit a little heat.Cooking generates a lot of heat, so use the hob and oven sparingly and consider only cooking late at night when you can have the windows open.Alternatively, take your cooking outside using a barbecue, camping stove or similar.View image in fullscreenLick a lolly: ice lollies can cool you down whatever your age.Photograph: Cultura Creative (RF)/AlamyEat cold foodKeeping yourself cool and hydrated can help you deal with heat.Consider eating cold food such as sandwiches and salads or water-rich foods such as cucumbers and ice lollies.Fill up bottles of water during the evening and store them in the fridge overnight so you have cold water to drink during the day.Take cool showersTaking a tepid but not freezing cold shower is an effective way of cooling your body. You want to cool the skin as much as possible without exposing it to very cold water, which can cause your blood vessels to contract, trapping the warm blood from radiating your core heat away through your skin.View image in fullscreenAs cool as Kvaratskhelia: a cold compress to the back of the neck – as enjoyed by PSG’s players this week at the Club World Cup – is particularly effective.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersYou can also use a cold compress to cool parts of your body – something that can be particularly effective on the back of your neck, your armpits or wrists.Go window shoppingIf all else fails, take a trip to a place with air conditioning such as a shopping centre, supermarket, cinema orother cool spaceto recuperate.Some say that checking into a cheap hotel with air conditioning can also be a lifeline in the hottest of nights.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksConsumer affairsUK weatherEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So here are the best vibrators available.

I’ve worked as an expert independent research and development consultant for more than a dozen adult product companies; I’m a board member of theVagina Museumin London; I’m a campaigner for sexual health and gynaecological charities, includingTerrence Higgins Trustandthe Eve Appeal; and I helped write many of your favourite characters’ lines about dildos, douching and desire in the hit Netflix series Sex Education. All this means I’m well qualified to assess whether these devices have been crafted decently.I’m also a freelancer who works from home. I’ll leave it at that.Types of vibratorView image in fullscreenThe Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1.Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.BulletsSmall, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).WandsLarge vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.RabbitsThese vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation.The best bullet vibratorsBest bullet vibrator overall:We-Vibe Tango XView image in fullscreen£79 at We-Vibe£79.99 at SinfulThe original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.Why we love itIts Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which isexactlywhat tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.It’s a shame that …the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.Speeds:eightVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:two hoursCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbullet for innovation:Hot Octopuss AMOView image in fullscreen£49.95 at Hot OctopussAnother tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler. Hot Octopuss is a skilled inventor: its suite of ingenious toys includesPulse – the world’s first “Guybrator”that can induce orgasms from a flaccid penis as well as an erect one, proving a boon for cancer survivors, disabled people and others with erectile difficulties.Why we love itAMO’s ingenuity is in the way it’s sculpted, with a pointy tip for pinpoint pleasure; a broader head on the opposite side for more diffuse vibrations; and a fin-like profile for nestling lengthways between labia. It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.It’s a shame that …the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.Speeds:sixVibe patterns:fivePower:rechargeableRun time:40 minutesCharge time:two to three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestsustainable bullet:Love Not War MayaView image in fullscreen£99.99 at VeoIf you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink.Why we love itSeven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say,a rabbitora G-spot probe. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.It’s a shame that …at more than £50 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible‘Expect to see snake-like peeling’: 19 self-care treats for the perfect pick-me-upRead moreBest softand sensual option:Smile Makers The FirefighterView image in fullscreen£44.95 at Boots£49.95 at Beauty BayBullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.Why we love itThe fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.It’s a shame that …it only comes in pink.The Surfer, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:twoPower:rechargeableRun time:three hoursCharge time:two to two-and-a-half hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbudget bullet:The Rocks OffRO-90View image in fullscreen£5.50 at Rocks Off£15.95 at AmazonRocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.Why we love itIt’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety insidethe smaller RO-80 model. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to developa truly accessible toy range, Quest. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.It’s a shame that …single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them. I also question how the shiny metallic finishes might stand up to long-term cleaning.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:1 x AAA batteryRun time:three hours 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsThe best rabbit vibratorsBest rabbit vibrator overall:Je Joue Hera FlexView image in fullscreen£99 at Je Joue£109 at SheSpotThe Hera Flex is such a good problem-solver, it could probably win an algebra contest.Since everyone’s anatomy is different and distances between vaginas and clitorises vary, a frequent dilemma with rabbits is that once the shaft is inserted, the external stimulator doesn’t quite rest on the right spot. Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.Why we love itThis Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.It’s a shame that …there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWarranty:one yearBest for temperature titillation:Lovehoney Glow BunnyView image in fullscreen£79.99 at LovehoneyIf you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.Why we love itThe temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.It’s a shame that …the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:fourPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:100 daysBestfor air pulse stimulation:Womanizer Duo 2View image in fullscreen£189 at Womanizer£189 at BootsAdmittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.Why we love itThe firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preserved,andyou don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.It’s a shame that …the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features.Speeds:14Vibe patterns:10Power:rechargeableRuntime:two hoursCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:five yearsBestfor an innovative shaft:Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1View image in fullscreen£35.37 at Satisfyer£39.97 at AmazonSatisfyer is known for two things. First, making excellent-quality, more affordable “dupes” of aspirational high-end sex toys – almost like an Aldi version of Lelo and co. Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling outvastmultitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.Why we love itIt sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.It’s a shame that …it makes a noise like a car tyre inflator while it’s pumping up, and sounds like your vagina is sighing mournfully as it deflates. Put the stereo on, because this toy’s noises make for an inappropriate and distressing lovemaking soundtrack.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hours and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:15 yearsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.Why we love itI was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed bythe Yarrow: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean.

Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos onSnail Vibe’s websiteto see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile.It’s a shame that …the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.Speeds:five for each motorVibe patterns:five for each motorPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBest budget rabbit:BondaraScrewballMonAmourView image in fullscreen£45.99 at BondaraAn aesthetic homage to the popularLelo Soraya 2that costs significantly less.

The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.It’s a shame that …Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work).

The mains-powered Doxy Die Cast is arguably as hard as you can go. It’s not for the faint of heart (or parts), but it’s so powerful that it can probably conjure up an orgasm through walls. And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.Why we love itDoxy makes arechargeable Die Cast(£149.99) and several superbsmaller, lighter cordless wands, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.It’s a shame that …at 690g, it’s heavy as hell.

Turn on the domed head at the top for external body massage or the insertable shaft at the bottom to enjoy penetration and internal stimulation. Despite this toy having dual motors, you can’t run both ends at once – although only the most adventurous among us would need that.It’s a shame that …this toy doesn’t pack the power of pricier wands, and some prefer a material and design with more softness, flex and yield. However, it’s a great entry-level wand that gives you a chance to experiment with different stimulation styles and learn what you like before investing in a deluxe toy for three times the price.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hours and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsHow I chose vibrators – and what you should considerView image in fullscreenThink about what materials and textures feel inviting to you.Photograph: Getty Images/Pcess609At least 15 toys were tested in each category, with 53 tested in total. In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.What Ididn’tdo was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail” or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multifunctional/tech-enabled?What materials and textures feel inviting to me?A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, youalwaysreach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastlyenhanceshared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro, whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.What to do when your old toys finally dieIf all this toy talk has reminded you that you have enough bad vibes, shot bullets and dead rabbits gathering dust in your bedside cabinet to rival Watership Down, you’re not alone. Research conducted earlier this year by tech refurbishment specialists Back Market revealed that 15% of people keep old and broken sex toys stored ad infinitum because they’re embarrassed to throw them away. One in three surreptitiously chuck them in the household bin – even though anything with batteries, a plug or a charging port can be recycled. An unfortunate side-effect of increased sexual liberation and toy ownership is that worn-out erotic electricals are worsening the planet’s burgeoning e-waste problem, and valuable materials within them, including aluminium, gold, copper, lithium and steel, are being lost to landfill.If your ancient wand vibe is now more tragic than magic, head toRecycle Your Electricals, enter your postcode, then select Vibrator from the dropdown menu (yes, it’s a legitimate category). You’ll be given recycling instructions specific to your location; some councils will even collect your raunchy rubbish direct from your door. I’d wrap it in a bag, mind, for discretion.

A fast ferry gets you to the archipelago’s capital in under an hour. My tip is to spend the afternoon exploring the town, with its classic Falu-red wooden houses and gardens overflowing with flowers. But don’t take the last ferry back. Instead, find a spot by the water and watch as the midsummer sun refuses to set, bathing the islands in golden, pink light for hours. It’s a simple, accessible way to experience the magic of Sweden’s endless daylight without straying far from the city.PamelaFood, friendship and fire in ValenciaView image in fullscreenPeople around the bonfire on the beach for the festival of San Juan.Photograph: Ruben Olmo Morales/AlamyLast summer, while having a break in Valencia, I found out Spanish people mark 23 June as the beginning of summer by celebrating thefestival of San Juan. For a few nights around the actual date of San Juan, bonfires, wine and music on the beaches seemed to go on until dawn. The local family I was staying with invited me to choose some old furniture to burn on a beach bonfire and helped me throw it on before we danced round the fire holding hands and singing songs to pagan gods to burn the evil of the previous year! We barbecued anchovies and sausages we had bought at Valencia’s marvellous Mercado Central at midnight before throwing ourselves into the Med at 2am – a feelgood way to celebrate midsummer, full of food, friendship and fire!AprilCycle to the sun … or just EdinburghView image in fullscreenCramond beach sunrise, as cyclists on Ride to the Sun arrive.I’ve really enjoyedRide to the Sun– a 100-mile overnight bike ride from Carlisle to Edinburgh held on 21 June.

From shrieking swifts diving through the 19th-century market hall in nearby Auvillar to a turtle dove purring beside a rural road, it was this bird lover’s idyll. We heard nightingale melodies throughout the day as well as after dark, and caught the calls of cirl buntings, hoopoes and black redstarts. And it wasn’t just birds.

It is neither a “false premise” nor a “mad conclusion” to argue that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has the goal of restoring Russia to the status of a world power, and that the departure of the US would leave Russia “the dominant military power in all of Europe”. In reality, governments and independent experts from across Europe, ourselves included, have reached conclusions very similar to Dr Hill’s, as they are supported by empirical evidence – not least by Putin’s own overtly stated aspirations.One wonders what “precautions” the signatories would advise Britain to take in the event of a US pullout from Europe. The once – and perhaps still – friendly contacts in Russian officialdom that some of the letter’s authors maintain will not help.Roy AllisonSchool of Global and Area Studies, University of OxfordTimothy Garton AshFaculty of History, University of OxfordAnders ÅslundStockholm Free World Forum, Sweden (DPhil Oxford)Rostyslav AverchukVoxUkraine, Kyiv (BA Oxford)Jaroslava BarbieriRussia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House, LondonIan BondThe Centre for European Reform, LondonLaurie BristowAmbassador to Russia 2016-20, Cambridge, UKMaksym ButkevychPrinciple of Hope Foundation, Kyiv (MA Sussex)Edward Hunter ChristieFinnish Institute of International Affairs, Helsinki (MSc LSE)Ruth DeyermondDepartment of War Studies, King’s College LondonSasha DovzhykINDEX: Institute for Documentation and Exchange, Lviv (PhD Birkbeck)Marta DyczokWestern University, London, Ontario (DPhil Oxford)Julie FedorThe University of Melbourne, Australia (PhD Cambridge)Emily FinerSchool of Modern Languages, University of St AndrewsRory FinninFaculty of Modern and Medieval Languages, University of CambridgeLawrence FreedmanDepartment of War Studies, King’s College LondonMischa GabowitschJohannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany (BA Oxford)Ian GarnerPilecki Institute, Warsaw, Poland (BA Bristol)Keir GilesRussia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House, LondonPaul GoodeCarleton University, Ottawa, Ontario (DPhil Oxford)Thomas GrantWolfson College, University of CambridgeSamuel GreeneSchool of Politics and Economics, King’s College LondonAgnia GrigasAtlantic Council, Washington, DC (DPhil Oxford)Hubertus JahnClare College, University of CambridgePolly JonesFaculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of OxfordIvan U KłyszczInternational Centre for Defence and Security, Tallinn (IM Glasgow)Amy W KnightIndependent Scholar, Summit, New Jersey (PhD LSE)Natasha KuhrtDepartment of War Studies, King’s College LondonTaras KuzioNational University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (PhD Birmingham)Simon LewisUniversity of Bremen, Germany (PhD Cambridge)Klara LindströmStockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (BA Oxford)Bobo LoIndependent international relations analyst, Brighton, East SussexJohn LoughRussia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House, LondonEdward LucasCentre for European Policy Analysis, Washington/LondonOrysia LutsevychRussia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House, LondonClaudia MajorGerman Marshall Fund of the US, Berlin (PhD Birmingham)Luke MarchSchool of Social and Political Science, University of EdinburghDaria MattinglyDepartment of History, University of ChichesterMichael McFaulStanford University, Palo Alto, California (DPhil Oxford)Jade McGlynnDepartment of War Studies, King’s College LondonBohdan NahayloKyiv Post – Ukraine’s Global Voice, Kyiv/Barcelona (BA Leeds)James NixeyConflict Studies Research Centre, Shrivenham, OxfordshirePhillips O’BrienSchool of International Relations, University of St AndrewsOlga OnuchSchool of Social Sciences, University of ManchesterIngerid M OpdahlInstitute for Defence Studies, Oslo (PhD Birmingham)Carolina Vendil PallinRoyal Swedish Academy of War Sciences, Stockholm (PhD LSE)Peter RutlandWesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut (BA Oxford)Gwendolyn SasseHumboldt University of Berlin, Germany (PhD LSE)Anton ShekhovtsovCentral European University, Vienna (PhD UCL)James SherrRussia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House, LondonOxana ShevelTufts University,Massachusetts (MPhil Cambridge)Iryna ShuvalovaFaculty of Humanities, University of Oslo (PhD Cambridge)Timothy D SnyderUniversity of Toronto, Ontario (DPhil Oxford)Joanna SzostekSchool of Social and Political Sciences, University of GlasgowMaximilian TerhalleHoover Institution, Stanford, California (MA SOAS)Nikolaus von TwickelCentre for Liberal Modernity, Berlin (MA King’s College London)Andreas UmlandStockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (PhD Cambridge)Adam UreLvivski Consulting, London (PhD UCL)Fredrik WesslauStockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (BSc LSE)Sarah WhitmoreSchool of Law and Social Sciences, Oxford Brookes UniversityAndrew WilsonSchool of Slavonic and East European Studies, UCLKataryna WolczukSchool of Government, University of BirminghamStefan WolffSchool of Government, University of BirminghamMychailo WynnyckyjNational University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (PhD Cambridge)Yuliya YurchenkoSchool of Accounting, Finance & Economics, University of GreenwichExplore more on these topicsDefence policyForeign policyRussiaVladimir PutinlettersShareReuse this content"

Have fossil fuel lobbyists finally got to him?Monbiot is right to highlight our complacency with overfishing, but in our attempts to tackle industrial fishing’s worst abuses, especially unchecked bottom trawling, we should not demonise small‑scale fishers – our ocean’s most powerful custodians.Across the globe, small‑scale fishers using low‑impact gear in coastal waters are on the frontlines against industrial overfishing. They’re the first to feel the impacts of ocean decline and the best-placed to propose solutions.Is it true that “the fishing industry trashes everything”? No. Some gears, like bottom trawls, are indeed destructive and should be restricted. But small-scale fisheries using low-impact gears are the opposite. They use environmentally friendly methods to provide healthy, low-carbon food to coastal communities.Is fishing really “the most destructive of all private industries”? No. Fossil fuel, mining and chemical lobbyists will be smiling as readers direct their ire towards the local inshore fishing fleet.Should the UK government redirect funding away from fishing and let the industry fade? No. Current subsidies unfairly favour industrial vessels with outsized impacts. Redistributing funds and rapidly scaling investment in small‑scale fisheries would deliver dividends through resilient food systems, enhanced food security, sustainable livelihoods and greater climate resilience, alongside healthier ecosystems.Should the oceans be closed to fishing, bar a few gazetted areas? No. Coastal waters should be fully co‑managed with small-scale fishers to ensure they are stewarded for future generations.The world is awakening to the impacts of bottom trawling. Now it must wake up to the vital importance of small‑scale fisheries – and fast.Tom CollinsonAdvocacy manager, Blue VenturesI read George Monbiot’s article with interest. I am one of the producers of Rupert Murray’s 2009 filmThe End of the Line, which was about marine destruction, was funded in part by Channel 4, and broadcast by it. This film did not “carefully avoid” blaming the fishing industry, and an independent study showed that it had an impact on public attitudes, corporate behaviour and political policy.That film drew heavily on the previous work ofCharles Clover, who appeared in the film and whose 2004 book of the same title was a milestone in the campaign to save the world’s oceans.It is not just a question of making good and powerful programmes. Today, those have to have a celebrity at the front of them, and a lasting impact is achieved by a sustained and continuous campaign from civil society groups and journalism – in George’s words “those whose job it is to inform us”. My concern is that afterOcean, the BBC will think “job done” and everyone else in the media will agree.Christopher HirdDartmouth FilmsMany of us echo George Monbiot’s “At last!” in response to David Attenborough’s film. But I was disappointed that the names of the trawlers plundering the oceans were blurred. It is about time the international companies plundering our oceans’ ecosystems were publicly shamed.Environmental NGOs, especially local ones using citizen scientists to gather data in their own time and often unpaid, have amassed millions of pieces of relevant data, especially from inshore waters. Yet we still have long “consultations” on marine protected areas, usually resulting in nothing changing. I have completed four in recent years about Scottish inshore waters. There is collusion between UK governments and their national scientific and nature conservation organisations in this, and environmental NGOs, in fear of losing finance, grants etc stay silent.The government has procrastinated in ratifying the 2023UN high seas treatyagreeing to put 30% of these waters into marine protected areas. Ecosystems are the lifeblood of our oceans and ultimately us. Overfishing, short-term greed and financial returns are the name of this game.

We hope that now Shell will stop these shenanigans and sit down with us to sort this out. People in Ogale are dying; Shell need to bring a remedy. We thank the judicial system of the UK for this judgment.”A Shell spokesperson said that the company also welcomed the judgment. They said: “For many years, the vast majority of spills in the Niger Delta have been caused by third parties acting unlawfully, such as oil thieves who drill holes in pipelines or saboteurs.“This criminality is the cause of the majority of spills in the Bille and Ogale claims, and we maintain that Shell is not liable for the criminal acts of third parties or illegal refining. These challenges are managed by a joint-venture, which Shell’s former subsidiary operated, using its expertise in spill response and clean-up.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNigeriaOil (Environment)ShellOil and gas companiesOil (Business)AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The legislation promised byMark Carney, the prime minister, during the federal election, is meant to strengthen Canada’s economy amid a trade war launched byDonald Trump.The bill removes interprovincial trade barriers and aims to prioritize infrastructure projects, such as energy pipelines and mines deemed to be in the national interest.It is the latter portion of the bill that has caused concern among Indigenous communities over fears the government, granted broad powers, could speed up approvals for infrastructure and energy projects and override protest from Indigenous communities.Ahead of the vote, Carney defended the legislation, which was amended earlier this week to ease concerns from Indigenous leadership.“At the heart of this legislation is… not just respect for, but full embrace of, free, prior and informed consent. It has to be seen in parallel with very major measures that this government is taking to not just support those partnerships, but also to finance equity ownership in these nation-building projects forIndigenous peoples, Indigenous groups, Indigenous rights holders,” said Carney.Under Canadian law, the crown has a “duty to consult” Indigenous communities on projects that could adversely affect them. “Consultation, co-operation, engagement, participation is at the heart of C-5 and that is how you build a nation. And that’s very much how we’ve designed it,” Carney said.While the bill says the government must consult Indigenous communities in cases where their rights are affected by a fast-tracked project, it also allows the Liberal cabinet to overrule pre-existing laws to speed up permits for major projects.The federal legislation comes as provinces also pass bills that speed up infrastructure projects. Ontario plans to create “special economic zones” that would bypass all provincial laws, amid tensions between the premier and First Nations chiefs in areas slated for mining.Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, provoked criticism earlier this week criticized for saying First Nations communities “keep coming hat in hand all the time to the government” for more money. He apologized the following day after meeting with chiefs from the Anishinabek Nation, which represents 39 of Ontario’s 133 First Nations chiefs.“I get pretty passionate. And I just want to say, I sincerely apologize for my words, not only if it hurt all the chiefs in that room, but all First Nations,” said Ford. “I get passionate because I want prosperity for their communities.”Both the federal and provincial legislation reflect the friction between speedy resource and infrastructure development and the need to consult with affected communities that have beenhistorically marginalized, both socially and economically.Earlier this week Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the Assembly of First Nations national chief, warned the federal bill was being “rammed through” parliament.“First Nations are united,” she told CBC News. “They want prosperity, but they don’t want it at the expense of our rights.”Woodhouse Nepinak says she and other leaders across the country want the government to pause the bill for more study. But Carney is eager to pass the bill, fulfilling a campaign promise that his government would eliminate internal trade barriers by 1 July. Indigenous leaders have warned a failure to fully consult on the bill could lead to widespread national protests, akin tothe Idle No More movementin 2012.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyIndigenous peoplesInfrastructurenewsShareReuse this content"

This is very serious,” the exiled Nicaraguan writer Gioconda Belli wrote on social media.Neither Ortega nor his government commented on the case.Samcam, who was a political analyst, had spoken out frequently against the government in Managua, which he fled in 2018 to live with his wife in Costa Rica.That year, protests against Ortega’s government were violently repressed, resulting in more than 300 deaths, according to the UN.In January last year, another Nicaraguan opposition activist living in Costa Rica, Joao Maldonado, was shot while driving with his girlfriend in San José. Both were seriously wounded.Former Costa Rican president Luis Guillermo Solís called Samcam’s murder “for his frontal opposition to the Ortega and Murillo dictatorship” an “outrageous and extremely serious act”.“I feel thatDaniel Ortegaand Rosario Murillo are initiating a ‘night of the long knives’ … due to the regime’s weakening,” Dora María Téllez, a former comrade of Ortega turned critic, said from Spain, where she too is in exile.The Night of the Long Knives was a bloody purge of rivals ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in 1934.“They resort to the execution of a retired ex-military officer, who they believe has a voice that resonates within the ranks of the army,” Téllez told the Nicaraguan news outlet 100% Noticias.Ortega, now 79, first served as president from 1985 to 1990 as a former guerrilla hero who had helped oust a brutal US-backed regime.Returning to power in 2007, he became ever more authoritarian, according to observers, jailing hundreds of opponents, real and perceived, in recent years.Ortega’s government has shut down more than 5,000 non-governmental organizations since the 2018 mass protests that he considered a US-backed coup attempt.Thousands of Nicaraguans have fled into exile, and the regime is under US and EU sanctions.Most independent and opposition media operate from abroad.Pro-government media in Nicaragua did not report on Samcam’s killing.Explore more on these topicsCosta RicaNicaraguaDaniel OrtegaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Although this storm stayed off the coast ofMexicoand was relatively weak to other storms that have developed in this region, Dalila brought flooding and mudslides to the resort town of Acapulco, in western Mexico.On Tuesday, Hurricane Erick formed in the eastern Pacific, marking the fifth named storm in the region. Erick rapidly strengthened off the west coast of Mexico into a category 2 hurricane on Wednesday, before transitioning into a category 4 hurricane on Thursday, with maximum sustained winds of about 140mph. Despite having been downgraded to category 3 by the time it made landfall over the state of Oaxaca, sustained wind speeds still reached almost 130mph, causing major disruption. Large waves were produced by Erick, with the popular surfing spot Puerto Escondido seeing waves breaking at over 20ft (about 6 metres).Up to 400mm of rain is expected to fall through the course of the hurricane’s passing, bringing further flooding and landslides to areas that were already affected by Dalila late last week and earlier this week. Forecasts indicate the hurricanewill deintensify as it pushes north-westwards across mountainous terrain in Mexico.The tropical eastern Pacific is expected to continue to be active through the rest of June, with potential development areas being watched by the National Hurricane Center. In contrast, the Atlantic is expected to remain quiet for a time, but is still forecast to produce an above-average number of storms and hurricanes.Typhoon Wutip, which developed in the SouthChinaSea last week as the first typhoon of the season, moved north-eastwards through south-east China last Sunday and Monday, resulting in the death of seven people. Although the system weakened to a remnant low soon after making landfall with China, it continued to bring flooding, with 70,000 people evacuated as Huaiji county was placed on its highest level of flood alert.Explore more on these topicsMexicoWeather trackerAmericasHurricanesChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It urged staff to be diligent in “protecting” any students who were considering participating, and to discourage them.Another email shared on Edu Lancet, and seen independently by the Guardian, told faculty staff that any teacher who received an invitation from an embassy or a foreign organisation funded by an embassy must seek permission to attend from the principal for the purpose of “maintaining national security”.The Hong Kong education bureau did not confirm or deny the claims in response to questions from the Guardian, but in a statement said it had enacted policies to help schools “effectively prevent and suppress acts and activities that endanger or are detrimental to national security.“Schools have the responsibility to play a good gatekeeper role and to enhance the sensitivity of teachers and students to national security.”The bureau had enacted “clear guidelines” for schools that required them to “establish school-based mechanisms and formulate appropriate measures, according to their own circumstances and needs, to implement various tasks related to safeguarding national security and national security education”, it added.The bureau did not answer questions about what laws would be broken by attending any Fourth of July event, or whether such warnings only applied to the US holiday.The US Consulate in Hong Kong has been contacted for comment.Edu Lancet and Yeung, who runs the page to voice concerns from those working with the education system and “expose the current problems”, have been criticised by the Hong Kong government in the past for their posts. The security secretary, Chris Tang, has accused Yeung of “making incitements” from his current home in the UK.The purported directives fit in with tightening restrictions on Hong Kong’s education system, and a push to have the curriculum focus more on national security amid increased control of the city by the Chinese government. After pro-democracy protests rocked the city in 2019, the ruling Chinese Communist party imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that broadly outlawed acts of dissent and opposition as violations against the state.In 2020, the then chief executive, Carrie Lam,blamed the education systemfor fuelling the protests, setting the tone for an overhaul that is ongoing.The Hong Kong governmenthas since alteredtheschool curriculumto includeteachings on national securityin subjects such asEnglish language, music, maths and sport, and to focus more onpatriotic education. It has also banned texts it sees as endangering national security, including a picture book about sheep created by the city’s physiotherapists union,and prosecuted authors.Teachers in Hong Kong have previouslytold the Guardianthey felt pressure to self-censor for fear of being reported for remarks seen as unpatriotic. Since the start of the 2023-24 school year, all new teachers in public sector schools, direct subsidy scheme schools and kindergartens must sit an exam on Hong Kong’s mini constitution, the Basic Law, and the national security law.Hong Kong’s education minister, Christine Choi, hasrepeatedly warned of “soft resistance” in schools, and this month said educators had to be vigilant against the infiltration of “hostile forces” through events such as book fairs and extracurricular activities which “could include undesirable reading materials”.Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Addressing Hun Sen as “uncle”, she adds that if there were anything he wanted to “just let me know, I’ll take care of it”.Paetongtarn told a press conference on Thursday: “I would like to apologise for the leaked audio of my conversation with a Cambodian leader which has caused public resentment.”Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades, was succeeded by his son, Hun Manet, the current prime minister, in 2023, but remains politically powerful.Paetongtarn said her comments were a negotiating tactic, but this has done little to quell public anger.The Thai foreign ministry summoned the Cambodian ambassador on Thursday to deliver a protest letter complaining about the leaking of the call. The full version was released by Hun Sen after the initial clip was leaked.The phone call threw Paetongtarn’s government into chaos, threatening to destroy the uneasy partnership formed between her family and their former rivals in the military.The conservative Bhumjaithai party – the second largest in the coalition – pulled out of the ruling coalition, leaving her government with a slim majority. Leaders of the Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties held urgent talks on the crisis on Thursday afternoon but have not withdrawn.If another coalition partner were to pull out, it could make her position untenable and could force an election, or an attempt by other parties to cobble together a new coalition.Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, leader of the opposition People’s Party, earlier called for Paetongtarn to dissolve parliament to prevent groups from exploiting the situation “and inciting an incident that could harm the democracy”, warning against a military coup.Thailand’s government has been challenged by a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, and for the past two decades the country’s politics has been dominated by a power struggle between the military and Paetongtarn’s family, the Shinawatras. Her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in a 2006 coup, and her aunt Yingluck was removed from power by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.View image in fullscreenA royalist supporter holds a sign that reads “Thai government with Khmer heart Get Out” during an anti-government protest after the phone call leak.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersHundreds of anti-government protesters, some of them veterans of the royalist, anti-Thaksin “Yellow Shirt” movement of the late 2000s, demonstrated outside Government House on Thursday, demanding that Paetongtarn quit.Ken Lohatepanont, a Thai political analyst, said that “while a coup is no longer completely unthinkable” it did not appear likely yet, adding: “The democratic process has not yet reached an impasse.”Thailand’s military said in a statement that army chief Gen Pana Claewplodtook “affirms commitment to democratic principles and national sovereignty protection”.“The Chief of Army emphasised that the paramount imperative is for ‘Thai people to stand united’ in collectively defending national sovereignty,” it said.Paetongtarn, who has been in officeless than a year, is also facing legal threats. At least three petitions have been filed against the leader over the leaked call, including to the National Anti-Corruption Commission, accusing her of ethical misconduct and violating the constitution, and to the Central Investigation Bureau, accusing her of offences against national security. The Election Commission has also been urged to investigate.The crisis comes at a time when the Thai economy is struggling, with a fall in Chinese visitors hitting its tourism industry, and the threat of US tariffs of 36% looming.Paetongtarn has not responded to calls for her to resign, but has sought to convince the public that her government stands united with the military as it responds to the dispute with Cambodia.“Now, we have no time to fight among ourselves. We must defend our sovereignty, and the government is ready to support the armed forces by all means. We will work together,” she said.On Friday, Paetongtarn will travel to Thailand’s northeast, where clashes have occurred, to meet with Lt Gen Boonsin Padklang, the commander of the forces in northeast Thailand, whom she criticised in the call.With Agence France-PresseLittle experience and a lot on her plate: who is Thailand’s new prime minister?Read moreExplore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

The exchange has sparked a conversation online, with some saying they would never be brave enough to complain and others recounting their worst haircut experiences.Here Guardian Australia writers – in what almost became a group therapy session – tell us about their worst haircuts. You can share yours in the comments below.Graham ReadfearnI was in the middle of an almost year-long backpacking trip around the world in 2000. My hair was getting what I’d describe as quite lustrous but my then girlfriend had another word. Anyway, we were in a town somewhere south of Santiago and I gave in and found a barber. I emerged into the Chilean sun looking like the love child of a 1960s Paul McCartney andSharon Strzelecki. At least I didn’t stick out – every other male seemed to have the same haircut. And no, I don’t have pictures.Janine IsraelWhen I moved to London, paying for a haircut seemed prohibitively expensive. So I signed up to be a “hair model” (AKA guinea pig) at a fancy salon in Covent Garden. The waiver I signed meant I was handing myself over to the stylist to do whatever they pleased. My hairdresser said he wanted to replicate the hairstyle he’d given the day before to a woman with dead-straight blond hair on my shoulder-length curly brown hair. Then he proceeded to cut my hair to the length and shape of a cheap clown wig, with a bizarre band of 2cm-long tufts around the hairline. It might have looked edgy on the blond but on me it looked like a lawnmower had broken down midway doing through the job, and from the horrified look on the hairdresser’s sweating face, he knew it.Nick MillerQuite early in my career at the West Australian newspaper I switched from dark brown to blond hair, for no clear reason I can now remember. They stopped sending me to political doorstops as a brand protection measure. After that I had bright red hair and an eyebrow ring, again I can’t recall why, and they switched me to a desk-bound column job for a while, and the main editorial cartoonist drew a caricature that senior editors shared around afternoon news conference.Luca IttimaniI went on a TV show and said if I won the trophy I’d get a bowl cut with it. I won, and my mate put the trophy on my head and chopped. I do not have the straight Beatle-style locks required to keep a bowl cut flat so it just looked like half my normal wavy hairdo had gone missing.Experience: I’m a barber who hasn’t had a haircut in 43 yearsRead moreBut I was committed – I kept the cut for nearly a month, the constant expansion of the hair above my ears only accentuated by the absence of anything below. Who knew my forehead could look so big?Ben DohertyI’ve got a mate who’s a rock star. He’s admirably self-effacing about it but that’s what he is: a bona-fide, write-in-on-your-tax-return, rock star. We used to kick around in bands together but he was always destined for greater things: his life is now sold-out stadiums across the US, pool parties with the Wu-Tang Clan, his face on T-shirts.Allied to his extraordinary musical talent, this man has an effortless, charming charisma. He went and got a haircut that was very cool at the time: a supremely high buzz cut up the sides, betopped by a cheeky fringe. He wore it, it looked amazing. I thought, “Yeah, I could totally nail that.”I did not nail it. It was awful and aggressive and made me look thuggish. Photos from the time make me cringe. I think I ended up just shaving my head and starting again – chastened and altogether more careful about trying to be cool.Gabrielle JacksonI was going through a major life change in London – I’d quit my job and was planning to travel and write a book, so felt I needed a new haircut to reflect the new me. I decided to leave my old hairdresser of many years, thinking she was too edgy and “didn’t get me”. So I tried out a new, very expensive and “trendy” hairdresser in London, who had given friend the most perfect bob. At this new place they give you a glass of wine before the cut, so the stylist can get to you know you. Overcome by how cool the hairdresser was, I gave my consent to an asymmetrical bob.‘Claire, it’s French!’It was so bad – everyone I knew just stared at me dumbfounded. I went out for a drink and who was the only other person in the bar? My old hairdresser! And I felt personally attacked by theFleabag asymmetrical bobstoryline.Explore more on these topicsFashionMen's hairWomen's hairnewsShareReuse this content"

The labelling requirement includes the energy efficiency star-rating stickers often seen on refrigerators or dishwashers.Australians could be spared excessive power bills as Labor looks to stamp out price gougingRead moreBut the National Audit Office (ANAO) report found the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water is not measuring the program’s impact on reducing emissions. The report said the department “is not measuring the program’s impact on reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions and so cannot demonstrate whether the program is achieving its intended purpose”.Issues flagged in the ANAO report and could negatively impact its credibility, Pears said.Pears said the energy rating stickers “have a lot of credibility with people” and is “relied upon” by consumers.“The issue we face now is, if the program is not being properly administered – and clearly it hasn’t been – then the government and the energy sector too are at risk of … losing credibility with consumers.”The department has said the scheme has saved households and businesses between $12bn and $18bn in energy costs since the Act was legislated in 2012. Between 2021 and 2022, it said consumers saved between $1.3bn to $2bn, and greenhouse gas emissions were reduced between 4.1m and 6.3m tonnes.But Pears said the broad gap in estimated figures suggests the scheme isn’t working as intended.“The fact that there’s such a wide band reflects the fact that they have some idea but not a very precise idea of what the benefits are,” he said.Pears said that beyond the administrative gaps, the current minimum standards are “weak” compared to best-practice regions like the European Union or China.For example, the EU began enforcing a new rule this year for the energy consumption of electrical appliances in standby or off-mode, which it says will save consumers up to $950m between now and 2030.If Australia were to raise its standards, Pears said every household or business could save “thousands” of dollars over the lifetime of each appliance.“Because our standards are quite weak, we don’t necessarily get the most efficient products,” Pears said.Under the legislation, companies test their appliances in approved laboratories according to the minimum standards. Thedata is sent to the climate change department for review. If compliant, the appliance is approved for sale in Australia.The department can perform a “check test” on products to independently to ensure they are compliant.The audit said the number of check tests has been decreasing over recent years, and haven’t targeted areas with the “greatest risk of non-compliance”. In the financial year 2013-2014 the department conducted 188 check tests, according to the ANAO, but in 2021-22 just 61 models were checked.The department told the ANAO it aims to test between 60 and 70 products annually.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPears said this can allow some bad actors to get away with subpar testing.Pears said an effective testing program is similar to speed cameras on the road.“If you think you might get caught for speeding, you’ll obey the speed limit. With any regulatory system like appliance efficiency, if you think you might be caught, you’re much more likely to do things properly.”Since the program was established in 2012, the department has issued just four infringement notices, none which were paid or enforced. The audit office report said this could “limit the department’s ability to effectively encourage compliance and deter non-compliance”.ANAO’s report also found that, in many cases, the same person within the climate change department was in charge of assessing and approving or rejecting a product.“Without effective segregation of duties, there is risk that products that do not meet the requirements of the relevant Gems determination may be approved for registration. This also increases the risk of human error or corruption,” the report said.Pears also believed information on appliance efficiency stickers should be improved.

So if you’ve got a seven-star enormous television, that can still be using a lot more energy than a much smaller TV that’s got a low star rating.”The department responded to the audit, accepting all of its nine recommendations, and said work is already under way to improve the program.ANAO recommended check testing be targeted to areas with the greatest risk of non-compliance. It also recommended the department develop performance measures to assess the effectiveness of the program in achieving its outcomes.In a statement, the department confirmed it has established a taskforce to improve the program, and has begun “expanding the availability of check facilities” to encourage better compliance.Explore more on these topicsEnergyCost-of-living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

In January, 206 psychiatrists in NSW threatened to resign; 62 have resigned, while others await the commission’s decision.In closing submissions Thomas Dixon, the barrister for Asmof, pointed the commission to evidence it had heard about the “proliferation” of mental health patient presentations in the public health system in recent years, at the same time there has been a reduction in the number of public psychiatric specialists.Dixon said that in the five years from July 2019, the number of staff psychiatric specialist vacancies in NSW increased from 35 full-time equivalent (FTE) roles to 131, a near 400% increase.“Why is this occurring?” he asked the full bench. “The reasons are many, including pay … stress, overwork and concern for patient outcomes. All of these factors were caused or exacerbated by staff shortages.“Staff shortages are having a negative impact on the quality of patient care and integrity of the health system.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAccording to Asmof, psychiatrists are paid significantly more in states other than NSW. Salaries were up to 51% higher in Western Australia, 44% higher in the Northern Territory, 38% higher in South Australia, 28% in Queensland and 25% in Tasmania. They are 2% higher in Victoria, but Asmof said that in Victoria, as most psychiatrists do not work full-time, they are paid an hourly rate which amounts to 31% more than in NSW.Dixon reminded the court of evidence it had heard that giving a pay rise to psychiatrists would actually end up costing the government less than its current policy, which was to fill gaps in staffing with locums or visiting medical officers (VMOs). Dixon said that a full-time staff psychiatrist cost the same as a VMO working at 0.6FTE.NSW Health could save $35m a year by giving psychiatrists a 25% pay rise, modelling suggestsRead moreIan Neil SC, the barrister representing the secretary of health and the NSW department of health, argued that there was no evidence that increasing the pay of psychiatrists with a special levy would have any impact on the attraction and retention of staff, except for stopping those who had threatened resignation pending the outcome of the arbitration, which he urged the court not to consider.“Asmof loaded up the gun and pointed it at our heads,” Neil said of the mass resignation threat. “That ought not to be taken into account.”Neil told the court that increasing the pay for psychiatrists by 25% in an interim 12-month order was problematic in that it meant the commission would have to keep that pay uplift in other award negotiations going forward, and that it would not address the issue that Asmof hoped it would remedy.“Wage fixing is not an appropriate mechanism to address the problem of attraction and retention, of itself,” he said.“The problem of workplace shortages … are a much more nuanced problem that requires a nuanced response.”Neil was pushed by the justices to give an account of what the health secretary contended the solution was for the problem of attraction and retention, if not a pay increase, to which he said:“There is no simple answer to that question because it’s not a simple issue. It would be a simple issue if funds were infinite, it would be a simple issue if the source of trained staff specialist psychiatrists were infinite, but none of those propositions are true or realistic.”The full bench has adjourned to consider its judgment.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial relationsNew South WalesMental healthHealthPsychiatrynewsShareReuse this content"

Failure to comply could have lead to sanctions including fines or the blocking of the websites.France has gradually introduced requirements this year for all adult websites to have users confirm their age with details such as a credit card or ID document. The aim is toprevent minors from accessing pornography.But the Paris administrative tribunal on Monday suspended a government decree while investigating whether it was compatible with EU legislation. The French government has shared its intention to appeal to the Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court.Aylo said the decree’s suspension was an “opportunity to reconsider more efficient approaches” to age verification. The company argued that this was an ineffective mechanism that exposed people’s data to bad actors, hacks or leaks.“Requiring you to repeatedly provide sensitive personal information creates an unacceptable security risk that we refuse to impose on our users,” the company said in a message displayed on the sites’ homepages earlier this month.About 40% of children in France access porn sites every month, according to a 2024 study by France’s Arcom audiovisual watchdog.In a bid to preserve privacy, the government decree also required operators to offer a third-party “double-blind” option that would prevent the platforms from seeing users’ identifying information.Aylo, which reports seven million visitors in France daily across its various platforms, has called instead for governments to require makers of operating systems such as Apple, Microsoft and Google to verify users’ ages at the level of individual devices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We support the continuation of discussion with [Britain, France, Germany and the EU] and express our readiness to meet again in the near future.”Late on Friday, Donald Trump said he was unlikely to press Israel to scale back its campaign to allow negotiations to continue.“I think it’s very hard to make that request right now. If somebody is winning, it’s a little bit harder to do than if somebody is losing, but we’re ready, willing and able, and we’ve been speaking to Iran, and we’ll see what happens,” he said.Araghchi said he was willing to continue talks with his European counterparts since they have not supported Israel’s attacks directly. But he said Iran was “seriously concerned over the failure of the three countries to condemn Israel’s act of aggression” and would continue to exercise its right to “legitimate defence”.Israeli strikes have not knocked out Iran’s nuclear programme - or its nuclear ambitionsRead moreHe also said Iran’s capabilities, including its missile capabilities, are non-negotiable, and could not form part of the talks, a rebuff to the French president, Emmanuel Macron,who in an earlier statement said they should be included in the talks.With Israelidiplomats and military commanders warning of a “prolonged war”, the route to direct talks between the US and Iran remains blocked, leaving the European countries as intermediaries.After Friday’s talks between Araghchi and his British, French and German counterparts, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don’t see regional escalation of this conflict.”The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said there “can be no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem. Military operations can delay it but they cannot eliminate it”.The talks are being held against the backdrop of Trump’s threat that the US could launch its own military assault on Iran within a fortnight – a step that would probably turn the already bloody war into a full-scale regional conflagration.European diplomats said they came to talks to deliver a tough message from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and special envoy, Steve Witkoff: that the threat of US military action is real but that a “diplomatic pathway remains open”.But without direct talks between the US and Iran it is hard to see how an agreement can be reached to curtail Iran’s nuclear programme in a way that satisfies the US headline demand that Iran must never have a nuclear bomb.Trump suggested that European efforts would not be enough to bring any resolution. He said: “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this.”The European ministers said they had expressed their longstanding concerns about Iran’s expansion of its nuclear programme, “which has no credible civilian purpose and is in violation of almost all provisions in the nuclear deal agreed in 2015”.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Today the regional escalation benefits no one. We must keep the discussions open.”Earlier on Friday, Macron said the European offer to end Israel’s war would include an Iranian move to zero uranium enrichment, restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and an end to Tehran’s funding of terrorist groups.The proposals were surprisingly broad, spanning a range of complex issues beyond Iran’s disputed nuclear programme, and appeared likely to complicate any solution unless an interim agreement can be agreed.One proposal recently aired is for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment for the duration of Trump’s presidency. The concept of uranium enrichment beingoverseen by a consortium of Middle East countries– including Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – remains on the table.Macron, already accused by Trump of publicity seeking this week, set out a daunting agenda. “It’s absolutely essential to prioritise a return to substantial negotiations, including nuclear negotiations to move towards zero [uranium] enrichment, ballistic negotiations to limit Iran’s activities and capabilities, and the financing of all terrorist groups and destabilisation of the region that Iran has been carrying out for several years,” he said.In the previous five rounds of talks, the US insisted that Iran end its entire domestic uranium enrichment programme, but said it would allow Iran to retain a civil nuclear programme, including by importing enriched uranium from a multinational consortium.Iran claims that as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, it has an absolute legal right to enrich uranium, a position neither the European nor American powers have endorsed. In the past, European negotiators have proved more adept than their US partners in finding compromises, including the temporary suspension of domestic enrichment, a principle Tehran reluctantly endorsed between 2003 and 2004.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranIsraelTrump administrationEuropean UnionIran nuclear dealMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She has previouslyfaced criticism for not speaking upover the humanitarian consequences for Palestinians from Israel’s onslaught.The EU-Israel association agreement, signed in 1995, underpins a trade relationship worth €68bn (£58bn) between 27 European countries and the Middle Eastern country. The EU is Israel’s largest market and accounts for about one-third of its trade. Israel is also a member of the EU’s Horizon research funding programme, and has secured grants worth €831m since the current programme began in 2021.The document emerged after more than 100 campaign groups urged the commission this week to suspend the association agreement.“A weak or inconclusive review of Israel’s compliance with article 2, and/or failure by the commission and council to suspend at least part of the association agreement, would ultimately destroy what’s left of the EU’s credibility [and] further embolden Israel authorities to continue their atrocity crimes,” reads the statement, signed by 113 civil society groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.Eve Geddie, the head of Amnesty International’s EU office, said the decision to launch a review had come “tragically, devastatingly late” and that while it was important, as time passed Israeli forces had become “more and more emboldened”.Separately, eight EU member states have written to Kallas urging her to look into discontinuing trade of goods and services from the occupiedPalestinian territories.The letter, organised by Belgium, states the EU is obliged to respond to an opinion from the international court of justice last Julyordering Israel to end its occupationof Palestinian territories as soon as possible. In a landmark – albeit non-binding – ruling, the court said other states were under an obligation not to recognise the occupation as lawful.“We have not seen a proposal on how to effectively discontinue trade of goods and services with the illegal settlements,” states the letter, calling for the EU to set out a timeline for reaching “full compliance” with the advisory opinion around its first anniversary.View image in fullscreenThe Netherlands launched a call to review the EU-Israel association agreement after protests last month, which have continued (pictured: The Hague, 15 June 2025).Photograph: Paulo Amorim/VW Pics/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockEU policy on Israel has been hobbled by difficulties finding unanimity among 27 member states with starkly different views, from countries that have recognised Palestine,including Spain and Ireland, to staunch allies of the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.The tide turned last month when the Netherlands, a strong ally of Israel,launched a callto review the EU-Israel association agreement, afterthe largest protests on Dutch streetsover a foreign policy question in decades.The Dutch foreign minister, Casper Veldkamp, a former ambassador to Israel, argued that Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip was a breach of international law and therefore the association agreement. An unexpectedly large number of countries agreed, although the question was not put to a vote.The EU is far from united over what to do next. A full suspension of the agreement, which requires unanimity, is seen as impossible, given the certainty of a veto from Hungary, the Czech Republic or Germany.The EU only needs a weighted majority to suspend favourable trade terms or Israel’s participation in Horizon, but even those outcomes are highly uncertain.Hildegard Bentele, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament’s Israel delegation, criticised moves to question the agreement. “This will not have any influence on the Israeli government. I am very sure about it. This will put us in a less influential position,” she said in an interview earlier this month.Kallas’s predecessor, Josep Borrell, however, has criticised Europe for shirking its moral responsibilities over Gaza. In a typically outspoken speech, he argued the EU should use the association agreementas a lever to demandthat humanitarian law is respected.In a further illustration of the EU’s foreign policy knots, Hungary is blocking EU sanctions against violent Israeli settlers.Kallas earlier this week voiced frustration at critics that have accused the EU of silence and inaction, citing the need to find consensus. “Sanctions need unanimity. And again I’m representing 27 [countries].”She argued that presenting sanctions that would inevitably fail was pointless: “I feel better myself that I’ve done something, but actually I know that this will not go through … and then it will just show that we don’t have a common position.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelHuman rightsEuropean UnionGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesInternational court of justicenewsShareReuse this content"

The concept of uranium enrichment being overseen by aconsortium of Middle East countries– including Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – remains on the table.Iran has insisted it cannot abandon its right to enrich uranium within its territory, but the pressure to make concessions is intense both internally and externally.Macron aired his ideas on Friday as European foreign ministers held talks with their Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in Geneva. It is the first time Araghchi has met western-based diplomats in person since the launch of the surprise Israeli offensive against Iran a week ago.Araghchi has spoken this week by phone to the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and has told him he will not revive US-Iran talks in person until Israel ends its strikes.Before leaving for Geneva, Araghchi said: “In a situation where aggression … continues, the Americans want negotiations and have sent messages several times, but we have clearly said that there is no room for dialogue until the aggression and aggressor stop. We have no talks with America as a partner in this crime.”The talks in Switzerland are being held against the backdrop of a week of Israeli and Iranian strikes against each other. Trump, after days of threats followed by prevarication, said on Thursday he woulddelay for two weeksany decision on whether to join Israel’s military action. But such is the US president’s unreliability, in Tehran’s view, that it sees his commitment as valueless.The foreign ministers from France,Germanyand the UK have consulted the US closely but diplomatic sources said they were going to Geneva stressing their belief in de-escalation and the need for dialogue.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, met the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in Washington on Thursday to talk about the US red lines. The UK’s envoy to the UN, Barbara Woodward, warned Iran in a statement to the UN security council: “Any further escalation – such as restricting IAEA access, diverting nuclear material or increasing the production of high enriched uranium – would intensify the threat to international peace and security posed by Iran’s nuclear programme.”But she also told Israel that “military action cannot put an end to Iran’s nuclear capabilities”.Macron, already accused by Trump of publicity-seeking this week, set out a daunting agenda.“It’s absolutely essential to prioritise a return to substantial negotiations, including nuclear negotiations to move towards zero [uranium] enrichment, ballistic negotiations to limit Iran’s activities and capabilities, and the financing of all terrorist groups and destabilisation of the region that Iran has been carrying out for several years,” he said.He warned against the use of force, adding in a reference to Iran’s uranium enrichment facility atFordow: “No one can seriously believe that this threat can be met with [Israel’s] current operations alone.“Why? Because there are some [nuclear] plants that are highly protected and because today no one knows exactly where’s the uranium enriched to 60%. So we need to regain control on [Iran’s nuclear] programme through technical expertise and negotiation.”In the previous five rounds of talks, the US insisted that Iran end its entire domestic uranium enrichment programme, but said it would allow Iran to retain a civil nuclear programme, including by importing enriched uranium from a multinational consortium.Iran claims that as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), it has an absolute legal right to enrich uranium, a position neither the European or American powers have ever endorsed.In the past, European negotiators have proved more adept than their US partners in finding compromises, including the temporary suspension of domestic enrichment, a principle Tehran reluctantly endorsed in 2003-4.In the Paris agreement in 2004,France, Germany and the UK alongside the rest of the EU avoided the issue of whether Iran had a right to enrich by saying instead it recognised that Iran’s suspension of enrichment was “a voluntary confidence-building measure and not a legal obligation”.The UK position is that the NPT neither grants an absolute right to enrich nor bans it.Ellie Geranmayeh, from the European Council on Foreign Relations, warned against Europe making excessive demands. She said: “Over 20 years of negotiation, Europe has used its diplomatic experience to find imaginative solutions and off-ramps faced by extreme positions adopted by America and Iran.“It would be a lost opportunity if Europe, seeing Iran weakened, threw away the chance to play that role again by setting ultimatums that are even more demanding than the position adopted by the Trump administration, and which Iran will never accept.”Such is the tension around the talks that one of Araghchi’s advisers, Mohammad Hossein Ranjbaran, claimed Israel had tried to assassinate the foreign minister, and that guarantees had been sought about his safe passage to Europe.Russia has offered to mediate talks, a proposal rejected by European leaders.Iran may be in aweak position militarilywith its air defences down, but for as long as the US delays a decision on whether to use its unique “bunker busting” bombs to try to destroy the Fordow plant, the Israeli prime minister is in a quandary.Benjamin Netanyahu’shopes for regime changeinside Iran have also been dealt a blow since even opponents of the Iranian government, both domestic and foreign, do not support his assault.Narges Mohammadi, the Iranian Nobel peace prize winner, said in a message to Trump: “Not only do not join this war but seek to stop it and establish peace throughout the Middle East.”A large turnout for Friday prayers in Tehran suggested Israel had created an atmosphere of rare national unity in the face of an external enemy.That has left Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah and opponent of the regime, relatively isolated in closely associating himself with Israel.Some reformists are arguing internally that enrichment is a sovereign right but that if it comes at the expense of the country’s destruction, then that right should be suspended.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelFranceGermanyForeign policyEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

According to the IDF, the strikes prevented launch of missiles scheduled for later on Friday evening.Iran let off a rare mid-afternoon salvo of ballistic missiles across Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the entire country. At least one of the missiles evaded Israeli air defences, hitting an area by the docks of Haifa, wounding at least 45 people, 19 of whom were hospitalised. An Iranian missile also hit the southern city of Beersheba, where there were no injuries.As fighting continued to escalate, the Israeli military chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said Israelis must prepare for “difficult days” ahead.1:37Iranian missile strike damages Israeli hospital – videoHe said on Friday: “To remove a threat of such magnitude, against such an enemy, we must be ready for a prolonged campaign. Day by day, our freedom to operate is expanding and the enemy’s is narrowing.”Echoing the warning, Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, said: “We will not stop. Not until Iran’s nuclear threat is dismantled, not until its war machine is disarmed, not until our people and yours are safe.”Speaking in Geneva where he was meeting his counterparts from the UK, France and Germany, the Iranian foreign minster, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was determined to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty “with all force”.But there was no sign of any breakthrough, and Araghchi said Iran would only consider a resumption of diplomacy with Washington if Israel halts its bombardment.Late on Friday, Donald Trump said it was unlikely he would pressure Israel to scale back its offensive to allow negotiations, telling reporters: “I think it’s very hard to make that request right now. If somebody is winning, it’s a little bit harder to do than if somebody is losing, but we’re ready, willing and able, and we’ve been speaking to Iran.”António Guterres urged all parties to “give peace a chance”. The UN secretary general said an expansion of the conflict “could ignite a fire that no one can control”.Meanwhile, the UK said it had withdrawn embassy staff from Iran. Switzerland announced the closure of its embassy there.The UK foreign ministry said: “Due to the current security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw our UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely.”Countries have been working to evacuate their citizens from Israel, with the UK coordinating with Israeli authorities tocharter repatriation flightsonce Israeli airports reopen, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Friday.Israeli airstrikes on IranThe war started whenIsrael launched hundreds of airstrikes on Iranlast Friday morning, in what it said was an operation aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of missiles and drones, triggering a tit-for-tat cycle of bombing between the two countries.Israel knocked out much of Iran’s air defences in its initial wave of attacks and Israeli jets have operated with relative freedom over Iran. Iran has sent a steadily diminishing number of ballistic missiles into Israel and managed to get some past air defences,hitting a hospital in southern Israelon Thursday and injuring about 80 people.Israeli bombing has killed at least 639 people and wounded 1,326, according to Iranian media, while Iranian missiles have killed at least 25 people and wounded hundreds in Israel.Neighbouring states are concerned that an expanding war between Iran and Israel could have regional consequences, particularly if Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Yemen andLebanonget involved.Iran has threatened that if the US joins Israel in its bombing campaign it would target US bases in the Middle East, which hosts thousands of US troops across at least eight different countries.On Friday, the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, told the Lebanese militiaHezbollahnot to get involved in fighting between Israel and Iran.View image in fullscreenA Red Crescent rescue team at the site of an Israeli strike in Tehran on Wednesday.Photograph: Ircs/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockA western diplomatic source in the Middle East said: “The idea that if the US intervenes it will push all the proxies in the region to put it on fire, of course this is a scenario we need to take into account, but the whole [Iranian] axis is no longer the same.”Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies in the Middle East are severely battered from two years of fighting with Israel and by thecollapse of the Syrian regime– a significant Iranian ally – in December.The source said: “We are not worried more than we should be about what Qassem is saying. He’s just [saying] we’re not neutral and support in different ways. It would be suicide for them to get involved.”Iranian strikes on IsraelKatz ordered the Israeli military to intensify strikes on Iranian government targets in Tehran, including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij, an internal security force.Israel also said it had struck a weapons research centre in Tehran that it said was used for the development of Iran’s nuclear weapons project.Katz said the attacks were aimed at inducing “a mass evacuation of the population from Tehran, in order to destabilise the regime and increase deterrence in response to missile fire on Israel’s home front”. The Israeli military later announced it had hit the headquarters of the Basij.A spokesperson from the Iranian health ministry said Israel had struck a hospital in Tehran, which they said was the third Iranian hospital to be attacked since fighting began.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of an Iranian ballistic missile strike on the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon on Thursday.Photograph: Jim Hollander/UPI/ShutterstockAn Iranian missile landed in Beersheba in southern Israel on Friday morning, lightly injuring seven people and damaging nearby homes. Iran said it had aimed the missiles at the nearby Dimona nuclear facility.Araghchi met his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday in what the French foreign ministry said was an attempt to restart nuclear talks.Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’Read moreThe US has flirted with the idea of joining Israel in its attacks on Iran. The White House said on Thursday that Trump would decidewhether or not to intervenewithin two weeks. The time period is reportedly to allow a window for diplomacy to take effect, with the US wanting Iran to completely abandon its nuclear programme.Israel is keen for the US to jump into the fray, as only the US possesses the capacity to strike Iran’s most heavily fortified nuclear facility, the Fordow uranium enrichment site, which lies up to 100 metres under a mountain near the Qom.Privately, sources familiar with the deliberations for the US to intervene militarily in Iran have said Trump was also uncertainif the US’s most powerful bunker buster could indeed take out Fordow.Araghchi said discussions with the US would be impossible “until Israeli aggression stops”.The European diplomatic efforts were meant to jump-start US-Iranian discussions in order to avoid a US military intervention. They involved European states that, while opposed to Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, favoured a ceasefire rather than a prolonged military conflict.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranHezbollahLebanonMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The interruption in electricity supply was likely to have ruined many of the delicate centrifuges spinning at very high speeds enriching uranium hexafluoride gas in the underground facilities, according to an assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The nuclear complex outside the ancient city of Isfahan was also pounded in one of the opening salvoes, which hit its uranium conversion plant and another facility for making nuclear fuel for reactors. Satellite images emerged showing these sites pockmarked with holes.NatanzIshafan damageThe regime in Tehran, with all its pretensions of being a regional power, had told its population that the privations it had suffered over decades were a necessary sacrifice for the nation’s defence against its enemies, near and far. But under fire, the Islamic Republic was impotent to protect its own people, or even its top generals.The Iranian leadership appears to have stuck to the conventional wisdom that Israel could not destroy Iran’s deeply buried facilities such as the underground chambers at Isfahan and more importantly the Fordow enrichment plant, built into the side of a mountain, without US help.FordowThat assumption, at least, did turn out to be half true. By Monday, Israeli bombs appeared to have burrowed their way down to the Isfahan subterranean facility, but after a week, Israeli officials were still saying they needed US help to do significant damage to Fordow.What Iran did not expect was that Benjamin Netanyahu would start the war without US participation in the attack. Israeli officials said they had received a tacit green light from Donald Trump and guarantees of assistance in defence, though not in offence.By defying expectations and going to war anyway, Israel’s prime minister gained the great advantage of total surprise. Iranian intelligence had been lulled into complacency by plans for a sixth round of US-Iran negotiations due to take place last Sunday, and by Trump’s public remarks warning that an Israel attack would “blow” the chances for his own diplomacy.Iran’s spies would have also noted thatNetanyahu’s son’s weddingwas due on Monday, and that the prime minister was planning to take a few days off. Surely the long-threatened war would wait.View image in fullscreenMourners attend a funeral in Ahvaz for those killed in Israeli strikes.Photograph: Alireza Mohammadi/ISNA/ReutersWhen the bombs began to fall on Friday then, the shock was absolute. The first wave killed the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen Hossein Salami, and the army chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, the nation’s top military commanders, among several generals targeted.Six of Iran’s nuclear scientists were also killed, most if not all by airstrikes on their homes. By the end of the week, the Israelis claimed to have killed 14 scientists in an attempt to wipe out Iran’s nuclear knowhow.In the first sortie, 200 Israeli warplanes hit 100 distinct targets in part of an intricately planned operation, codename Rising Lion, which had been at least eight months in the making.The success Israel had in destroying Iranian air defences in a previous missile strike in October convinced the Israeli leadership that it had opened up a window of opportunity, during which Iran would be uniquely vulnerable, but the window would close over time.Latest strikes on IranNetanyahu said this week that Rising Lion was originally planned for April. However, the timetable was set back two months to allow Trump an opportunity to strong-arm Iran into giving up its enrichment programme at the negotiating table, so he could claim to have averted a new war in the Middle East.Ina letter in March to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Trump gave diplomacy 60 days to produce results and the clock began to tick with the first meeting between American and Iranian negotiators in Oman on 12 April. Last Thursday 12 June, was day 61 on that calendar, and that night the Israeli fighter-bomber squadrons took off for targets 1,000 miles (1,600km) away.Trump later claimed to have been in the loop all along. He bristled at the suggestion that he was merely given a “heads-up”. It was far more than that, he claimed.View image in fullscreenThe damaged headquarters of Iranian state television in Tehran.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APIt now appears that, having decided to attack after Trump’s 60-day pause, the timetable for Rising Lion was locked in by military requirements. The Mossad special forces and drones had been put in place inside Iran, specifically to target the sinews of Iran’s ability to strike back – its air defence and its ballistic missile launchers. They could not be left behind the lines for long. Their discovery would have compromised the whole operation.In the preceding days, as the rumours of war swirled around the region, Iran boasted it was primed to strike back with devastating effect. In the event, it was hamstrung. The generals who were supposed to give the orders were already dead by the time Iran knew it was under attack.The only Iranian response in the first hours of the war were 100 drones, which were easily shot down by Israel and the US before they reached Israeli territory. By the end of last Friday, Iran’s hastily appointed replacement commanders had scrambled to launch 200 ballistic missiles.Israel was able to intercept mostwith its multi-tiered, US-supported air defences, with Israeli interceptors rising up in clusters to meet the incoming threat, lighting up the night sky.A handful of Iranian strikes hit home, however, killing Israelis in Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion who had not sought shelter.Strikes on IsraelOver the course of the first week of the war, the confirmed Israeli death toll had reached 24, less than a 10th of the number of Iranian civilians killed by Israeli pilots striking residential areas in their hunt for regime figures and scientists.In response to the first Israeli casualties, the defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed that “Tehran will burn” if Khamenei continued to fight back with missiles. The Iranian missile salvoes kept coming throughout the week, however, though with smaller numbers in each barrage, as Israel hunted down and destroyed Iranian launchers.View image in fullscreenIsraeli security forces inspect destroyed residential buildings that were hit by a missile fired from Iran.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APBy Friday, IDF briefers claimed to have destroyed two-thirds of the estimated 400 launchers Iran had started the war with, suggesting Israel could be winning the race to blunt Iran’s primary deterrent before Israel ran out of stocks of its most effective and expensive missile interceptor, the Arrow 3.Meanwhile, it was Iranian civilians who took the brunt of the war. Over the course of the week, the roads out of Tehran have been clogged by families using their 25-litre fuel rationto try to flee the capital. The obstacles to leaving the city were doubled when one of the main routes out, the road to Qom, was blocked by bombing.Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’Read moreFrom the first day of the offensive, it was clear that Israel was aiming at more than Iran’s nuclear and missile programme. A gas refinery on the coast was hit, as was an oil storage facility on the outskirts of Tehran. Israeli leaders have referred to these as “ayatollah regime targets”, the pillars of the Iranian economy.Netanyahu has been increasingly clear that, while regime change was not a formal war aim, it was the desired outcome. Visiting a damaged hospital in Beersheba on Thursday, the prime minister called on Iranians to rise up against their rulers, while Katz declared that Khamenei “cannot continue to exist”.For all the Israeli grandstanding in the wake of a week of constant military successes, the ultimate outcome of the war hung in the balance on Friday.Trump declared he would take up to two weeksto decide whether he would send in US bombers into the fray, to target Fordow and other hard targets, potentially including Khamenei himself.View image in fullscreenA baby is evacuated from the site of a direct hit from an Iranian missile strike in Ramat Gan.Photograph: Oded Balilty/APThe announcement appeared to create an opportunity for diplomacy, with foreign ministers from the UK, France and Germanymeeting their Iranian counterpart in Geneva. It was questionable whether anything short of a complete Iranian surrender of the right to enrich uranium would satisfy Trump, and it would definitely fall short of Israeli demands.With US involvement, the damage inflicted on Iran would undoubtedly be more profound, but it is far from evident it would bring down the Iranian regime.The only real certainty as the war enters it second week, regardless of whether American planes join the Israel air force in the skies over Iran, is that the misery of ordinary Iranians is sure to deepen.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were women, children and young people among the injured because the people who went to receive the aid … came from all walks of life,” Abu Nasser said.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying either to reach aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a secretive US- and Israel-backed organisation that recently started to hand out food in the territory or, more recently,to offload the limited number of UN and commercial vehicles carrying flour and some other basics.Such reports are difficult to confirm independently but appear corroborated in many details by interviews conducted with witnesses by the Guardian.Khaled al-Ajouri, 33, of the Jabaliya refugee camp, said he had travelled early in the morning in the hope of getting supplies from the aid trucks.“I decided to stay a bit away to protect myself. I convinced myself that I was in a safe area. Suddenly … there were explosions and I was hit in my leg and chest,” Ajouri said.There were also reports of other casualties on Friday in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, with at least 12 people killed in an airstrike on a house belonging to the Ayyash family in the central town of Deir al-Balah.Mohammad al-Mughayyir, the director of medical supply at the civil defence agency in Gaza, told AFP: “Forty-three martyrs have fallen as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip since dawn today, 26 of whom were waiting for humanitarian aid.”Israeli military officialssaid on Fridaythat warplanes had attacked 300 “terror targets” in Gaza during the week, including individual militants, weapons caches and positions used to attack Israeli forces.One of the strikes killed a senior militant in the territory who had helped bury the bodies of two hostages seized during the attack led by Hamas into southern Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, they said.Israeli military officials say troops have fired at “suspects” they claim pose a threat to them.James Elder, a Unicef spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva that he had many testimonials of women and children being injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.“There have been instances where information [was] shared that a [distribution] site is open, but then it’s communicated on social media that they’re closed, but that information was shared when Gaza’s internet was down and people had no access to it,” Elder said.The GHF releases information about opening hours of sites primarily on Facebook, which many in Gaza cannot access.Food has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy. Many shipments have been stopped by ordinary Palestinians in Gaza and offloaded.There is also an acute shortage of fuel, which is needed for pumps on boreholes and Gaza’s sole remaining desalination plant. None has been allowed into Gaza since the collapse of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in March.Elder added: “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water for people in Gaza. Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40% of drinking water production facilities remain functional.”Fuel reserves built up during the pause in the 20-month war are now almost exhausted, aid officials said.Most of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems, reservoirs and pipeshave been destroyed. In March, Israel cut off power supplies to the main desalination plants, a vital source of water for Palestinians in Gaza.Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell aid.UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of the war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.On Wednesday, the GHF said it had provided more than 30m meals to the people of Gaza “safely and without incident” since it began operating last month.Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage during the 7 October 2023 attack, of whom they still hold 53.The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached more than 55,600, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Register your presence to receive further guidance.”The Foreign Office has now pulled its embassy staff out of Iran, which continues to be hit by Israeli strikes. “We have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely,” it said.Government advice in relation to Israel remains that British nationals should follow local guidance and take decisions on whether to leave based on their individual circumstances.Thousands of people currently in Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories are understood to have registered their presence with the Foreign Office, but the government has not moved to advise a general departure or relocation to Tel Aviv.Many of those registered are thought to be dual British-Israeli nationals who may not seek UK consular assistance, but a smaller number of people have made active requests for support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it was now transferring ownership of the project to the independent production company that produced it.Anger and frustration had been building for months over the status of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, with some involved in the film believing it was originally due to be broadcast at the start of the year. There have been concerns that some of those featured in the programmecould withdraw their supportover the delays.The BBC formally paused its broadcast after an investigation was launched into the making of another documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone. That programme waspulled from iPlayer earlier this year afterit emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The review into its production continues.However, the BBC said that after attempting to find other ways of using parts of the medics programme, produced by the independent Basement Films, it had concluded there were impartiality concerns and it would no longer be shown by the broadcaster.Susan Sarandon among hundreds to urge BBC to release delayed Gaza filmRead more“We wanted the doctors’ voices to be heard,” the BBC said in a statement. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review was published. For some weeks, the BBC has been working with Basement Films to find a way to tell the stories of these doctors on our platforms.”It added: “Yesterday it became apparent that we have reached the end of the road with these discussions. We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC. Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world’s most trusted broadcaster.”It also challenged claims the film had ever undergone the BBC’s final pre-broadcast signoff processes. “Any film broadcast will not be a BBC film,” it said.The decision comes after the founder of Basement Films, Ben de Pear, took aim at the BBC during a documentary festival this week, saying BBC journalists were being “stymied and silenced”. He directly criticised the BBC director general, Tim Davie, whom he described as “a PR person”.“All the decisions about our film were not taken by journalists; they were taken by Tim Davie,” he said. “Tim Davie is taking editorial decisions which, frankly, he is not capable of making.“The BBC’s primary purpose is TV news and current affairs, and if it’s failing on that, it doesn’t matter what drama it makes or sports it covers. It is failing as an institution. And if it’s failing on that, then it needs new management.”The decision also follows an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme by one of the journalists involved in the documentary, Ramita Navai, in which she described Israel as “a rogue state that’s committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, and mass-murdering Palestinians”.Challenged about her statement by the presenter Amol Rajan, who said that it was her opinion, she said it “isn’t my opinion” and that she had collected evidence during her work on the documentary.The BBC said it had produced “powerful coverage” of the Gaza war, including documentaries. “We have also investigated allegations of abuse of Palestinian prisoners and Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s hospitals,” it said. “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The newborn’s heel is pricked to collect a few drops of blood on a card that is sent away to be tested.Along with a greater focus on prevention, the 10-year plan is expected to include Streeting’s other “shifts” in the NHS, from hospitals towards more community-focused care and from analogue to digital services.Last week the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced that the government would increase NHS funding by £29bn a year in real terms over the next three years.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan will be published soon and will set out details for a range of initiatives to advance the NHS and make it fit for the future.”In October, the NHS in England announced it was toscreen 100,000 newborn babiesfor more than 200 genetic conditions in a world-first scheme aimed at bolstering early diagnosis and treatment.Explore more on these topicsGeneticsNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It will then need to be enacted through new legislation. If passed, it will make becoming a member of the group illegal.The decision comes as a security review begins at military bases across the UK, after activists broke into the RAF base inOxfordshireand sprayed two military planes with red paint.Palestine Action released a short video on Friday morning showing two people driving electric scooters unimpeded inside the airbase at night, in an embarrassing breach ofMinistry of Defence(MoD) security at a site that holds transport planes used by the king and prime minister.The group said it had targeted RAF Voyager aircraft used for transport and refuelling, and that “activists have interrupted Britain’s direct participation in the commission of genocide and war crimes across the Middle East”.Footage posted online showed two people inside the airbase in darkness, with one riding on a scooter up to an Airbus Voyager and spraying paint into its jet engine.0:40Footage shows Palestine Action breaking into Brize Norton airbase – videoAfter sharing the footage, a Palestine Action spokesperson said: “Despite publicly condemning the Israeli government, Britain continues to send military cargo, fly spy planes over Gaza and refuel US and Israeli fighter jets.”The group claimed its activists had evaded security and had put the air-to-air refuelling tankers “out of service”.However, RAF engineers have been assessing the damage, with a defence source earlier telling the BBC that they did not expect the incident would affect operations.Keir Starmer, the prime minister, condemned the action as “disgraceful” describing it as an “act of vandalism”.Counter-terrorism police are investigating the incident alongside Thames Valley police and the MoD.RAF Brize Norton serves as the hub for UK strategic air transport and refuelling, including flights to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The air force has conducted reconnaissance flights over Gaza out of the Cyprus base.Other groups that have been recently proscribed in the UK include Hizb ut-Tahrir, a Sunni Islamist organisation with a goal to establish a caliphate under sharia law. It was banned last year by the Tory government. The Wagner group, the Russian private military company, was banned in 2023.After reports of the impending ban emerged, Palestine Action wrote on X: “We represent every person who stands for Palestinian liberation. If they want to ban us, they ban us all.”The Palestine Solidarity Campaign wrote on the same platform that it was “outrageous” that the government was banning “a non-violent direct action group”.Palestine Action was founded in 2020 by Huda Ammori, whose father is Palestinian, and Richard Barnard, a leftwing activist.The organisation, which focuses its campaigns on multinational arms dealers and corporate banks, recently targeted a factory in Shenstone claiming it made drones for the Israeli army.“Using disruptive tactics, Palestine Action targets corporate enablers of the Israeli military-industrial complex,” it says on its website. “Palestine Action takes strategic, sustained and focused direct action against key targets.”A proscribed organisation is an organisation or group that it is illegal to join or show support for, because it has been identified as being concerned in terrorism.The home secretary has the power to proscribe an organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000 if that organisation commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism – including the unlawful glorification of terrorism – or is otherwise concerned in terrorism.Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismRoyal Air ForceMinistry of DefenceMilitaryOxfordshireEnglandIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

It may also have inspired one driver who got stuck trying to travel down the Spanish Steps in Rome this week.The film ended with Michael Caine teetering on the edge of a cliff in a coach, claiming to have a “great idea”. In Rome, the 80-year-old’s navigational error on his way to work ended with emergency services having tobring in a craneto winch his vehicle off the Italian capital’s landmark.But it is not only in Rome where steps, or indeed navigational issues, can create havoc for drivers. In the slightly less celebrated surrounds of north London’s Maitland Park estate, residents have been complaining about drivers getting their cars stuck trying to rehash one of the film’s most famous scenes by driving down a small flight of steps.According to the Camden New Journal,five cars met their matchon the five concrete steps within the space of a month last year, with some of the drivers reportedly blaming their satnav apps for leading them there.View image in fullscreenMichael Caine in The Italian Job (1969).Photograph: Paramount/AllstarOne resident, Aron Kennedy, posted online about the phenomenon, which he referred to as a “new Camden tourist attraction along with Karl Marx”. He told the paper: “If it happens one more time I think we might have to get a living statue of a car stuck there permanently.”In Plymouth in 2017, it was reported that a driver turned off a road, through the gap in railings at a pedestrian crossing, across the pavement and through a covered walkway leading under a block of flats and a small supermarket, before parking the silver Vauxhall Corsa facing downwards on a flight of steps. All because the satnav had reportedly said to turn left at Tesco.And so many lorries have got stuck following their satnavs down a narrow country lane in Cornwall that one man reportedly paid £150 for a large yellow sign that read, in block capitals: “Do not follow satnav. This route is unsuitable. You will get stuck.” According to a local newspaper report last month, this was not enough to stop it happening yet again.In Somerset, by a 6ft-wide lane, stands a house that has reportedly sustained £50,000 of damage over several years from HGV drivers trying to force their way past while following directions on their devices.And those are just domestic tales of driving woe. Driving when abroad can be particularly confusing. Guardian readers have been sharing some of their own experiences.Otieno Okatch said he and his wife, from California, rented a car in Switzerland during the annual Fasnacht celebrations. “One day, we ended up in downtown Lucerne and got lost. The streets were oddly empty. We turned the corner and had inadvertently entered the city Fasnacht parade. We were mortified. A police escort had to help us get out as thousands stared at the two foreigners.”Anand Ranganathan, also from California, told of an experience when he and his wife were in Arles, France, while touring the country about 14 years ago. Forced by hefty mobile roaming charges to follow printed-out Google Maps directions to their hotel, they were sent down a “one-lane road that had a retractable bollard in the middle of it”.He said: “Only drivers who had a special code were allowed to go through it … Of course, we didn’t realise this until we got close to the bollard. Now we were stuck. There was a line of cars behind us and a bollard in front of us … The cars behind us were honking, the driver immediately behind us was cursing us in well-considered French, and I was standing there gesticulating to indicate that I was but a lost tourist.”To stairs in London and Devon, and narrow lanes in Cornwall and Bouches-du-Rhône, add for one driver a picturesque flight of steps in the heart of the Italian capital.Explore more on these topicsItalyRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Organisers say a lack of name recognition for Clarke – the reason they want the statue in the first place – is preventing them reaching their £60,000 target.View image in fullscreenA resin model of the Mary Clarke statue along with a copy of her lamp.Photograph: Andy Winter“Mary was injured in thenotorious violence of Black Friday on 18 November 1910, later imprisoned for one month, enduring a hunger strike and, reportedly, forcible feeding,” said Calder. “She died of a brain haemorrhage on Christmas Day 1910, two days after her release from prison.”Birgit Miller, a cabinet member for culture, heritage and tourism at Brighton and Hove council, said although the campaign had all-party support, cuts meant the council could not fund it.“Remembering Mary is important because she dedicated her life – and ultimately sacrificed it – so women like me could have a vote,” said Miller.She believes Clarke has been forgotten because she died so early in the suffrage campaign. “It was only those who had been following the fight since its beginning who would have remembered who she was,” she said.Prof Julie Gottlieb, who was on the panel advising which names should appear on Fawcett’s plinth, said Clarke’s was never considered, even though her sister Emmeline is commemorated along with her three nieces.“Our priority was to be as representative as possible across all kinds of lines: demographic, political, ethnic, gender, religious and class,” she said. “I think the balance that was struck was fair and successful.”Clarke’s story, however, still has the power to inspire younger generations. River Isaac was seven when she read about the statue appeal in a newspaper.“I had been wanting to write to our headteacher to campaign for better football facilities for girls but had been too scared,” she said. “But then I thought how Mary Clarke had done all these things, even though she must have been scared, and decided it was no reason for not doing something.”Not only was Isaac’s appeal to the headteacher a success but she and some friends then set up the Mary’s Lamp group, asking Brighton councillors questions about women’s rights and highlighting discrimination against girls in Afghanistan.Women are hugely underrepresented in UK public art, statues and memorials: excluding royals, there are just over 100 statues honouring a specific woman for her achievements.“Visibility of women like Mary Clarke is important and we agree there should be a statue to celebrate her sacrifice in the campaign for suffrage,” said Penny East, the chief executive of theFawcett Society.Brighton was the territory where Clarke campaigned before her death at the age of 49.Explore more on these topicsWomen's suffrageWomen (Society)Emmeline PankhurstActivismFeminismWomen (Life and style)HeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

This mechanism was due to end next April, creating a “cliff-edge” that threatened to bankrupt scores of councils.‘Ticking timebomb’: how Send spending could bankrupt English councilsRead moreThe override will now run until April 2028, the government announced aspart of its wider reformsto revitalise local government funding in England.Iain Murray, director of public financial management at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the changes have not fixed the fundamental pressures facing local governments.Murray said: “Without urgent solutions to both existing and future Send deficits, those councils grappling with unsustainable high-needs costs and rapidly growing cumulative deficits may, at best, be forced to make further reductions in essential services, and at worst, risk declaring themselves effectively bankrupt.”The Local Government Association has said more than half of councils risked becoming insolvent if the override ended next April. AGuardian investigationrevealed in March that their combined deficits would reach £5.2bn by the end of this year.The additional borrowing is likely to reach £200m a year in interest payments and associated costs, as well as lost income from investments and assets as councils use up their reserves to cover the deficits and loans.Tim Oliver, chair of the County Councils Network, said: “Council leaders can breathe a sigh of relief knowing they no longer face a financial cliff edge in nine months’ time.View image in fullscreenHelen Hayes, the Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, chairs the Commons education committee.Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian“We now need to ensure that the government’s commitment to support councils to manage their Send deficits rings true.“Despite the extension of the statutory override, many councils still face a number of issues, including rising debt outstripping reserves, mounting interest payments and lost investment income. For some, this could mean reducing services elsewhere or running into extreme financial difficulty.“Therefore, it is critical government sets out a comprehensive solution later this year. This should include writing off deficits and compensating councils … ensuring that the slate is wiped clean.”Helen Hayes, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons education committee, said the extension was a “temporary fix”, and warned: “The government should not delay a permanent resolution to local authorities’ long-term Send deficits beyond 2028 and it must work to devise a solution that helps councils to achieve long-term financial sustainability and does not damage their finances further.”Council high-needs budgets have been under pressure from the sharp rise in children with special needs, with the number requiring extra resources detailed in education, health and care plans (EHCPs) rocketing in recent years.Nearly one in five schoolchildren in England now have recognised special educational needs, according to Department for Educationfigures, including 482,600 children with EHCPs.The government said it will use the two-year delay to reform how the Send system works and is funded. In that time ministers say they intend to deal with the high-needs deficits, despite only raising central funding for local government 1.1% a year on average until 2028-29.A government spokesperson said: “This government inherited a Send system left on its knees, which is why we are looking at changes through our plan for change to improve support for children and stop parents having to fight for help while bringing about financial sustainability for councils.Councils in England warn of mass bankruptcies as Send deficits soarRead more“We will set out our full plans for reform in the autumn, including our approach to supporting councils with their deficits, to deliver excellence everywhere for every child.”Othermeasures in the consultationwill see government grants moved away from wealthier urban centres such as London towards to places with higher deprivation levels, as well as rural authorities and tourist hotspots where funding does not account for surges in visitors.Officials say the move will not lead to higher council taxes, in part because the government’s financial forecasts assume councils putting council tax up by 4.99% – the maximum increase without holding a referendum.Jack Shaw of Manchester University, an expert in local government, said: “The longstanding failure to reform council tax has had a more detrimental impact on councils outside London and the south-east, so it’s right that funding is corrected to take that into account. Some authorities will lose out, but there are transitional arrangements to mitigate that.“Council cuts under the Conservatives mean that it’ll take some time to put them on a more sustainable footing. Funding reform will improve the fortunes of many councils, but they’ll continue to face acute financial challenges.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSend crisis: a system at breaking pointLocal governmentSchoolsCouncil taxEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

That ends now,” said Kari Lake, Trump’s senior advisor to USAGM, inFriday’s termination announcement.VOA once reached 360 million people weekly across dozens of languages, former USAGM CEO and director John Lansingtold Congress in 2019. In March, the White Houseput out a statementcalling the outlet “propaganda”, “leftist” and dubbed it “The Voice of Radical America”. One of the examples cited to justify that explanation was VOA’s refusal to use the term “terrorist” to describe members of Hamas unless in statements, which falls in line with common and basic journalistic practice.The cuts represent a major retreat from America’s Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to reach audiences behind the iron curtain. VOA had evolved from its wartime origins to become a lifeline for populations living under authoritarian rule, providing independent news and an American perspective in regions where press freedom is under assault.The layoffs also came just days afterVOA recalled Farsi-speaking journalistsfrom administrative leave to cover the war between Israel and Iran, after Israel shot missiles at Tehran less than a week ago in the dead of night.“It spells the death of 83 years of independent journalism that upholds US ideals of democracy and freedom around the world,” said three VOA journalists, Patsy Widakuswara, Jessica Jerreat and Kate Neeper, who are leading legal challenges against the demolition, in a statement.The agency’s folding began in March when Trump signed an executive order targeting federal agencies he branded as bloated bureaucracy, and VOA staff were placed on paid leave and broadcasts were suspended.Lake, Trump’s handpicked choice to run VOA, had previously floated plans to replace the service’s professional journalism with content from One America News Network (OANN), a rightwing pro-Trump network that would provide programming without charge.The sole survivor of the cull is the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which transmits into Cuba from Florida. All 33 employees there remain, according to the announcement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The state has separately stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be able to sold there by 2035.Although states are typically not allowed to set their own standards aside from the federal Clean Air Act, California has been given unique authority to do so via a waiver that has seen it become a pioneer in pushing for cleaner cars. Other states are allowed to copy California’s stricter standard, too.But oil and gas companies, as well as Republican politicians, have complained about the waiver, arguing that it caused financial harm. The waiver was removed during Donald Trump’s first term but then reinstated by Joe Biden’s administration.Last week, Trump again moved to end the waiver,signinga congressional disapproval of California’s move to cut pollution and shift new cars and trucks to become electric over the next decade. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor and a Democrat, who is in a hugehead-to-head battlewith the White House over theLos Angeles protestsand state power, amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, has called this move illegal and has said the state will sue.The justices’ ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit by a ValeroEnergysubsidiary and fuel industry groups.The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 EPA decision to let California set its own regulations.“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the decision.The lower court had previously ruled that the oil and gas industry didn’t have legal standing to attempt to topple the California waiver but a challenge to this reached the supreme court, which appeared sympathetic to the claim when the case was heard in April. “It’s not that high a burden,” Amy Coney Barrett, one of the justices, said about proof of the alleged harm.California and the federal government have been allowed to “stretch and abuse” the Clean Air Act, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the groups challenging the waiver, has complained.But environmentalists and California’s Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it has helped push forward vehicle innovation and help cut greenhouse gases. Transportation is responsible for more planet-heating pollution in the US than any other sector.“California and other clean car states cannot achieve federal clean air standards and protect communities without reducing harmful transportation pollution,” said Andrea Issod, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. “We stand with these states to defend their well-established authority to set standards for clean cars.”The supreme court’s ruling on Friday does not in itself end California’s standards to cut pollution from vehicles, said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.“The standards have saved hundreds of lives, have provided enormous health benefits, and have saved families money,” Patton said.“While the supreme court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court, the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does it alter the life-saving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaDemocracy and justiceWest CoastPollutionFossil fuelsEnergyUS supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

While it is impossible to say for sure what the challenger’s motives are in this case, the James Bond trademark portfolio and its legacy value does make it an enticing target for opportunists, and further cancellation attempts can’t be ruled out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spinoffs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould steer the next Bond film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named.Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.

We hope that now Shell will stop these shenanigans and sit down with us to sort this out. People in Ogale are dying; Shell need to bring a remedy. We thank the judicial system of the UK for this judgment.”A Shell spokesperson said that the company also welcomed the judgment. They said: “For many years, the vast majority of spills in the Niger Delta have been caused by third parties acting unlawfully, such as oil thieves who drill holes in pipelines or saboteurs.“This criminality is the cause of the majority of spills in the Bille and Ogale claims, and we maintain that Shell is not liable for the criminal acts of third parties or illegal refining. These challenges are managed by a joint-venture, which Shell’s former subsidiary operated, using its expertise in spill response and clean-up.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNigeriaOil (Environment)ShellOil and gas companiesOil (Business)AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s one thing after another,” Stiglitz said.The report warns that many governments, fearful of the consequences of default, “prioritise timely debt payments over essential development spending. This is not a path to sustainable development. Rather, it is a roadblock to development and leads to increasing inequality and discontent.”The HIPC debt relief programme emerged out of a concerted campaign by civil society groups, including churches, calling for a “jubilee” for cash-starved developing countries.The initiative saw more than $100bn of debt cancelled – including as a result of commitments made at theGleneagles G8 summit, chaired by the UK.With 2025 designated a jubilee year by the Catholic church, Pope Francis commissioned the new report, to explore how the current debt crisis could be tackled. He called last year for “an international mechanism for debt restructuring based on the solidarity and harmony of peoples.” The report will be presented to his successor, Leo XIV, at the Vatican on Friday.The research underscores the gravity of the situation for many countries, warning: “The consequences are particularly acute in Africa, where debt distress is most severe. Approximately 57% of the continent’s population – 751 million people, including nearly 288 million living in extreme poverty – reside in countries that spend more on servicing external debt than on education or healthcare.”The authors warn that the impact is likely to be rising poverty and malnutrition, the “erosion of hope” and “deepening social fractures”.They also point out that the situation is more complex than in the early 2000s, when much of the debt was owed to governments, or other public sector bodies.“The international community has a moral obligation to advance a ‘HIPC II.’ However, the challenges of implementing such a comprehensive solution today are greater than those faced during the original HIPC initiative,” the report says.As well as debt write-offs, the report argues for a series of technical and legal changes to the global financial system, to tackle the debt crisis and prevent it recurring again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only does owning one confer countless perks and the kind of societal status that most money can’t even buy, but team valuations in the major North American sports have been on a steep upslope for decades. The sale of the Lakers represents a new peak and is also the latest data point that illustrates a new fact about sports ownership. The best properties have become too valuable an asset class for people like Jeanie Buss to control them.Lakers to be sold to Dodgers owner at $10bn valuation, per reportsRead moreBuss’ father, Jerry, bought the team in 1979, and the Lakers have since then operated like one of the world’s largest family businesses. The Lakers are by far the biggest source of the Buss family’s wealth, andas ESPN reported on Thursday, the team has traditionally used its own revenues to pay its expenses. Its golden goose is an enormous local television deal with the LA cable provider Spectrum.The cable bundle is dying, however, and these days the biggest sports teams are increasingly owned not by wealthy individuals and families but by consortiums of deep-pocketed investors and institutions. The Lakers had already moved in this direction; the Buss family sold a quarter stake in the team to a group led by Walter in 2021. That same group – with Walter as the frontman, but by no means doing it alone – took control of the Dodgers in 2012 and later bought control of the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks.Blue-chip sports properties like the Lakers are now too big for even most billionaires to just reach into their pocket and buy all alone. For that reason, leagues have gradually made it much easier for institutional investors to buy stakes in teams. (The NFL, with limits,has swung open the door to private equity.) The corollary to that trend is that when a longtime owner like Jeanie Buss has buyers lined up with enough liquidity to secure her family fortune in cash, rather than ownership of a team, she’s likely to jump at it.The Lakers’ new owners are likely to do very well on their investment. The decline of cable is a major threat to professional sports teams, and some smaller-market clubs in the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball have taken substantial cash flow hits as regional carriers have faded. But the Lakers are so entwined with one of the world’s largest cities that to bet against their continued growth is to bet against the future popularity of basketball, the city of Los Angeles and live entertainment altogether. Angelenos will not stop buying Lakers tickets and, even more critically, will not stop happily paying to watch 82 games per year, whether they’re doing that on a streamer or traditional TV. The Lakers are too big to fail, and some time down the line, someone will value them at well more than $10bn.View image in fullscreenAn investment group led by LA Dodgers owner Mark Walter, above, now holds a majority stake in the Lakers.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesThe sale will probably be good for Lakers fans, though they are not the priority in any transaction of this type. Walter’s group has done wonders with the Dodgers, seizing on the franchise’s natural advantages – a rabid fanbase and a location players want to play in – and turned the team into the most consistent winner in baseball. It is harder to flex a financial advantage in the NBA than in salary cap-less MLB, but Walter’s Dodgers have become the teamwith the best reputation among ballplayers. Not that the Lakers have a hard time attracting stars, but one could imagine them attracting even more of the players they covet. At the end of the day, isn’t that kind of product what fans want to see?While this will all likely go fine for the Lakers, the shift in ownership models does raise questions about what will become of sports teams thatdon’tdefy gravity by their very existence. Plenty of individual club owners have been massive flops who have earned the endless scorn of their clubs’ fans. But the fact of having one highly visible, specific owner has at least rendered a version of accountability. After all, it’s easier for Manchester United fans to chant “Glazers out!” than it would be to chant “shadowy consortium of institutional investors out!” A move toward large groups of investors controlling iconic teams will make it easier for individual actors to milk them for cash without facing the kind of public shaming that has long been possible for teams with more identifiable villains in the owner’s suite. The Lakers are big enough and successful enough that this dynamic might never come to a head. Most teams can’t say the same.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersNBAUS sportsBasketballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Paul was arrested in March 2024 – the same day federal agents conducted multiple searches related to the Combs’ investigation.Prosecutors are winding down their case after six weeks of testimony from an array of witnesses ranging from ex-girlfriends and former employees to male sex workers andthe rapper Kid Cudi. Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, evenmade a surprise appearanceat the courthouse.The prosecution seeks to convince the jury that Combs oversaw a sprawling racketeering enterprise for two decades that relied on obedience by employees willing to do anything for him, including buying drugs when necessary.View image in fullscreenBrendan Paul, who played for Syracuse, was alleged to be a drug mule for Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and arrested on cocaine and marijuana possession charges in 2024.Photograph: Rich Barnes/Getty ImagesDefense lawyers say Combs did not commit federal crimes, although they acknowledge that prosecutors have exposed domestic violence during the trial. After pleading not guilty following his September arrest at a Manhattan hotel, Combs has been held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.Prosecutors were expected to rest their case by Monday. A defense presentation is expected to last from two to five days.Paul said he bought drugs for Combs between five and 10 times, spending up to $500 for drugs including cocaine, ketamine, ecstasy and marijuana.He said he only did drugs with Combs once, when Combs asked him to try “tusi”, also known as pink cocaine, to see if it was good.Paul said he did so because he “wanted to prove my loyalty” and said he thought it was good.“We continued on with our night,” he told assistant US attorney Christy Slavic.Paul said that prior to his arrest, he had forgotten about the cocaine after collecting it while “sweeping” Combs’ room that morning and had accidentally left it in a bag he carried as he prepared to go on vacation with Combs and other aides. The charges were dismissed after Paul completed a pretrial diversion program.Under questioning by defense attorney Brian Steel, Paul said his “heart dropped” when he realized that there was cocaine in a travel bag after telling officers at the airport that everything in the bag belonged to him.Steel asked Paul if Combs was generally happy and didn’t hurt anyone when he was on drugs.“He got extremely creative,” Paul responded.At another point, Steel asked the witness: “You would not work for a criminal, would you?”“Absolutely not,” Paul responded.Slavic, though, elicited Paul’s mixed feelings about Combs when the prosecutor asked him just before he finished his testimony: “Sitting here today, how do you feel about Mr Combs?”“It’s complicated,” he answered.Paul, originally from Cleveland, was a 6ft 2in guard who walked on at Syracuse University and came off the bench in 16 games over two seasons, playing a total of 17 minutes and scored just three points. He later transferred to lower-tier Fairmont State University in West Virginia, where he played for two more seasons.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsKid CudiCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He was greeted by owner Tom Ricketts, who embraced him in a hug as he exited the vehicle.Sosa became the face of the Cubs franchise where he played 13 seasons after coming in a trade from the crosstown White Sox in March 1992. A seven-time All-Star, Sosa hit 545 homers in 1,811 games with the Cubs and hit a franchise-record 66 in 1998 when he was named the NL’s MVP.Sammy's home.pic.twitter.com/7nJL8YUjx8— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs)June 20, 2025Sosa, now 56, played his final game with the Cubs at Wrigley on 2 October 2004, when he homered and had two hits in an 8-6 loss to Atlanta. During his years with the Cubs, Sosa appeared to bulk up drastically and was a headliner in a generation of baseball’s biggest names linked to performance-enhancing drugs.The Cubs traded him to Baltimore with cash in February 2005 for three players.Sosaappeared to acknowledgeusing performance-enhancing drugs in December when he released a statement saying he was sorry for mistakes, without specifying them.“There were times I did whatever I could to recover from injuries in an effort to keep my strength up to perform over 162 games,” he said in the statement. “I never broke any laws. But in hindsight, I made mistakes and I apologize.”On Friday morning, Sosa posed for photos with rising Cubs star Pete Crow-Armstrong outside the team’s clubhouse and a video showed Sosa embracing manager Craig Counsell in his office before the game.The Cubs remained mum, however, on any ceremony or event before or during Friday’s game.In Thursday’s 8-7 loss to Milwaukee, Crow-Armstrong went deep to set a new team record for reaching 20 homers and 20-plus stolen stolen bases the fastest, doing it in 73 games. Sosa had the old mark of 96, set in 1994.Explore more on these topicsChicago CubsMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, this was also a dreadful afternoon for Enzo Maresca, who got his tactics wrong and somehow found a way to produce the self-sabotage of treating the Lincoln Financial Field to a masterclass on how to neutralise Cole Palmer.So much for all the hype about Palmer taking the No 10 shirt. Why leave him isolated on the right? Palmer yearned for his normal central role and he did not look impressed when he went off in the 82nd minute, by which point Flamengo were 2-1 up, in possession of a one-man advantage and presumably very happy to see Maresca remove Chelsea’s likeliest source of salvaging something from the wreckage of their six-minute implosion midway through the second half.Club World Cup didn’t start the fire – it didn’t light it but we’ll try to fight it | Max RushdenRead moreNot that Chelsea deserved anything other than a defeat that leaves their hopes of reaching the knockout phase of theClub World Cupas winners of Group D in peril. Maresca’s lineup was weirdly clunky – he decided to forgo width by dropping Noni Madueke and moving Reece James into a stolid midfield – and he was outsmarted by Flamengo’s manager, Filipe Luís.Some substitutions win you games; some lose them. For Flamengo there was a stunning contribution from Bruno Henrique, who was thrown on in the 56th minute and in the right place to equalise six minutes later. Chelsea, on the other hand, were left trying to make sense of Jackson’s indiscipline. The striker came on for Liam Delap in the 64th minute, watched Danilo give Flamengo the lead moments later, and then picked up a red card for a crude lunge on Ayrton Lucas four minutes after entering the field of play.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson trudges off after his red card minutes after coming on as a substitute.Photograph: Chris Szagola/APIt seems nothing has been taken on board in the six weeks since Jackson was sent offfor elbowing Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, in a game that threatened to derail Chelsea’s push for Champions League qualification. This was the Senegal forward’s second red card in four appearances and if this is how he intends to respond to competition from Delap then he cannot expect Maresca to trust him with the responsibility of leading the line for Chelsea.A heartfelt apology on Instagram did little to repair the damage caused by Jackson, whose one-game ban could be upgraded by Fifa. “It happened against Newcastle, it happened today,” Maresca said. “I am not 100% sure it is a red card compared to the Newcastle one. It is a bad moment for Nico. He will be out for a while. Nico apologised.”The folly typified Chelsea’s lack of control. Flamengo, who are top of the Brazilian league, played with more balance and imagination. Wesley flew forward from right-back and Gerson was outstanding in attacking midfield. Gonzalo Plata finished with two assists and Jorginho, the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder, pulled the strings with his clever switches of play from deep.The South American sides are not to be underestimated. They remain unbeaten and Chelsea only needed to look at Botafogo beating Paris Saint-Germain to appreciate that this was going to be nothing like their opening win over Los Angeles FC.Flamengo’s fans were out in force in the Philadelphia sun. The intensity rattled Chelsea. Their passing was erratic and Maresca’s tweaks backfired. He brought Malo Gusto in at right-back, started with James next to Moisés Caicedo in central midfield and pushed Enzo Fernández forward.It left Chelsea without a clear way of going from back to front. They took an early lead when Wesley and Danilo failed to deal with a speculative punt from James, enabling Pedro Neto to race through and score, but there was no flow to their football. Delap, who was handed his full debut, faded after drawing a save from Agustín Rossi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They pushed again at the start of the second half. Caicedo, Fernández and James were out-thought. Gerson and Plata went close. The warning signs were obvious.

Will it ever reach breaking point?From heat to unrest: how five major Club World Cup storylines are shaping upRead moreTo legacy fans (who liked football before the start of June) the Club World Cup may feel like the moment where you switched off, or just didn’t switch on in the first place. If football began yesterday, you’d probably plan it with a tournament with club sides from all over the globe. But football didn’t begin yesterday.Jonathan Wilsoncan tell you exactly when that was. And of course you don’t have to watch this shoehorned land‑grab of a tournament, but sometimes it would be nice to not even have the option.The inflated prize money, where that wealth has come from and the impact huge sums of money going to individual clubs will have on leagues around the world are the start of the problems. Then there’s the fear of the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement service coming to deport a couple of players (or some of those coming to watch). The crowds are, to quote Gennaro Gattuso, “sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit” – more than 400,000 empty seats so far (BBC), 1.5m tickets sold so far for the tournament (Fifa). The tournament overlapping with the Women’s Euros is disgraceful.Careers may be shorter, and we should care about this issue – but how many of us will just support the next guy in the shirt? The reality will be the same whenever players with the potential to reach the peak of the game suffer injury or loss of form. Take Dele Alli or Ansu Fati: we just stop calling them elite and then let them drift from our minds. There will always be top players playing for top clubs. There will always be the best player and so on and so on. Unless players strike it will carry on down the same path.It is obviously easier for neutrals to ignore it. But if you happen to be, say, a Chelsea fan, then part of deal is that you follow your team in their games. Sure there’s a hierarchy of importance – Premier League over Carabao Cup – but it doesn’t feel like you can just keep this file closed. It might the most obvious thing ever written, but if your team is playing, your team is playing.View image in fullscreenBotafogo sparked ecstatic scenes when they defeated PSG at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersTo criticise the Club World Cup is to be accused of having a Euro- or Anglo-centric view of the game – and that might be fair. “Try telling those Botafogo fans that this doesn’t matter.” The scenes at full time aftertheir win over PSGwere wonderful. Who wouldn’t want to see Lionel Messi score another great free-kick? Do you know what, I’m probably OK.Fifa, the guardian of the game, is plonking this in with little care for elite player welfare or the fans or the women’s game. It is not alone. Uefa enlarged the Champions League; the prize money there already distorts smaller European leagues. The Premier League won’t filter enough money down to the EFL. League Two clubs won’t vote for more teams to come up from the National League. TheClub World Cupis just the ultimate example. The notion of the football family is a nice one to cling to. But it only really exists when you can tweet that you care about something that has no material impact on your prospects.This tournament will grow as its history grows. There will always be people who want to watch football because, well, football is great. The danger as always is what comes next: franchise football teams, franchise footballers, a world league, the end of the pyramid. You can’t blame people for just wanting to watch a game without thinking of the greater good, or bad. This is the football you are given, you can watch it if you like.Those of us lucky enough to work in the game should constantly recognise the privilege, and even when I’m complaining about the amount of football, I’m watching Cambridge United’s shirt-reveal video over and over (not because I’m in it, but because Paul Wanless is at the chippy! Steve Fallon is in the Cambridge Blue!) and I’m checking the Spurs transfer gossip. The game has that hold over us, and it is a shame that there are too many people right at the top who want to exploit that.Surely a month off would be good for everyone?

I know that when I was 18 or 19 I was looking up to those experienced players. Just by watching what they did – and how they did it – I learned. It wasn’t always necessary for them to say anything.

If I want to do something, I’m going to do it.”In March Lewis-Skelly, at the age of 18, became the youngest player toscore on his England debut, and life has changed considerably for Lewis since she received a call from an agent who wanted to represent her son when he was 11.Lewis-Skelly had recently excelled at a youth tournament in Japan, along with Ethan Nwaneri, another Hale End academy product who has progressed into the first team under Mikel Arteta, and suddenly found himself in demand.“That’s when you start to know about the industry so that you can say: ‘Hang on, we’re not there yet. Let me find out more …,” Lewis says. “Because there is no race. There is no rush. My mum always used to say to me: ‘If something feels urgent, that is a sign to slow down.’”Lewis, who had experience of working for an investment bank in the City, took matters into her own hands. She qualified as a Fifa-registered agent and completed a master’s degree in football business, focusing her thesis on the parent experience in elite football academies – an area in which she was quickly gaining first-hand experience. “It can be a really lonely journey,” she says.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly scores for England against Albania.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat proved to be the inspiration for setting up, in 2022,No1Fan.club, which has been providing support and education for parents of children in the academy systems and is due to become part of the Premier League’s life skills programme next season.“We’re only one of two organisations that do things specifically for parents,” she says proudly. “Everyone else is providing workshops for the players. But no one’s actually focusing on the parent support that helps the kids. So that’s a big win for us, that they finally realised that we’re here to help, and we’re not here to bash the industry but we are here to help them help parents with the realities of the journey, which inevitably will help them and their staff. It’s just taken them a while to realise that.”Lewis has also approached the Professional Footballers’ Association and wants to work with the Football Association on changing regulations that can restrict academy players from joining other clubs if they move home, with some effectively shut out if their former side demand compensation.“These are things which some parents have to seek legal advice for,” she says. “It’s tricky, but as grassroots parents that’s the last thing you’re even thinking about. It’s important that we help parents understand the journey. Signing the paper is the easy bit, but it’s what comes next: the expectation, the juggling of education, the messaging to our kids. The amount of people that say to me: ‘I bet you can retire because Myles is this.’ Or: ‘I bet you can buy a house.’ And I’m like, that’s the language that’s not helpful.”Lewis admits her son’s meteoric rise over the past season has been a steep learning curve but says a strong support network has helped to keep his feet very much on the ground. “Having to deal with going out in public, all of that is new,” she says.“I’m still learning. I think for us, the most important thing is having the right team around you, not putting him on a pedestal at home. ‘No, you’ve still got your chores to do. You still need to empty the dishwasher, tidy your room.’ He still lives at home and I like it, because obviously I enjoy his company a lot. But also, he’s a child – 18 does not make you an adult. It might do by the law. But he’s not ready to go out and live on his own.”View image in fullscreenMarcia Lewis completed a master’s degree in football business as Myles worked his way through the academy system.Photograph: Yolanda de VriesThat were rumours of interest from Real Madrid this summer with Lewis-Skelly due to enter the final 12 months of his first professional contract, signed in October 2023, but he ispoised to extend his dealand become one of the world’s best-paid teenagers. Lewis expresses admiration for Trent Alexander-Arnold’slevel of Spanishat his Madrid unveiling and says her son “loves” studying the language for his AS Level, but suggestions Lewis-Skelly might have left the club he joined at the age of eight are given short shrift.“Rumours are rumours, aren’t they?” Lewis says. “I mean, everyone would always have something to say, you know; that’s fine. We don’t engage in all of that. Myles is enjoying his football. I would want him to enjoy his football wherever he goes, at whatever stage. And, you know, that’s the most important thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am not walking this path alone. We have the right people to support Team Myles. And I think that’s the one thing that we would love to encourage parents to find out more.“We have a workshop called ‘Finding the right agent’. And it isn’t about, OK, go here. No, it’s about, do you know the role? The part that they’ll play? What questions should you ask? You know, even around the approach, around having a meeting, how do you show up to feel on an equal playing field with someone who wants to sell you a service? What are the signs? What are the red flags? Equally, parents, how do you need to adjust your behaviour? You know, it’s not about paying off your house.”The self-belief Lewis-Skelly showed in performing Erling Haaland’s Zen celebration after scoring inArsenal’s 5-1 thrashing of Manchester Cityin February at the Emirates comes not only from his mother but also from Marcia’s mum. “She is a very confident woman – don’t take no shit!” Lewis says.View image in fullscreenMyles Lewis-Skelly displayed his self-confidence with his ‘Zen’ celebration after scoring against Manchester CityPhotograph: Javier García/ShutterstockShe is happy to take credit for her son’s physical prowess, which has impressed Arteta, Thomas Tuchel and so many pundits. “I’d like to say so!” she responds when asked whether her cooking is responsible. “Even as a young child he always ate well. As a kid, he always loved pasta. But it’s not like Myles has been on this nutritional health fix since he was 10. No, he’s been a child. Let him eat what he needs to eat.”No1Fan.club will host its firstparent conference, Changing the Game for Football Families, on 5 July at Stormzy’s Mercy HQ in south London. It will feature workshops from experts in areas such as career planning for young footballers and digital health, and talks from speakers including Les Smith, the father of Fulham’s Emile Smith Rowe. For Lewis, it is another opportunity to help break down some of the barriers in the sport.“I’ve witnessed some of the misogyny in football and how, from an agent perspective, I’ve been approached before, quite disrespectfully, quite frankly. Almost preyed upon … So I think that’s the other thing about having someone like myself, who is a Black woman, reaching parents, who finally feel that there is someone who either looks like them or is the same sex as them that is challenging the status quo. When I see the diversity of our workshop groups, it’s amazing.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I needed to move home’Read moreThe Chelsea goalkeeper was asked at England’s pre-Euros media day at St George’s Park whether she was surprised by Earps’s announcement and whether they had spoken. “First of all we have to respect what her decision is,” Hampton said. “There’s been quite a bit of scrutiny that she probably doesn’t deserve with everything that she’s achieved in the game and put women’s goalkeeping on the map for the younger generation. It was never really a thing, and Mary’s changed that.“I think I’ve done everything I need to do: I’ve sent her a text and I congratulated her on a very successful international career and I think that’s all I really can do. I don’t think there’s anything else and I’m not expecting anything back. She’s been an unbelievable player. We’re going to miss her here. She’s a big personality in this team and she glued us all together at times when we needed to. It’s been difficult for everyone to come to terms with her decision, but we have to respect that.

There are constant reminders on the Channel 4 coverage in the UK that “we” are the holders, despite the fact there are onlya couple of remaining membersfrom the squad that defeatedLa Rojitain the final in Batumi two years ago. It’s a night that Oliver Skipp will never forget. There is another stark difference between then and now: England were properly decent at that point. This current crop have stumbled their way into the last eight like a weary boozer, six pints deep, picking his way through an All Bar One terrace on a hot day.Galavanting is not part of this England team’s repertoire; instead meekness is the summary of what they have offered. After a promisingdefeat of the Czech Republic, they stumbled toa goalless drawagainst the might of Sloveniabefore losing to Germany Bin their final group game. Spain, on the other hand, have breezed to this stage, sweeping past Slovakia (3-2) and Romania (2-1). The more worrying news for England is that the Spanish are favourites and an inquisition should be expected. They’ve still got memories ofCurtis Jones’s winner in Georgia two years ago, although the more galling moment remains James Trafford making an injury-time penalty save from Abel Ruiz to secure the silverware for England. Revenge, it seems, is best served in a partially full stadium in Slovakia’s seventh biggest city.If we’re looking for positives out of the Germany game for England, then young Bournemouth midfield scurrier Alex Scott, who scored in the second half, was decent. He reckons it’s only a matter of time before the floodgates open for Carsley’s pups. “The lads score goals every single day but it’s not quite clicked yet in the games. The quality we have in this team, it’s a matter of time before the goals start flying in,” he whooped. They’ll need to win possession off the ball-hogging Spaniards before they can pepper the goal with shots. How will they do that, then? “Replicate what the lads did two years ago,” he mused. “It is going to be a tough team. Every Spain team is very good on the ball, very calm and composed.”In preparing to soften any blow, England need not worry, even if a hammering is handed out. Why? Because they have one of their own in Spain’s squad. Leeds United striker Mateo ‘Matty’ Joseph Fernández-Regatillo is leading the line despite possessing 10 England Under-20 caps. Born in Santander to an English father and Spanish mother, Joseph spent the first 19 years of his life in his homeland before being attracted by the bright lights of Yorkshire to learn about real football, none of that tiki-taka nonsense. Giving Joseph a proper football education might now backfire on England, but it does guarantee that at least one proud bulldog will make it to the semi-finals, whatever happens.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Taha Hashim for red-hot Copa Gianni updates from Flamengo 0-0 Chelsea at 7pm (BST).QUOTE OF THE DAYThe American dream.

Empty seats have been visible, sometimes in great numbers, at nearly every game (none of which have been sellouts). That said, the raw attendance numbers have not been bad, considering that many kick-off times have fallen at noon or 3pm during workdays.There have been 20 games at the Club World Cup so far. The average attendance has been 35,525. The median is about the same. About 730,000 tickets have been sold or distributed for these matches. All of these are reasonably solid figures.On the other hand, the stadiums have, on average, been about 55% full. The median percentage of capacity used – a figure that gives less weight to outliers such as the 3,142 who attended Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan in Orlando – is 45%. With a few exceptions, the tournament is being playing in massive NFL stadiums, and that means a lot of empty seats.The environments, though, have largely been very good. South American fans in particular have brought it, with Brazilians in New York and Argentinians in Miami creating noisy and invested atmospheres that seem right at home at a tournament with the World Cup name.Thanks to the massiveness of these stadiums, though, the optics are not always the best.View image in fullscreenUlsan v Mamelodi Sundowns has drawn the smallest attendance of the Club World Cup.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersHeat and weatherIt’s been hot at times, but the tournament has also been lucky so far in that many cities, especially New York, have been experiencing cooler-than-normal temperatures over the past week. The most notable exception wasParis Saint-Germain v Atlético Madridat the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where the heat combined with crowd control issues and a lack of water contributed to what the Guardian was told wasa “dangerous” environment for fans. It wasn’t comfortable for the players either.“Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético’s Marcos Llorente said. “The heat is terrible. My toes hurt, even my toenails … We are adapting to the heat of playing at these hours … no one in Europe is used to it.”The next several days will see more of these situations. A brutal heatwave is set to hit much of the eastern United States starting on Friday, covering many of the stadiums where the remaining games will be played. Evening kick-offs will be hot but theoretically bearable once the sun is down. The problematic games will be those that kick off in the afternoon local time – there are 14 of those left in the group stage, including six that start at noon, when the heat will probably be at its worst in the direct sunlight.And that’s without even getting into weather delays. Already, there have been three – mostly for lightning as thunderstorms have gathered amid the humid weather. There is very littleFifacan do about those, of course – but it’s a trend worth keeping an eye on. There is a chance, of course, the delays could disrupt the simultaneous kick-offs in the group finales.Political unrestThe opening matches of this tournament were awash with reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and/or Customs and Border Protection officers would be present at games and looking to continue theirpublic raids, which have been met with counterprotests across the country. That has yet to happen.Make no mistake, security is high at these games, as they are at any major sporting event in the United States. But there haven’t been any reported attempts at mass arrests as there have been in other places around the country.That is not to say politics, world events and the tournament haven’t overlapped. Mehdi Taremi, Inter’s Iran striker, has been forced to miss the tournament after beingstuck in Tehranafter Israel’s attacks on the city. And this week Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, and a delegation from Juventus (including the US internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah)stood in the Oval Officeas Donald Trump answered questions about a potential war with Iran and awkwardly asked the players if women could play for Juventus (a reference to the rightwing talking point about trans women in women’s sports).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Teams representing Conmebol have not lost, the only undefeated confederation remaining after one matchday in every group. They’ve achieved some pretty big results along the way – includingBotafogo’s 1-0 winover the Champions League winners, PSG, on Thursday night, and Boca Juniors’ 2-2 draw with Benfica.Asian and Oceanian teams are having far less fun. The confederations’ five teams have yet to win, with Auckland City suffering a10-0 demolitionby Bayern Munich. The lone bright spot for Asian clubs wasAl-Hilal’s 1-1 draw with Real Madrid– a game in which the Saudi Pro League side looked every bit Madrid’s equals in Xabi Alonso’s first game in charge.Generally speaking, and in line with past editions of the Club World Cup, the so-called “smaller” teams are the ones bringing real life to this party, while mostUefateams are waiting for their first big challenge. The final group games and knockouts should be plenty of fun.View image in fullscreenJoy for Botafogo after their 1-0 victory over PSG.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersStandout playersIt’s a bit early to say anyone is making a case for the Golden Ball given most teams have played one game, but a few players have stood out.One, unsurprisingly, is Lionel Messi. The Inter Miami superstar is a player Fifa bent over backwards to get into the tournament, awarding his team a “host nation” slot after they failed to qualify through other means. That decision has paid off. Messi is 37 and has clearly slowed a little, but he remains capable of delivering in big moments, as he did with a winning free-kickgoal against Porto.Pretty much every Bayern player stands out after that ridiculous scoreline, even if it came against amateur opposition. Jamal Musiala has the early claim on the Golden Boot, having scored a hat-trick in that game.For Manchester City, Phil Foden got off on the right foot with a goal and an assistagainst Wydad, and Chelsea’s new signing Liam Delap made a positive impact on his debut, a2-0 winover Los Angeles FC.Kylian Mbappé, meanwhile, has been a notable absence, having beenbriefly in hospitalthis week with gastroenteritis.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsMLSUefaFifafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This proved to be anything but a routine sendoff for the Lions coaches and players, who already have a good deal to reflect on as they head for Perth this weekend to embark on their eagerly awaited Australian tour.Should they win the Test series 3-0, of course, this pre-departure ­wake-up call will rate as only a minor footnote in the great scheme of things. The Wallabies, nevertheless, will have taken due note of both the historic result and the positive manner with which Argentina approached the ­contest. The Pumas, despite the absence of some first-choice players, led by 11 points at half-time and were good value for their history-making win.Freeman and Van der Merwe miss chance to make impression in tough Lions opener | Brendan FanningRead moreMaybe, one day, the Lions will find it in their hearts – and wallets – to agree to a full tour of South America which, on this evidence, would be a guaranteed crowd pleaser.As for the Lions, playing in Ireland for the first time, it is too early to draw hard and fast individual ­conclusions, but Tadhg Beirne and Sione Tuipulotu will both be influential figures in Australia and the two starting props, Ellis Genge and Finlay Bealham, showed up well in the set scrums.Pre-departure games, though, can give and take away and this result was another example. “We made it a tough game, didn’t we?” the Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. “Congratulations to Argentina, who thoroughly deserved to win. [But] the story of the game is that we made too many errors. We need to be better than that. Losing hurts, especially in this jersey. We need to find a solution pretty quickly and be honest with ourselves.”At least the post-game injury ­bulletins were OK. Four years ago,Alun Wyn Jones was ruled out of the early stagesof the tour after damaging a shoulder against Japan at ­Murrayfield and the possibility of being sidelined before the plane south has left the runway inevitably hung in the humid evening air.View image in fullscreenBundee Aki drives over to score the first try of the Lions’ tour, although Argentina ended the first half in front.Photograph: Peter Morrison/APThe calibre of the opposition, though, created little margin for error. The Pumas may not have been absolutely at full strength but whenever Pablo Matera, Juan-Martín González and Julián Montoya take the field they are never less than fully committed. The pace of the game certainly bore little resemblance to a gentle friendly.Luke Cowan-Dickie came close to an opening try only to lose control of the ball in the act of scoring and, after Tomás Albornoz and Fin Smith had swapped a penalty apiece, it was the Pumas who seized the initiative thanks to a nicely taken 11th minute try by their speedy left wing Ignacio Mendy.The Lions also had a second potential score by Tuipulotu correctly ruled out for a prior knock-on but their cohesion was steadily improving, helped by the established England half-back pairing of Alex Mitchell and Smith. Both were involved, along with full-back Marcus Smith, in ­keeping a promising move alive before the physical Bundee Aki took the most direct available route to the try-line.These are clearly early days but Tuipulotu looks to be the kind of player any centre would love to play alongside and the calmly assured Smith also looked at ease in the same red jersey worn by his grandfather, Tom Elliot, on the 1955 tour to South Africa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was another example on the stroke of half-time when Duhan van der Merwe, desperate to impress, lost the ball and the Pumas took gleeful advantage, Carreras releasing ­Albornoz for a swallow-dive score 75 metres upfield.The 21-10 interval scoreline demanded a swift response, which duly materialised within five minutes of the restart. The Lions opted to trust their driving maul with the line in sight and a concerted surge gave the opposing pack little option but to drag it down, costing them a penalty try and 10 minutes in the sin bin for Mayco Vivas.The raft of Lions subs also brought fresh energy and, soon enough, they were back ahead. Genge came charging through the middle in proper rhino fashion and, eventually, Beirne added the finishing gloss. The Pumas, though, also found a second wind and another daring break-out raid from deep yielded their third try of the night courtesy of the pacy Santiago Cordero. If the Australian leg of the tour is equally full of thrills and spills, the next few weeks will be excellent viewing.It was also a more than decent occasion which further underlined the power of one of rugby’s most evocative brands. Even Munster fans would have been impressed by the sea of red jerseys all around the Aviva and, despite some punchy ticket prices, the attendance was a 51,700 sellout. The final result, though, will inevitably be the abiding memory.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsArgentina rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The tourists proceeded to plunder 359 runs for the loss of three wickets on a flat pitch with Yashasvi Jaiswal and the new captain, Shubman Gill, both scoring centuries.The last six Tests played at Headingley had all ended in victory for the side that bowled first, and Vaughan, a former Yorkshire batter, accused England of making their decision based on the history books rather than the conditions on the day. “I am an old-school traditionalist here at Leeds that when the sun is shining, with dry weather, you bat,” said the 50-year-old Vaughan, who played 51 first-class matches at Headingley including four as England captain.“I was staggered when he said he was going to bowl. Traditions are out the window. You have to pick your decisions on that moment, and not things that you did here years ago.“India’s Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal make tons to leave England toiling in first TestRead moreTim Southee, the former New Zealand seamer working as England’s bowling consultant, said they had been swayed by the green tinge to the surface on Thursday, before it received its final trim overnight. “With the colour of the wicket yesterday and a little bit of moisture left in it, there was going to be a little bit in it this morning. That was the thinking behind the decision,” he said.“I think there was a little bit of assistance there [in the first hour], but for the rest of the day it was a pretty good surface, which is encouraging for our guys when we get an opportunity to bat. I guess when you win the toss and bowl you expect to make early inroads, but they negotiated that first hour or so pretty well. We’ve got a new ball still, so hopefully tomorrow morning we can make the most of that and make some early inroads.”England’s decision at the toss may have been intended to expose the relative inexperience in these conditions of India’s top order: of the five players to bat on Friday Jaiswal was playing his first Test in this country, Gill his fourth, and Sai Sudharsan – who got a four-ball duck – was making his Test debut.“Credit to the Indian batsmen – Jaiswal and Gill played a couple of great hands there,” Southee said. “They’ve not played a lot of cricket but they’re certainly talented cricketers.”Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketBen StokesMichael VaughannewsShareReuse this content"

There were, after all, quite a few self-sabotaging concentration lapses, his forehand was sometimes too erratic and he did not always seem comfortable moving on the slick grass.In the most important moments, however, when the match hung in the balance, the 23-year-old locked in and produced his best tennis. Once again, the British No 1 held his nerve in the final stages of a tough three-setter as he defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals at Queen’s Club for the first time in his career.The victory means Draper will return to his career-high ranking of No 4 on Monday, securing him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. At a time when almost every player wishes to avoid an early meeting withCarlos Alcarazor Jannik Sinner, he cannot face either of the world’s top two before the semi-finals.However, a meeting with Alcaraz here remains on the cards. One day after his own dramatic three-set win, as he recovered from 2-4 in the final setto defeat Jaume Munarin a three hour, 26-minute marathon, Alcaraz, the top seed, returned to the semi-finals at Queen’s Club with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Arthur Rinderknech. Alcaraz has won 16 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career.Alcaraz stressed how difficult it was to recover with less than 24 hours after such a tough match. “Could be better, honestly, but I thought I was going to feel much worse than I feel right now,” the world No 2 said. “But we are tennis players, we have to do whatever we have to do just to recover, to be in good shape the next day. I’m just feeling great. I’m glad that today was one hour, 20 minutes. Today was more grass [than clay], so I’m just happy and hopefully tomorrow I’m going to feel much better.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz has now won 16 matches on the bounce after his victory over Arthur Rinderknech.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersFor Draper the past few days have, in some ways, emphasised just how much things have changed over the past year. Although he has broken new ground this week by reaching a first semi-final at this venue, he still feels some way from producing his best. “The level of what I’m playing could be more consistent, definitely better,” he said. “I think it will come. The more I practise, the more I play, I’m getting a little bit better each time. I don’t know when it will come together, but still doing well to be in the semis. Day by day, we’ll see.While he has previously been able to produce his best level from the beginning of the grass season, Draper is still finding his feet after enduring his first full clay-court season and the significant efforts it took for him to adapt his game to suit a completely different surface.“It’s just such a hard adjustment,” said Draper. “I really tried on the clay to play a certain way, to be aggressive in the back court, to be tough from the back of the court, and I spent probably like a month and a half on the clay.This is still [early] because I didn’t practise too much before the tournament with certain things. I’m sort of going by ear out there a little bit, and I’m trying to become more and more comfortable on the grass. When you get more comfortable in the movement, more comfortable in what you’re trying to do out there, it just starts clicking.”During the decisive moments, though, the confidence that Draper has gained over the past few years has been plain for all to see and every match affords him the opportunity to further improve his level on grass as he attempts to peak in time for Wimbledon. Draper will next face the talented Czech Jiri Lehecka, who ended the excellent run of the British No 2, Jacob Fearnley, with a 7-5, 6-2 win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’ve accommodated where they could.”EuroBasket, a biennial competition, is one of the biggest international tournaments in the game. It is also a qualifying metric for the Women’s World Cup and the Olympics. With the 2025 edition under way, Fágbénlé’s presence is crucial as one of the leading WNBA players choosing to play in an international tournament during the season.At 6ft 4in, the driving centre is a focal point for GB, an underdog team. They have been here before: written off at the 2019 tournament, they made a historic run to the semi-finals, with Fágbénlé leading the team in points, blocks and efficiency per game – a composite stat calculated using points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and shot attempts.This time, GB are in a challenging Group D. An opening85-70 defeat to the four-time champions Spainmeans remaining fixtures against Sweden and the co-hosts Germany will be crucial. “I feel great about our chances of advancing to the knockouts,” says Fágbénlé. “We have a chance to win against any team we play. It just depends on our consistency, our toughness and our grit. Anyone can be beaten.”View image in fullscreenTemi Fágbénlé shoots during Great Britain’s EuroBasket defeat by Spain. ‘I will be indebted to basketball for the rest of my life,’ she says.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.The transition from the WNBA to EuroBasket brings a set of adjustments on the court for players. The three-second rule – “In Europe, I get to live in the paint without any repercussion of how long I’m in there for,” laughs Fágbénlé – and the level of play differs vastly, with GB’s team comprising semi-pros and amateurs along with the professionals.“We have some people coming from college who haven’t played professionally yet. It’s not comparable to the WNBA or the Euroleague. But you have that common goal for your national team. And it’s a great feeling because there aren’t as many individual agendas. In the W, you might have people who are trying to be all-stars or trying to get this or that award. We all want to win for our country. I’ve played in Europe. This is my scene.”Born in Baltimore and raised in London, Fágbénlé’s “first love” was tennis but she switched to basketball, playing at a club in Haringey before attending Harvard and the University of Southern California for college basketball. After becoming the first Briton to win a WNBA championship in 2017, with the Minnesota Lynx, she took a break from the league, doing the rounds in Europe including with the London Lions before returning to the US, this time with the Indiana Fever. It was a season of unprecedented attention, largely due to the arrival of the 2024 No 1 draft pick, Caitlin Clark, a player at the forefront of popularising women’s basketball.“There were a lot of eyes on us, a lot of outside drama. The media – and people in general – love a good story, right? It was funny to see because on the inside you know the truth. But also great to see Caitlin handle everything so gracefully, graciously and maturely. It was definitely a challenge trying to focus on basketball, but I’m glad we went as far as we did.”View image in fullscreenIndiana Fever’s Caitlin Clark (left) and Temi Fágbénlé combine to thwart an attack by Brionna Jones of the Connecticut Sun last August.Photograph: Michael Hickey/NBAE/Getty ImagesThe Fever went on to make their first playoff appearance since 2016 and Fágbénlé, despite struggling with injuries, combined with Clark as a surprise dynamic duo. “Caitlin sees the floor very well and she’s a great passer. I was willing to complement her game as the star of the team. I understood what my role was and that was fine with me.”Some of the unprecedented media attention involved constant chatter about who would start, a talking point Fágbénlé dismissed in several press conferences with the team. “I’ve always had a team-first mentality. We’re playing a team sport. Why would you be worried about what you’re doing individually? If you’re worried about yourself, go play tennis or something.”It is fitting now the 32-year-old finds herself at the WNBA’s newest expansion team, the Golden State Valkyries, a team she says is made up of “sixth women”.View image in fullscreenTemi Fágbénlé (left) in action for her new side Golden State Valkyries against the Phoenix Mercury guard Lexi Held.Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP“Teams around the league protected five players, generally the starting five. Then the Valkyries got to pick one player from each team. You’re going to pick the first player off the bench. The sixth woman. What do bench players encompass? Great teamwork. We were expected to lose a lot. But people don’t get it. We’re going to be contenders. Like we won’t be bottom half, I don’t think.”A true team mindset did not come easy to Fágbénlé who, as an introvert, struggled to feel as if she was contributing.Basketballis a loud sport that needs constant communication and overcoming her nature to become a vocal leader was a conscious effort.“I was quiet and I saw that wasn’t the thing to be if you wanted to be a good teammate. In fact, you’re being selfish. Whenever I would be on a team I would see veterans who talked – even talking as to look silly or stupid – but it was helpful.“All of a sudden now I’m known as the talker. I talk so much. I’m like ‘how did I get here?’ It’s hard to teach to someone who doesn’t see that as a priority, but it is.”Fágbénlé’s journey – from a quiet London teenager to a seasoned leader on the big stage – feels resonant. Her evolution mirrors the spirit of the GB’s EuroBasket squad: overlooked yet relentlessly committed. She is again at the heart of a team thriving on defying expectations. It surely is not a coincidence she keeps finding herself here – she is the one setting the standard.“I will be indebted to basketball for the rest of my life. Basketball shows you who you are in times of adversity and I’ve been able to find the weak points in my character and fix them. Resilience is a skill that is to be honed. And I’ve really been honing it over the years.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballUS sportsWNBAinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The last of those came in the eighth inning of Thursday’s 5-3 Padres victory when the benches finally cleared after Tatis was hit near the right hand.While the staredown behind home plate was more peacock feathers than fisticuffs, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and Padres manager Mike Shildt were ejected following a tense back-and-forth exchange.Afterward, the Padres’ Manny Machado said his true feelings won’t be known until Tatis gets results from X-rays and a CT scan.“They gotta pray for [results] to come back negative tomorrow,” Machado said. “They should. Us, too, but they should for sure.”After Tatis was hit, the Dodgers’Shohei Ohtanitook a pitch to the back of his right (pitching) shoulder from Robert Suárez. With Dodgers players starting to move over the dugout railing, Ohtani waved back his teammates and took first base.Shohei Ohtani plays peacemaker at the end of another wild game between the Padres and Dodgers.pic.twitter.com/V03xUugs8z— MLB (@MLB)June 20, 2025“Well, I think he knew it was intentional,” Roberts said. “He wasn’t hurt by it, and he didn’t want any more drama, which I respect that a lot.”Ohtani was hit twice in the series, each a half inning after Tatis was hit. The Dodgers’ Andy Pages also was hit twice in the series.Roberts said he hoped Tatis does not miss extended time.“I didn’t feel good about Tatis – great player, good guy – getting hit,” Roberts said. “I didn’t feel good about it. And so as [Shildt] comes out, and he’s yelling at me and staring me down, that bothers me. Because, to be quite frank, that’s the last thing I wanted.”Shildt said he has respect for the Dodgers but seeing Tatis get hit three times by their pitchers in less than two weeks doesn’t sit right. He has also been hit by the Dodgers six times in his career, the most by any club.“Whether it was [intentional] or it wasn’t, enough is enough,” Shildt said. “We got a guy who’s getting X-rays right now, is one of the best players in the game, fortunately he’s on our team, and this guy has taken shots, OK?”While the teams waited more than two months to face each other for the first time this season, there will be another two-month wait until they face off again 15-17 August at Los Angeles and 22-24 August at San Diego.“It’s going to be a fun ride,” Machado said. “This division’s freaking awesome, and it’s going to be a fun ride going down the road. The Giants got better with [Rafael] Devers, and we know what these guys have on the other side. And what we have on this side. And obviously you can’t count out Arizona. They’ve got a really good team over there. They’re going to be battling. It’s a four-headed monster battling it out, so it’ll be an interesting second half.”Explore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles DodgersSan Diego PadresShohei OhtaniBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The US have won their group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, and close Group D play on Sunday against Haiti at Arlington, Texas.US coach Mauricio Pochettino stuck with the same lineup that produced a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the first time he made no changes in consecutive matches since taking over the program last October. But playing against No 58 Saudi Arabia, the 16th-ranked Americans showed little of the attack firepower they displayed against the No 100 Soca Warriors.The match saw few real chances on goal by either team. The Americans had just one shot in the first half. Richards’ speed to track back to cover for Alex Freeman’s mistake and block a shot kept Saudi Arabia from a 1-0 lead.Matt Freese got his second consecutive start in goal for the US and third in four matches as he appears to have displaced Matt Turner.The Gold Cup represents the last competitive test for the Americans ahead of the 2026 World Cup. As co-host with Mexico and Canada, the US are an automatic qualifier for the World Cup.The Americans limped into the Gold Cup on a four-match losing streak that included a 4-0 rout by Switzerland in their final tune-up. And with many of the top players either sitting out this tournament for personal reasons, injuries or playing in the Club World Cup, Pochettino selected a roster full of relatively untested and unproven players.Missing the tournament for the US are regulars Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest,Explore more on these topicsGold Cup 2025USASaudi ArabiaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The watchdog has the power to fine a company up to 1% of turnover if it is found to have broken the groceries code.The adjudicator, Mark White, said: “Delays in payment can significantly harm suppliers. The alleged delays could expose Amazon suppliers to excessive risk and unexpected costs, potentially affecting their ability to invest and innovate.”The company sells groceries in the UK through its Amazon Fresh branded stores and online retail operation, as well the Whole Foods chain, which itbought in 2017 for $13.7bn(£10.2bn).Suppliers raisedmore issues with Amazon than with other retailers, according to a survey for the GCA carried out in 2024.After the warning to Amazon last July, the GCA said it had monitored the retailer’s actions and heard detailed evidence about suppliers’ experiences.The GCA said on Friday it had grounds to suspect Amazon had breached paragraph 5 of the groceries code between 1 March 2022 and 20 June 2025, but would focus its investigations on the period from the start of 2024 to gain the best understanding of Amazon’s current practices.The watchdog is calling on suppliers to send in evidence by 8 August.

So here are the best vibrators available.

I’ve worked as an expert independent research and development consultant for more than a dozen adult product companies; I’m a board member of theVagina Museumin London; I’m a campaigner for sexual health and gynaecological charities, includingTerrence Higgins Trustandthe Eve Appeal; and I helped write many of your favourite characters’ lines about dildos, douching and desire in the hit Netflix series Sex Education. All this means I’m well qualified to assess whether these devices have been crafted decently.I’m also a freelancer who works from home. I’ll leave it at that.Types of vibratorView image in fullscreenThe Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1.Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.BulletsSmall, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).WandsLarge vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.RabbitsThese vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation.The best bullet vibratorsBest bullet vibrator overall:We-Vibe Tango XView image in fullscreen£79 at We-Vibe£79.99 at SinfulThe original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.Why we love itIts Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which isexactlywhat tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.It’s a shame that …the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.Speeds:eightVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:two hoursCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbullet for innovation:Hot Octopuss AMOView image in fullscreen£49.95 at Hot OctopussAnother tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler. Hot Octopuss is a skilled inventor: its suite of ingenious toys includesPulse – the world’s first “Guybrator”that can induce orgasms from a flaccid penis as well as an erect one, proving a boon for cancer survivors, disabled people and others with erectile difficulties.Why we love itAMO’s ingenuity is in the way it’s sculpted, with a pointy tip for pinpoint pleasure; a broader head on the opposite side for more diffuse vibrations; and a fin-like profile for nestling lengthways between labia. It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.It’s a shame that …the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.Speeds:sixVibe patterns:fivePower:rechargeableRun time:40 minutesCharge time:two to three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestsustainable bullet:Love Not War MayaView image in fullscreen£99.99 at VeoIf you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink.Why we love itSeven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say,a rabbitora G-spot probe. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.It’s a shame that …at more than £50 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible‘Expect to see snake-like peeling’: 19 self-care treats for the perfect pick-me-upRead moreBest softand sensual option:Smile Makers The FirefighterView image in fullscreen£44.95 at Boots£49.95 at Beauty BayBullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.Why we love itThe fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.It’s a shame that …it only comes in pink.The Surfer, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:twoPower:rechargeableRun time:three hoursCharge time:two to two-and-a-half hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbudget bullet:The Rocks OffRO-90View image in fullscreen£5.50 at Rocks Off£15.95 at AmazonRocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.Why we love itIt’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety insidethe smaller RO-80 model. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to developa truly accessible toy range, Quest. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.It’s a shame that …single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them.

Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.Why we love itThis Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.It’s a shame that …there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWarranty:one yearBest for temperature titillation:Lovehoney Glow BunnyView image in fullscreen£79.99 at LovehoneyIf you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.Why we love itThe temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.It’s a shame that …the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:fourPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:100 daysBestfor air pulse stimulation:Womanizer Duo 2View image in fullscreen£189 at Womanizer£189 at BootsAdmittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.Why we love itThe firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preserved,andyou don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.It’s a shame that …the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features.Speeds:14Vibe patterns:10Power:rechargeableRuntime:two hoursCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:five yearsBestfor an innovative shaft:Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1View image in fullscreen£35.37 at Satisfyer£39.97 at AmazonSatisfyer is known for two things. First, making excellent-quality, more affordable “dupes” of aspirational high-end sex toys – almost like an Aldi version of Lelo and co. Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling outvastmultitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.Why we love itIt sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.It’s a shame that …it makes a noise like a car tyre inflator while it’s pumping up, and sounds like your vagina is sighing mournfully as it deflates. Put the stereo on, because this toy’s noises make for an inappropriate and distressing lovemaking soundtrack.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hours and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:15 yearsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.Why we love itI was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed bythe Yarrow: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean. It’s another winner that’ll give your knees the hippy shakes.It’s a shame that …the crevices around the clitoral stimulating nub need extra attention to keep clean and bacteria-free between uses.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRuntime:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestnewanimal:Snail Vibe CurveView image in fullscreen£97.74 at Boots£119.99 at Love HoneyA new animal enters the scene, with an ingenious take on how to tackle those pesky rabbit problems. Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos onSnail Vibe’s websiteto see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile.It’s a shame that …the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.Speeds:five for each motorVibe patterns:five for each motorPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBest budget rabbit:BondaraScrewballMonAmourView image in fullscreen£45.99 at BondaraAn aesthetic homage to the popularLelo Soraya 2that costs significantly less.

The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.It’s a shame that …Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work).

The mains-powered Doxy Die Cast is arguably as hard as you can go. It’s not for the faint of heart (or parts), but it’s so powerful that it can probably conjure up an orgasm through walls. And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.Why we love itDoxy makes arechargeable Die Cast(£149.99) and several superbsmaller, lighter cordless wands, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.It’s a shame that …at 690g, it’s heavy as hell.

Turn on the domed head at the top for external body massage or the insertable shaft at the bottom to enjoy penetration and internal stimulation. Despite this toy having dual motors, you can’t run both ends at once – although only the most adventurous among us would need that.It’s a shame that …this toy doesn’t pack the power of pricier wands, and some prefer a material and design with more softness, flex and yield.

In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.What Ididn’tdo was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail” or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multifunctional/tech-enabled?What materials and textures feel inviting to me?A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, youalwaysreach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastlyenhanceshared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro, whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.What to do when your old toys finally dieIf all this toy talk has reminded you that you have enough bad vibes, shot bullets and dead rabbits gathering dust in your bedside cabinet to rival Watership Down, you’re not alone. Research conducted earlier this year by tech refurbishment specialists Back Market revealed that 15% of people keep old and broken sex toys stored ad infinitum because they’re embarrassed to throw them away. One in three surreptitiously chuck them in the household bin – even though anything with batteries, a plug or a charging port can be recycled. An unfortunate side-effect of increased sexual liberation and toy ownership is that worn-out erotic electricals are worsening the planet’s burgeoning e-waste problem, and valuable materials within them, including aluminium, gold, copper, lithium and steel, are being lost to landfill.If your ancient wand vibe is now more tragic than magic, head toRecycle Your Electricals, enter your postcode, then select Vibrator from the dropdown menu (yes, it’s a legitimate category). You’ll be given recycling instructions specific to your location; some councils will even collect your raunchy rubbish direct from your door. I’d wrap it in a bag, mind, for discretion.

The concept of using art to reinvigorate disused spaces is far from novel, but it’s been taken to compelling heights in The Door in Question, an intense – and at times deeply unsettling – 90-minute extended reality, or XR, production that blends immersive theatre, escape rooms, virtual reality and mixed reality (overlaying the real world with digital elements).Described by creator and director Troy Rainbow as “an immersive journey into psychosis”, The Door in Question was partly inspired by his own experience of psychosis as well as the experiences of his mother, who had schizophrenia.The Spare Room review – Judy Davis is electric in thrilling adaptation of Helen Garner novelRead moreThe 37-year-old artist used letters she wrote to him – reflecting “her type of thinking, and the type of thinking I fell into” – to inform the core challenge of “adapting delusional belief systems into narrative form”. The story centres around four delusional characters, each of which believe a man named Anton was killed in a different way.The word “immersive” is bandied around a lot these days, but The Door in Question really isimmersive, creating an enveloping experience that engages all the senses – including touch and smell.View image in fullscreenThe Door in Question takes place in and around Metro West shopping centre in Footscray, which has been largely abandoned by retailers.Photograph: Lauren MarrIt begins in a small room in Metro West shopping centre – a largely unused complex with, as Rainbow puts it, “a cachet of lost dreams feel about it”. After a brief guided meditation, I’m fitted with a VR headset, and emerge from the room to walk around the virtually altered centre, encountering peculiar objects that weren’t there before. Some I’ll see again later on, in physical rather than virtual reality – which blurs the actual and the unreal, and triggers a strange kind of deja vu.Trading my headset for a pair of headphones, I head on to the street, where a mysterious woman tells me stories about various locations around me while directing me around the block and into another building.Here I move through a series of surreal-looking rooms filled with old and decaying elements. There’s a lab-like environment with a dentist’s chair; a security room in which I have a conversation with myself via AI that imitates my voice; a grotty kitchen filled with broken and oddly placed things; and a creepy kids room, with plush snakes on the bed and a homemade board game.View image in fullscreenThe participant passes through a number of surreal-looking rooms as part of the experience.Photograph: Lauren MarrThroughout the experience, voices sprout up from unexpected places around me, achieved in part through directional speakers – “so it actually sounds like a voice in your head”, says Rainbow. These voices deliver bizarre and sometimes hysterical rants. A man talks about our soul becoming data and dissolving; a child speaks of divine miracles. As I move through these environments, I encounter strange pictures and written material – religious texts, cryptic notes scrawled on walls, typed documents in folders. It feels as if I’m insidea scary movie or video game.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIolanthe: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)Read moreThe Door in Question (which premiered in 2021, and has experienced several iterations before this current one) is powerful partly because of its intimate nature. Throughout the experience, the participant is alone – with the exception of an actor who follows them up the street, ensuring they head in the right direction – and alone with the thoughts in their head (plus all those crazy ones bouncing off the walls). The intimacy of the experience, coupled with the fact that each participant co-authors it, makes it feel very personal.All this requires a very different approach to storytelling from mediums with ringfenced fields of representation, such as film and traditional theatre. Beyond the obvious difference of interactivity, this kind of storytelling involves using space to reveal information, and establishing an interplay between narrative and location.View image in fullscreenCreator Troy Rainbow drew from the letters and personal writings of his mother, who had schizophrenia.Photograph: Lauren MarrTechnology is crucial to pulling this off, and Rainbow says “I work with the mindset that technology isn’t the facilitator of the idea – it’s a co-creator”.Finding the right real-world locations is also key, and using abandoned and dilapidated spaces is something Rainbow is passionate about: “Why work against that to create something? Why not allow that to inform the experience?” he says. “It’d be cool if there were more artistic experiences embedded in dormant spaces.”The Door in Questionis playing at Metro West, Footscray until 29 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreVirtual realityImmersive theatreAustralian theatreMelbournefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump must be stoppedFawaz GergesThis is a war of choice, based on misinformation. If the US and UK join it, they risk a rerun of the Iraq debacle of 2003Fri 20 Jun 2025 07.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 08.42 EDTShareLike the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, Israel’s war on Iran is neither legal nor just. It is a war of choice, not of necessity – and should the US or its European allies, particularly Britain, join in, they risk being dragged into another disastrous and unlawful conflict in the Middle East.A US military intervention would be in direct contravention of international law. Already, the US, once the architect and guardian of the international order, is now among its chief violators. Instead of pressuringBenjamin Netanyahuto end his siege and destruction of Gaza, Donald Trump has fully sided with Netanyahu and called Israel’s attacks on Iran “excellent”. He has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender”. Trump is considering military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Doing so is explicitly prohibited under article 56 of the additional protocol to the Geneva conventions because of the danger of nuclear contamination.Britain, meanwhile, must tread carefully. The attorney general hasreportedlywarned that any UK military involvement beyond defensive support would be illegal. Richard Hermer, the government’s top legal adviser, is said to have raised internal concerns about the legality of joining a bombing campaign.The foundation of Israel’s justification for launching pre-emptive strikes and of Washington’s quiet complicity is alarming. The core claim is that Iran was rapidly taking steps to “weaponise its uranium”, with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, repeatedly warning that Tehran was approaching a point of no return in developing a nuclear bomb.But Netanyahu’s narrative flatly contradicts the US intelligence assessment, which found that not only is Irannotactively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it remainsat leastthree years away from having the capability to do so. The CIA disputes the Israeli claim that Iran is close to crossing a nuclear threshold.Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard,testifiedin March that Iran wasnotbuilding a nuclear weapon and that the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had not authorised a nuclear programme, one that was in fact suspended in 2003. Even if Iran was making a bomb, international law doesn’t give Israel and the US the right to bomb Iran. The UN charter is clear on the use of force in international relations.Yet, when pressed about this contradiction, Trump dismissed the intelligence outright. “I don’t care what she said,” he told reporters. “I think they were very close to having it.” Netanyahu and Trump’s narrative also stands in direct opposition to findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose director general, Rafael Grossi,confirmedon 17 June that there was “no proof” Iran was systematically developing nuclear weapons.Set against this backdrop, US military intervention would rupture the rules-based international order further and make future conflicts more unpredictable and dangerous. Other powerful states could launch offensive wars under the pretext of pre-empting real or imagined threats to their national security. Today, it’s Israel and the US. Tomorrow, China could use the same rationale to justify attacking Taiwan.The echoes of the Iraq war should also raise alarm bells. Then, as now, war was sold on manufactured intelligence. Netanyahu was a vocalsupporterof the neoconservative movement that led the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq and justified it with claims about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism. George W Bush sold that war with the now-infamous line about Hussein’s “massive stockpile” of biological weapons, despite the CIA stating it had “no specific information” on quantities or types. Bush went further, claiming: “We do not know whether or not [Iraq] has a nuclear weapon,” contradicting his own intelligence. He knew, and he lied.Trump, for his part, publicly criticised that very deception,sayingBush’s decision to invade Iraq was “the worst decision any president has made in the history of this country [the US]”, adding: “There were no weapons of mass destruction, and they knew there were none.” Yet Trump today appears to borrow a page from Bush’s playbook.Although there is no plan for a US ground invasion ofIran, any attack on Tehran risks spiralling into a full-blown regional war. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against US bases in Iraq, Bahrain and the wider Gulf. A mission creep could easily escalate, triggering a cycle of strikes and counterstrikes.Trump sets deadline of two weeks to decide if US will join Israel’s war on IranRead moreFor example, Iran could mine the strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point for global energy flows. The effects could reverberate globally, hitting energy markets and causing an inflationary cycle, weakening confidence in the US dollar, and potentially plunging the US economy into stagflation.Even the Houthis, with far fewer military capabilities than Iran, have managed to severely inflict damage and disrupt shipping in the Red Sea. If the US joins Israel’s war, Iran could cripple global trade routes and send oil pricessoaring.If the US joins Israel’s war on Iran, it could backfire spectacularly, and potentially strengthen the regime rather than weakening it. One likely outcome is that the clerics will dash forward towards making a nuclear bomb, pointing to Israel’s attack and attempt at regime change as justification. Meanwhile, in the UK, Keir Starmer would do well to remember the bitter legacy of Tony Blair, who led Britain into Iraq alongside the US.Fawaz Gerges is professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.

Of a bunch of white settlers enjoying pink gins on the terrace, she writes, “the glasses made a tinkle that was not of the substance of glass, but of bottles wrapped in tissue paper. Sometimes, for a moment, a shriek or a cackle would hang torpidly in space, but these were unreal sounds as if projected from a distant country.”This week, much of Britain enjoyed an unbroken run of 30C days and we were all yanked back to that distant country – the one in which we sat in hot classrooms clad head to toe in polyester, wilting to LP Hartley’s The Go-Between. “In the heat,” wrote Hartley, “the commonest objects changed their nature,” and no matter how many summers we’ve been through, this fact seems to surprise every time.What struck me this week as temperatures soared was how particular each heatwave is to its locality. In New York, summer comes with light as harsh and unshaded as fluorescent strip lighting and the sky is an angry blue. In the southern hemisphere, where the sun is at its strongest, you can walk down the street and feel the heat on your back like a hand, pushing. In Britain, however, the country remains pale and watery in even the hottest weather, an apparent mildness of light and sky that somehow makes the trees seem more green, the effect of high temperatures more surreal and the people, after three consecutive days of hot weather, inclined to completely lose our minds.TuesdayThe English dream is not of nice weather but of any weather that provides a pretext to talk about it. This week, on top of the thrill of the heatwave, the Met Office gave the nation more fuel for its pastime with a warning that in the current climate, the chances of Britain experiencing 45C heat in the next 12 years have risen to 50/50. (In 2022, temperatures hit 40C for the first time on record.)You could talk about the terrible consequences of this, or the failures to date of world leaders to staunch global heating, but really what most of us wanted to do was to say “45 degrees!” and pull a series of cor-blimey faces. There was more: in what pushes us close, surely, to a record-breaking week in opportunities for weather chat in this country, the Met Office went on to issue aninvitationto the public to come up with suggestions for storm names for the 2025/26 season.Last year, you may recall, Storm Bert wreaked havoc on the west coast, and there was also Storm Darragh and a series of storm backup names, such as Storm Conall, Mavis and Tilly. But precedent won’t help us here. Opening up submissions to the public this year is a terrible idea given how hilarious everyone in this country finds themselves and we all know how this ends: with Storm Stormy McStormface and Storm Stormzy.WednesdayCommentary around the joint appearance of Donald Trump andKeir Starmerin Canada this week focused on the dismaying optics of our prime minister scrabbling about on the ground to pick up papers the more powerful leader had dropped. What better illustration of the literal grovelling required to get on the American president’s good side?It was a little mortifying to watch, I agree. But when you stop to think about it, what strikes me about this vignette from the G7 is Starmer’s entirely normal human instinct, when someone standing beside you drops their papers, to bend to the floor to help pick them up. It’s not Starmer’s subservience that stands out in this scene, but Trump’s psychopathy as he stands there like a boulder, not helping to clear up his own mess.Of course it was only about the fourth weirdest thing the American president did this week, as he continues to extemporise and jazz-hand his way to the brink of war with Iran. A clear winner was the message Trump put out on Truth Social about Iran’s leader: “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding … We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.” A thoughtful clarification, here, for Trump’s slowest followers, that “take out” in this context doesn’t indicate the president’s desire to buy the Ayatollah dinner.View image in fullscreen‘Mr President, this is what we call a small act of human kindness.’Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/APThursdayWoo, ahatchet jobof a superstar novelist beloved by everyone in Gen Z and above! If you are someone who takes an interest in other people’s bad reviews, you will probably already have received, from multiple sources, a link to Tom Crewe’s amazingly unequivocal takedown of Ocean Vuong in this week’s London Review of Books.“I groaned my way through The Emperor of Gladness,” writes Crewe of Vuong’s new novel, a prequel to his million-selling debut On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous and an Oprah Book Club pick that is selling very briskly. “I writhed. I felt real despair every time I forced myself to open the covers. It was one of the worst ordeals of my reading life.” He went on: “This is because, while it is bad in all the ways that On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeouswas bad, it is also bad in new and unexpected ways.”For example, wrote Crewe, this novel, “has a much higher proportion of dialogue, for which Vuong has no talent. It tries, and fails, to be funny.”It is also, he writes, “inordinately long and almost entirely filler”. I haven’t read the new book, but I thoroughly enjoyed Vuong’s debut and disagree with much of this 5,000 word review. Although not enough, of course, to undermine the pleasure of reading an example of a critic telling us what he really thinks.FridayLet’s end the week in a happy place, with theweddingof Alex Soros, one of the five children of billionaire George Soros, and Huma Abedin, former political aide to Hillary Clinton whose wretched ex-husband, Anthony Weiner, arguably bears a greater responsibility for putting Trump in the White House than any other individual. (It was Weiner sending crotch photos to young women that, in a series of unlikely events, delivered a hard drive with Hillary’s emails to the FBI boss, James Comey).But after all, here’s a fairytale ending – or, depending on your view, the kind of nightmare that wakes you up at 2am in a cold sweat: you are getting married in a huge tent in the Hamptons in the presence of 500 people including Kamala Harris, Anna Wintour, Hillary Clinton and – the icing on it – Jimmy Fallon, who will be making some jokes.

Is it about to repeat it in Iran?Stephen WertheimIf the United States joins Israel’s fight to try to finish Israel’s job, it will enter into a war of unknowable scope against a country of 90 million peopleFri 20 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 12.05 EDTShareTwo decades ago, as Americans debated whether their country should invade Iraq, one question loomed the largest: did Saddam Hussein possess weapons of mass destruction? If so, the implication was that the United States should disarm and overthrow his regime by military force. If not, Washington could keep that option in reserve and continue to contain Saddam through economic sanctions and routine bombings.In time, the implications of the Iraq war far exceeded the boundaries of the original debate. Saddam, it turned out, had no weapons of mass destruction. But suppose he had possessed the chemical and biological agents that the war’s advocates claimed. Invading his country to destroy his regime would have given him the greatest possible incentive to use the worst weapons at his disposal. The war would have been just as mistaken – more so, in fact.For the same reason, the matter of WMD hardly explains the war’s genesis or its ultimate consequences. The advocates of invasion, it is true, didn’t want Saddam to build his supposed arsenal and potentially go nuclear. More important, however, theysaw an opportunityto assert America’s dominance on the global stage after the country was struck on 9/11. They wanted to remake the Middle East and demonstrate American power. That they did, just not as they hoped.Today the United States government, under President Donald Trump, is again weighing whether to use military force against a Middle Eastern country that was not preparing to attack the United States. This time the decisive question is supposed to be whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon and reaching some ill-defined point of no return. If you answer yes, you therefore favor US strikes on Iranian enrichment facilities and possibly much else. After all, the United States has long maintained that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, and if that goal cannot be achieved by diplomacy – even if America’s ally Israel may have spoiled that diplomacy – it must be attempted by force.The American public should resist such thinking, which does not make sense. Iran, according to US intelligence, was not on the verge of producing a useable nuclear device. It was giving itself that option, producing highly enriched uranium, but had not yet decided to obtain a weapon, much less undertaken the additional steps needed to construct one. For the past two months, Iran had been in diplomatic negotiations with the Trump administration, and both sides appeared to be getting closer to a deal that would drastically curtail Tehran’s enrichment of uranium and prevent any path to the bomb.Then Israel attacked. It acted less to pre-empt an Iranian bomb than to preempt American diplomacy. A new nuclear deal would have lifted sanctions on Iran’s battered economy, helping it to recover and grow. A deal would have stabilized Iran’s position in the Middle East and potentially strengthened it over time. Precisely by succeeding in preventing Iran from going nuclear, a deal would have advanced Iran’s integration into the region, accelerating the wary rapprochement Tehran had achieved with its historic rival, Saudi Arabia, over the past two years.The specific deal under discussion, which envisaged bringing Iran into a regional consortium to enrich uranium, would have kick-started the process. From there, who knows: perhaps the United States might normalize relations with Iran and, having rid itself of its main regional enemy, finally act on the desire of successive bipartisan presidents, Trump included, to pull back from the Middle East.This was the outcome that would have best served the interests of the United States. This was the outcome Israel acted to prevent. To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a formidable, normalized, and non-nuclear Iran was the threat that mattered most. Attacking Iran, by contrast, presented an opportunity – to cripple and perhaps even overthrow the Islamic Republic, whose best air defenses Israel had disabled the previous year, after Iran’s strongest regional allies in Lebanon and Syria crumbled in spectacular fashion. Israel does not know, because no one can, what kind of Iran will emerge from the wreckage: whether it will be more aggrieved or less, nuclear armed or not, a functioning state or a cauldron of chaos. Netanyahu took a gamble nonetheless, figuring the United States would finish his job, clean up his mess, or both.Even if Iran were speeding toward a nuclear weapon, even if diplomacy had been exhausted, the threat of a nuclear Iran should not be inflated. Suppose for a moment that Iran went nuclear, which it may well do now that the absence of such a deterrent left it vulnerable to attack. If Iran got the bomb, the United States, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Israel, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Iran would go nuclear to ensure the survival of its regime. Firing nuclear weapons at Israel would assure Iran’s destruction. Iran is unlikely to do that.Make no mistake: for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons is entirely undesirable. It could trigger the further spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and beyond. Iran could resume its destabilizing and destructive activities, targeting US interests and allies, assured that no one would dare to strike at the regime. The United States has rightly invested considerable effort, over decades, to prevent an Iranian bomb. But is that objective worth war?Ourwar?Thiswar?If the United States joins Israel’s fight to try to finish Israel’s job, it will enter into a war of unknowable scope against a country of 90 million people in a region of marginal strategic significance. Iran may well retaliate against Americans, triggering a large-scale, open-ended conflict. In the absolute best-case scenario, the war would quickly end in an Iranian capitulation so complete that Israel would be content to stop shooting. What then?Iranians won’t forget being attacked. Israelis won’t trust the country they attacked but left intact. And Americans will see that no matter whom they elect – even on the slogan of “America first” – their leaders refuse to take control of events and act on the national imperative to leave Middle East wars behind and focus instead on the great many unsolved and worsening problems that will actually decide America’s fate.If, on the other hand, the United States steps back from the brink, it will open up new possibilities. Of valuing the well-being of Americans over the hatred of distant demons. Of no longer living in permanent, insatiable fear. Of getting out of the position from which a rogue ally can obstruct America’s efforts, determine its national agenda, and damage its civic life.Those are the possibilities worth fighting for.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t mean constant online immersionFri 20 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.02 EDTShareThe threat of a world war. Political assassinations. Federal raids on unsuspecting migrants.There seems to be no end to terrifying news these days. In fact, it comes at us so unceasingly that numbness can set in. Or even depression or melancholy, like a black cloud over every part of our lives.The “gloomcycle” is what Rachel Janfaza, who founded the gen Z-oriented site known as the Up and Up, has dubbed what’s going on. In a recentpiece,she quoted one 23-year-old from Alabama: “I am really overwhelmed by all of the bad news I am seeing right now.”Whatever generation we’re from, that’s a familiar sensation.The question is, how to deal with it? After all, particularly because ofDonald Trump’s chaotic ways, it shows no signs of slowing down. And while it’s important not to tune out altogether, it’s also important to stay grounded.America is sleepwalking into another unnecessary war | Eli Clifton and Eldar MamedovRead moreWhere’s the balance?I’m certainly not a life coach but as someone whose work requires me to stay connected and informed, I’ve developed some coping resources.Here are three recommendations to manage the firehose of bad news and to protect your spiritual and emotional health while still staying engaged in the world.Set thoughtful limits. Can you put your phone in another room or in a drawer for a period of each day? Can you pledge never to sleep with it nearby? I have a friend who has made a pact with her spouse to have an hour after waking and an hour before going to bed in which they don’t talk about current events, and certainly never utter the name of the 47th president.Can you decide not to be on social media during significant hours of the day? And maybe even to ignore your email unless it’s during loosely defined business hours? (This is an especially tough one for me; I always want to respond immediately, which only elicits another response.)Engage in self-care.Maybe you go to the gym or for a run. Maybe it’s a bubble bath. Maybe it’s listening, without any other distractions, to Mozart – or Jon Batiste. For me, it’s daily yoga (the challenging ashtanga practice) followed by meditation. And it’s reading fiction or memoirs unrelated to politics – most recently, Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses, Fredrik Backman’s My Friends,Molly Jong-Fast’s How to Lose Your Mother, and, in galley form, Susan Orlean’s not-yet-published memoir, Joyride.A friend told me recently that she’s rereading all six novels of Jane Austen as an antidote to these fractious times. I like to read books in print, not on a device, since screens are already too dominant in my life. Can you slow down enough to give your full attention to literature for an hour? It will help, and it will also help to build back your undoubtedly frayed attention span.Rely on trusted voices and sources of news.I think the Guardian is one of these, and I would think so even if I didn’t write here almost every week. I know a lot of people who count on the perspective of Heather Cox Richardson, the history professor who writes a dailynewsletter, Letters from an American.Robert Reich, a former labor secretary, is one of my go-to sources of perspective, as are a few columnists, including Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Inquirer and Lydia Polgreen at the New York Times.While traveling in Asia recently, I read the Japan Times and the international edition of the New York Times each morning; they were bundled together and delivered to my hotel room. There was something about that well-organized news – delivered in old-fashioned print form – that was incredibly calming. A prominently displayed column about Israel by Thomas Friedman gave me more context than a freaked-out social media thread, no matter how smart. While it’s unlikely that we’re going to return to reading a print newspaper as a major news source, the daily pacing and the sensible curation of what’s important has a lot to recommend it.The anti-Trump camp was in disarray. How has No Kings managed to unite it? | Emma BrockesRead moreIn Chris Hayes’s recent book, The Sirens’ Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource, the political commentator identifies what’s going on for all of us – and the dangers. Hayes confessed in aVox interviewthat despite his knowledge about the “attention economy” and its personal costs, he still struggles.“I’ve written a recovery memoir,” Hayes joked that he told his wife, “and I’m still drinking.”The bad news will keep coming. As citizens, we need to know what’s happening so we can act – in the voting booth, at a protest rally, in conversations with our neighbors or loved ones.But that doesn’t mean constant immersion. A little of the gloomcycle goes a long way.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionSmartphonesDigital mediaSocial mediaUS politicsMental healthMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

Liberal cities have become targets for politicians looking to stir up their voters elsewhereFri 20 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTShareFromLos Angelesto London, Istanbul to Warsaw, cities are making rightwing populists angry. Their liberal elites, immigrants, net zero policies, leftwing activists, globalised businesses, expensive transport infrastructure and outspoken municipal leaders – all are provocations to populist politicians whose support often comes from more conservative, less privileged places.Three years ago the founders of national conservatism, the transatlantic ideology on which much of modern rightwing populism is based, published a statement of principles. One of these, surprisingly little noticed at the time,declaredwith some menace: “In those [places] in which law and justice have been manifestly corrupted, or in which lawlessness, immorality, and dissolution reign, national government must intervene energetically to restore order.”This month, Donald Trump’s administration identified the first American city – and almost certainly not the last – tomeet these ominously broad criteria. “Los Angeles has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens,” he said. It was “a city of criminals” and “socialists”, said his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. “Mob violence” was so disrupting the work of the federal government there, claimed his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that an “insurrection” was under way. Trump promised: “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean and safe again.”That this “liberation” involved an ongoing, expanding and legally contentious military occupation – almost unprecedented in American history – is one indicator of how deep the populist animosity towards liberal cities and their leaders runs. Another is therecent imprisonmentof the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu, a challenger to the authoritarian Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for the Turkish presidency. Another is the level of security required for London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, which is similar to that for Keir Starmer and King Charles.The death threats, public abuse and state aggression endured by such municipal figures in supposedly free democracies – along with slightly more subtle anti-urban interventions, such as Nigel Farage’scomplaintin 2014 that he could not “hear English” on an inner London train – reveal much about rightwing populism, its anxieties and fundamental values. Cities are where the future often starts, and populism is often about holding on to the past.While conservative populism reveres, or says it reveres, the nation state, the countryside, community, social continuity and the traditional family, cities are often places of more fluid loyalties. While populism presents politics as a simple battle between “the people” and their enemies, cities, by gathering so many interest groups in one place, show that politics is in fact a more complex process: involving competition but also cooperation, contests over space and resources, and many social forces, including class, gender, sexuality, local pride and race.More enraging and disorienting still for conservative populists, over the past 30 years many big cities have changed. Trump acknowledges this bydescribingLos Angeles as “once great”. As Mike Davis laid out in hispioneering historiesof the city, for most of the 20th century Los Angeles was, behind its laid-back image, a highly conservative place: racially segregated, repressively policed, ruled by Republican mayors as much as Democrats. Immigration, radical activism, more progressive administrations and liberal gentrification gradually altered the city so that now, while still often shaped by inequalities, it is a stronghold of the centre left.A similar shift has happened since the 1990s in Paris,Londonand many other European and North American cities. For the right, the loss of these prestigious places has been a bitter defeat – hence their insistence that they have been ruined by liberals and the left. Khan’s centrist mayoralty in London has used its very limited powers to provide free meals for primary schoolchildren and give the capital cleaner air, yet is routinely described by the rightwing press as a dogmatic and disastrous experiment.Such caricatures of cities and their government are all the more unconvincing because they ignore the political complexity of these places. Forty percent of Londonersvoted for Brexit, and many of the city’s immigrants are social conservatives. Some of its supposedly most rigid leftwing areas have, or have had, well-known rightwingers as residents: Boris Johnson and Paul Dacre, the ferociously illiberal former Daily Mail editor, used to live in Islington, north London. Dominic Cummings still does. At a Turkish greengrocer in the borough, I sometimes see the Tory MP Nick Timothy – who recently told the House of Commons: “Diversity is not our strength: it is a very serious and difficult challenge” – queueing seemingly quite happily as the shop hums with different languages, before returning to his home in the even more diverse borough of Hackney.For all the aspects of city life that infuriate those on the right, there are others you might expect to please them: the emphasis on work, the entrepreneurialism, huge importance of property and endless hierarchies. These priorities and divides could push cities back to the right. In the 1980s, much of London elected Tory MPs. Paris had a conservative mayor, Jacques Chirac, from 1977 to 1995.Yet a return to urban conservatism feels less likely with the right in populist mode. As the Economist magazine – not usually an ally of the municipal left – recently pointed out, city government needs “pragmatic politicos who keep … the roads free of potholes … [and] buses running on time”. The broad-brush, administratively chaotic politics of Trump, Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives don’t seem well suited to such tasks.Perhaps that doesn’t matter to the populists. They can go on attacking cities, in order to stir up their voters elsewhere, without actually having to run them. Meanwhile, liberal and leftwing municipal politicians keep key economic and tourism hubs functional, leaving populist national politicians such as Trump free to promote less practical policies. He may hate contemporary Los Angeles and California, but the state’s economyrecently overtookJapan’s to become the world’s fourth largest – helpful for a president whose own economic plan is misfiring.Yet the urban resistance to rightwing populism shouldn’t be written off as just playing into the enemy’s hands, as some political pessimists have done during the protests in Los Angeles. Whether on the street or from a grand mayoral office, defying today’s intolerant, reactionary populists has a value – as an act in itself and as an encouragement to others. City life can be grim and disappointing. But one of its virtues is that while trends come and go fast, rebellions are rarely forgotten.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionLos AngelesLondonDonald TrumpFar right (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Trust me, it’s the last thing Europe needsAlexander HurstThe EU is under pressure to strike a trade deal with Trump, but an influx of mass-produced, low-quality food must be off the tableFri 20 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 08.22 EDTShareAll over European media, the take seems to be similar – that the EU is “under pressure” to conclude some sort of deal with the US in order to avoid Donald Trump’s 9 July deadline for the unilateral imposition of broad tariffs. What might be on the table in the attempt to secure that? In early May, the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was already suggesting that a deal to increase purchases from the UScould includeagricultural products – a possibility thatseems to remaineven though Šefčovič later clarified that the EU wasnot contemplatingchanging its health or safety standards.Since I havefailed to Abba(“Always be boldly acronyming”) and don’t have anything as good as Taco (“Trump always chickens out”) – coined by the Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong – at the ready, I’ll simply reach for the easy line: opening the door even slightly to more US food imports into the EU would leave a bad taste in all our mouths. Trump’s hostage-taking approach to trade should not be rewarded, certainly not with something that hits as close to home as food does.“The European Union won’t take chicken from America. They won’t take lobsters from America. They hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak,” declared the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in April.Laughter aside, every time I go back to the US I become a vegetarian for the duration of my trip – even though US grocery store vegetables are themselves generallybig, blemish-free and bland. Why? Call me paranoid, but I simply don’t want to ingest the samegrowth hormonesthat Lutnick’s “beautiful” meat probably contains traces of and that are banned in the EU.Growing up in Ohio, I experienced the full force of US food culture. It was the 90s, which meant that margarine was most definitely in and butter was out; an example that highlights how processedeverythingtook root, including – in my vegetarian family – highly processed meat alternatives. The people around me meant well, but how do you fight a system that, from top to bottom,was designedto pushhigh fructose corn syrupinto practically everything (and most worryingly into school lunches)?To be fair, all of this has since generated a domestic backlash, but there’s an intense amount of momentum behind it still: almost without fail, I find that the standard sugar level in the US soarsfar beyondwhat I now find appealing. Even in places I wouldn’t expect to find added sugar at all, like pizza.And why would the Trump administration’s full-scale savaging of the US government’s administrative and regulatory capacity,including the Food and Drug Administration, increase anyone’s trust that what US regulation does exist is actually being followed?Some of you are perhaps rolling your eyes, thinking: Alexander Hurst, a naturalised French citizen, has gone full “chauvin”; converts are the worst. Except it’s not just me. There is an entire internet subgenre of content extolling the virtues ofFrench butter, or involving Americans whocome to France and realisethatthisis what peaches, or strawberries, really taste like.Beyond the question of whether or not Europeanswantto eat US agricultural output, a hypothetical trade deal would involve hugely negative climate impacts. The distance that food travelsalready accounts for 20%of global agriculture-related emissions pollution, andEurope’s sharein imported agriculture emissions is already high. We need to be reducing it, not adding to it through foodstuffs carted unnecessarily across the Atlantic.How can we ask European farmers to accelerate their transition to regenerative agriculture (which offers the potential todrastically reduceagriculture emissions) if, at the same time, they are being undercut by US producers who face far lower regulatory standards?“Europe already produces and grows everything it could possibly need. The last thing we want to see circulating is hormone-pumped beef or chlorinated poultry,” says Lindsey Tramuta, the author ofThe Eater Guide to Paris. “Even beyond the goods themselves, there’s the issue of distance: why bring food over from the US if Europeans can get their needs met from much closer to home?”Yannick Huang, who manages the Vietnamese restaurant Loan in Paris’s Belleville neighbourhood, agrees. “At a time when we’re trying to do organic, local, it’s pointless to want to import anything from the US,” he told me. Huang, who is obsessive about ingredient quality, only serves French beef. To him, US agriculture comes tainted with the connotation of “GMOs and other problems”.Hold on, you might say. Isn’t it inconsistent to oppose Trump’s tariffs while also promoting food protectionism? Fair point: it’s hard to find a “one size fits all” approach to globalisation. It has harmed some workers in wealthy economies while alsoreducing the gapbetween low-income nations and high-income ones. No country on Earth has a fully self-contained advanced semiconductor manufacturing supply chain, and in sectors where globalisation has become excessive, it might be even moreeconomically harmfulto roll back. None of that, though, means that things that have resisted becoming fully global should all of a sudden be opened up – food most of all.Ramzi Saadé is a Lebanese-Canadian chef whose Paris restaurant, Atica, is dedicated to afiercely regional approachto haute cuisine. But taking his diners on a voyage of discovery doesn’t mean his food has to go on one too; despite focusing on first Basque, and now Corsican cuisine, he sources almost all of his ingredients from the area surrounding Paris. For a lamb dish involving 13 different elements, only the nepeta, a Corsican herb, had travelled, he said. “Is my role today to bring you Japanese culture via wasabi flown to Paris?” Saadé asked. “No, my role is to explain to you that it’s grated this way and put on fish for this reason, and I can do that with wasabi from France.”I couldn’t help but think that it’s actually far more interesting to do it his way – to interpret a cuisine rather than attempt to transpose it.We are what we eat. A cuisine is a medium of communication; it is, indelibly, tied up with the stories we tell about who we are. Perhaps that’s why it’s so disturbing to see food held hostage, or weaponised, in the pursuit of economic or geostrategic goals.Europe’s intense and varied regionality is an enormous part of how it eats and therefore what it is. Opening the market to mass penetration by US agriculture would, little by little, nibble away at that richness. It’s the kind of proposition that, if it ever makes it out of the kitchen, should be sent back straight away.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionTariffsTrump administrationEuropeFranceBeefUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But they say the training sessions have not explained what the technology will be used for.Reporters have been told to expect another round of training using an AI tool called “Story Cutter” which will edit and produce copy, effectively removing or reducing the need for subeditors.The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance said the AI programs were not only a threat to jobs but also threatened to undermine accountable journalism.News Corpmastheads have certainly embraced the use of AI for illustrations recently; andin 2023the company admitted producing 3,000 localised articles a week using generative artificial intelligence.Sinking feeling as Adelaide Advertiser chooses wrong week to run Aukus submarines sponsored series | Weekly BeastRead moreIn March the company’s chief technology officer, Julian Delany, unveiled NewsGPT and described it as a powerful tool.A News Corp Australia spokesperson told Weekly Beast: “As with many companies News Corp Australia is investigating how AI technologies can enhance our workplaces rather than replace jobs.

Editor-in-chief of WA Newspapers, Christopher Dore, has been approached for comment.Breaking with traditionOn Monday, Australian Story will examine the Rachael Gunn story – but Raygun’s voice will not be heard after the breakdancer declined to participate.While this is a departure for the award-winning program, which conventionally tells first-person stories, it’s not unheard of. Australian Story’s executive producer, Caitlin Shea, told Weekly Beast the format is broad enough “to examine ideas, issues, and cultural phenomena as well as the more personal profile”.View image in fullscreenRaygun at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.Photograph: Elsa/Getty Images / ABCShea points to episodes that examined Cliff Young’s race, the ABC TV show Race Around the World and true crime stories about Kathleen Folbigg, the Somerton Man mystery and Lyn Dawson.The episode is not a profile but “examines the Raygun phenomenon to try to understand why it created such a storm and why Gunn remains such a polarising figure”.Giant of business journalism retiresAfter 45 years in journalism, 35 of them at the ABC, the broadcaster’s senior business correspondent Peter Ryan is retiring. Treasurer Jim Chalmers paid tribute to Ryan, calling him “an absolute legend” in a note to staff from news director Justin Stevens. “Every day as you wake up and you think about what’s happening in the economy, if you only needed to listen to one voice to be sure that you got its essential elements, it would be Peter’s,” Chalmers said.Stevens said Ryan has metastatic thyroid cancer and is moving to palliative care, and focusing on his wife, Mary Cotter, and daughter Charlotte.Recognised with the Order of Australia medal in 2022, Ryan has reported for flagship radio programs AM, The World Today and PM and his roles have included Washington bureau chief, head of TV news and current affairs in Victoria, executive producer of Business Breakfast and founding editor of Lateline Business.His advice to colleagues: “Show up to work early and prove that you’re ready to take on the big story of the day. Try to have a Plan B in your back pocket just in case your original brilliant idea doesn’t go anywhere and the EP comes walking your way.

I mean, how do you juggle it all?Trump: “I’ve got wars. I’ve got war and peace, and I have you. And I heard it was your first, so this is your first [podcast].

Titles included “Head, Spoken” (Radio National manager) and “Classical Lead” (manager of Classic FM).Non-state actorDespite the failure of her“official” endorsementof Peter Dutton before the last election, Sharri Markson has issued her own symbolic sanctions on Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong.“I’m going to start tonight by issuing my own symbolic sanctions against the two most damaging figures in the Albanese government, the prime minister and the foreign minister,” theSky News Australiahost said.“I sanction Wong and Albanese for their antagonistic and extreme rhetoric which, over the past 20 months has only inflamed anti-Israel sentiment and contributed to the dangerous rise in antisemitism in our country.”Distress and harmAn apparent suicide of a young man at a public place in the Adelaide CBD on Sunday has been extensively reported by the Advertiser, much to the dismay of the South Australian Police and the man’s family.A spokesperson for the police told Weekly Beast that despite the police advising all media outlets on Sunday 15 June that the incident was “a mental health matter, and we will not be reporting on it any further”, some members of the media went ahead anyway and the family was “extremely distraught”.The Advertiser published several stories in the newspaper and online, as well as a video. The content included multiple photographs of the location, the manner of suicide and the man’s private photographs.The Australian Press Council has specific guidelines for the reporting of an individual suicide, which say it should only be done if it is in the public interest and the journalist has the consent of the family. The manner of suicide should not be disclosed. This individual was not a public figure.Late on Thursday, with another article published in the Advertiser, the South Australian police took the unusual step “on behalf of [the] family” of asking the media to remove all the content.We “formally request all media remove any articles, social media or any media relating to his death”, SA police said. “The reporting and media articles are causing further unnecessary distress and harm to the family and friends of [the deceased]. We trust that all media will adhere to this request on behalf of the family and actions its requests immediately.”The editor of the Advertiser, Gemma Jones, and the editor of the Daily Mail, Felicity Hetherington, did not respond to requests for comment and the stories remain online at the time of publication.Explore more on these topicsNews CorporationWeekly BeastArtificial intelligence (AI)Australian mediaDonald TrumpMedia businessState of OriginSeven West MediacommentShareReuse this content"

The road has been long and hard, and I am very aware that many others have been on that journey since long before I even became an MP. The question of whether to offer choice to people at the end of their lives was first raised inparliament in 1936– almost a century ago.Since then, terminally ill people have pleaded repeatedly with MPs to heed their simple wish to have control and autonomy at the end of their lives. A courageous few have taken their cases to the courts, even while they confronted the prospect of their own imminent and inevitable deaths. The judges said it was for parliament to decide. Now, at last, the House of Commons has responded, and responded decisively to recognise the justice of their cause.Whiletaking this bill throughits Commons stages, I felt the burden of their anguish and that of those who are courageously and respectfully asking that their own death should be a good one, at a time of their choosing. It was for them that I and my colleagues took so much time and trouble to ensure that we put before parliament legislation that wasfit for purposewhile protecting everybody, but especially the most vulnerable in society, from any risk of coercion or pressure.Undertaking that task through the private member’s bill process has not been straightforward. But that is how conscience issues are decided in our democracy. In doing so I have been fortunate to benefit from the expertise of excellent and dedicated government officials, lawyers and parliamentary draughtsmen – the foot soldiers of our democracy whose contributions often go unnoticed. The government is rightly neutral, but its hard work helped give me the confidence that the bill that now goes on to the House of Lords for further consideration is the best it possibly could be.I have also been supported by MPs across the political divides in the House of Commons and that has been a hugely rewarding experience. It proved once again that on this issue, like so many others, it is possible to work with political opponents and that,in the words of my sister, Jo Cox, “We have far more in common … than that which divides us.”I believe that by working together with a shared commitment not just to get this reform through, but to do it carefully, responsibly and openly, we have done the job our constituents send us to Westminster to do. When other political arguments that we have day in and day out are long forgotten, this parliament will be remembered for many years to come for the decision we have made. And it is my genuine belief that in that time thecontroversy over this measurewill fade, just as it has in other countries that took this step long before us. And just as it has over issues that were once fiercely contested but are now accepted as sensible and fair, such as equal marriage or a woman’s right to choose.I hope this is the last piece I ever have to write in defence of assisted dying | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIf this bill finally becomes law later this year it will still take some years to implement, although I hope that delay will be as short as possible. It will come too late for many, including some of those I have met along this journey. Their courage is extraordinary and their selflessness is remarkable. They say to me: “I may not get the death of my choice, but if others coming later are spared the suffering and indignity of a painful death then it will be worthwhile.”Their voices have finally been heard. The journey is not yet over but the end is in sight. I would have been heartbroken if the vote had gone the other way. Not for me and my team and all those who have worked so hard on this bill, but for those whose lives would have once more been filled with despair and trepidation.I recall thewords of Desmond Tutualmost a decade ago when he said: “Just as I have argued firmly for compassion and fairness in life, I believe that terminally ill people should be treated with the same compassion and fairness when it comes to their deaths.” It has taken a long time – too long – for us in this country to heed those words but heed them we have, and I believe this will be remembered as a proud day for parliament and a day of hope for the future.Kim Leadbeater is Labour MP for Spen ValleyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a site that subjects women to relentless scrutiny, and lo and behold it’s run by a spineless manFri 20 Jun 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 14.26 EDTShareWith as much as two weeks to kill before nuclear winter sets in, many of you will be looking to road-test your new fallout suits. In which case: can I interest you in the sensational unmasking of the founder of Tattle Life? It turns out the guy who operates the radioactively toxic gossip forum is a “vegan influencer” – I think it’s one of those new types of job, dear – and his name isSebastian Bond. From that professional description, Sebastian would never hurt a living creature – unless it’s a mummy blogger, in which case he would gut her like a pig. Metaphorically, of course! Sorry, but that is simply the price you pay for not declaring the nappies you’re unboxing on Instagram are actually sponsored.But I’m racing ahead. If you’re not familiar with Tattle Life, it’s an online forum that claims to be “a commentary website on public business social media accounts” – much in the way the torpedoing of the Lusitania was a commentary on the commercial cruise business. At one point Tattle Life was said to have 12 million monthly visitors. Which, to put it into context, ismore than the Times and Sunday Times websitegets, and considerably surpasses the visitor numbers of something like GB News. The other thing Tattle Life says about itself on its homepage is: “We have a zero-tolerance policy to any content that is abusive, hateful or harmful.” This is a little bit like the Racing Post saying it has a zero-tolerance policy for stories about horses, greyhounds or sports betting.In effect, Tattle Life comprises a pulsating collection of live threads, in which anonymous users spend their lengthy wine time ignoring their own kids in order to obsessively tear down Stacey Solomon for some infinitesimal perceived mistake she’s made with hers that day. That’s it, Tattlers – you crack open another chilled box of rosé and remorselessly slag off, dox or expose this or that influencer/Instagrammer/minor rando for infringements of a code of which you’re the self-appointed enforcers. And if you don’t like that description of yourselves, boohoo. What, NOW you want accuracy and restraint?Anyway, the site has been positively thriving like this for some years, despite regular petitions to take it down and frequent outpourings of distress from celebrities, sublebrities and whatever the class of recognition below even that is, many of whom believe it has either destroyed their professional lives and/or mental health, or had an incredibly good go at trying. Two such victims wereNeil and Donna Sands, a Northern Irish couple with a clothing line and various other small businesses. Donna discovered she had been targeted by site users in 2021, when a friend alerted her to the fact that people in her office were laughing over a 45-page thread about her. Forty-five pages! I guess no snowflake in an avalanche feels responsible.The deranged interest/abuse continued, to the point of posting her whereabouts at any given time, and drove Donna almost to the point of nervous breakdown. The pair sued Tattle Life for defamation and, after a long and complex battle, won. They were awarded a combined £300,000 in damages as well as costs – now estimated to total about £2m. But who was to pay? Tattle Life was run anonymously, and it was only a week ago that the high court of justice in Northern Irelandlifted various reporting restrictions and orders, leading to one Sebastian Bond being exposed as the operator of the site.Many think the floodgates to further legal action will now open, but whatever Tattle Life’s fate, it’s interesting as a period piece. The site sprang up in an era when fame came to be regarded as a grasping business decision and not as a cultural accolade. Anyone who made money in the public eye was fair game for anything. And look, no one likes a grift, we can all have sympathy for people who feel they’re being missold something or other, and most of us would fear the Faustian bargain of explicitly monetising our personal lives, let alone our children. But the elevation of even tiny bits of poetic licence by individuals most people have never heard of to the level of massive consumer fraud is mad – and says so much more about the self-styled cops of our age than the robbers.In the end, investigators got Bond via his own site’s preferred methods – obsessively tracking his public digital footprint, piecing together bits of often contradictory information, searching for chinks in his armour. The biter was bit. And, would you believe, Sebastian had pretended to be a woman on Tattle. Went by the name of Helen McDougal. “I was just not surprised that it was a man pretending to be a woman,”Donna Sands told the Mailthis week, “and pitting these women against each other – driving them to their darkest places.”So where is Sebastian Bond now? Some reports place him in Thailand, while others ran pictures of his parents’ nice house in Somerset. As forwhohe is … he’s a man posing as a woman in the course of drawing profit, an individual dedicated to exposure who didn’t have the nuts to reveal himself, a grifter who’d rather vanish than face his own music. In fact, so vast is the disconnect between who Sebastian really is and who he presented as for his moneymaking activities that there really ought to be hundreds of skin-flayingly vicious threads about him on Tattle Life. And yet, needless to say, there aren’t.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When I met him at a hospital in Khan Younis – where painkillers, like food, are scarce – the 13-year-old was in agony. “I have shrapnel inside my body that they couldn’t remove,” he told me. “I am in real pain; since 6am I have been asking for a painkiller.” As he recounted the chaos, his father’s composure shattered, and tears rolled down his face. Was he going to lose his son simply because Abed Al Rahman wanted his family to eat?Abed Al Rahman had been trying to get food from a new private and militarised distribution site in Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is funnelling aid through a handful of southern sites guarded by private contractors and Israeli soldiers. With so few distribution points, those who can make the trek are forced to travel long, dangerous distances – risking their lives for grossly inadequate amounts of supplies.In the first week of the GHF’s operation, there werefive mass-casualty eventsin the vicinity of distribution sites as desperate civilians were met by gun and tank fire. Children have been killed. The UN’s aid chief,Tom Fletcher, saidthe sites made “starvation a bargaining chip” and were “a fig leaf for further violence and displacement”. A system that bypasses the UN has, in fact, bypassed humanity. Indeed, politicised aid distribution is unsafe for everyone involved – last week, the GHF said eight of its local team members and volunteers had been killed.And while it’s critical that there is a focus on this lethal lack of aid for Palestinians, the daily killing and maiming of children has become an afterthought. This is my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of 7 October, and in all that time almost nothing has been done to stop the world’s deadliest conflict for children in recent memory. There have been more than50,000 childrenreported killed or injured in 20 months. Fifty thousand.On the same morning I met Abed Al Rahman, I spoke with 24-year-old Sheima, also hospitalised. She, too, went to one of the GHF distribution sites. Different day, same story: her family was denied humanitarian aid for months. Consumed by hunger, her father too sick to travel, Sheima reached a site. Again, gunfire. Boxes of food thrown to the dirt. “I saw dead bodies on the ground,” she told me. “People stepping over them, just trying to get some food.” In the mayhem, Sheima became entangled in wire – her leg and arm torn open as she tried to flee. She didn’t get any food. “Even though I almost died, I would go again,” she said. “I’m the eldest in my family – we need food to survive. I wish to die with a full stomach, not from starvation.”These raw testimonials reinforce two critical questions. First, when UN and international non-governmental organisations warehouses outside Gaza are jam-packed with lifesaving supplies, why is there still a lethal lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza? And second, will these few sites run by private contractors solve the crisis?On the first point, after a total blockade on all supplies going into Gaza from early March until 19 May, Unicef and the World Food Programme are now permitted to bring in limited quantities of only a few selected items. Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classificationwarned last monththat all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza are facing life-threatening food insecurity. Lack of access to clean water has been pushed to lethal levels.Amid incessant bombardments, drastic aid restrictions and mass displacement of the civilian population, the risk of famine is not just possible, but increasingly likely for families in Gaza. From the end of the ceasefire to May this year, malnutrition admissions among children aged under fivesurged by nearly 150%, with a steep rise in severe cases. This isn’t just a trend – it’s an urgent warning.And to the second question, can the GHF prevent famine? The reality is, far too little aid is being distributed from far too few distribution points, all amid concerns that families travelling from northern Gaza to reach sites in the south will not be allowed to return.This is not how you avert famine. Before the collapse of the most recent ceasefire, the UN operated a highly effective aid delivery system in Gaza. And during the ceasefire, we were delivering assistance from more than 400 distribution points across the territory. Access to food, safe water, medicines and shelter skyrocketed. Unicef even went door-to-door to reach malnourished children.Unicef continues to call for a ceasefire, protection of children, the release of hostages and full aid access. We know what it takes to deliver for children in emergencies – it is the same in every crisis and every conflict since the second world war. Children need nutritious food at scale, safety, clean water and dignity. Not security operators. Not indiscriminate fire. Not chaos.There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.Abed Al Rahman died of his injuries on 17 June 2025, after this article was written.James Elder is Unicef’s global spokespersonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

MPs must take their chance to drive forward personal freedoms – and add to Labour’s legacyFri 20 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 07.50 EDTShareMPs, read this horror before you vote today. Here’s how some people are slowly dying, right now, in mortal agony untreatable by the best palliative care: “Some will retch at the stench of their own body rotting. Some will vomit their own faeces. Some will suffocate, slowly, inexorably, over several days.” An average of 17 people a day are dying these bad deaths, according to 2019 figures, as reported by palliative care professionals who see it happen.TheInescapable Truth, a report from Dignity in Dying, revealed what is usually kept hidden from us: the shocking last months for the unluckiest. It could happen to you or me. The assisted dying bill’s final Commons vote today is no abstract debate about slippery slopes or what God wants: to do nothing is to inflict torture on many.The vote may be tight: unwhipped private members’ bills rely on MPs turning up. At second reading, 330 were in favour, 275 against. After 100 hours of detailed scrutiny and many strict amendments, more than 40 MPs switched both ways. No longer a judge, but an expert panel with a lawyer, social worker and psychiatrist will examine each application. Compromises include a four-year wait after royal assent for the service to be set up. An ITV Newsvote trackerexpects 154 MPs to vote for it, 144 against, 22 undecided and 21 abstainers.Opponents are wheeling out their last-gasp tactics. Catholic bishops this week warned that the future of care homes and hospices will be put into “grave doubt” by the legislation: “Institutions whose mission has always been to provide compassionate care in sickness or old age, and to provide such care until the end of life, may have no choice, in the face of these demands, to withdraw from the provision of such care.” Disingenuous is a polite word – under the bill, health and social care workerscan refuse involvementin the assisted dying process.God moves in such mysterious ways that some of his followers hide his involvement, without publicly revealing their religious reasons for opposing. The campaign group Our Duty of Care doesn’t mention God on its website – nor the fact it shares an office with and isfinanced by evangelical groups. Membership of Care Not Killing, which runs the Our Duty of Care campaign, is largely religious. Only God ordains the time of our entrances and exits. The mystery is its secretiveness. Presumably that’s because his word cuts very little mustard in a country where 53%have no religion.Others of the faith avoid mentioning him, such asJacob Rees-Mogg on GB News, accusing Labour of “a cult of death”, with Labour MPs “voting to finish off the elderly” in the week of the “terrible vote from the House of Commons to allow infanticide of babies in the womb”, after the Commons decriminalised women ending their pregnancies. Cult of death? That sounds more applicable to those willing to let others die in painful agony.But not all opponents are religious. One of the oddest is the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych). Although the bill requires patients to be mentally competent to request assisted dying, among other objections the RCPsych reminds MPs that “terminal illness is arisk factor for suicide”. That’s the point – a time when suicide might be quite rational. Offering psychiatry instead of an easeful potion could be greeted with expletives from those in agony.Disability groups have been persuasive, fearing they may be pushed towards shortening their lives, always at risk of being treated as inconvenient. But polling of those with disabilities shows78% in favourassisted dying, in line with the rest of the population.Scotland,Jerseyand the Isle of Man have moved ahead of England on this, andFrance just joinedthe many countries in legalising the right to die. Hundreds travel to Dignitas in Switzerland:52% of Britssay they would consider this grim and lonely death, but few can afford the £15,000. About650 suicidesof the dying are recorded; there may be more of these lonely, unassisted deaths.MPs have personal beliefs, but also solemn duties: that’s why they must reject the assisted dying bill this week | Gordon BrownRead moreIf I sound intemperate, it’s the memory of my mother’s prolonged painful death: she thought her good GP would ease her way out but, post-Shipman, he couldn’t. No, as some hope, morphine is not a kindly drug wafting you away – it can’t remove all pain. Enough people have witnessed bad deaths that public opinion is strongly behind the right to die.Opponents warn people may be pushed into a faster death because they are a perceived burden on their family. To avoid inflicting suffering on those around you seems to me a good reason for not leaving a miserable memory of your final months. Knowing it’s an option, even if never used, will comfort many given a terminal diagnosis. What if, opponents keep warning, someone is pressed into it? Everything is a balance of risks: set the absolute certainty of some horrible deaths against the possibility that a dying person may lose a few months of life. Which is worse?AsLabourreaches one year in office, this vote should join this week’s abortion decriminalisation as another milestone in the long history of personal freedoms that is always the party’s legacy. While Harold Wilson never personally backed Roy Jenkins’s long list of radical reforms, Keir Starmer has vociferously supported both bills. If it passes, it goes to the Lords, where 26 bishops will do their damnedest to stop it, reminding us why they should be removed along with the hereditaries. I have written often over many years on the right to die when we choose. I hope I never need to again.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Its director discusses cultural baggage, catastrophising – and why his kids’ generation is an ‘upgrade’Xan BrooksFri 20 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.01 EDTShareThe UK is a wasteland in Danny Boyle’s new film. Towns lie in ruins, trains rot on the rails and the EU has severed all ties with the place. Some residents are stuck in the past and congregate under the tattered flag of St George. The others flail shirtless through the open countryside, raging about nothing, occasionally stopping to eat worms. You wouldn’t want to live in the land that Boyle and the writerAlex Garlandshow us. Teasingly, on some level, the film suggests that we do.Boyle and Garland first prowled zombie Britain with their 2002 hit28 Days Later. It was an electrifying piece of speculative fiction, a guerrilla-style thriller about an unimaginable world. Since then we’ve had Brexit and Covid, and the loomingthreat of martial law in the US… The story’s extravagant flights of fancy don’t feel so far-fetched any more. “Yes, of course real world events were a big influence this time around,” Boyle says, sipping tea in the calm of a central London hotel. “Brexit is a transparency that passes over this film, without a doubt. But the big resonance of the original film was the way it showed how British cities could suddenly empty out overnight. And after Covid, those scenes now feel like a proving ground.” Where Cillian Murphy first walked, the rest of us would soon follow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vlad Vdk/Contour by Getty Images28 Years Later review – sprinting zombies take evolutionary leap forward in badass threequelRead moreTense and gory, 28 Years Later is a fabulous horror epic. I would hesitate to call it a sequel, exactly: it’s more a reboot or a renovation; a fresh build over an existing property. Newcomer Alfie Williams plays 12-year-old Spike, who defies his parents (Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and flees the sanctuary of Holy Island for an adventure on the infected mainland. Along the way, he tangles with berserker zombies and smirking psycho-killers, and encounters Ralph Fiennes’s enigmatic, orange-skinned Dr Kelson, reputedly a former GP from Whitley Bay. All of which makes for a jolting, engrossing journey; a film that freewheels through a gone-to-seed northern England before crashing headlong into the closing credits with many of its key questions still unanswered.The hanging ending is the point, Boyle explains, because the film is actually the first part of a proposed trilogy. Sony Pictures has put up two-thirds of the budget. The second movie – The Bone Temple, directed by the Americanfilm-maker Nia DaCosta– is already in the can. Boyle has plans to shoot the final instalment, except that the future is unwritten and the industry is on a knife edge.View image in fullscreen‘It showed how British cities could empty out overnight’ … Cillian Murphy in 28 Days Later.Photograph: Ronald Grant“Sony has taken a massive risk,” the director tells me happily. “The original film worked well in America to everyone’s surprise, but there’s no guarantee that this one will. It’s all because of this guy, [Sony Pictures’ CEO] Tom Rothman. He’s a bit of a handful, a fantastic guy, runs the studio in a crazy way. He’s paid for two films, but he hasn’t paid for the third one yet and so his neck’s on the line. If this film doesn’t work, he’s now got a second film that he has to release. But after that, yeah, we might not get to complete the story.”Good directors reflect the times they work in, but they’re at the mercy of them, too, hot-wired to the twists and turns of history; up one year and down the next. And so it is with Boyle, who’s travelled from the sunny Cool Britannia uplands ofShallow GraveandTrainspottingthrough the imperial age of Slumdog Millionaire and the London Olympics, right down to the shonky doldrums of today, when a cherished project might collapse under him like an exhausted horse. He’s 68 now, and battling to get his films across the line. I don’t know why he’s so cheerful. Hasn’t everything gone to hell?“Well, I’m an optimist,” he says. “So I don’t despair about things the way I know that a lot of people do. Also I’m slightly more outside the media than you. That allows me a slightly different view on things. And increasingly, as I age, I become more wary of the obsessions of the media. That constant catastrophising and sense of perceived decline.”View image in fullscreenCool Britannia uplands … Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor, Kevin McKidd and Ewen Bremner in Trainspotting.Photograph: Channel Four Films/AllstarIt’s particularly noticeable in the US, he thinks. “Much of Trump’s dominance is undoubtedly down to his appeal to the media. He is so media friendly. His soundbites, everything about him, fit hand in glove with news and entertainment to the point where it’s damaging. Whereas in this country, we’re quite fortunate. We’ve dodged the far-right bullet for the moment and we elected Keir Starmer against the tide of what’s been happening elsewhere.” He reaches for his tea. “It could be a lot worse.”In 2012, Boyle devised and directed Isles of Wonder, theopening ceremony of the London Olympics. The show was a triumph: a bumper celebration of British culture that made room for James Bond and the queen, Windrush migrants and the NHS, Shakespeare and the Sex Pistols. “But my biggest regret was that we didn’t feature the BBC more. I was stopped from doing it because it was the host broadcaster. Every other objection, I told them to go fuck themselves. But that one I accepted and I regret that now, especially given the way that technology is moving. The idea that we have a broadcaster that is part of our national identity but is also trusted around the world and that can’t be bought, can’t be subsumed into Meta or whatever, feels really precious. So yeah, if I was doing it again I’d big up the BBC big time.” He laughs. “Everything else I’d do exactly the same.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m proud of the film, but it wouldn’t even get financed today’ … Dev Patel and Freida Pinto in Slumdog Millionaire.Photograph: APIsles of Wonder has safely passed into legend. These days it’s up there with James Bond and the queen. I wonder, though, how history will judgeSlumdog Millionaire, his Oscar-winning 2008 spectacular about a ghetto kid who hits the jackpot. Boyle shot the film in Mumbai, partly in Hindi, and with a local crew. But it was a film of its time and the world has moved on.“Yeah, we wouldn’t be able to make that now,” he says. “And that’s how it should be. It’s time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we’ve left on the world.”Is he saying that the production itself amounted to a form of colonialism? “No, no,” he says. “Well, only in the sense that everything is. At the time it felt radical. We made the decision that only a handful of us would go to Mumbai. We’d work with a big Indian crew and try to make a film within the culture. But you’re still an outsider. It’s still a flawed method. That kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be. I mean, I’m proud of the film, but you wouldn’t even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn’t even get financed. Even if I was involved, I’d be looking for a young Indian film-maker to shoot it.”View image in fullscreenA bumper celebration of British culture … the Windrush scene during the Boyle-directed opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianA waiter sidles in with a second cup of tea. Boyle, though, is still mulling the parlous state of the world. He knows that times are tough and that people are hurting. Nonetheless, he insists that there are reasons to be cheerful.“Have you got any kids?” he asks suddenly. Boyle has three: technically they’re all adults now. “And I think that’s progress. I look at the younger generation and they’re an improvement. They’re an upgrade.”The director was weaned on a diet of new wave music and arthouse cinema, Ziggy Stardust andPlay for Today. He began his career as a chippy outsider and winces at the notion that he’s now an establishment fixture. “It all comes back to punk, really,” he says. “The last time Lou Reed spoke in public, he said: ‘I want to blow it all up,’ because he was still a punk at heart. And if you can embrace that spirit, it keeps you in a fluid, changeable state that’s more important than having some fixed place where you belong. So, I do try to carry those values and keep that kind of faith.” He gulps and backtracks, suddenly embarrassed at his own presumption. “Not that my work is truly revolutionary or radical,” he adds. “I mean, I’m not smashing things to pieces. I value the popular audience. I believe in popular entertainment. I want to push the boat out, but take the popular audience with me.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to push the boat out, but take the popular audience with me’ … directing Alfie Williams and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya MizunoI suggest that this might be a contradiction. “Yeah, of course it is,” Boyle says, snorting. “But I’ve found a way to resolve it – in my own mind, at least.”If 12-year-old Spike played it safe he’d have stayed on Holy Island beside the reassuring flag of St George. Instead, the kid takes a gamble and charts his own course to the mainland. He’s educating himself and embracing a fraught, messy future. He’s mixing with monsters and slowly coming into his strength. That’s what kids tend to do, Boyle explains. That’s why they give us hope. “Maybe hope is a weird thing to ask for in a horror movie,” he says. “But we all need something to cling to, whether that’s in films or in life.”28 Years Later is in UK cinemas now"

From the futuristic reflection of Renegade to the soulful Cold Dreaming to the thought provoking A Drop in the Ocean, and the devastating realisation of loss in Last Year’s Man ... This is a band confronting the past, to channel hope and find redemption by coming through challenges that can only be overcome through genuine friendship.Steven, WolverhamptonBad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosThis is a timely release, coming mere months after the abhorrent anti-Puerto Rican “floating island of garbage” comments by Tony Hinchcliffe at a Trump rally. Bad Bunny’s response at the time was fierce, rebuking all that was Trump, Republican, bigoted, and his first music since feels like a follow-up. In DTMF, Bunny refuses to cede space or stand down. Either from his position as a mainstay of the US mainstream music world or as a proud Puerto Rican. He crafts an album of one summer anthem after another, built to be listened to by everyone while unmistakably a product of the music of his home.Alex, BelfastBon Iver – Sable, FableJustin Vernon is finally happy! And he sounds perhaps more enchanting as a man embracing joy as he did as a lone wanderer in the wintery woodlands of Wisconsin. The album opens on familiar ground with the Sable tracks, and these build beautifully until we reach Fable and Vernon exclaims: “January ain’t the whole world”. From there on the album is a gorgeous celebration of accepting love and happiness through some incredibly vibey and experimental songs in theBon Iversignature. If Only I Could Wait, with Danielle Haim is a standout, alongside Walk Home, and the slow submergence into steady love through the album closers There’s a Rhythm and Au Revoir is simply perfect.Pulkit, ManchesterVukovi – My God Has Got a GunI’m convinced there’s a parallel universe somewhere in which guitar-and-drums-driven rock music still has mass mainstream appeal and Vukovi would deservedly be among the UK’s biggest music stars. On this, their fourth album, the pop-metal leans towards the heavier side, and lyrically perhaps nothing sums up these songs’ exploration of mental health struggles and self-doubt better than opening track This is My Life and My Trauma. But the melodies are strong and front woman Janine Shilstone’s vocals are as fiercely defiant yet beautiful as ever, underpinned perfectly by energetic riffs and tight rhythmical playing from guitarist Hamish Reilly and drummer Martin Sharples-Johnston.John K, BirminghamDavido – 5ive5ive by Davido gives me a new sense of hope and purpose. It helps me get on with my daily activities and to unwind in my free time. As a mum who’s constantly busy caring for a newborn baby, I find listening helps me with my mental health and encourages me to enjoy life and live life to the fullest. The rhetoric in the album is out of this world.Paola Adeitan, Marlborough, WiltshireThe Slow Readers Club – Out of a DreamIt’s such a great commentary on modern times, with real lyrical depth added to a sort of doom-pop atmosphere. I stumbled upon them by chance and saw them at a tiny venue in the Netherlands – they’re as great live as they are on their records. I can’t comprehend how they’re not world famous.Klavdija, Brussels, BelgiumThese New Puritans – Crooked WingView image in fullscreen‘I find it incredibly uplifting’ … These New Puritans: George Barnett, left, and Jack Barnett.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianI hadn’t discovered the band before this album so it was an absolute treat to work through their back catalogue. I love the textures and layers of the music on this album. It’s the perfect soundtrack to my evening walks in my local woods. There is a depth to the music that is spiritual and anything that moves me like this gets my attention. The opening track Waiting has a choral feel. It’s sparse yet such a complete sound with beautiful vocals. It’s not an upbeat album – far from it – but I find it incredibly uplifting. The production throughout is sublime.Ed Olhausen, High WycombeJensen McRae – I Don’t Know How But They Found Me!Absolutely every song on the album is worth a listen and suits an occasion in the day. Praying for Your Downfall and Massachusetts are cathartic for different reasons, while Let Me Be Wrong and I Don’t Do Drugs are cheeky and honest. Overall, the album is so human – it touches many emotional experiences with compassion and clarity, and shows off the very best of musical commitment to songwriting, vocals, composition, guitar and production.Alice, CambridgeSleep Token – Even in ArcadiaA perfect storm of everything Sleep Token does best but distilled and sharpened. It’s not a concept album, but feels like one. The lyrics have never been more deific but Vessel has never sounded more human. An incredible follow-up to a near-perfect album. I’ve never been as obsessed with a band as I am with Sleep Token.Ed, SouthamptonMarina – Princess of PowerAs a young gay man, Marina (FKA Marina and the Diamonds) was the soundtrack to my teenage years. I adored her cult classic Electra Heart album and remember when she was the undisputed queen of Tumblr. She continued putting out great music, including her previous album, the fantastic and pleasingly political Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land. But now, riding a wave of 2010s nostalgia, Marina is back in the charts and at the top of her game. The whole album is delightfully camp and jam packed with Eurodisco-esque gay club bangers. I predict that, just as with Charli, Marina is heading for a comeback.Oliver, ManchesterShura – I Got Too Sad for My FriendsIt’s a gorgeous slice of folk-pop that’s swimming with gentle, lovely tunes. World’s Worst Girlfriend is a great way in; Richardson, which features the warm tones of Cassandra Jenkins, has set up semi-permanent residence in my head.Tom Evershed, Melbourne, AustraliaWilliam Tyler – Time IndefiniteTime Indefinite is a powerful record and seemed to arrive at exactly the right time for me. Tyler finds and collects sounds, ranging from lo-fi and scratchy to pastoral and lush. Individually, they seem dissolute or even anxiety inducing, but by weaving in his own looping guitar it all builds towards something approaching harmony – or beauty. A bridge over troubled waters.Ed Yates, KnaresboroughMorcheeba – Escape the ChaosIt’s a grand return to form with the standout tracks for me the Stone Roses-esque titled Elephant Clouds and the bullet train inspired, anthemic Hold It Down. But the whole LP (I continue to buy black gold from my local store) is a superb sonic renaissance that can match that of their Cool Britannia peers Pulp.

Working with her new band and collaborators, the Attachment Theory, she has finally been fully let loose as a singer and communicator, and the results are staggering, moving, uplifting and devastating by turns. Her shows in the spring brought the new record vividly to life, and breathed new vital life into her existing material. Clearly these are the collaborators that she has always needed, and this record will undoubtedly be reckoned as one of the finest releases this year, as it would be in any year.Luke Dixon, LondonExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBon IverDovesBad BunnyThese New PuritansMarina and the DiamondsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brace yourself for copious talk of ‘body energy systems’Lucy ManganFri 20 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTShareHe’s the same! He’s the same!Noel Edmondsis the same! Even if he wasn’t quite your cup of tea back in the day, I promise you’ll be happy to see him. Fixed points in a universe changing unstoppably for the worse have that effect on you.Edmonds bestrode the world of 80s and 90s light entertainment like a Tiggerish colossus, presenting everything from Top of the Pops to Multi-Coloured Swap Shop to Telly Addicts – oh, how well I remember watching the latter as a woman proposed to her boyfriend and how beautifully Noel covered the deafening silence where the horrified man’s acceptance was supposed to go – to Noel’s House Party (let us hope Mr Blobby is ageing as well as his mentor), and more, including his last big hit Deal Or No Deal. He became a bit of a laughing stock when he tried to share with the world his discovery, via his reflexologist, ofcosmic ordering(an iteration of positive thinking woowoo) but never – I think at this point uniquely among his peers – coming a vilely scandalous cropper at any stage.He was last seen on our screens being voted off 2018’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. After that, he used some of the money restored to him after he won a huge case against bankers who had deliberately bankrupted his company group to buy an 800-acre estate in New Zealand and relocate there with his wife (“my earth angel”) Liz. Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure marks his return to television and chronicles their life running what he hopes will become a popular retreat, complete with vineyard, watering hole the Bugger Inn, spectacularly good views and spectacularly bad puns.View image in fullscreenTranquil rocking … Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure.Photograph: ITV/PA“I am rocking!” he says, and is eager to share with us the secrets of his youthful mien; “tranquil power” workouts in the gym, crystal healing (vibrations at 5-8Hz, obviously, or it doesn’t work), structural water (post-electromagnetised, in case you are not au fait), twice weekly stints in a hyperbaric chamber, and a big statue in the garden that watches over him. “All we are is body energy systems,” he … is “explains” the word? “They touch everything around us. Which is how you move into the bigger matrix, the universal energy system.” You know what? I loved Noel’s House Party. And nothing has ever made me cry happier tears than Noel’s Christmas Presents, perfectly-pitched every year on the side of “warm glow” rather than “mawkish sentiment”. He’s earned this.He remains unassailably himself – emotional, childlike, open (the curiosity/credulousness that lets you embrace cosmic ordering is also what allows you to connect with people and find something interesting about them all), confident and professional. The last isn’t an add-on but a part of what made him great. As he puts it at one point, he worked hard and took it seriously. He has an old-school respect for his audience and isn’t about to let them down. To watch him now is to be reminded how much contempt there is threaded through our entertainment, our culture now and what we have been reconditioned to accept as the norm. He also remains unafraid of the long march towards a terrible joke, as attested by the scene in which he lowers himself into a cold plunge bath. “It should have been three degrees! Because when will I see them – Mr Happy and the twins! – again?”If you were anything other than a wholly committed hater of the man before, you will follow him just as willingly as you did decades ago, this time through bad Kiwi weather instead of ill-fated proposals, money troubles instead of swaps, and chaos caused by tabloids instead of Mr Blobby (though we are promised a visit from the latter).When the estate reopens for the season, a local customer is asked for his opinion on the new landlord. “Seems like a good bugger,” he replies. So he does, so he does.Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure airs on ITV1 on 20 June and ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewNoel EdmondsTelevisionEntertainment TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Britain’s biggest alfresco bash is about to kick off again.Glastonbury 2025is set to be an extra-special one. There will be no 2026 event as the festival takes a fallow year. This year’s Glasto-goers could go large to compensate.As always, the BBC will provide wall-to-wall coverage of all the action. So fear not if you failed to secure a ticket, which sold out in a mere 35 minutes. Watching along at home will be almost as much fun and a lot less sweaty. From lineup highlights to secret sets, controversies to crowd-spotting, here’s your ultimate viewing guide.The headlinersView image in fullscreenThe oldies … Rod Stewart all set to rock the stage.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Penske Media/Getty ImagesIt’s a year of first timers …It’s a right old ragbag at the summit of the bill. Most rumoured names (Oasis! Springsteen! Rihanna! Stevie Wonder!) failed to materialise. Instead, two of the Pyramid stage’s three top spots go to first-time headliners. Friday is the biggest night of their careers for the 1975, fronted by Matty “son of Denise Welch” Healy. No pressure, lads. On Sunday, it’s the turn of US pop-punk princessOlivia Rodrigowho, as far as we know, isn’t related to any Loose Women.… but there are still plenty of golden oldiesSandwiched in between on Saturday is grizzled guitar goblin Neil Young and his band the Chrome Hearts. The coveted Sunday teatime “legends slot” will be occupied byRod Stewart, joined by former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. Sir Rod the Mod might be 80 with health worries but insists he’s “more than able to pleasure and titillate”. Do ya think he’s sexy? Actually, don’t answer that.On the Other stage, the headliners are homegrown hip-hopper Loyle Carner, pop polymath Charli xcx (dress code: lime green) and dance veterans the Prodigy – their first Glastonbury appearance since the death of frontman Keith Flint, shortly before the 2019 festival. Expect emotional tributes to the twisted firestarter.Acts to watchView image in fullscreenFlorida firecracker … Doechii.Photograph: Nathan Posner/ShutterstockThe festival’s worst clash?Fresh from winning best rap album at this year’s Grammys,Florida firecracker Doechiiheadlines the West Holts stage on Saturday night and will be much talked-about.

Is it too hot for skinny jeans?Surprise secret setsView image in fullscreenIs it Patchwork … or is it Pulp?Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesThere’s always frenzied speculation about A-list acts playing secret sets. This year’s rumour mill has been busier than usual. Slated for a plum Pyramid stage spot at 6.15pm on Saturday is a mystery act called Patchwork. There are also tempting “TBA” slots on the Woodsies and Park stages.Chappell Roan, Lady Gaga and Sabrina Carpenter have been optimistically mentioned. More realistically, Haim, Lorde, Green Day, Kings of Leon and Pulp are widely predicted. The other Britpop band on the comeback trail, of course, are Oasis. Their reunion tour kicks off in Cardiff a week after the festival. Could the Gallaghers be plotting a stealth warmup gig at Worthy Farm? Cider-fuelled sibling fisticuffs – let’s have it.The controversiesView image in fullscreenPeace not war … Kneecap’s Liam O’Hanna AKA Mo Chara, JJ O’Dochartaigh AKA DJ Provai and Naoise O Caireallain AKA Moglai Bap outside Westminster Magistrates Court earlier this month.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty ImagesThe press will be primed and ready at 4pm on Saturday when Irish republican rappers Kneecap take to the West Holts stage. There were calls for the Belfast trio to be axed from the lineup after footage emerged of them allegedly telling fans to “kill your local MP”. The band were investigated by police and member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh wascharged witha terrorism offence. Expect them to respond “robustly” during their set.Later on Saturday night comes Neil Young, who caused a kerfuffle in January when he accidentally announced his headline slot – by cancelling it. Young declared that he was dropping out due to the BBC’s “corporate control”. Two days later, he backtracked, blaming “an error in the information received”. I wonder if corporation executives will cut short his coverage in retaliation?How to tune inAs is traditional, Glastonbury’s official broadcast partner will infuriate BBC bashers with copious coverage. With live streams of the five biggest stages, there will be more than 90 hours of performances on iPlayer’s dedicated Glastonbury channel.On broadcast TV, there’s extensive programming across BBC One, Two and Four. A tag team of Clara Amfo, Lauren Laverne, Jack Saunders, Huw Stephens, Jamz Supernova and Jo Whiley will guide viewers through the standout sets, while introducing intimate performances at their vantage point overlooking the Park stage.Audio-wise, 6Music’s schedule is devoted to All Day Glastonbury for six days (see what they did there?). Radios 1, 1Xtra, 2 and 4 will also broadcast live from Worthy Farm. There are three visualised episodes of Sidetracked, the hit music podcast hosted by Annie Macmanus and Nick Grimshaw. Other BBC “brands” doing special editions on-site include The One Show, Woman’s Hour and CBeebies Bedtime Stories.

He was to become  his cherished friend, inspirational collaborator and valued mentor for many decades. Simon Rattle remembers the great pianist’s wit, wisdom – and a particular pair of scissorsSimon RattleFri 20 Jun 2025 11.51 EDTShareIt’s hard even to know where to start with Alfred: for any musician of my generation he was simply always there, the very definition of integrity and a kind of unique probing humour.I heard him first in Liverpool, playing Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 22, K482, an unforgettable concert for an impressionable 14-year-old. I could never have imagined then that my first collaboration with him would be in the same city when I was 20. That Beethoven – his first piano concerto – began a long journey of learning and friendship over the subsequent decades. I cannot stress how much I learned from him, or how painfully obvious it was to me just how steep the climb was to be able to come anywhere near to being an adequate partner for him. I remember clearly the sense of being kindly but firmly stretched to beyond my level of musicianship. Immense freedom within a strict framework. I am profoundly grateful that he was willing to carry on pulling me upwards for nearly 40 years!I visited him often in his Hampstead home. I met his friend Isaiah Berlin there, terrifying enough on its own, and he said to me, “you know, I don’t think Alfred has ever had an unoriginal thought”. An astonishing but probably accurate observation from an intelligence that could recognise its equal.But often it was just the two of us, listening and discussing. He was happy to listen to interpretations I brought, as he was with surely countless other musicians, and my scores are full of his insights and recommendations. In the middle of one of my evidently lugubrious accounts of theEroica symphony’s funeral march, I noted his devastatingly honest comment “Simon, have you never considered that there might be such a thing as active grief?”But often it was his wisdom about how to turn harmonic corners more eloquently. Difficult to achieve but vital for the music. Plus generous, challenging encouragement.Contemporary art, one of his quiet passions, politics, literature were also there in the mix. But it is his humour, an almost surreal amusement at the world around him, that remains the strongest memory, and the reason it is impossible to recall him without smiling, even in this time of sadness.The Alfred who, as a young man performing in Vienna, brought a tortoise on stage with him to walk around the concert hall floor, “just because I like funny things.”This friendly devil would sometimes make an appearance.He loathed piped music: I remember him in one Birmingham restaurant spying a thin wire leading to what seemed to be an unstoppable sound system.“I have just the thing” he said, producing a small pair of scissors from his jacket pocket. Seeing our astonishment as he quickly snipped through the wire, he said. “Don’t worry, they won’t even notice until tomorrow and it may be weeks before they discover the wire!”As ever, unique and unexpected. And even the occasional sharp edges deeply lovable. What a privilege to have had him in our lives.Explore more on these topicsAlfred BrendelClassical musicSimon RattlefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then his book Don’t Call Me Urban captured the energy of the grittier first wave – and an expanded edition is finally hereDan HancoxFri 20 Jun 2025 10.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 10.38 EDTShareIt’s an overcast Thursday morning, and photographer Simon Wheatley is doing a soft-shoe shuffle through Roman Road in Bow, eastLondon, as a market stall blares out exquisite 70s funk. “That’s more like it,” he says, with a grin on his face. “A bit of energy.” This was once grime’s artery, its chaotic central hub, even its muse – a street Wiley once told me was “the nurturer” of local talents like him and Dizzee Rascal. And it was here, in the 2000s, that Wheatley would create a vivid and intimate document of grime in its frenzied flush of youth, and of working-class neighbourhoods like this before they became considerably more sedate. Fourteen years after the release of Don’t Call Me Urban, Wheatley’s long-sold-out photo-book from that era – once described by Vice as “grime’s Old Testament” – it is finally getting a rerelease, at almost double its original size.I have arranged to meet Wheatley outside the bougie Roman Road coffee shop that was once legendary grime record shop Rhythm Division. This leads to some confusion – there are simply too many bougie coffee shops in succession. “Back in the day it was absolutely thronging with people,” Wheatley recalls. “You’d turn a corner and down a sidestreet there’d be six guys doing an impromptu cipher [a freestyle MC-ing performance] – everywhere there were youths hanging out, wheeling around on their bikes, spitting over some tinny beat playing off a Nokia. This was the heartbeat of grime.”Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclassWheatley became grime’s documentarian simply by walking out of his front door in Limehouse when he was “just a broke photographer” in his 20s, and daring to take an interest in his young neighbours. He did so at a time when the media and MPs were condemning the same kids as delinquent “hoodies” or “chavs” – as if they were somehow morally culpable for the social problems they were enduring. Photographing rising underground artists for Black music magazine RWD gave Wheatley his “hood pass”, with now-famous images such as Roll Deep’s “ice-cream van” shoot, Skepta in a chip shop, Crazy Titch and his terrifying dog, Dizzee in the studio, Kano dressed as Scarface, or Tinchy Stryder and his crew Ruff Sqwad when they were still in school.View image in fullscreenOne of Wheatley’s famous images … Roll Deep, east London, 2005.Photograph: Simon WheatleyThose shoots opened the door – although some suspected he was an undercover cop when he first showed up. “I remember [Roll Deep’s] DJ Target invited me to the When I’m ‘Ere video shoot, and I saw this gaggle of youngsters hanging about, looking at me suspiciously. I realised that there was a whole world to uncover, with their lives.”Over time, he won the trust of his subjects. It helped, he thinks, that he is a “a bit of an odd case, a bit of a weirdo” – an outsider among outsiders. Wheatley insinuated himself into the pirate radio studios and youth clubs that provided the DIY launchpads for so much talent. He shot not just microphone clashes and radio sessions but fights, drug deals, hectic street-corner tableaux and intimate domestic moments; teenagers watching TV, daydreaming, having breakfast, rolling spliffs, writing out lyrics longhand, doing each other’s hair.“For me, the texture of grime is there in the real world,” Wheatley says. “It’s there on the estate, or in the radio stations at 2 o’clock in the morning, where some deeply underground crew would have a slot – the bin bag in the corner overflowing with fast food boxes and drink cans, Rizla packets and rave flyers scattered everywhere.” Don’t Call Me Urban is a social document of youthful energy, boredom, angst and joy, as much as it captures a generation of musicians on their way to fame and fortune.View image in fullscreen‘For me, the texture of grime is there in the real world.’Photograph: Simon Wheatley“I always felt that grime was a reflection of that post-Thatcherite social breakdown,” Wheatley continues. “It was that very coarse expression of a kind of individualism.” The paradox is that it was also “very much about the community”, about mates looking out for each other when nobody else would. He is defensive of the bright, creative young people who went on to change the face of UK music, some of whom have become his close friends; I have been with Wheatley while he buys nourishing groceries for a hungoverHak Baker, the charismatic singer-songwriter Wheatley was shooting in 2006, when he was a 14-year-old MC called Swift Leng.It was this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me“Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclass,” Wheatley says. “Grime now is just regarded as a musical genre, rather than a sociological phenomenon. But it was both of those things: an incredible sound, but also this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me, and that’s what I really went hard after, chasing.”At times, this chase would lead him into sketchy situations, with people pulling out long blades at pirate stations (also caught on camera), and the police rarely far away. One night, he found himself in the middle of an empty field by the Docklands Light Railway, shooting a pre-arranged fight – football hooligan style – between boys from the E3 and E14 postcodes. Some of them weren’t wildly impressed when his flash went off.View image in fullscreenTinchy Stryder & Ruff Sqwad, 2005.Photograph: Simon Wheatley“That was very early on in my grime experience. Naivete has always been my greatest shield,” he laughs. “I didn’t really know what I was doing half the time, or where I was going. Crazy Titch said recently: ‘Simon was so brave.’ I wasn’t brave; I just didn’t know!” Wheatley’s mentor was Philip Jones Griffiths, the late war photojournalist, and as a photojournalist himself, Wheatley has taken deliberate risks – going through military roadblocks in Chiapas, Mexico, disguised as a peasant while on the trail of the Zapatistas in the late 1990s, or plunging into the Paris banlieues during the 2005 riots.He is a physically dynamic photographer, well-suited to capturing the restless, fidgety energy of teenagers. “I was a sports fanatic as a teenager,” he says, demonstrating some capoeira moves, “and photography replaced sport for me as a passion. I can’t really teach photography, but I can teach martial arts: I teach a combination of capoeira Angola mixed with yogic breathing and tai chi. I also fast before I shoot, just for a few hours, so my senses are sharper.”View image in fullscreenDizzee Rascal in the studio.Photograph: Simon WheatleyFirst published in 2011, Don’t Call Me Urban was quickly out of print and in demand, its price soaring on resale sites as the genre exploded into the mainstream. “It became almost like a relic that was appreciated by the connoisseurs of the culture, and it became this cult book,” he says – both as a rare visual document of Black British music heritage, and a source of creative inspiration. One of those connoisseur-fans is Clint Ogbenna (known as Clint 419), founder of streetwear clothes brand Corteiz, who turned one of Wheatley’s famous shots of Crazy Titch into a jacket, and gave Wheatley the push and financial support to finally rerelease the book.As well as providing a unique document of grime in its heyday, Wheatley’s work is a valuable visual record of every day life in east London, before the 2012 Olympics arrived and changed it beyond recognition. He is keen to avoid fetishising the pre-gentrification city: “Who’s to say all those changes are bad?” he asks. “I’m sure some people are happy their flats have been refurbished. But artistically, texturally, there was something very gripping about a run-down block in a state of disrepair – it almost felt as if it was abandoned to the youth, to make their playground of hope, frustration and despair. There was much more atmosphere – nowadays everything is a bit cleaner.”The expanded edition of Don’t Call Me Urban!

At home in North Carolina, their leader explains why she likes things ‘a little bit scary’ – and what’s next after her split from bandmate MJ LendermanFri 20 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 20 Jun 2025 06.02 EDTShareTo step into Karly Hartzman’s home is to see the contents of her brain shaken out. There is a fireplace mantel covered in dolls and figurines; a wooden rack filled with cassette tapes; an old doll’s house filled to the brim with fabric scraps; a few overflowing bookshelves. As the 28-year-old leader of the indie-rock band Wednesday greets me at the door, she realises a few new additions have just landed through the letterbox, some books about the history of hardcore and punk: she has been listening to both a lot and is eager to educate herself.Hartzman is a collector by nature, a habit that is also at the heart of her songwriting. Equally inspired by the southern rockers Drive-By Truckers and the shoegaze greats Swirlies, Wednesday’s sound combines heartfelt twang with walls of pummelling sound. Hartzman’s lyrics are highly narrative, inflected with striking, gnarly details. Listen to the band’s breakthrough album,2023’s Rat Saw God, and you will hear about urine-coloured soda, roadside sex shops, accidental arson and teens getting high on Benadryl.The band’s forthcoming sixth album, Bleeds, refines their sound, never letting the raw noise overshadow Hartzman’s knack for melody and unique stories. “This is what we’ve been working towards this whole time,” she says. She calls the band’s singular sound an “unavoidable” result of the members’ individual tastes. By now, she says: “We know what a Wednesday record sounds like, and then we make it.”Although Pitchfork declared Wednesday “one of the best indie-rock bands around”, Hartzman keeps a low profile in her home town, the small North Carolina city of Greensboro. She recently moved back from nearby Asheville, where she lived on a bucolic property known as Haw Creek that was home to various local musicians. In person, Hartzman is thoughtful, expressive and more reserved than you might expect from her riotous performances.As we drive around Greensboro, she points out her teenage haunts, such as the cafe she used to frequent when she skipped school. As a kid, she resented being told what to do, but never let that get in the way of an education. “I was very methodical,” she says about cutting class. “I was writing and reading and doing work – I was doing my own school, on my terms.”She credits her taste in music to a few crucial sources: her parents, who played Counting Crows and the singer-songwriter Edwin McCain around the house; her older sister, who got her into Warped tour punk (Paramore were an early favourite); and a longtime friend who introduced her to shoegaze and post-hardcore bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Unwound.View image in fullscreenKarly Hartzman at Green Man festival, Wales, in 2024.Photograph: Rob Watkins/AlamyWhen she started college, Hartzman admired her friends who played in bands, but she wasn’t interested in taking music lessons. Then she saw the band Palberta – a playful indie-rock trio whose members traded instruments every few songs – and felt inspired by the messy, uncomplicated style of playing the three women shared. “They were doing something that sounded awesome and very easy,” she says. “After that show, I bought my friend’s guitar off him.”Hartzman’s earliest recordings were solo; she got a formal band together only when her sister asked her to perform at her birthday party. From there, Wednesday rotated through a few members before settling into a stable lineup: Xandy Chelmis on steel guitar, Ethan Baechtold on bass and piano, Alan Miller on drums and MJ Lenderman on guitar. They started playing house shows and tiny spots with friends’ bands and folks they met in local DIY scenes.Wednesday’s shows could be raucous, rowdy affairs, but their home lives centred around the quietude of Haw Creek, surrounded by streams and open fields – the kind of place where they could go fishing in the morning, then practice in the living room later on. “We lived on acres of land,” she says. “Nothing will ever beat that.”When you’re 28 in a relationship, you have to be like: does this person have the same intentions in life?Hartzman lived at Haw Creek with Lenderman who, alongside his work in Wednesday, found meteoric success last year for his fourth solo album,Manning Fireworks. He and Hartzman started dating before Lenderman joined Wednesday – Hartzman was a fan of his music, playing it over the speakers at the coffee shop where she worked before they met.After six years together, they broke up amicably in 2024. Hartzman chalks it up to the usual big-picture differences that emerge in adulthood. In your early 20s, she says: “You’re just like: ‘Oh, I like this person, I’ll date them.’ But then, when you’re 28, you have to be like: ‘Does this person have the same intentions in life?’” Hartzman was interested in marriage and kids; Lenderman was not quite on the same page, she says. But, from the beginning, “I’ve known, even if we’re not romantic for ever, we’re creative collaborators for ever”. Lenderman will be on future records; while he won’t perform on their next tour, Hartzman insists it’s nothing personal; between Wednesday and his solo career, his touring schedule has been relentless and “he needs a break”.The songs on Bleeds were written before the breakup, although some of them hint at the deteriorating relationship. The Way Love Goes started as an apology for not being fully present. “When I wrote it, I was like: ‘But I’m gonna fight for this,’” she says. “Of course, by the time we recorded it, that was not the situation.” Wasp, meanwhile, describes the bitter self-recrimination she felt towards the relationship’s end. “My body just kind of gave up on me,” she says. “I was really dissociated because I didn’t want to break up, but I was having to accept that we needed to.”View image in fullscreen‘One of the best indie-rock bands around’ … Wednesday.Photograph: Graham TolbertBleeds is haunted by images of loss and violence: a washed-up body, a livestreamed funeral, a car crash, a knife fight. Hartzman doesn’t see it necessarily as a dark record; she sees it as chasing good stories and telling the truth. “Death is around at every point,” she says. “If you don’t acknowledge that, you’re lying.” She is drawn to mixing the cartoonish and the creepy: “I think that’s just a southern gothic attitude,” she says, describing her taste as “a little bit scary, but there’s a heart of gold underneath”.Much of Hartzman’s songwriting draws on her memories of youthful debauchery, like sneaking out late then teaching Sunday school. She is also a keen collector of stories, keeping an eye out for strange characters and unbelievable happenings. “If someone has a story where they’re, like: ‘Oh my God, this was so embarrassing,’ or: ‘This is kind of a secret,’” her ears prick up. (She always asks for permission and changes names and identifying details to protect the innocent.) From Bleeds, the drowning victim on Wound Up Here (By Holdin’ On) comes from a friend’s story from his days as a rafting guide in West Virginia; Carolina Murder Suicide was inspired by a true-crime podcast. But Hartzman’s songs still feel intimate, told in first person through a singular lens, treating their subjects with compassion.Rat Saw God took the band to new heights, landing on many publications’ year-end lists. But as she looks towards the release of Bleeds, Hartzman is committed to keeping her personal life steady. It helps that while “the shows have changed a lot” – getting bigger and bigger – “my life at home has been so consistent”. This year, she ditched her smartphone, got off social media and built herself a charmingly retro, Y2K-style personal website. The apps were zapping her focus; then, a profile of Lenderman was published with details of their breakup. “People were putting their own two cents on that shit,” she says with an eye roll. “I was like: oh, it would feel so good to get off that.” She has changed how she listens to music, too, jettisoning the algorithm to favour recommendations from friends and blogs. “It’s been so rewarding.”View image in fullscreenKarly Hartzman in Greensboro, North Carolina, the town she grew up in, left and returned to.Photograph: Chris Carlson/APOn her site, she shares monthly journal entries and roundups of the music and media she is enjoying. She answers reader-submitted questions about everything from learning guitar to her relationship with religion.She also has a PO box where listeners can send letters; she replies to as many as she can. It’s important for her to be in touch with the people who love her music, she says, and she wants to give them something special. But this method represents, for her, a “closeness on my own terms” – a way of preventing the always-on burnout faced by many musicians on the rise. Her ability to tune out industry pressure surprises even those closest to her. Lenderman “is always wondering: ‘How do you not feel that kind of pressure of expectation?’” she says. “But my need to write is so important to me, more than any reception.”Pixar, Catholic shame, and urine-drinking podcast bros: the mixed-up rock of MJ LendermanRead moreAs well as making her own merch from customised thrift store T-shirts, in her precious downtime, Hartzman has been writing and spending time with local friends – they are fond of a laundromat-cum-bar called Suds & Duds. She has never lived outside North Carolina – and doesn’t plan to. “I love it,” she says. “It feels like home to me. And that feeling is addicting.” Folks here know her face because they watched her grow up, or grew up alongside her, not because her band recently played The Late Show (although she did get recognised recently by a Wednesday listener at her grandmother’s retirement home).Most of what happens in her songs “could happen anywhere”, she says. “I’m not trying to say, necessarily, that I had a different upbringing or lifestyle than most teenagers.” But she is telling her story truthfully – “and, in reality, it happened here”.Hartzman understands why other artists might move to a major city to find artistic success, but she is glad to be rooted in such a distinctive place. “I don’t like the feeling of: ‘I’m in the cultural centre of the universe and what I do here will pervade the rest of culture,’” she says with a shrug. “I like the idea of coming in from the edge.”Bleeds is released via Dead Oceans on 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsIndiePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said it was now transferring ownership of the project to the independent production company that produced it.Anger and frustration had been building for months over the status of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, with some involved in the film believing it was originally due to be broadcast at the start of the year. There have been concerns that some of those featured in the programmecould withdraw their supportover the delays.The BBC formally paused its broadcast after an investigation was launched into the making of another documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone. That programme waspulled from iPlayer earlier this year afterit emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The review into its production continues.However, the BBC said that after attempting to find other ways of using parts of the medics programme, produced by the independent Basement Films, it had concluded there were impartiality concerns and it would no longer be shown by the broadcaster.Susan Sarandon among hundreds to urge BBC to release delayed Gaza filmRead more“We wanted the doctors’ voices to be heard,” the BBC said in a statement. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review was published. For some weeks, the BBC has been working with Basement Films to find a way to tell the stories of these doctors on our platforms.”It added: “Yesterday it became apparent that we have reached the end of the road with these discussions. We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC. Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world’s most trusted broadcaster.”It also challenged claims the film had ever undergone the BBC’s final pre-broadcast signoff processes. “Any film broadcast will not be a BBC film,” it said.The decision comes after the founder of Basement Films, Ben de Pear, took aim at the BBC during a documentary festival this week, saying BBC journalists were being “stymied and silenced”. He directly criticised the BBC director general, Tim Davie, whom he described as “a PR person”.“All the decisions about our film were not taken by journalists; they were taken by Tim Davie,” he said. “Tim Davie is taking editorial decisions which, frankly, he is not capable of making.“The BBC’s primary purpose is TV news and current affairs, and if it’s failing on that, it doesn’t matter what drama it makes or sports it covers. It is failing as an institution. And if it’s failing on that, then it needs new management.”The decision also follows an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme by one of the journalists involved in the documentary, Ramita Navai, in which she described Israel as “a rogue state that’s committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, and mass-murdering Palestinians”.Challenged about her statement by the presenter Amol Rajan, who said that it was her opinion, she said it “isn’t my opinion” and that she had collected evidence during her work on the documentary.The BBC said it had produced “powerful coverage” of the Gaza war, including documentaries. “We have also investigated allegations of abuse of Palestinian prisoners and Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s hospitals,” it said. “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Will the most-hyped reunion in British rock history actually come off? And will fans be able to bag themselves an officialOasistea towel?The answer to that final question, at least, has arrived. The first Oasis merchandise store will open inManchesteron Friday, two weeks before the band perform their first gig in 16 years at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.Selling everything from £40 bucket hats to baby grows, cutlery sets, shot glasses, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags, the shop in Spinningfields will be one of six across the UK and Ireland this summer, with the others in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin.Fans will be able to recreate the front covers of the band’s debut album,Definitely Maybe, and bestselling follow-up, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, on green screens in the store. Those hoping to buy a signature Liam Gallagher parka will be left empty-handed, however.The official merch stores will add to the considerable payday for Oasis before the most highly anticipated – and profitable – series of shows in British music history. The shops, which will sell limited-edition vinyl records, also represent the changing nature of music fandom, said Dr Matt Grimes, of Birmingham City University. “It’s almost like the experience of the event itself is just not enough. So how do you create other experiences for people?” he said.Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from £40m to £400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets – with some sold by Ticketmaster foras much as £337.50– fans are expected tosplash out £1bnon everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.View image in fullscreenStart buying your heart out … fans can pick up everything from limited-edition vinyl to baby grows, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags at the Manchester store.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBirmingham City University estimated last year that the brotherscould earn £50m eachfrom the initial 14 UK shows – but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. “The question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?” said Grimes, the university’s course director for music business.He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis’s reported £20m merchandise deal are top secret.Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (£85), bucket hats (£40), jackets (£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: “The band with the 3 stripes”.The Gallaghers aren’t the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for “Oasis fashion UK” have surged 180% in the last 30 days.By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

While it is impossible to say for sure what the challenger’s motives are in this case, the James Bond trademark portfolio and its legacy value does make it an enticing target for opportunists, and further cancellation attempts can’t be ruled out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spinoffs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould steer the next Bond film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named.Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.Heyman is best known as the producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production onthe HBO TV series adaptation of the stories.

In 2024,it was reportedthat residents of Notting Hill receivedmore in capital gainsfrom 2015 to 2019 than the combined populations of Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.View image in fullscreenDrafts of unpublished and unrealised scripts called Pirate, Preacher, Killer about Notting Hill carnival and the life of Boysie Singh.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe son of a south Asian man and a creole woman, Matura left Trinidad for the UK in the 1960s. He worked as a hospital porter, frequented the Royal Court and ended up appearing in a B-movie western shot in Rome.It was in Italy where he saw a production of Langston Hughes’ Shakespeare in Harlem and thought he “could do better than that”, and began writing.Like other Caribbean playwrights, Matura had a side job while getting his footing, working in a garment factory off Tottenham Court Road. He would jot down ideas and doodles on the back of order sheets, some of which have been retained in the archive.Matura’s wife, Ingrid Selberg, said: “He was supposed to be counting the rolls of material, and he was always skiving off and writing things on the back of the order forms.”Described by one writer as looking like “a refugee from a 60s band” who wore sunglasses indoors and sported a “morose walrus moustache”, Matura fit into thecountercultural world of Ladbroke Grove.He was a key part of a flamboyant group of Caribbean creatives who injected black consciousness into UK culture, along with Horace Ové (who directed the first Black British feature film, Pressure) and Michael Abbensetts (who went on to create Empire Road).Helen Melody, the lead curator of contemporary literary and creative archives at the British Library, said: “I think he was aware of the political uncertainty and uprisings of the whole movement in the 1960s, which wasn’t just in Trinidad but more widely.“You can see his plays often chart the experience of people who’d traveled to the UK or elsewhere from the Caribbean, but he also still retained kind of an interest in what was happening in the place he left as well.”View image in fullscreenHelen Melody with items from the archive of Mustapha Matura at the British Library.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe archive contains unpublished work including two plays, one called Band of Heroes about Notting Hill carnival and the other about the real-life Trinidadian gangster Boysie Singh.Despite having no formal training, Matura became arguably the most significant playwright from the Caribbean diaspora in the 20th century.He was a founding member of the Black Theatre Co-operative, which was formed by a group of actors who had appeared in his 1979 play Welcome Home Jacko, while his first agent was the formidablePeggy Ramsay.Maturadied in 2019and a funeral was held in Ladbroke Grove, with a steel band sendoff.“He was such a Trinidadian,” said Selberg. “But he loved Ladbroke Grove, he loved Portobello Road. He was a kind of Janus with a two-sided head. Interested, equally interested in both Britain and Trinidad, and equally critical of both.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBritish LibraryLondonEnglandTrinidad and TobagonewsShareReuse this content"

He is risen indeed. Six years after he huffed off to New Zealand in a hail of tuts, tsks and never-liked-you-anyways,Noel Edmondshas returned to our screens with a message for humanity. “We’re not trees,” he proclaims. “We can move.” Noel Edmonds – and there can be no doubt that this is very much Noel Edmonds – is referring to his decision to leave the UK with his wife (Liz, 55) in order to establish an 800-acre hospitality business in the sobbingly beautiful South Island idyll of Ngatimoti. He doesn’t like Britain any more, he says. It has “changed”.But Noel – as his new programme, Kiwi Adventure, makes blisteringly clear – has not changed. He looks like a child’s sand drawing of Aslan. He believes in “the universal energy system”, wears combatively tight linen T-shirts and has baths so cold he fears openly for the future of his scrotum. He is a deeply odd man.And yet.From the depths of the oddness re-emerges an imperishable truth: Noel Edmonds, for better or worse, is clinically incapable of making uninteresting TV.Here, then, are seven of the most notable emissions from the man’s party cannon.Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976-82)View image in fullscreenDream team … Swap Shop presenters Keith Chegwin, Maggie Philbin, John Craven and Noel Edmonds.Photograph: RGR Collection/Alamy“Swap Shopppp,” bugled the theme tune, heralding the all-too-brief golden age of Saturday morning TV, an inflatable neon wonderland in which a jubilantly youthful Noel Edmonds could ask Kate Bush how she got her hair to go like that.Telly Addicts (1985-98)Ferociously watchable studio quiz in which square-eyed families went cardigan-to-cardigan over questions about Blue Peter and Keith Chegwin. The winner? Knitwear. The runner-up? Telly. Noel’s stewardship – aggressively serviceable action-slacks, smirk like the judgment of Zeus – would lend much-needed tension to the soft furnishings, thus plunging the McPerms of Perth and the Vauxhall-Cavaliers of Nantwich into a perpetual Scooby Doo-based deathmatch. Bring it back!Noel’s House Party (1991-99)View image in fullscreenMr Blobby: partner in crime for the House Party.Photograph: Geoff Wilkinson/Rex FeaturesWelcome ye to “Crinkley Bottom,” an illusory fiefdom in which unsuspecting celebrity visitors (Dave Lee Travis, Edwina Currie etc) were greeted with mockery, gunge and often startlingly physical “gotchas”. Pivotal to the chaos were Noel (presentational style: giggling necromancer) and bubonic familiar Mr Blobby, whose monosyllabic distress and sudden bouts of confused violence would attract audiences of 15 million. The House Party manifesto was as simple as the era in which it was conceived: hysterical conviviality for all, unless you’re Dave Lee Travis, in which case we’ll break your legs.View image in fullscreenSpecial delivery … Noel’s Christmas Presents.Photograph: Sven Arnstein/Sky TVNoel’s Christmas Presents (1989-99;2007-11)Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël / Born is the King of Bra-aa-aaacknell. And Hove. And Ipswich, Canada, Finland and Crewe. The premise whispered of doom and seasonal biliousness but in reality the annual sight of Edmonds guffawing around the world to deliver festive reunions and white goods to the sickly and deserving was … not great, precisely, but also, crucially,not cack. The reason? Our host’s unique ability to sidestep mawkishness while dressed as, variously, Santa, a Victorian dignitary and a garden gnome. He’s called Noel for a reason, you know.Deal or No Deal? (2005-16)The concept? Simple. The Noel? Guarded; tightly bearded; visibly uncomfortable around pensioners. The subsequent, sweltering tension – will Doris from Thanet attempt to engage him in a conversation about her dead husband for longer than her allotted 30 seconds? – would turn a daytime gameshow about cardboard boxes into a potentially lethal game of chance.View image in fullscreenBoxing clever … Deal or No Deal? attracted audiences of around 5 million at its peak.Photograph: Channel 4Noel’s HQ (2008-09)Emboldened by the success of Deal or No Deal?, Edmonds’ (brief) return to Saturday night TV found our subject very much in “Noel’s narked off” mode, sprinting through the obligatory “members of the public rewarded for charitable deeds” bits in order to address the vexed issue of “Broken Britain”. And lo, Noel didst upbraid bungling councils, bellow about bylaws and deliver sudden, snarling exhortations toknow thy consumer rightslest the heavens split asunder and ye be cast into the eternal fire of implied warranty (Hotpoint 3:11-13). The subtext? I (Noel Edmonds) am angry, thus you (the viewer/Broken Britain/God) must pay. It was, in a very real sense, Brexit’s patient zero.Noel Edmonds’Kiwi Adventure (2025)View image in fullscreenEdmonds as Edmonds … with wife Liz on Kiwi Adventure.Photograph: ITV“I am rocking,” intones Noel, emerging from his hyperbaric chamber like a blow-dried Christ. “I. AM. ROCKING.” Broadcast this sort of stuff from a regional news studio and viewers would be lunging for the nearest mallet. But here, buttressed by a gasp-inducing mountain range and a preternaturally tolerant wife, Edmonds takes on an air of … vulnerability?Likability?Besides, the man’s 76. If he wants to say “I am Jesus” while wearing utility shorts in an outdoor shower, who are we to object? After six decades of televisual brilliance, awfulness, jumpers, Alan Partridge-esque hubris and comb-through hair colour, Noel Edmonds, perhaps more than anyone, has earned the right to be Noel Edmonds.

On the face of it, this series simply documents his attempts to open a bar-restaurant in New Zealand with his wife, Liz. But the fun is in the journey not the arrival. Edmonds is obsessed with new-age woo, spending time on his “crystal bed” and practising a workout regime he calls “tranquil power”. He’s also startlingly excited about his nail gun, calling it “a sex toy”, and regards Liz as “an earth angel” believing she was “a gift from the cosmos”.

So a sequel is clearly a free hit for him, which explains why he’s gone Broadway or bust with a full-blown musical. It helps that Lady Gaga is on board, carrying the vocal weight as Lee Quinzel, who falls for Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck while both are incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital. Their amour fou is realised in a series of fantastical numbers that are very entertaining, though the mental illness storyline is less effective.Simon WardellThe Entity (Sidney J Furie,1982),12.45am, Film4At first glance, Sidney J Furie’s 1982 film is just an exploitation flick riding on the coattails of The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror.

I must have been six or seven when I managed to read The Mountain of Adventure by Enid Blyton. I know she is no longer in fashion but I still remember the thrill of the world she created and the excitement of the plot.My favourite book growing upI adored the Flambards series by KMPeyton, probably because it felt slightly adult and a little bit sexy, but my absolute favourites were Grimble and Grimble at Christmas by Clement Freud. They were anarchic and knowing, in a way I hadn’t encountered before but more than anything else they were very funny. It also introduced me to the inspired illustrations of Quentin Blake.The book that changed me as a teenagerWhen I was around 15 or 16 we had a supply teacher and he brought with him plastic bags of novels and just threw them out to us sitting at our desks. I randomly caught The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath which really did change how I felt about books. It was funny, sophisticated and raw in a way I didn’t know novels could be. But more than that, as people say now, I felt seen. Esther Greenwood contained so many emotions and qualities that I recognised. I’m also happy to say that the supply teacher Niall is a good friend to this day!The writer who changed my mindWhen I was about 19 I remember reading the very start of Daniel Martin by John Fowles. He describes a German plane crashing into the British country side and it was so perfectly written that I resolved to never write books. What was the point? They would never be as good as these few pages. I took me more than 30 years to get over that feeling.The book that made me want to be a writerPrior to my John Fowles experience I had wanted to write and was scribbling down short stories, but I have no recollection of a moment or novelist that lit the spark. I think it was more the joy I found in telling tales and setting the scene. Everything I was reading just taught me that there was a way to do that and a world I could be a part of.The book or author I came back toI think I was exposed to Charles Dickens too early and found him very dark and dense. It was only many years later, when I had to read Oliver Twist for work, that I realised how incredibly engaging and entertaining his books are. There is a passage towards the end of A Tale of Two Cities where Carton roams the streets of Paris contemplating his death, which is as beautiful and profound as anything I’ve ever read.The book I rereadI very rarely reread anything but if I do it is probably during the summer in Ireland and it would tend to be a classic, like Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park or Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. There is such pleasure in finding out how much you’ve changed as different characters and plot points speak to you differently. Interesting how much we all bring a point of view to every novel we read.The book I could never read againI can’t imagine I will ever go back to the Just William series by Richmal Crompton. I loved them as a preteen but I fear I might find them a little less charming now.The book I discovered later in lifeThe novels of Elizabeth Taylor were a fairly recent discovery for me. Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont is a stunning book. Wry, funny and heartbreaking, but never cruel. Maybe you have to be a little older to really enjoy it? I was also recommended the works of the late Octavia Butler recently. I rarely read sci-fi, but Kindred is the most visceral novel about the horrors of slavery that I’ve read.The book I am currently readingI’ve just finished Long Island Compromise by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. A sprawling saga about a damaged family which I really enjoyed.My comfort readAgatha Christie, what else? Grisly murders and neat solutions.

Fox chooses his victims carefully: his “little kittens”, all in his preferred 12-to-14 age group, have literary leanings and absent fathers, and feel validated by the attention he pays them. When the parts of Fox’s body that haven’t been consumed by wildlife are pulled out of a local swamp, it falls to world-weary detective Horace Zwender to work out what’s been going on. Peppered with exclamation marks, breathless and febrile, this is an utterly mesmeric account of how one man’s crimes can affect an entire community.View image in fullscreenA Schooling in Murderby Andrew Taylor (Hemlock, £20)Taylor’s latest also centres on an educational establishment, Monkshill Park School for Girls, a crumbling mansion in Monmouthshire, Wales. It’s the end of the second world war, the country is exhausted, and several inhabitants are waiting for news of loved ones who are missing, perhaps dead. Also missing is teacher Annabel Warnock, who disappeared during the Easter holidays. It’s presumed that “Warnie” simply walked out on her job, but she remembers being shoved off a nearby cliff. Now a trapped spirit, she is determined to discover who killed her and, able to move about the school and grounds unobserved, finds herself privy to all sorts of secrets. Taylor’s ability to conjure time past is second to none and here he blends a school story for adults, a ghost story and a mystery for a sublime evocation of a closed world in which the adults are, in their way, as powerless as their young charges.View image in fullscreenDeath of a Diplomatby Eliza Reid (Sphere, £20)Reid is a former first lady of Iceland, and her debut novel is set on Heimaey, the largest of that country’s Westman Islands. Canadian ambassador Graeme Shearer and his wife Jane are paying a visit with the dual purpose of opening an art exhibition and forging business links with a large fishery. Beneath the standard-issue speechifying, subtle power plays and general buttering up, trouble is brewing. Not only is the island’s mayor grieving the unexpected death of his husband, but the Shearers’ marriage is in crisis and the increasingly stormy weather means that the island is isolated until further notice – and then deputy ambassador Kavita Banerjee is felled by a poisoned “Flaming Viking” cocktail. Told from multiple points of view, the story rewinds to 13 hours before Kavita’s death, before taking us forward to the projected killing of an unnamed second person. Despite a fair bit of exposition, this classic “closed world” mystery moves at a good pace, making excellent use of its claustrophobic setting and delivering a final sucker-punch twist.View image in fullscreenActually, I’m a Murdererby Terry Deary (Constable, £18.99)The Horrible Histories writer’s first novel for adults begins in 1973, when four strangers meet on an early morning train from London to Newcastle upon Tyne. There’s Tony, a struggling actor; Claire, who works in the fledgling computer industry; Edward, prosperous lawyer and adviser to the prime minister, Edward Heath; and last “Mr Brown”, who tells his new acquaintances “Actually, I’m a murderer”. In the next few days, one of the company will be killed, another will turn to blackmail, and a third will be forced to commit a crime … All this is recounted 50 years later by Tony, the professional killer and self-styled sociopath “Mr Brown”, and police officer Aline James. It’s by no means all hijinks – the institutional misogyny young Aline has to contend with rings appallingly true – but this smart, funny and deftly executed page turner is sure to please.View image in fullscreenCan You Solve the Murder?by Antony Johnston (Bantam, £14.99)“Solve it yourself” titles aren’t new. In the 1930s, Dennis Wheatley’s “murder dossiers” came complete with clues ranging from telegrams and photographs of cigarette ends to little bags containing human hair, and in recent years the Murdle puzzle collections have become a publishing phenomenon, but a superior interactive crime story is always a delight. This is Cluedo-type detective fiction in which you, the reader, are the presiding DCI, presented in “choose your own adventure” gamebook style. In order to solve the murder of property developer Harry Kennedy, whose corpse has been discovered at the luxurious Elysium spa, you must choose which of the available suspects to interview and which locations to explore, with each decision leading you to a fork in the narrative road as the chapters fan out to a series of different conclusions, only one of which is correct. Park your need for emotional resonance and sharpen your wits: this clever, intricate book is a highly entertaining mental workout.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupCrime fictionThrillersFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Judge not, that ye be not judged.Is giving an artist a one-star review an act of abuse – casting the first stone? Is it worse when the reviewer is male and the artist female? That’s the starting point of this entertaining and very timely debut novel from Charlotte Runcie, an arts journalist who, as a young intern, was lambasted on stage by a successful standup to whom she’d given a bad review.Alex Lyons, chief theatre critic for a national newspaper, is known for his hatchet jobs. It’s the Edinburgh fringe, and he’s sitting through a one-woman standup show. “The solo performance artist, Hayley Sinclair, had a lot to say about the climate emergency, the patriarchy, and the looming end of the world, which was fair enough, but unfortunately her show was so terrible that, by half an hour in, Alex had decided that he actually wanted the world to end as soon as possible.”Instead, immediately after bashing out his one-star review, he goes to a bar, encounters an emotionally exhausted post-show Hayley, and invites her back to the flat he is sharing with another journalist, Sophie Ridgen. It is only the next morning that Hayley, after spending the night with Alex, reads the eviscerating, career-ending words he has written about her: “a dull, hectoring frump, like one of those 1950s cartoons of housewives beating their husbands with a rolling pin”. Alex blithely walks in from his morning shower to find Hayley with his brickbat in her hands.Am I tempted to cast the first stone? Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety make this impossibleIt is a delightfully excruciating scene, setting in motion one of the most enjoyable novels I’ve read in a long time. Although as a male reviewer of a female artist, for a national newspaper, who by chance read much of the book on the train south from Edinburgh, I experienced moments of very meta-terror and mischief. Wouldn’t the most fun review to write, but even more to read, be an absolute slating? Wasn’t I, too, being tempted to cast the first stone?Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety rendered that impossible. Alongside a fringe festival retelling of the history of the #MeToo movement, we also get a will-they-won’t-they plot and an inside account of so-Alex-has-been-publicly-shamed. Because, in reaction to her awful one-star review, and the one-night stand, Hayley transforms her one-woman show into “The Alex Lyons Experience” – a one-star review of Alex’s entire life and an immediate star-making media sensation. She retells the story of her encounter with Alex, then opens the stage for other women to share the appalling things Alex or other Alex-like men have done to them. And as clips from the show go viral, resonating far beyond a small function room below a pub and bringing forth similar stories from thousands of women, it starts to seem as though most men – all men? – are deserving of similar humiliation. And if not that, then a good digital stoning.As the Black Mirror episode Nosedive foretold, these days we are all but forced to participate in a culture of constantly rating one another. Midway through the novel, Sophie finds herself getting self-hatingly drunk at a festival party.There was an interactive customer feedback device propped up on the bar.

It was the movie that in effect invented the summer blockbuster, paving the way for Star Wars, Jurassic Park and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It cast sharks in the role of monsters to be feared and killed – but also stimulated interest in marine conservation.Based on a novel by Peter Benchley and directed bySteven Spielberg, Jaws tells the story of a great white shark terrorising the beach town of Amity Island, prompting police chief Martin Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and grizzled fisherman Quint to hunt it down. It earned rave reviews from critics and became the first movie to take more than $100m in theatrical rentals.The three men on a boat were Dreyfuss (Hooper),Roy Scheider(Brody) and Robert Shaw (Quint) and the dynamic between them is central to the film’s appeal. Today only Dreyfuss is left. Now, 77, sitting in a library at his home in San Diego, California, his memories remain lucid. “First of all, you have to remember this is not 50 years later,” he says via Zoom. “This is yesterday.”At first Dreyfuss turned the part down. “At this lunch meeting he [Spielberg] illustrated the story very well, very vividly, and he said, did you like it? I said, oh, yes. He said, do you want to do it? I said, no, and he said, why? I said, because it’s going to be a bitch to shoot. I at that moment was not looking for difficulties. I turned him down in that meeting and then I turned him down again.”But then Dreyfuss saw a rough cut of a film he had just made and thought his performance looked so bad that it might end his career. So he called Spielberg and begged him for the role. Once shooting got under way, it did not go as Dreyfuss had prophesied at that lunch meeting.“One of the many things that I learned was that it was not a bitch to shoot at all. I would say that there was one word that characterised the shoot and that was waiting. More waiting than anything.”Despite the difficulty and cost, Spielberg insisted on shooting in the open ocean off Martha’s Vineyard for the sake of authenticity. The budget ballooned from $4m to $9m. Production went 100 days over schedule and was plagued by the malfunctions of the mechanical shark (nicknamed “Bruce” after Spielberg’s lawyer).At the mention of this, Dreyfuss puts his hands to his mouth to mimic a loudspeaker: “‘The shark is not working. The shark is not working. Repeat. The shark is not working.’ And then one day you hear this. ‘The shark is working! The shark is working!’”He recalls: “There were three different sharks and three different crews that worked the shark and it was all a disaster. There’s a line in the film where Robert says he had these eyes, these doll’s eyes, and he did because theyweredoll’s eyes!“Steven had to conceive of a film which implied the shark rather than show it directly. That was the story of the shoot: the director, Steven, had to rework his conception of the entire movie because he knew he could not show it as brazenly or blatantly as he had assumed. That ultimately made the film a masterpiece.”Spielberg, who was in his mid-20s at the time, has credited director Alfred Hitchcock with influencing his less-is-more approach to building suspense. He also received a mighty lift from composer John Williams, whosetwo-note theme musicinitially seemed so simple that Spielberg thought it a joke until he realised its visceral menace.Dreyfuss comments:“John is an extraordinary composer and it took him no time at all to create a sound picture that could carry the film. You don’t see the shark first: you hear it. Under the credits you hear bar-dum, bar-dum, bar-dum, bar-dum and you’re seeing that shark moving through the underbrush and I’m telling you, it put the fear of God in the audience and me and everybody.”The British film critic Mark Kermodehas arguedthat Jaws is not about a shark. A case in point is a scene below deck in which Quint recalls how sharks ravaged survivors after the wartime sinking of the USS Indianapolis, providing Quint with a powerful motivation for his hatred of the animals. Enhanced by improvisation captured on tape recorders, it has been described by Spielberg as “the scene that I’m proudest of in Jaws”.Spielberg tells of guilt over harm hit film Jaws may have done to sharksRead moreShaw – who struggled with alcoholism for most of his life – made himself drunk for the scene but it backfired on the first take, Dreyfuss recalls. “He lost control of himself and he was terribly embarrassed and that only made him drink more and so that day was a terrible humiliation for him. Because I was sitting next to him and in the shot, it was painful.“That night he called Steven at two or three in the morning and said, how badly did I humiliate myself? Steven said, not fatally. He came in the next morning and he did the scene in one take and he was brilliant.”For decades there have been stories that the palpable tension between Hooper and Quint was not based on acting alone but mirrored personal animosity between Dreyfuss and Shaw. The alleged feud was explored in the recent playThe Shark is Brokenco-written by and starring Shaw’s son Ian. Dreyfuss, however, is adamant this is a myth and one that pains him to this day.“If you are aware of the stories in and around the filming, you know the ‘discovery’ of the feud between Robert and myself didn’t exist for 25 years,” he says firmly. “It was not the truth. It was not the fact of our relationship at all. Twenty-five years after the film was over, I found that there was this ‘feud’ between us.View image in fullscreenRobert Shaw, Roy Schieder and Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws.Photograph: Kobal/Allstar“What there had been was one day where I was angry at him for stuff. It was one day. To a great extent what happened was that in order to jack up the stories about the film, they re-emphasized the story of this feud, which wasn’t real and the people who did it knew it. I resented that for a long time but Robert was already dead by 15 years and there was nothing I could do.“I cherished his memory and what I was learning from him and I’m not kidding about that. Robert was an extraordinary actor and an extraordinary writer and I could tell you a great number of stories about all of that. But I won’t allow anyone to walk away from an interview withRichard Dreyfussand think that there was reality to the feud.”He and Shaw had even made plans for a future collaboration, Dreyfuss adds. “We were in the hold of the boat and we were both napping and all of a sudden Robert said, ‘I know. I’ll play the Ghost to your Hamlet if you play the Fool to my Lear.’ I said, ‘You’ve got it. But not for 10 years.’ He said, ‘Why?’ I said, ‘Because you’ll eat me alive,’ and he laughed and said, ‘OK.’“So we had an agreement to make those two pieces and unfortunately he died very quickly. That was a catastrophic feeling, a loss that I knew had changed my future. I could have taken willing advantage of that friendship and I was unable to.”When Dreyfuss first saw the finished cut ofJaws, it made a huge impression. He recalls: “I was as terrified as if I had never experienced the making of this film. I was completely swept up in the story. It was so much an achievement of film-making and my friend Steven, who’s sitting there – I knew that I was watching the crowning of the uncrowned prince of Hollywood.”‘People want blood and gore’: what we got wrong about filming sharksRead moreThe movie drew long queues at cinemas and quickly became a cultural phenomenon. “There was, for the first time, an awareness of how a film could affect all of society. There was not one group, one country, one people who were immune to this. He happened upon something that was so ubiquitous and shared by all people. Wow! Although Steven did that a number of times afterwardsin other films, it’s easy to spot because of Jaws.”Dreyfuss has never again sat down to watch the whole of Jaws from start to finish, although if he chances on a TV showing that is already under way, he usually sticks with it to the end. And what of the three widely panned sequels?“They should never have been made and I have absolutely no interest in seeing them. Never have and never will.”Dreyfuss, Shaw and Spielberg were not involved in Jaws 2, released in 1978, but it did star Scheider andLorraine Gary, playing his wife Ellen Brody as she had in the first film. Gary is now 88 and living in Los Angeles. Speaking by phone, her memories of working with Scheider on Jaws are less than rosy.“He was very much an isolated human at that point. He smoked; I hate cigarettes. He also spent a tremendous amount of time with one of those tin foil reflector pans, getting his tan. There was very little in common. Years later I was in New York and we ran into each other on Madison Avenue. We talked like real people at that point instead of actors on the set and it was fun – it was very professional.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal/Kobal/ShutterstockTypically summer months were quiet for cinemas but Jaws was deliberately timed for when people were at beach resorts and accompanied by the tagline: “See it before you go swimming!” The film opened on 464 screens in North America and was boosted by a major TV advertising campaign, still unusual at the time andmarketing stuntssuch as themed ice-creams. Gottlieb once observed: “That notion of selling a picture as an event, as a phenomenon, as a destination, was born with that release.”Did Gary have any sense that Jaws would be such a gamechanger? “Absolutely not. No clue. It stunned me when it did, what it did and it stuns me now. Every day I get fan mail. I’m an 88-year-old woman. Come on, leave me alone! It’s all very strange to me but luckily, it’s fun.”Unlike Dreyfuss, the experience did not put her off swimming. Gary has gone scuba diving and come within five feet of a shark. “I’m not scared of sharks,” she says. “The only time I was scared by sharks was when I saw my sons and my grandchildren in the ocean and I thought, sooner or later there’ll be payback, but there wasn’t. I truly do not have a very strong feeling about hurting the reputation of sharks. They deserve to be known for who they are and what they do.”The film’s impact on these ancient predators, which date back 450m years – longer than the dinosaurs – is complex and frequently debated. Itsofficial trailerspeaks of a “mindless eating machine” that will “attack and devour anything”, adding: “It is as if God created the devil and gave him jaws.”Small wonder Jaws instilled widespread fear of sharks, whose population has fallen dramatically since the early 1970s. Spielbergtold BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discsin 2022: “I truly and to this day regret the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film. I really, truly regret that.”But the film also sparked engagement in marine science and conservation, a legacy actively pursued by the author Benchley, who died in 2006, and his wife Wendy, who is executive producer of a Nat Geo documentary,Jaws@50: The Definitive Inside Story.In a phone interview, Wendy, 84, comments: “Jaws tapped into an innate fear of being eaten by a monster. It was a scary book and a scary movie but 90% of the people who read the book or saw the movie got over their fear; 10% never went back in the water.”Benchley had worked as a speechwriter forPresident Lyndon Johnsonover the last two years of his presidency then wanted to get back to freelance writing. The couple were living in Pennington, New Jersey, with two young children and financial pressures but Benchley decided to try writing a book.He had two ideas, Wendy says. “One was about current day pirates; one about a great white shark that hangs around a town and causes some mischief. I said, oh, honey, I don’t think either of these ideas are going to be that great. Thank heavens he didn’t listen to me.”Benchley hadspent childhood summerssailing, fishing or swimming at Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, where the black dorsal fins of sharks could be seen above the surface. “Now, he knew after he wrote the book, and after people started to do more and more research on sharks, that sharks do not hang around. They don’t like human flesh: we’re too bony, we don’t have enough fat on us. Peter always said, ‘I would never write Jaws again because I now know how important this animal is and how magnificent it is.’”Benchley was unsure what to call the book. Wendy says: “Some suggested titles were pretentious, like Leviathan Rising, and others were very scary, like White Death. Peter’s father, who was a wonderful guy and a novelist also, said with his good sense of humour: ‘How about What’s That Noshing on My Leg?’“It was down to the wire and Peter said, let’s settle on the word Jaws because nobody knows what it means and nobody reads a first book anyway. There was absolutely no expectation that this would be rocketing up theNew York Times bestseller list.”Nor did the Benchleys expect it to become a movie. Spielberg had chanced upon galley proofs of the book and been enthralled. The rights were secured by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown for $150,000, plus $25,000 for a first draft of the script, before the novel had been published (it would sell 5.5m copies before the film opened).Jaws - the original Guardian review: archive, 22 Dec 1975Read moreWendy says: “I do remember when Peter got the phone call in our little house in Pennington. I cried. I thought, our life is ruined because I had known people who suddenly got some wealth and I thought, oh no, but we were a little bit older and we had good, strong families and we had wonderful friends and so our life stayed very solid.”Benchley co-wrote the screenplay, and had a bit part on screen as a reporter, but was relieved whenCarl Gottliebtook over the day-to-day writing, including a leavening of humour. The film version removed plot lines from the novel such as a mafia connection and an affair between Hooper and Brody’s wife. Spielberg also decided: you’re gonna need a bigger shark.View image in fullscreenSteven Spielberg poses with the model shark.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyDismayed by the demonisation of sharks, Benchley wrote, narrated and appeared in dozens of TV documentaries about marine life and becamea full-time marine conservationist. He and his wife worked for the Environmental Defense Fund. ThePeter Benchley Ocean Awardsare held each year to celebrate individual excellence in ocean conservation.Wendy says: “We were horrified that people took this novel and this fictional movie as some kind of a licence to go out and kill sharks and to schedule more shark tournaments. We took this very seriously and began to work on conservation issues.”As awareness has grown, she adds, applications to study marine science have risen at universities around the country. “That is an outcome of Jaws that people now understand. In fact the ocean community embraces Jaws as a positive for ocean science, ocean research and conservation.“The other thing that surprised us and relieved us greatly was that Peter began to get thousands of letters from people all over the world who said it was a great book, scary movie, but it intrigued them and they want to know more about sharks. There were so many letters from people wanting to be Hooper, not in a white lab coat sitting doing research but out on the ocean and experiencing not only sharks but other ocean creatures. That was a wonderful feeling.”Explore more on these topicsJawsRichard DreyfussSteven SpielbergSharksAction and adventure filmsHorror filmsThrillersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the very least, the film will remind you that when politicians smugly announce they wish to make a bonfire of regulations, they should be taken, under police escort if necessary, and made to stand at the foot of the tower. As for the housing secretary at the time of the tower’s refurbishment, the abysmally arrogant Eric Pickles, he was made a life peer in 2018.With the very considerable help of thehousing-issues journalist Peter Apps, the film shows how the horror was created by a perfect storm of incompetence, mendacity, greed, and (that heartsinking phrase) systemic failure. The local council were keen to spruce up its brutalist, concrete (but safe) Grenfell Tower because it was a “poor cousin” and depressing property values. Decorative cladding was just the ticket and the council allowed the installation of the cheapest tiles,made of aluminium composite material which was terrifyingly flammable. A US aluminium firm’s French division sold the council those tiles; in the subsequent inquirythey were accused of suppressing their own researchinto how dangerous another of their products was.The coalition government of David Cameron, dominated by red-tape-burners, had ignored the terrible warning of the2009 Lakanal House fire, also in London, with comparable cladding which killed six. Other cladding-related fires in other countries had resulted in tighter regulations – but not in the UK. Andsenior officers of the London fire brigade had not been aware of the cladding issueand so failed to update the policy of “stay put”, asking people in tower fires to stay in their flats. Firefighters were courageous, though this was a fatal flaw in their managers’ approach.Among the government figures, Theresa May, then prime minister, at least has the courage to be interviewed on camera here, though there is something slippery in her statement: “There was regulation there, it just wasn’t up to purpose.” Brian Martin, the civil servant in charge of building regulations at the time, was notoriously dismissive but did have the grace to sound embarrassed at the inquiry. The same can’t be said for Pickles, whohigh-handedly told the inquirythat he didn’t have all day to answer the questions and talked about the “96” deaths – apparently confusing Grenfell with Hillsborough.Criminal proceedings and convictions and class-action lawsuits seem as far away as ever. What is there left for us in the meantime? To establish a database of all UK buildings that still have the unsafe cladding, always to make sure we know where the stairwell is whenever we check into a hotel or enter any high-rise – and to support the continuing campaign of the survivors.Grenfell: Uncovered is onNetflixfrom 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGrenfell Tower fireGrenfell Tower inquiryFirefightersNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its charisma is reminiscent of his previous rollicking production at this venue,The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, which featured some of the same actors.This is not as successful, despite its infectiousness. Ultz’s set design is loose, initially bearing a coffin at its centre. The premise is that 11 travellers must embark on a quest across all 54 nations inAfricawithin a week, spurred on by ancestral mother Mama Africa (Suzette Llewellyn). It is not altogether clear what will happen if they fail despite the symbolic coffin; the play does not dwell on raising the stakes. The job of the characters is to “demystify and justify” the continent.Based on writer-director Elufowoju’sown travels, the collective odyssey encompasses personal, political, social and even environmental history along with myth and ideas around belonging. Spoken scenes are accompanied by interludes of exuberant song and dance. The performers are always entertaining: Munashe Chirisa oozes comic talent as a shopkeeper in Uganda and a traffic warden in Seychelles; Liana Cottrill is an astounding dancer; The Ganda Boys (Denis Mugagga and Daniel Sewagudde) weave music around scenes; whileElufowoju, following an illness in the cast, does a fine job of reading a part.We briefly hear about the colonial history of Cameroon and at one passport control, an officer challenges a traveller’s dual African/British identity. We sweep reverentially into Robben Island, briefly stopping inside Nelson Mandela’s former cell, and push through to Tunisia and a bristling encounter in Libya.Sometimes it is hard to work out what is happening. Scenes are often brief – giving little time to connect with characters – and heavy-handed in their messages. The drama feels baggy and more like sketches or riffs that contain little tension, story or characterisation. Maybe it is a deliberate endeavour to disrupt or diverge from a – western? – dramatic narrative so it is not led by these traditional elements.What takes their place is joyful but broad-brush, maybe too ambitious in what it is trying to achieve. Where it shares the same inventive staging and bubbling joy as The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, there is little of its magnificent storytelling, despite the 11 adventuring storytellers.At theArcola theatre, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

He would have dismissed such an accolade as banal, journalistic and ignorant. He would, of course, have been right. Piano playing, he once said, was never sufficient, even when it was faultless.Yet, for a generation of musicians, especially in Britain, where he lived the second half of his long life, this dismissal of his own greatness could itself be dismissed as false modesty. When London’s Royal Festival Hall, still at that time the capital’s most cherished classical music large venue, reopened after a long renovation in 2007,the choice of its first recitalist was a no-brainer. For his legions of admirers, Brendel was always the one.He was the pianist whose recitals they would never miss, the one whose recordings they felt came closest to definitiveness, and he was the artist whose performances seemed unmatched in their objectivity, balance and colour, seriousness and depth. For the listeners of his era, he was, quite simply, the pianist of pianists.Brendel,who died this weekat his London home at the age of 94, was never best known for his piano pyrotechnics. In performance, he eschewed glitz. While some keyboard virtuosi of earlier times have been noted for their performance mannerisms – Horowitz wiping the piano keys with his handkerchief in mid-performance, Rubinstein playing to the gallery with his exaggerated arm movements – Brendel was straight-backed, concentrated, almost severe.That was the deal. It was the music, not his personality, that the audiences came to hear. Brendel’s technique was of the highest order, but it was always at the service of the music and the listener, not of his own reputation. His piano sound was rich but never overdone, his readings authoritative but never pompous. His performances always had a well-articulated shape and direction, but they were made up of a thousand small choices and touches about phrasing, contrast and tone. He was never an obviously fast player, but as a listener it was hard to keep up with the cascade of detail that always underpinned the whole.I once encountered him walking purposefully across Hampstead Heath, carrying a brand new blue bucket.He was known for his authority in the works of the Austro-German masters – Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert in particular – all of them reliable public favourites. As he grew older, his programmes rarely strayed far beyond this Viennese canon, though Haydn, Liszt and Schoenberg were always important to him too. Chopin and Schumann became increasingly rare inclusions.But Brendel was not, as some insist, the last upholder of the central European piano tradition. For one thing, he always kept up with contemporary music. He reveredHarrison Birtwistle. When the Guardian was looking for a new chief music critic in the early 1990s, it was he who recommendedAndrew Clementsfor the job on the grounds of his commitment to new music.He saw himself as a cosmopolitan who had simply ended up in the UK (he had a house in Hampstead and another in Dorset). Yet the fact that he chose to live here was undeniably flattering, and the compliment was repaid by the fierce and almost reverential loyalty of British audiences. As with Yehudi Menuhin from an earlier generation, and Daniel Barenboim during his young adulthood, Britain embraced Brendel with undisguised affection.He was always interested in listening to other musicians, which is more than can be said for all soloists. One sometimes saw him at other pianists’ recitals, notably those of the lateMaurizio Pollini, and of former pupils includingPaul LewisandImogen Cooper. His collaborations with singers were rare, but those of us who heard him accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Schubert’s Winterreise cycle (on the stage at Covent Garden in 1985) were rewarded with a partnership of equals.Piano playing was, of course, the thing he did best and which gave him his fame and his income. But it was only ever one part of his very varied and even eclectic cultural life. Brendel had a vast and individual intellectual hinterland. He was awriter, a poet and a painter as well as a musician, a teacher, a public intellectual and a man of wide sensibilities.View image in fullscreenA lover of the absurd … Alfred Brendel.Photograph: Isode OhlbaumHe was famously a lover of the absurd. His poetry showed the influence of the Munich nonsense writerChristian Morgenstern, while his cultural writing sometimes echoed the great Viennese criticKarl Kraus. Although he was not himself Viennese (he was born in the northern Moravian part of present-day Czechia), the Austrian capital drew him in, not merely because he played so much music by Vienna-based composers.Vienna was the city where he chose to give his farewell concertin 2008 – he played Mozart’s early E flat piano concerto K271.At his home, Brendel had a drawing of a pianist laughing fit to burst in a concert hall filled with intense and serious listeners. This may explain why there was always something both of the undertaker and the clown in his platform appearance. I never met him socially but, while wheeling one of my children in a buggy one winter’s day, I once encountered him walking purposefully across Hampstead Heath, carrying a brand new blue bucket with its price tag attached. Why the bucket? Where could he be taking it? He grinned as we passed one another. Perhaps it was just another private joke. But it seemed, now as it did back then, to embody the duality of the remarkable artist we have just lost.Explore more on these topicsAlfred BrendelClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Great artworks jostle for space on the walls – Picasso, Velázquez, a handful of impressionists, and a banner reads “Happy birthday boss”. Guests pour in from a pinging elevator: a maelstrom of big skirts in Disney princess colours, high-rise hair, three-piece suits and pork pie hats. Out of the window: skyscrapers.In singer turned directorJohn Savournin’s latest production for Opera Holland Park – a collaboration with Scottish Opera and D’Oyly Carte Opera – Franz Lehár’s hit operettaThe Merry Widowswitches fictional Pontevedro andLe Gai Parisfor New York’s mafia underworld and its Sicilian homeland. The plot’s patriarch becomes a pinstripe Manhattan godfather, title character Hanna Glawari the widow of a Sicilian lemon-tree racketeer.In their energetic English version, Savournin and David Eaton have fun with Dolmio-level Italian (no less authentic than Lehár’s original Balkan Neverland) and these mafiosi reach as often for the TV gangster phrase book – “Bada bing, bada boom”, “schmuck”, “capeesh?” – as for their guns. Dialogue is delivered in 90% faux mafioso (“family comes foist, bowss!”), 10% operatic RP. In the mostly excellent singing those proportions were reversed. And where the spoken passages were largely shrieked or shouted, the balance in the sung numbers swung in favour of the orchestra: most of the action played behind the pit thus vastly increasing the demands on singers already working in tent-acoustics.View image in fullscreenHigh-camp melodrama … The Merry Widow.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSo much high-camp melodrama may leave some yearning for a calmer take on Lehár’s classic. But, for those with a higher tolerance for hyperactive kitsch and national stereotyping after Lehár’s own model, this mid-century Merry Widow is enormously enjoyable. Come for the big tunes, stay for the straight-legged “Russian” folk dance performed unsmiling in dark glasses, the stage hands in white tie, lemon trees on wheels and the “birthday cement mixer” (don’t ask).

Matthew Kellett’s Little Italy accent was the best of the bunch, while Christopher Nairne and Connor James Smith made one winning double act as warring Italians,Amy J PayneandMatthew Siveteras another, the ferocious “Russian” Kromows. But this is also a piece with a big heart. Along with the warm, stylish playing from the orchestra of Scottish Opera underStuart Stratford, it was the suavity and occasional tenderness ofAlex Otterburn’s Danilo andPaula Sides’s Hanna that made this performance more than the sum of its gags.AtOpera Holland Park, London, until 28 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

She recalls her early struggles – and explains why her beloved classical music fits best with RPGsFri 20 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareAlfred Hitchcock, David Attenborough, Harold Pinter, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Hideo Kojima – these are just a few of the recipients of the Bafta fellowship, the highest honour the academy can bestow. Japanese composer Yoko Shimomura is the latest to receive the accolade; one of only 17 women and four Japanese people to have done so. She is also the first video-game composer to be recognised by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and the first composer recognised at all since John Barry in 2005.It is with good reason that the academy has honoured her. Shimomura is an icon. You’ll know her music from Street Fighter,Final Fantasy, Super Mario, Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana, Streets of Rage and more than 70 other games she has contributed original compositions or arrangements to. Her 37-year-long career has seen her record at Abbey Road Studios, have her music played by symphonic orchestras around the world, and work in genres ranging from rock to electronica, ambient to industrial, pop to opera. And yet Shimomura seems unchanged by her success.“Certainly, over the course of my career, there have been a number of times – a lot of times perhaps, compared to other people – where I have struggled. Enough to think maybe I want to give up.” She tells me that even as far back as her first job at Japanese developer Capcom, she thought she had maybe two or three years in her before she’d quit. She also says she applied for that job with “barely any hope of getting accepted” – with a modesty that still seems a core part of her character.“Even though I love this job, there have been plenty of times when it was really hard for me to continue. I couldn’t sleep, and I would especially struggle as deadlines would approach.”View image in fullscreenThe first video-game composer recognised by Bafta … Shimomura collects her fellowship.Photograph: Lia Toby/Getty Images for BAFTAPart of her fatalism came from the culture of video games in Japan in the late 80s. Despite the thriving arcade and development scene later leading to the mainstream success of the PlayStation in the mid-90s, pursuing a career in video games was seen as a dubious prospect by Shimomura’s peers and family. “This is something I think most gamers who were around at the time will understand,” she laughs. “Generally, my friends and people I hung out with were not big gamers, so they weren’t too familiar with what games really were. At the time, a lot of them were confused about what a job in video-games music even was! Certainly, my parents were not of the generation who would have played the Famicom [the NES], so they would say things like: ‘Oh, video-game music? Is that a job? Is that real?’ There was a lack of knowledge and understanding about the profession, really.”People used to say: ‘Video-game music? Is that a real job?’Surprisingly, given the male-dominated western world of video games in the 80s and 90s, Shimomura tells me that a lot of her colleagues in the sound department at Capcom were women. The developer split its composers into corporate and consumer divisions, where the top staff were all female. “I felt that since the head staff were women,” she says, “it was easier for other women to join the department.”Her peers began to understand how serious Shimomura was about her musical career with the release of Street Fighter II in 1991, the ninth game she worked on. “That’s when the tide started to turn. It sold so much, and so many people knew it and became familiar with my music, that it was a really significant title for me. I certainly think it’s why I ended up working with Square on titles like Live a Live and Front Mission – because the bosses there knew me from Street Fighter.”For Street Fighter, Shimomura would study the character designs and personalities of the fighters, then design themes for them. She would also pore over the detailed pixel art stages for each character, and draw out details from their “home stage”. She would then compose music based on the character’s ethnicity and culture, often to striking and unusual effect. The best example, to my ear, is the use of a major key rhythm track for the Brazilian fighter Blanka, while the main melody playing on top of the rhythm is in minor. It’s odd but it works, and gives the green-and-orange fighter a musical identity as as much as a visual one.View image in fullscreenAmazon River Basin in Street Fighter II … the inspiration for one of Yoko Shimomura’s most notable early tracks.Photograph: CapcomShimomura’s classical background gave her the tools to work techniques such as this into her music. She eventually departed Capcom for Square, the most famous RPG developer in the world, because she wanted to work on games where she could utilise classical composition techniques.“Why is classical music such a good fit for RPGs? I think it’s because so many of those titles are set in medieval, European-style worlds where that music naturally belongs,” she says. “But even if an RPG is set in a more modern take on a world, they’re very rarely close to reality; the game world is of another age. And classical music is of another age too, so it’s a very good fit.”The first project Square set Shimomura to work on was Live a Live, a 1994 RPG that takes players on a fantastical journey as eight characters across nine scenarios. “There are so many different worlds and different settings in there, and very few of them actually needed classical music, so it was completely different to what I was expecting,” she laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Music in Live a Live had to align with the characters. For Parasite Eve, I had to work with what was established in the original game. Mario RPG, of course, is set in the world of Mario and had to be ‘Mario music’. I was not free to create something from the ground up until Legend of Mana.”View image in fullscreenLive a Live … working with an eclectic cast of characters and giving them a unique aural identity is Yoko Shimomura’s bread and butter.Photograph: Square EnixLegend of Mana would be foundational for the rest of Shimomura’s career. Three years later she would work on Kingdom Hearts, the now-mainstream success that trades on the unlikely idea that the worlds of Final Fantasy and Disney could somehow become merged.“When it first released, Kingdom Hearts wasn’t a big hit,” Shimomura recalls. “After it was released, it was one of those hard times I mentioned before: I left Square, and I wasn’t sure if I was going to continue in this job or not. But then they came back to me and asked if I wanted to work on Kingdom Hearts II, and that was significant for two reasons. One, it proved I couldcontinue doing this as a freelancer. And two, it was the first time I’d been asked to come back and work on another game in a series.” Even at that point, 17 years into her career, Shimomura was uncertain about her standing in the world of video-game music. “I think, both professionally and in a sense of personal growth, that’s why Kingdom Hearts means so much to me.”Now, 37 years since her first job at Capcom, Shimomura has been lauded with Bafta’s highest honour, and she is still as polite, humble and respectful as the young woman poring over Street Fighter’s stages. “I was blessed to have mentors and seniors who really helped me grow as a composer and taught me a lot of what made me who I am,” she says. “I feel very lucky, and it is down to all those people that I am here talking to you today.”And her advice to other young women hoping to break into making music for games today? Be tenacious, persevere and work through that self-doubt. “I think the reason I haven’t given up is because I always make myself think of the love I have for music and for games. I cherish that feeling. And so if people do ever think they want to give up, please, cherish that feeling of love yourself, and keep going. I hope I can be an example for people when times are tough. If I can get over that, I hope that they can too.”Explore more on these topicsGamesHigh scoresFinal FantasySuper MarioJapanAsia PacificAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Religious processions gave way to paganistic bonfires where people tossed mementoes of their year to forget. Next up were fireworks and a Brazilian samba troupe. Locals explained that the mayor could justify the expense because it was a prerequisite of getting re-elected. After midnight we headed to the beach for a party fuelled bycalimocho(red wine and cola, don’t ask). We retired at 8am for a breakfast of chorizo and fried eggs just as a live DJ started up.Kieranskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From shrieking swifts diving through the 19th-century market hall in nearby Auvillar to a turtle dove purring beside a rural road, it was this bird lover’s idyll. We heard nightingale melodies throughout the day as well as after dark, and caught the calls of cirl buntings, hoopoes and black redstarts. And it wasn’t just birds. One night, crickets and frogs provided a chirruping and croaking medley – a memorable midsummer nocturne.Sharon PinnerBands on every corner, ParisView image in fullscreenA band playing in Ménilmontant, Paris, during the Fête de la Musique.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyHiring a bike and exploring Paris forFête de la Musiquewas a brilliant way to spend an urban solstice. Every year on 21 June, the city turns into one big free festival, with stages of all sizes springing up outside famous landmarks and local neighbourhood bars. Beginning in the heart of the city to catch some psychedelic guitar outside the Centre Georges Pompidou, we then pedalled past brass ensembles outside jazz bars near Jardin du Luxembourg, classic French techno along the banks of the Seine and scuzzy metal bands in squares of the 13th arrondissement.Lizzy CThe golden light in Italy’s PiedmontView image in fullscreenThe vineyards of Serralunga d’Alba.Photograph: AlamyIn the golden light of midsummer, Serralunga d’Alba’s rolling vineyards (about 35 miles south-east of Turin) come alive. Staying atCascina Meriame, a working winery with panoramic views, I savoured barolo and barbaresco wines during intimate tastings led by passionate hosts. Evenings were spent watching the sun set over the Langhe Hills, a Unesco world heritage site, while enjoying local cheeses and nebbiolo wines. The nearby medieval castle added a touch of history to the serene landscape. For a tranquil midsummer retreat blending culture, cuisine and nature, this Piedmont gem is unparalleled.Mr Ifan Morgan ap DafyddWinning tip: a fine place for a picnic, northern IcelandView image in fullscreenGrímsey is an island that straddles the Arctic Circle line.Photograph: Oleg Senkov/AlamyWe travelled to Grímsey from Akureyri for the island’s summer solstice festival. Arriving early, we hiked to the marker sign and received official certificates to confirm we had crossed the Arctic Circle. Celebrations began atKrian, the only restaurant on the island, and continued well into the night at the schoolhouse. The drink flowed and there was a treasure hunt, dancing, traditional songs and homemade food. Families came together for picnics on the wildflower-covered hillsides, outdoor chess tournaments were played at midnight and, local or stranger, all were welcomed. It was truly magical.ElizabethView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsSummer holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Filled with honey-roasted apricots and a fragrant almond cream, they make a fabulous pudding; berries macerated with sugar and a splash of orange juice or Cointreau would also be delicious.Oat shortcakes with honey-roasted apricots and almond creamPrep15 minChill30 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingMakes6For the shortcakes100g rolled oats225g plain flour, plus extra for stamping out the dough70g caster sugar2 tsp baking powder½ tsp baking soda/bicarbonate of soda½ tsp fine sea saltFinely grated zest of 1 orange(save the juice for the apricots)120g cold unsalted butter, cut into 3-4cm cubes120ml plain unsweetened kefir drink, plus extra for brushing1 tsp vanilla extractFor the apricots500g ripe apricots, halved and pitted60ml orange juice60ml water¼ tsp ground cardamomseeds(from about 8 pods), optionalA pinch of salt60g runny honeyFor the cream300ml double cram1 tbsp icing sugar, sifted, plus a little extra for dusting1 tsp vanilla extract¼ tspalmond extractLine a 20cm x 30cm baking tray with greaseproof paper. Pulse the oats in a food processor until finely ground but not powdery, then add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda/bicarb, salt and orange zest, and pulse a few times to combine and aerate.Add the butter, pulse until the mix looks crumbly, then tip it into a large bowl. Add the kefir and vanilla, stir with a fork until it just comes together in a shaggy dough, then out on to a lightly floured worktop and pat out into a roughly 2½cm-thick disc.Dip a 6-7cm biscuit cutter into flour, then stamp out as many rounds as possible. Arrange the shortcakes a few centimetres apart on the lined tray, then gather the offcuts, press together lightly, then pat out and cut out a few more rounds – you should end up with six altogether. Transfer to the fridge for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, roast the apricots. Heat the oven to 215C (195C fan)/gas 6½ and take a baking dish large enough to accommodate the apricots in one layer and line it with baking paper.Arrange the fruit cut side up in the baking dish, then pour the orange juice and water over and around it. Sprinkle over the cardamom and salt, then drizzle with the honey. Bake for 20-25 minutes, basting and gently shaking the dish occasionally, until the apricots are tender, collapsed and slightly caramelised. Remove from the oven (leave the oven on) and leave to cool in the dish for a few minutes, then tip the apricots and their juices into a bowl.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Composite: Q R Cody/a qr code for a marketing pushTurn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.
