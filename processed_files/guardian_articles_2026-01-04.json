The news that he had become the first British artist in history to be nominated that many times in the awards’ rock categories came as a suitably striking finale to what, by any metric, was an extraordinary year for the 28-year-old singer-songwriter.In June, his fourth studio album, Idols, entered the UK charts at No 1, outselling its nearest competitor by 50%. The same month, the annual festival he curates and headlines, Bludfest, drew an audience of 30,000 to The National Bowl in Milton Keynes. In July, he played atBack to the Beginning, the farewell performance by Black Sabbath, whose frontman Ozzy Osbourne died 17 days after the gig. On a bill almost comically overstuffed with heavy metal superstars paying tribute – Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Anthrax, Slayer – his rendition of Black Sabbath’s 1972 ballad Changes unexpectedly stole the show, appearing to win him an entirely new audience in the process: the crowd at the gig skewed considerably older than the gen Z fans Harrison traditionally attracts.The ensuing performance is worth watching on YouTube. You can see Harrison winning the crowd over as the song progresses: by the end, there are audience members singing along in tears. “I wasn’t surprised in the least,” says Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, who also performed that day. “And I say this without reservation, and as a fan of heavy metal for 50 years. Because Dom has one of the greatest voices in the history of music, and as grand as that may sound there is no hype in what I’m saying.”He has one of the greatest voices in the history of music – and there is no hype in what I’m sayingBilly CorganIt won him the respect of other august rock figures: Metallica’s Kirk Hammett approached him and told him he loved what he did, and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler not only called Harrison his “brother from another mother”, he enlisted him as a collaborator. Released in November, Aerosmith and Yungblud’s EP One More Time topped the UK charts and became Harrison’s first US Top 10 hit. “I’m sitting here at the end of the year talking to you, trying to comprehend it,” Harrison says. “What the fuck is going on?”On a video call from Los Angeles, where he’s working on a new album, he is clearly delighted about his sudden ascent, partly because it seems so unlikely.View image in fullscreenPerforming with Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and Joe Perry in September at the MTV Video Music awards.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesHarrison is no one’s idea of a critical cause celebre. Since the release of his eponymous 2018 debut EP, his work has consistently attracted reviews that range from middling to hostile. He has never had a solo hit single: his most successful, 2019’s 11 Minutes, stalled outside the Top 50. As he points out, beyond his famously rabid fanbase, who call themselves the Black Hearts Club, people may know the name Yungblud, but would struggle to name one of his songs. He says he only started Bludfest because no festivals would book him, confused as to where an artist whose oeuvre leaps around stylistically from rap to punk to pop to hard rock to indie would sit. “I wasn’t poppy enough for some of them, I wasn’t heavy enough for the rock festivals, so I had to start my own thing. And the festivals that weren’t giving me the slots I wanted cost so much, 200 to 500 quid a ticket, so we started selling tickets at 45 quid.”He bullishly suggests that this year, Bludfest could attract a crowd of “50 to 60,000 people” – an example of how “disaster always turns into opportunity for me”. His lack of “a billion streaming song that Joe Bloggs in the pub knows” is a bonus, because “I’m never beholden to one song, I’m not defined by it the way some other artists are”. If the press look askance at his earnest pronouncements about politics, mental health, toxic masculinity and trans rights, his sartorial experiments with androgyny and his cartoonish punk image – all held to be evidence of someone trying a bit too hard – then that’s what he thinks his fans like about him: “I think it’s an innate sense of honesty, and a fearlessness to being laid bare. I’ve always been a lot for some people, but I’ve utterly told the truth in real-time through my music even if I’ve been lost doing it.”He says his career has always played out in an improbable way, from the minute he left his home town of Doncaster for London (he briefly shared a flat with another would-be pop star, Lewis Capaldi). “No record label in the UK would touch me. I remember someone saying: ‘This music will never get played on Radio 1.’ I thought: ‘OK, I can’t rely on putting out music the old way, I can’t rely on good publicity and the press.’ I had to make videos on my phone instead and post them on social media: right, this is a song I’ve written called King Charles, it’s about Brexit.”The online views started stacking up. “People started sending me direct messages and I started hitting them back: no one gave a shit in England, it was kids in the Netherlands. I put a gig on there and we sold out 150 tickets in 10 minutes. I remember turning up in a van and there were kids outside the venue when we pulled up. I loved the Clash and I’d seen pictures of Joe Strummer smoking outside gigs with his fans, so that’s what I did: I stood outside with them all day, bringing them cups of tea. That’s how it all started – all I focused on was the fans, meeting them. I didn’t think I was building a brand or a community or anything like that.”But he clearly was: serendipitously, Harrison had embarked on his career at precisely the point where the influence of rock and pop’s traditional gatekeepers – the music press and radio – had begun to dramatically wane, and the kind of social media fuelled grassroots approach he’d been forced into had become all important. A US label, Geffen, took the bait, and by 2020, Harrison’s grassroots fanbase had grown to the point where his second album, Weird!, topped the UK charts. So did its eponymous successor, despite the fact that Harrison was so dissatisfied with it, he sank into depression after its release.‘I want to ride out on a unicorn every night’: swords’n’sorcery heavy metal band Castle RatRead moreAlong the way, he picked up some celebrity supporters, among them his “hero” Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, who appeared in the video for his single The Funeral. Nevertheless, Harrison says, he was “extremely nervous” when he was asked to perform at the Back to the Beginning show. For one thing, he’d assumed he would be playing an uptempo Black Sabbath track, not a ballad. For another, grizzled heavy metal fans are not known for their tolerance of pretty, young male pop stars, pal of the star attraction or not. “About 50,000 people were there,” he says. “Twenty-five thousand haven’t got a clue who I am, 15,000 think I’m a poser, and maybe 10,000, one of their kids has mentioned me to them.“But the minute I got on stage, everything went calm. I grew up in a guitar shop [his father owned one], I’ve always been around older rock-heads – my dad, my uncles, the people who worked there and played in bands around Doncaster. It’s what I grew up with. I thought: ‘This is where I come from, this is going to bring me home.’”Since then, the plaudits have continued to roll in. “I truly believe when all is said done, he will stand up there with the greats,” Corgan says. “And it’s worth noting that Ozzy believed this, too.” On Friday, Yungblud released a new version of his hit Zombie featuring the Smashing Pumpkins – the US band’s first ever collaborative release with another artist.Harrison says he recently received an “amazing” letter from Robbie Williams, and his recent US tour attracted a much broader audience – “from kids to 70-year-olds”.“It’s been such a beautiful year,” he says of 2025, understandably enthused about the future. “It’s limitless, and exciting.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she said the shock was even greater because it wasn’t what she expected when she enrolled at theUniversity of York.“I hadn’t travelled much down south before university, and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re all from London and Cambridge.’ It was such a shock to me,” she said.“I’m from Burnley, in east Lancashire, and I was surprised there were so many people at York who weren’t from the north, because I thought more people would do the same thing as me and stay local.”University of York’s favourite mallard is a dead duck, fear staffRead moreIn her first year, Morville found herself living with 16 students but only one from the north. So she and her friends set to work to reviveYork’s Northern Society, offering events including a northern-themed fancy dress pub crawl that included northern icons Wallace and Gromit and the Gallagher brothers, with Morville dressed as aPendle witch.In spring, the society is holding a “Yorkshire Olympics” of events including black pudding throwing. The society also means students from different parts of the north are learning more about each other’s regions, she said.View image in fullscreenLucy Morville: ‘We go to university and get fun made of our accents, so it’s time to fight back.’Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianAdelle Stripe, thenovelist and journalist born in York, said the existence of northern societies recognises that the north contains many distinctive identities “under one great rainy umbrella”, rather than a single experience.“The north is not homogenous. Politically and culturally, it carries many shades. It is not just pit villages, back-to-backs and post-industrial wastelands. It is also a place of wealth, verdant landscapes and architectural beauty.Language, history and economics vary enormously, even from North to South Yorkshire,” Stripe said.“In an elite university, you might feel under-represented, so if this fosters a sense of community for students who are experiencing isolation, then it’s to be encouraged. I don’t think northerners need a society to do that, though, we are quite capable of finding each other without such formality.”While many of the northern societies in the south seem keen to share their love of Greggs sausage rolls, and the logo of the London School of Economics northern societyis a yorkshire pudding, the University of Cambridge’s branch has a more serious side.Alongside a programme of events including punting, sponsored by an international law firm,Cambridge’s northern societystates: “We know that applying to Cambridge can feel daunting – especially if you have never met anyone who has done it before. Our goal is to change that.”A surveycommissioned by the Sutton Trust, a charity aiming to boost social mobility through education, found that more than half of northern students at UK universities said they had “been mocked, criticised or singled out in a social setting” because of their accent.‘Are we reyt?’: the course that aims to revive the Yorkshire dialectRead moreOne student from Newcastle said: “At interviews, I remember one boy from London asking a large group of people if they could ‘actually understand [my] accent’, which was pretty awful and not a nice first impression of university.” Others said they were asked by other students if their parents worked in coalmines.For Morville, York’s northern society is a way of turning the tables.“I feel like we go to university and get fun made of our accents, so it’s time to fight back. [Southerners] always ask if they can come to the society, and I say: ‘Not really, because it’s not really the point, it’s not the space we want it to be if there’s people from the south there.’”But that doesn’t stop southerners trying to sneak in: “There was one girl, I think she came with her mates, and she was doing a fake scouse accent the whole night. People from that area were there, and one of them clocked it. She was found out and she revealed that she was putting it on.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationStudentsNorth of EnglandUniversity of YorkAccess to universityLanguageYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Better news: cinemas are fighting back against AI with films anxious about the new tech, including Gore Verbinski’sGood Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die(13 February), in which a man apparently from the future (Sam Rockwell) wants to warn people about an incoming AI hellscape, followed byThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist(title says it all really), from the film-makers behind Everything Everywhere All at Once, in March. Then, later in the year, Luca Guadagnino unveilsArtificial, his biopic of Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.Catherine BrayBritpop“If it was all up to me then you know we’d be touring till the day we die … but UNFORTUNATELY it’s not,” musedLiam Gallagher recently on Xafter fielding questions aboutOasis’s plans for 2026, hinting perhaps that it was up to the boss (Noel). Still, rumours persist that the band are planning huge summer shows, likely at Knebworth, the apex point of their Britpop dominance back in 1996. A 30-year anniversary would make (financial) sense. Another fan of the Hertfordshire country estate – he played three shows there in 2003 – is Liam’s old foeRobbie Williams, who will attempt to tap into the fumes of reheated Britpop fever with February’s guitar-heavy album called – you guessed it! – Britpop. Featuring a picture on the cover of a noticeably refreshed Williams after he’d gatecrashed the Oasis camp at Glastonbury in 1995, complete with red Adidas tracksuit, bleached hair and missing tooth, it’s apparently the album he always wanted to make after being booted out of Take That. “It was the peak of Britpop,” he said recently of that time, “and a golden age for British music.” While Britpop (the movement) was marked by fierce chart rivalries, Williams delayed Britpop (the album) from its original October 2025 release date to avoid being bested by Taylor Swift.Michael CraggConfessionsMore than 20 years afterMadonna’s last truly great front-to-back album, 2005’s Confessions on a Dance Floor, the Instagram addict will release its sequel at some point this year. Having reunited with that album’s producer Stuart Price for 2023’s rejuvenating, hit-focused Celebration tour, the pair have been holed up in the studio seemingly ever since. (There was also a tease of Madonna in the studio with pop supremo Max Martin.) Fingers crossed for a conversation-changing killer first single – equal parts bonkers and undeniable – lashings of glittery, disco-adjacent electropop and the rightful return of Madonna: The Icon. Elsewhere, the confessional brand of pop Madonna helped pioneer in decades past is at its zenith, with revealing releases forthcoming from the likes ofLana Del Rey,Sky Ferreiraand ex-Little MixerLeigh-Annefollowing in the footsteps of Lily Allen and Rosalía’s very different, but equally brutal, breakup epics.MCDraculaProving its immortality, Bram Stoker’s classic has been adapted yet again, for both stage and screen. French film director Luc Besson brings usDracula(in cinemas now) as a gothic romance, starring body-horror connoisseur Caleb Landry Jones as the undead lover searching for 400 years for the reincarnation of his wife (Zoë Bleu). Christoph Waltz plays the stake-wielding priest chasing him across the globe. On stage, Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo will play all 23 roles in Kip Williams’sDracula(Noël Coward theatre, London, 4 February to 30 May). Williams’s screen-heavy stagings have had wild success, including the recent adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, with Sarah Snook playing all 26 roles. Now it’s the Wicked star’s turn to do the same, and leave her bloody mark on Stoker’s tale.Kate WyverEat the RichIn her celebrated Edinburgh show, Jade Franks turned the brutal culture shock and myriad humiliations she experienced as a working-class scouser at Cambridge into a merciless satire of privilege in the UK:Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates x)which transfers to London this month (Soho theatre, London, 12 to 31 January). If seeing wealthy elites brought down a peg or two is your cup of tea then Glen Powell inheritance caper movieHowto Makea Killingand Lee Sung Jin’s returning TV dramedy anthologyBeef(which this time revolves around a Korean billionaire) should both be something to savour.

Make sure to double check your ticket. Cole Escola’s riotous Broadway hitOh, Mary!(Trafalgar theatre, London, to 25 April), has arrived in the West End with Mason Alexander Park in this fervently embellished story about the life of Abraham Lincoln’s wife. A five-minute walk away at Charing Cross theatre, Bronagh Lagan directs John Ransom Phillips’sMrs President(23 January to 8 March), a straighter look at Mary’s life and her encounter with the first celebrity photographer. If you’d rather spend an evening seething in rage at the state of the world, try the $40m Mrs Trump documentaryMelania(in cinemas 30 January, then on Prime Video), made by disgraced director Brett Ratner, who denies multiple claims of sexual misconduct. Melania is on board as a producer, so it’s sure to be a clear-eyed, honest take.KWGlastonbury-shaped holeFor the first time since its post-Covid return in 2022, Worthy Farm is having a fallow year. With no Glastonbury in sight, there are a plethora of festival options still on sale and available to fill the music-shaped chasm in your summer. For fans of Glasto’s eclectic programming, Dorset’sWe Out Here(20 to 23 August) is a very capable substitute with headline sets from Stereolab, Ethio-jazz great Mulatu Astatke and Brazilian composer Arthur Verocai. When it comes to late-night partying, Lincolnshire’sLost Village(27 to 30 August) always promises a genre-spanning range of DJs in its labyrinthine wooded site, and further afield, Barcelona’sPrimavera Sound(3 to 6 June) has huge headliners to compete with the Pyramid Stage, including the Cure, Massive Attack and the xx.Ammar KaliaHeathcliffFresh from his turn as a disconcertingly hunky humanoid in Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein, Jacob Elordi will spend 2026 cementing his position as one of Hollywood’s few bona fide gen Z leading men. In the spring, he’ll front Ridley Scott’s post-apocalyptic thrillerThe Dog Stars(in cinemas 27 March), but first he reunites with Saltburn writer-director Emerald Fennell for her gleefully irreverent, erotic take onWuthering Heights(13 February). Starring opposite fellow Aussie Margot Robbie, all eyes will be on Elordi’s Heathcliff, whose transformation from rural waif to gentleman brute will be soundtracked by Charli xcx and bestowed upon the world just in time for Valentine’s Day.RAView image in fullscreenJust deserts … Zendaya in Dune.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyImaxTell me, O Muse, of the hero who wandered far and wide, searching for the best film format, before deciding Imax was the one. Yes, Christopher Nolan has filmed Homer’sOdyssey(17 July) Imax-style, with Matt Damon as Odysseus. Cinephiles will want to watch as the gods intended, on an Imax screen in an Imax cinema. Giant screens will also play host to Marvel’sAvengers: Doomsday(18 December) – though the more interesting battle for box office nerds will be the current sand v spandex booking conflict between the comic-book behemoth andDune: Part 3, slated for the same release date.CBJack ThorneThe prolific screenwriter has been at the vanguard of British television for more than a decade (his CV includes Skins, This Is England and The Virtues), but 2025 really was Thorne’s year thanks to a trio of big social-justice dramas: The Hack; Toxic Town; and, of course, the juggernaut that was Adolescence. That show made a star out of 16-year-old Owen Cooper; expect the unknown child cast of Thorne’s upcoming BBC adaptation ofLord of the Fliesto get similar career boosts. Yet he’s also made time to pen a romantic drama for two of our best actors: Channel 4’sFallingfeatures Keeley Hawes as a nun who becomes infatuated with Paapa Essiedu’s priest.RAK-popLast year was the year animated film KPop Demon Hunters dominated Netflix and with its wildly popular soundtrack, nominated for five Grammys; in 2026 there is plenty more K-pop to come.

Ascendent K-pop groupNewJeans,meanwhile, were embroiled in a legal battle with their record label in 2025, but pending an imminent resolution their comeback is slated for later in the new year.AKLegacy sequelsTime was, a sequel meant part two of a self-contained film which did so exceptionally well at the box office that another story involving the same characters was unexpectedly in order. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, along came Jaws 2. Sequels are so normalised these days that we’re into Hollywood’s legacy sequel era: films that pick up the story years or even decades down the line. This year, examples are set to include28 Years Later: The Bone Temple(16 January),The Devil Wears Prada 2(1 May),Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man(cinemas 6 March, Netflix 20 March),Scream 7(27 February),Toy Story 5(19 June) andThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping(20 November) – OK, so technically a legacy prequel, that last one.CBMillerArthur Miller is hot property. Ivo Van Hove’s West End production ofAll My Sons(Wyndham’s theatre, London, to 7 March)has already been showered with five-star reviews. At London’s Young Vic, Jordan Fein (Fiddler on the Roof) brings us Miller’s lesser-knownBroken Glass(21 February to 18 April). A devastating portrait of antisemitism in 1930s America, it’s a story of dislocation and defiance, as a woman’s body stops working in response to reading about Kristallnacht. The Crucible, which premiered at London’s Royal Court 70 years ago, continues to fuel new stories, and now in the same space, Danya Taymor directs Kimberly Belflower’s seven-time Tony-nominated take on Miller’s best-loved play,John ProctorIs the Villain(20 March to 25 April) as a class discuss The Crucible in the context of their own knotty lives. Perhaps Miller’s most famous play,Death of a Salesman, receives a new staging at Liverpool’s Everyman theatre this autumn (19 September to 10 October). And looking further ahead, Millermania is set to reach fever pitch in 2027, with Paul Mescal set to star as Biff Loman in the same play at London’s NationalTheatre.KWView image in fullscreen(Clockwise from top left) Hamnet; Limp Bizkit; Rihanna; Michael; Dear England.Composite: FilmMagic; Helen Murray; Lionsgate; BBC/Studio Lambert/Cody Burridge/Matt Burlem; Marc Brenner; RedfernsNu-metalPerhaps it makes sense that late-90s nu-metal – all rock choruses, rap verses and nostalgic frat party energy – is continuing its comeback in 2026. Who doesn’t have some rage that needs exorcising? Besides, those baggy, oversized clothes and backwards snapbacks are a forgiving look for the OG fans hoping to cover expanding waistlines and male pattern baldness. Nu-metal’s influence was seen in the aesthetic of recent album campaigns by the likes of Fontaines DC and 5 Seconds of Summer, while this year sees the return of the genre’s heavyweights in arenas, stadiums and fields across the country. At the start of the summer, Rollin’ hitmakersLimp Bizkitheadline the UK’s premiere rock festival, Download (10 to 14 June), despite their last album, 2021’s Still Sucks, missing the UK Top 75.

It’s also possible that the big winners have already completed their tour of the multiplexes: Ryan Coogler’s Sinners was well liked by critics, while Wicked: For Good made the kind of money Oscar finds difficult to completely ignore, while the muscular heft of One Battle After Another seems locked on for Academy approval.CBView image in fullscreenArt attack … Catherine Zeta Jones in Kill Jackie.Photograph: Unai MateoPrestige TrashHow do you like your TV thrillers?

While ticket pricing is finally being overhauled, expect a slew of big cultural moments in 2026 to mean long queues. Semi-retired superstarRihannawas rumoured to have been returning to UK stadiums last year before getting pregnant, so if that anticipated comeback has been pushed to 2027 then tickets will be like gold dust this year.

Long before playing Max in Stranger Things, Sink was performing on Broadway, and she recently impressed there in John Proctor Is the Villain. Juliet will be her West End debut. Jupe plays her Romeo in this anticipated production by Robert Icke, on at Harold Pinter theatre, 16 March to 6 June.KWSNL UKThere are many reasons why the British version of Saturday Night Live may flounder: we won’t get the endless stream of uber-famous hosts; we don’t have the improv tradition; we as a nation simply will not tolerate the bloated, brash and sweatily unfunny skits that make up the bulk of the US original. Yet there is cause for cautious optimism. Firstly, we have actually successfully recreated the iconic sketch show on British soil before (see: late-1980s star-maker Saturday Live, ft. everyone from Harry Enfield to Hugh Laurie). Secondly, the head writer’s job has been given to Daran Johnson, one-third of transcendentally funny and criminally underrated sketch troupe Sheeps.RAView image in fullscreenFringe concern … Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Cody Burridge/Matt BurlemTraitorsBy now, two episodes in, you’re probably already immersed in the latest series ofThe Traitors, or regular-person Traitors as we may now have to call it after the success of the Celebrity variant last year.

While an Abba-style hologram Queen show featuring Freddie Mercury may be in its early stages – “I’m very taken with the idea that we can be the original Queen again,” mused the band’s Brian May last November – the band’s one-time collaborator Michael Jackson will have (a section of) his life immortalised via delayed Antoine Fuqua biopic,Michael(24 April). Chef, author and the so-called rock star of the culinary world Anthony Bourdain, who died in 2018, will also be given the biopic treatment in 2026 via A24’sTony. Bourdain will be played by breakout star of The Holdovers Dominic Sessa, with Antonio Banderas and Emilia Jones co-starring in a film set during the life-changing summer of 1976.MCVideo PodsWhen television was in its infancy, it was the cheap cousin of cinema, often consisting of some blokes in a room having a chat – no fancy sets, minimal editing and modest production values. These days a certain level of polish is expected. But what if you could make talk TV without so much fuss? Just some blokes – or maybe even some women! – in a room, having a chat. And lo, the video podcast was born, giving the likes ofJoe Roganthe chance to grow massive followings on a budget and without all that boring factchecking a broadcaster might require. Now even the TV guys are pivoting to pods, with the likes of Netflix embracing the fact that if people are looking at their phones half the time that they’re consuming streamer content, there’s no need to spend all that money making TV look super-flash: 2026 will see the fruits of a deal with Spotify to bring the most popular of its video podcasts, includingThe Rewatchables,The Big Picture,Recipe ClubandSerial Killersto Netflix.Televisionis dead, long live television.CBWorld CupLet’s face it, it probably won’t be coming home – but football definitely will be all over our screens this summer.

Another inspirational boss returns in the long-awaited fourth season ofTed Lasso, while garlanded director Molly Manning Walker makes her TV debut with Channel 4’sMajor Players, about two teenage girls who start a football team.KWeX-pop starsWhat do pop starsAriana Grande,AdeleandCharli xcxhave in common? None of them actually seem super keen on being pop stars any more. Yes Grande has a tour booked for this year – her first since 2019, including 10 dates at London’s O2 (15 Aug to 1 September) – but she’s already suggested it will be her final one, with her acting stint in the Wicked duology swiftly followed this year by a starring role in Meet the Parents sequelFockerin-Law(25 November). Adele, who announced an “incredibly long break” from music in 2024, looks to be making good on her statement and will make her acting debut in Tom Ford’sCry to Heaven. Having achieved top-tier status in the pop pantheon with Brat, it’s Charli xcx who seems most keen on relocating to Hollywood, however. She has six films in various states of production for this year, while three others,100 Nights of Hero(6 February),ErupcjaandSacrifice,arrived at festivals in late 2025. She will briefly resume her pop-star form inThe Moment, a mockumentary about a very xcx-ish figure’s headlining tour, directed by her longtime collaborator Aidan Zamiri and based on an original idea by Charli herself.MCYBAsThree decades on from their emergence as the unruly group of artists seeking to disrupt the stuffy British art world, the YBAs are back and indulging in 90s nostalgia in 2026. The Tate Modern in London is set to host the largest retrospective of YBATracey Emin’s work (27 February to 31 August), including hits such as The Bed and Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, alongside her moving recent paintings and never-before-seen early works.Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Showat V&A Dundee (3 April to 7 January 2027) is set to provide an innovative look at the development of modern fashion with landmark pieces including Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Maison Margielas. At London’s Tate Britain, meanwhile, the entire decade of the 90s is under examination (1 October to 14 February 2027) with a new mixed-media show. Photographs fromJuergen Tellerexpose the celebrity fascination around the YBAs and their partying cohort, while works fromDamien Hirstshowcase the trajectory of their artistry.AKZendayaThe bankable star can currently claim an incredible sum total of $3.9bn box office returns on her films to date, including the Dune movies, The Greatest Showman and three Spider-Men. This should be the year she tops $5bn, with credits including Christopher Nolan’s Odyssey, a third Dune and romanceThe Drama(3 April) opposite Robert Pattinson. This year also sees the Euphoria star her potentially tie the knot with long-term squeeze Tom Holland, though only a fool would claim to know exactly what’s happening there. At the time of going to press, the rumour mill is running with everything from “they’re already married” to “they’ve already split” to “the reception will be at the Nag’s Head in Walthamstow on 12 March”.CBExplore more on these topics2026 culture previewTheatreTelevisionGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The year was 2019, and I was test-driving a Tesla; while I was ambling off the forecourt, the PR told me jauntily that the windscreen was made of a material that would protect the driver from biohazards. I hit the brakes. “Youwhat? What kind of biohazard? Like, a war?” She misconstrued me, thinking I intended to go and find some toxic waste site to see if it worked, and said: “I’m not sure it’s operational in the press fleet.”That wasn’t my question: rather, what kind of a world wasTeslapreparing for? One so unstable that an average (though affluent) private citizen would do well to prepare for a chemical weapons attack? What model of consumption was this, that the rich used their wealth to prepare for the mayhem their resource-capture would unleash, while the less-rich prepared slightly less well? Was Musk trying to bring to market the apocalypse planning that elites had already embarked on? Because if he was, then it was possible that he was not a great guy. And that turned out to be correct.Tesla’s market share in Europedropped precipitously in the EUin November, from 2.1% to 1.4% of new cars sold, which is likely to be consumers turning away from what Tesla represents, even the ones that agree with Musk. At an anti-Tesla protest at the side of a dual carriageway earlier this year, we got honks of support from actual Tesla drivers. Nobody buying one of these cars pre-2024 would have signed up to look as though they were supporting the owner’s agenda, which gets more and more strident. Meanwhile, the Chinese carmaker BYD recorded the fastest sales growth in November, and China’s state-backed SAIC, which owns MG, recorded sales growth of 26%. Hybrids accounted for nearly half of all sales. People haven’t fallen out of love with electric cars.View image in fullscreenChina’s BYD has opened an EV factory in Rayong, Thailand.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersThe arguments for and against EVs and hybrids are a neat distillation of a conversation we should be having constantly about all steps towards net zero. From a purist’s perspective, EVs are a red herring; we should be moving away from individual vehicles altogether, making lifestyle and infrastructure and 15-minute city adaptations so that we don’t need cars – making an emotional leap to the car as a purely practical item that a whole street could share, rather than something that conveys status or self-reliance and as such has to be held privately. We will not get to where we need to be by staying this dumb. There’s also an unavoidable practical dimension: the batteries needrare metals, which means that making EVs creates yet more emissions.On the other hand, EVs offer clear proof that nobody is wedded to a fossil fuel lifestyle if something better comes along. And once something marginally better comes along, it constantly improves. No amount of corporate lobbying or teething trouble will stop people swapping out a worse thing for a better thing.And electric vehicles are an incredible story of improvement. When Ifirst reviewed a Nissan Leaf, it had to be delivered on a flatbed lorry, because the range was so tiny they couldn’t trust it would have enough charge after going 50 miles. Now the most basic model will go almost 300 miles. Solid-state batteries are going into trial next year with the promise of 500 miles on a 10-minute charge. I have severe misgivings about technological utopianism around climate breakdown: the hand-wavy insistence that human ingenuity will solve everything is often just a way to gate off collective energy and activism. But the advances in EVs outpace expectations by such a distance that it would be churlish not to notice.Tesla’s EU sales slump continues as Chinese rivals thriveRead moreComically, the measure the petrolheads used to love, the macho bit of driving – nought to 60 – is better on electric vehicles, because they have fewer moving parts, less energy loss and deliver instant maximum torque. Theinfrastructure is better; public charging is getting more ubiquitous and private charging cheaper.Maybe if we could be nuanced enough to acknowledge that we all need to change, but we can also take the win when it’s right there; that we all need to move past the market, but that market forces sometimes still work – that would have ramifications beyond cars. But the most important take-home is: don’t letElon Musktaint the EV revolution, and don’t let him turn it into something other than what it is. It is not the story of imperilled individuals, hiding behind their top-dollar reinforced windscreens. Collective ingenuity has advanced what’s realistic, and realists do the rest.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsOpinionElon MuskTeslaMotoringEthical and green livingTravel and transportcommentShareReuse this content"

Let me own that – I found it a bit difficult to get the dialogue flowing. That might have been a general first-time interaction thing.

It homogenises society, mixes communities up and avoids the creation of ghettoes that aren’t diverse. I don’t think it levels out society, but at least if people are living next to each other, they’re more likely to treat each other as human beings. It’s not changing the society we live in and it’s not changing inequality.RupertThe conversation flowed more easily after we discovered we’d both lived internationally; we had things in common. When we got to gentrification, his take was systemic, whereas mine was more phenomenological – I was associating it with the end result: the eye-rolling predictability of gentrified places, the same-y blocks of flats, the Tesco Express. I live in Worthing, which now has a Gail’s, testament to having climbed the coffee shop ladder.PaulHis argument was you lose communities that have a unique flavour.

The singer Chappell Roan, responding toBardot’s passingat 91, posted a photo of the actor in her beehived prime on Instagram, saying she had inspired her song Red Wine Supernova and writing\": “Rest in peace Ms Bardot.”The following day, the post was hastily deleted. “Holy shit,”Roan wroteon her Instagram Stories, “I did not know all that insane shit Ms. Bardot stood for obvs I do not condone this. very disappointing to learn.”Which insane shit, Roan didn’t specify, but in truth there is plenty to choose from. The iconic mid-century image of the actor may have remained frozen in time for some, but in the real world, the persona of Bardot had long since curdled into something much uglier.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in A Very Private Affair, 1962.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLater-life Bardot was a passionate defender of animal rights, true, but she was also a committed, enthusiastic racist, who wrote of Muslims: “They slaughter women and children, our monks, our civil servants, our tourists and our sheep, one day they’ll slaughter us, and we’ll have deserved it.” Elsewhere, she wrote: “Illegal immigrants … desecrate and storm our churches, transforming them into human pigsties, defecating behind the altar, urinating against the columns, spreading their nauseating stench beneath the sacred vaults of the choir.”These views didn’t just get Bardot “cancelled”, in the modern parlance – they saw her convicted of incitement to racial hatred, five times. She also referred to gay people as “fairground freaks” and denounced#MeToo victimsas “hypocritical, ridiculous, and pointless”. And yet, after her death, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, called her the “legend of the century”, writing that “Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom”. It’s one way of looking at it.In a censorious climate in which even the manner of Roan’s deletion and retraction won hervitriol from some fans, contemporary cancel culture seems ill-equipped to respond to a woman who described the Tamil community on the island of Réunion as “natives” with “savage genes” who carried “reminiscences of cannibalism”. How can history square the contradiction of Bardot, who in her long life was both a symbol of sexual emancipation and a mouthpiece for toxicity and hate?View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot supporting the French animal protection society in Gennevilliers, Paris, in 1982.Photograph: Duclos/APCertainly, in France, no one can claim to have been shocked by Bardot’s politics, and many of her obituaries there have been clear-eyed about what she represented. Bardot “embodied racial hatred”, wrote Clément Guillou inLe Monde, and was “an exception in French culture – the only celebrity to openly defend the far right”. For more than three decades until her death, Bardot was married to Bernard d’Ormale, a senior adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front party. (Le Pen would write approvingly that Bardot was “nostalgic for a clean France”.)Brigitte Bardot, French screen legend, dies aged 91Read moreThe French dailyLibération, too, noted that the actor’s love for animals – which won her for a time, in the anglophone world at least, an enduring image as a dotty cat lady – had “gradually shifted towards an identity-based discourse where animal rights became intertwined with a racist view of France”. As a mouthpiece for the radical right in recent decades, “Brigitte Bardot no longer bothered with nuance” but lived as a recluse in her Saint-Tropez estate, “surrounded by animals and her temper”.“It is true that in France, because she was very vocal about a number of issues, she’s been much more present in her contemporary [political] incarnation than she was in the UK, where she was still mostly seen as a film star and global celebrity,” saysGinette Vincendeau, a professor emeritus of film studies at King’s College London, who has written widely on Bardot and French cinema.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot with her husband, Bernard d’Ormale, a senior adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, on a carriage tour through Vienna in May 2002.Photograph: Herbert P Oczeret/EPAVincendeau experienced the tension over the actor’s image this week, when she was asked to revisit her appreciation of Bardot’s contribution to French cinema and culture,publishedby the British Film Institute, to add more detail of her race-hate convictions. She had not intended to minimise Bardot’s views, says Vincendeau, “but for me, we would not be talking about Brigitte Bardot’s [politics], if she hadn’t been the film star and, to me, a very interesting pioneer figure in the representation of women – and I think that still needs to be celebrated”.Bardot never considered herself a feminist – “she came from a very privileged background and there’s a kind of entitlement to her attitude” – but she was nonetheless a hugely significant figure in the history of female sexual liberation in France, says Vincendeau. French women did not get the right to vote until 1944, she points out, and it remained a deeply conservative country even afterSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex was published five years later.In this context, the impact in 1956 of And God Created Woman, starring a 22-year-old Bardot as a voluptuous orphan who initiates and enjoys sex, was explosive, says Vincendeau. “The originality and the modernity of her figure was that she was not just a sex bomb. As a feminist, of course I’m absolutely aware that [this film] and all her subsequent films portrayed her body as an erotic fantasy for the male gaze. But the unique aspect of Bardot, and why she’s such an interesting figure for feminists, is that she was also a woman who expressed her own desire. She was not just reacting.”View image in fullscreenBardot, centre, is led into a court in Paris in December 2008 to face accusations of inciting racial hatred.Photograph: ReutersThe character of Juliette was created by a man – Bardot’s husband and the film’s writer-director, Roger Vadim – but when she left him forher co-star in the film, Jean-Louis Trintignant, she became associated with the same sexual wantonness, just as she was becoming a huge star. A figure of lust for men, she was also a fantasy for women, argues Vincendeau, “because there was no legal contraception or abortion so she represented a dream of emancipation for women, and a very powerful one”.“Brigitte Bardot was a prodigious catalyst: with her, we went from a withered society, riddled with moralism … to [thestudent revolutions of] May ’68,” Émilie Giaime, a lecturer in contemporary history and media studies at the Catholic Institute of Paris,said this week. “She was the fuel for this metamorphosis of French society and the new aspirations of young people.” The unconventionality that Bardot represented in the 1950s may be a long way from the inclusive sex positivity of a contemporary queer artist such as Roan, but there’s an argument that one helped create the conditions for the other.View image in fullscreenBardot in And God Created Woman, 1956.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/VestronBardot may have embraced the outspoken liberty that her stardom offered, but the crazed “Bardomania” that resulted also came at an enormous cost. She was the first target of the emerging paparazzi culture, and endured constant, wild harassment, including being forced to give birth at home in 1960 (after a pregnancy she had been clear she did not want but was unable to terminate) while her house was besieged by photographers.France’s strict, present-day privacy laws emerged in part in response to Bardot’s awful experience; Giaime argues that the trauma of this period may have helped drive her to a reclusive misanthropy after she quit acting altogether in 1973.Bardot enjoyed pushing people’s buttons, says Dr Sarah Leahy, a reader in French and film at Newcastle University – “She was a provocateur, and she enjoyed controversy” – nonetheless, her Islamophobia was unquestionably sincere. “She didn’t censor herself; she said what she thought, whether we agree with it or not, whether we consider it to be abhorrent.”Leahy has taught courses on the impact of And God Created Woman for years; recently, she says, “I’d say that there’s been a real change in students’ responses to that film. It’s really interesting. I guess it’s more difficult for them to access what that image would have been in the 50s, knowing what they know now about her.”Bardot, she adds, was “a figure from a different time”. Her contemporaries included actors like Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, women who died young and are frozen in another lifetime. Unlike them, she lived long and grew angrier.“When you start to interrogate a myth, you expose the fact that it’s impossible to have a single coherent meaning from somebody’s life, especially somebody like her, who’s done so many different things,” says Leahy. The sex object, the role model, the compassionate campaigner, the racist. Bardot was all of them."

On Sunday he warned Rodríguezto heed US wishes. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” hetold the Atlantic.Rodríguez, 56, had on Saturday pledged fealty to Maduro and condemned his capture as an “atrocity” but the New York Times reported that Trump officials several weeks ago identified the technocrat as a potential successor and business partner partly on the basis of her relationship with Wall Street and oil companies.View image in fullscreenA TV and telephone tower destroyed in the US raid on Caracas on Saturday.Photograph: Maxwell Briceno/ReutersThe US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, spoke to Rodríguez, who told him “‘we’ll do whatever you need’”, Trump told reporters. “She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn’t have a choice.”Months in planning, over in two and a half hours: how the US snatched MaduroRead moreIn the capital, Caracas, senior government and military figures demanded the return of Maduro but pledged support for Rodríguezas a stand-in leader and called for a return to normality.“I call on the people ofVenezuelato resume their activities of all kinds, economic, work and education, in the coming days,” Vladimir Padrino López, the defence minister, said in a televised address.Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, said his father’s supporters are more resolved than ever to support the ousted president, according to an audio shared on social media.“They will not see us weak,” Maduro Guerra said. “The president, Nicolás Maduro, will return. He will return. It’s been a day of shock, of course, we’re all in shock.“But we will take to the streets, we will convene the people, we will unite, we will form a nucleus around our highest political-military command with maximum unity.”Venezuelan opposition figure Edmundo González Urrutia said Maduro’s ousting was “an important step, but not enough” to return the crisis-hit nation to normal.“This moment represents an important step, but it is not enough,” he said in a post on Instagram from exile in Spain.Trump said the US may intervene in other countries. “We do need Greenland, absolutely.” Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, posted a social media picture of Greenland painted in the colours of the US flag, and the word “soon”, prompting a protest from Greenland’s prime minister.In around of TV interviewsRubio downplayed the possibility of invasion or occupation of Venezuela. “There’s not a war. I mean, we are at war against drug trafficking organisations, not a war against Venezuela. We don’t have US forces on the ground,” he told NBC.Troops were in Caracas for two hours in a “law enforcement function” that did not require congressional approval, he said. “This was not an invasion. This was not an extended military operation.”The US will keep a “quarantine” around Venezuela to block the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions to sustain “leverage” over Maduro’s successor, said Rubio. “We are going to make our assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly.”The US had “multiple levers of influence” to respond if Venezuela’s leaders did not make the “right” decisions, said Rubio. He said the Cuban government – Venezuela’s main ally – was a “huge problem” and in a “lot of trouble” but declined to elaborate.Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, also rowed back on Trump’s vow to run Venezuela, saying there were “still a lot of questions to be answered” about what happens next.Trump’s attack on Venezuela without alerting Congress tests limits of executive powerRead moreThe governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay said in a joint statement that US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”. Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the attack but refused to condemn it.AllEU countries except Hungary issued a statementcalling for restraint by “all actors” and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in order to “restore democracy”.In Caracas some shops and cafes reopened in a semblance of normality while authorities counted the cost of Saturday’s raid.Large queues formed outside stores in Venezuela’s capital as anxious residents stocked up on basic supplies, apprehensive about what the future might bring and the possibility – suggested by Trump – that there could be a “second wave” of attacks.“It’s the same everywhere, there are queues in the supermarkets, there are queues in the bakeries, queues at the pharmacy,” said one 71-year-old pensioner who was one of 20 people lined up outside a small family grocery market in north-east Caracas on Sunday morning.“There’s so much uncertainty because people don’t know what might happen in the coming days and nobody wants to see another situation like the early hours of Saturday or to be caught with their pants down and an empty fridge,” added the man, who asked not to be named.His 68-year-old wife, who also declined to give her name, fought back tears as she pondered Venezuela’s latest crisis. “I just hope things return to normal. That there can be dialogue. That we can have peaceful lives. That there is no big disaster and that nobody dies,” she said.Outside one of Venezuela’s largest supermarket chains in Petare, on the east side of Caracas, a young couple waited in a 100-person-long line outside a supermarket in order to stock up on milk, butter and flour. So many people had flocked there that supermarket workers were letting in shoppers in groups.“[I feel] angry,” said the 23-year-old woman, who gave only her first name, Sauriany. “They don’t have the right to meddle like this in another country and to do whatever they like,” she said of the US raid.Her 24-year-old partner, a lineworker called Leandro, said the streets near their house were deserted as parents kept their children at home for fear of what might happen over the coming days. “There are so many rumours – that they [the Americans] might return … It was terrible on Saturday. All those explosions. The planes,” he said.In neighbouring Colombia there was deep unease too, with its president, Gustavo Petro, ordering 30,000 troops to its eastern border with Venezuela in case there was violence or a sudden influx of refugees.Padrino López said “a large part” of Maduro’s security team, as well as soldiers and civilians, died. One unverified report estimated the number killed at 40. The minister said the armed forces will resist “imperial aggression” and ensure independence and sovereignty despite the “cowardly kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.The White House shared footage of the deposed dictator handcuffed and doing a “perp walk” to Drug Enforcement Administration offices in New York before being taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro at the offices of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York on Saturday.Photograph: @RapidResponse47/ReutersAuthorities unsealed a four-count indictment that charges Maduro with narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. It also charges Flores, their son and two Venezuelan officials and an alleged leader of Tren de Aragua, a gang the Trump administration has designed a terrorist organisation. Maduro is due to appear in a Manhattan federal court on Monday for arraignment.The prosecution will deepen the humiliation felt by Maduro loyalists and complicate the balancing act faced by his successor.Rodríguez, who served as vice-president and oil minister until her boss’s removal, must juggle Washington’s demands for oil and security guarantees with a regime that retains vestiges of the socialism and anti-imperialism of its late founder, Hugo Chávez.The powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, pledged loyalty to Maduro but tacitly backed the interim president. “Here, the unity of the revolutionary force is more than guaranteed,” he said in an audio clip released by the ruling PSUV party.The Trump administration’s apparent satisfaction with regime tweak, rather than regime change, has dismayed those Venezuelans who hoped Maduro’s downfall would usher in democracy.‘It’s an opportunity’: joy and wariness among US Venezuelans after Maduro toppledRead moreTrump was dismissive about the opposition leaderMaria Corina Machado, the Nobel peace prize winner who mobilisedEdmundo González’s winning presidential campaign last year, and said she lacked “support” in Venezuela. Millions of Venezuelans revere Machado but she is loathed by the military hierarchy that props up the regime.View image in fullscreenChavistasmarch in Caracas on Sunday to protest against the capture of President Maduro.Photograph: Ronald Pena R/EPARubio said the US wanted a transition to democracy but ruled out elections in the short term and said those in charge of Venezuela’s military and police apparatus needed to decide in which direction they go. “We hope they will chose a different direction than the one Nicolás Maduro picked. Ultimately we hope this leads to a holistic transition.”In Caracas joggers and cyclists reappeared on streets but residents expressed nervousness and uncertainty about the future.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroMarco RubioAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But it was also months in the planning.Critical to Operation Absolute Resolve was the work of the CIA and other US intelligence agencies. From as early as August, their goal was to establish Maduro’s “pattern of life”, or as Gen Dan Caine, the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, described it, to “understand how he moved, where he lived, where he travelled, what he ate, what he wore, what were his pets”.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro had regularly changed his sleeping location.Photograph: Ariana Cubillos/APAs the US built up its military presence in the Caribbean from September, Maduro had tightened his personal security in an effort to evade capture. Gone were the well-trailed public speeches. He changed his sleeping location regularly – using between six to eight places to spend the night,according to the New York Times.map of part of VenezuelaThe president also relied even more heavily on Cuban counterintelligence and bodyguards, more trusted than Venezuelans, with the latter not allowed to use mobile phones. Yet such measures were not enough. On Friday evening, as the weather was finally clear enough for the US operation go ahead, Maduro’s location was fixed at a compound on Fuerte Tiuna, a key military base in Caracas.‘Venezuela helped us a lot’: US’s capture of Nicolás Maduro stirs anxiety in CubaRead moreSpy drones were part of how the CIA monitored Maduro, but after his capture on Saturday the agency also surprisingly briefed it had a human source inside the Venezuelan government – a bold statement given it could risk leading to a person being discovered – though also a way, perhaps, of undermining the confidence Maduro’s successors will have in their own security system.As many as a quarter of all US navy warships had been in the Caribbean since November, bolstered by the arrival of the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, with about 4,000 sailors and aircrew onboard. But despite the nearby deployment, on the night of the operation the aim of theUS militarywas to achieve tactical surprise and air dominance.View image in fullscreenOne of the helicopters believed to be carrying Maduro and Flores arriving at the Westside heliport in New York City on Saturday.Photograph: Jeenah Moon/ReutersThough some preliminary flights and other manoeuvres were inevitable, the final go order was given by the US president,Donald Trump, at 10.46pm eastern time, or 11.46pm in Caracas. The first step was to clear an air corridor – by smashing Venezuela’s aviation and air defences – for the helicopters that would carry the elite Delta Force troops tasked with snatching Maduro from his bed.Why has the US captured Venezuela’s president and what happens next?Read moreIt had been considered that Venezuela had a reasonably capable military by regional standards. It had used its oil wealth to buy two squadrons of Russian Su-30 jets, plus S-300 and Buk missile and air-defence systems. But, when it came to the moment of truth, the Russian kit was easily defeated, a reminder that the talk of asymmetric threats to western weapons systems can easily be exaggerated.Airbases and communications centres were bombed, probably by Tomahawk cruise missiles and AGM-88 Harm anti-radiation weapons, designed specifically to detect and destroy air-defence systems. There were also reports of F-35 fighter jets bombing Venezuelan fighters on the tarmac, once the air defence was suppressed. In total more than 150 US aircraft were involved in the night raid.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from La Carlota airport on Saturday after the US Delta Force raid.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APTrump also boasted that power in Caracas had been largely turned off “due to a certain expertise that we have”, a potential allusion to a cyber-attack. City residents did report electricity cuts after the first explosions were heard and satellite imagery showed a power station bombed at Fuerte Tiuna and it is possible that the cause was the kinetic military action, rather than a covert or cyber-attack.After taking off, the Delta Force team flew “at 100ft above the water”, according to Caine, to evade radar detection. Caracas is not far from the coast, about 10 miles away, making the flight time relatively brief, though in between are mountains, which the general said helped the incoming helicopters “hiding in the clutter” until they reached the capital city itself.One video filmed from Caracasshowed nine helicopters – modified Black Hawks and double-rotor Chinooks – flying in formation across the city to Fuerte Tiuna. None were hit or damaged by Venezuelan air defence or aircraft, so successful the suppression operation had been, but as they approached Maduro’s compound at 2.01am they came under gunfire – and a single helicopter was damaged, though still flyable.Again, the US military had heavily prepared for what would be the critical moments. A replica of Maduro’s compound at the Fuerte Tiuna base had been built in the US, its plan and security apparently known to the Americans. The Delta Force team had a blow torch to get through the steel doors and a hostage negotiator from the FBI in case Maduro locked himself away and refused to surrender.It went almost as planned. Gun battles broke out as the Delta Force team was on the ground. A large part of Maduro’s security team was killed, Venezuela’s defence minister said on Sunday. Venezuelan officials said at least 40 people had died around the country. No US soldiers were killed, though a handful were wounded.The Guardian view on the US seizure of Maduro: Trump has turned the world’s superpower into a rogue state | EditorialRead moreThe president, in his last moments in power, had tried to run to a safe room as dozens of Delta Force soldiers arrived. According to Trump, Maduro had got to its protective door but he could not close it. “He got bum rushed so fast,” the US president said after Maduro was quickly captured.All that was necessary was to take Maduro and Flores out of the country. The helicopters, covered by fighter jets from above, crossed back into the Caribbean at 4.29am, nearly two and a half hours after first arriving at Fuerte Tiuna, before initially depositing them on the USS Iwo Jima assault ship.View image in fullscreenMaduro was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York on Saturday.Photograph: Laura Thompson/ShutterstockOn its own terms, as a military operation, it was undoubtedly a successful, though naked exercise of US power. But it is far from clear it will allow theUS to take control of the countryor lead to a transformation of Venezuela – while the wider political ramifications cannot be forecast. Matthew Savill, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: “The Americans have removed a couple.

That right at the start of the year they’d bomb our country while everyone was asleep?” he asked.View image in fullscreenColombian military in Cúcuta at the border crossing with Venezuela on Saturday.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“If I thought it would improve the country I’d welcome it,” Leandro added, as shoppers were allowed into the overcrowded supermarket in small groups. “But I don’t believe this will happen. If they wanted peace, this isn’t the way to achieve it.”Similarly confused sentiments could be heard all over Caracas on Sunday as its 3 million citizens came to terms with thetraumatic nocturnal blitz on their city– a move the governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay warned set “an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security”.“It’s all so distressing,” said Gabriel Vásquez, a 29-year-old video-maker, recalling how he had been woken by the sound of a “gigantic” explosion at about 2am on Saturday and how his community in central Caracas was plunged into darkness as aircraft circled overhead.“I thought that any time my house could get bombed too,” said Vásquez, whose neighbourhood was still in the dark on Sunday. “We have no water, no electricity, no phone reception – nothing,” he complained.Julio Pimentel, a 33-year-old designer, said his electricity and water supplies had also been cut but admitted he had been surprised by the number of people out on the streets “considering the situation we’re in”. “Supermarkets and pharmacies are very, very crowded,” Pimentel said.There was scant sign of citizens celebrating Maduro’s downfall, something locals attributed to fear that his regime –which remains in power despite his arrest– might crack down and a deep-rooted sense that little had actually changed as a result of the US intervention.Delcy Rodríguez strikes defiant tone but must walk tightrope as Venezuela’s interim leaderRead moreOn Sunday, the head of the armed forces, Vladimir Padrino López, announced that military chiefs had recognised the vice-president,Delcy Rodríguez, as Venezuela’s acting president after the “cowardly kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Trump has also indicated he is prepared to deal with Rodríguez. “She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” he said after Saturday’s assault.“They’ve taken Maduro but the [Bolivarian] revolution isn’t over,” said Griselda Guzmán’s 71-year-old husband, Antonio, who like his wife, asked not to be identified with their real names. “We’re still in the same situation – they’ve just removed a pawn from the game of chess.”But many locals were quietly rejoicing at the demise ofa politician who many loathe for leading their oil-rich country into years of ruin and repressionsince he took power in 2013 and is widely believed to have stolen the 2024 presidential election.“We all get what we deserve. Maduro is a man who never put his hand on his heart to see the hardships of his country, to see his people going hungry,” said Griselda Guzmán, recalling the satisfying moment she had seen images of the dethroned dictator languishing in US custody. “When I saw him like that – handcuffed – I saw him for what he was: the biggest fool on Earth.”Guzmán said she believed Maduro had had “the opportunity of a lifetime” to leave power voluntarily after the 2024 vote, whichindependently verified voting data showed he had lostto the political movement led by the Nobel laureate María Corina Machado. “He could have handed over the presidency because he knew he hadn’t won,” she said.But instead Maduro chose to cling to power – and now he was behind bars in New York facing decades in a US jail.Her husband attributed the lack of public commemorations within Venezuela to a widespread belief that Saturday’s bombardment was merely the beginning of the latest rollercoaster chapter in Venezuela’s turbulent recent history. “Nothing has happened yet … this only started yesterday,” he predicted.Others were outraged by their president’s abduction and Trump’s decision to invade, a move many experts believe represents a flagrant violation of international law.“OK, there are problems – but they are Venezuelan problems and Venezuelans need to solve them,” said Sauriany. “They [the US] aren’t Venezuela’s owners. He [Trump] can’t just come along and say … he’s going to rule Venezuela because he’s removed Maduro.”Sauriany believed Rodríguez should be allowed to “carry on Maduro’s legacy” for the remainder of his six-year term, a prospect that appalls Venezuela’s opposition but seemed to become more likely after Trump’s comments on Saturday.In the weeks before Trump’s invasion, diplomats and experts warned thatsuch an attack could plunge Venezuela and the surrounding region into chaos or conflict. But on Sunday there was no immediate sign of violence erupting in the wake of Maduro’s toppling, or of a dangerous split in the military, but regional governments are on edge.View image in fullscreenThe Tienditas Bridge border between Venezuela and Colombia on Sunday.Photograph: Luisa González/ReutersColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, ordered 30,000 troops to its border with Venezuela to guard against possible turmoil.

The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom.”The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, has renewed fears of an American takeover of Greenland, as members of Trump’s Maga movement gleefully set their sights on the Danish territory after the attack in South America.Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday hours after Frederiksen’s remarks, Trump doubled down on his claim that Greenland should become part of the United States.“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, andDenmarkis not going to be able to do it,” Trump told reporters said when asked about the issue.Hours after theUS military operation in Venezuela, the rightwing podcasterKatie Miller– the wife of Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s powerful deputy chief of staff for policy –posted on Xa map of Greenland draped in the stars and stripes with the caption: “SOON.”Miller’s threat to annex the mineral-rich territory, which is part of the Nato alliance, drew outrage from Denmark and Greenland.Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called the post “disrespectful”. “Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights,” he wrote on X.But he also said: “There is neither reason for panic nor for concern. Our country is not for sale, and our future is not decided by social media posts.”Copenhagen’s ambassador to the US, Jesper Møller Sørensen, reposted Miller’s provocation with a “friendly reminder” of the longstanding defence ties between the two countries.“We are close allies and should continue to work together as such. US security is also Greenland’s and Denmark’s security,” he said. “The Kingdom of Denmark and the United States work together to ensure security in the Arctic.”He said Denmark had increased defence spending in 2025, committing $13.7bn (£10.2bn) “that can be used in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Because we take our joint security seriously.”He added: “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”Trump recently named Jeff Landry, the governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland. Landry, a former state attorney general, thanked Trump for his appointment in December, saying it was “an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US”.On Saturday, Landry welcomed Trump’s toppling of Maduro by force. “Having served as a sheriff’s deputy and AG, I have seen the devastating effects of illegal drugs on American families. With over 100k opioid-related deaths annually, I am grateful to see a President finally take real action in the war on drugs,” he posted on X.“Thank you @realDonaldTrump for holding individuals like Maduro accountable.”Since taking office a year ago, Trump has rattled European allies with his stated designs on Greenland, which is seen as strategically important for defence and as a future source of mineral wealth. It is home to the US’smost northerly military base, at Pituffik, which Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance,visited in March.The US president hasrefused to rule out military actionto gain control of the territory at a time when the US, China and Russia are jockeying for power in the Arctic, a prospect that has triggered widespread condemnation and disquiet on the island itself.“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly,” Trump told the US broadcaster NBC in May when asked about a potential takeover by force.“Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”You cannot annex other countries, Danish and Greenlandic leaders tell TrumpRead moreIn response to a constant drumbeat of threats against the territory, the Danish defence intelligence service last monthlabelled the US a security riskin a dramatic change in transatlantic relations.The prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Mette Frederiksen and Nielsen,said at the time: “We have said it very clearly before. Now we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law … You cannot annex other countries.”The vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US,according to a poll in January. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.Jennifer Kavanagh, the director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a thinktank that advocates restraint inUS foreign policy, said she had long dismissed Trump’s sabre-rattling toward Greenland.“Now I’m not so sure,” she said. “It wouldn’t be that hard for the US to put a couple hundred or a couple thousand troops inside of Greenland, and it’s not clear to me who could do anything about it.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policyTrump administrationRepublicansEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She was initially reported as missing.Her family said in a social media post on Sunday: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.”The post said her funeral is expected to take place in Paris later this week.According to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.The last 16 victims included two Swiss girls aged 15, a Swiss woman aged 22, a Swiss and French woman aged 24, two Italian girls aged 16 and 15, an Italian boy aged 16, a 22-year-old Portuguese woman, a 17-year-old Belgian girl, two French women aged 33 and 26, two French men aged 23 and 20, two French teenage boys aged 17 and 14, and a 15-year-old girl with French, British, and Israeli nationalities, police said.Those previously identified were 10 Swiss nationals, two Italians, one person with Italian-Emirati citizenship, one Romanian, one person from France and one from Turkey, Valais police said.The mother of Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss boy, confirmed that he was among those killed. “Our Arthur has departed to party in heaven,” Laetitia Brodard-Sitre said on her Facebook page. “Now we can start our mourning, knowing he is in peace.”Hundreds of people joined a silent procession through the upmarket resort town on Sunday to honour the victims of the catastrophe.After a service at the Chapelle St-Christophe, the sombre crowd filed silently out of the chapel to organ music. Some exchanged hugs and others applauded before joining the silent march up the hill to Le Constellation bar.View image in fullscreenMourners marched in silence from the chapel to the makeshift memorial.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAPeople in the dense procession walked in bright sunshine past shuttered stores. A stream of mourners and well-wishers deposited bouquets at a makeshift memorial piled with flowers, cuddly toys and other tributes.Applause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police and emergency services workers came up through the middle of the procession to be celebrated as heroes.“Through this tragic event, I believe we must all remember that we are all brothers and sisters in humanity,” said Véronique Barras, a local resident who knows grieving families. “It’s important to support each other, to hug each other and to move forward towards light.”In the crowd, Paola Ponti Greppi, an 80-year-old Italian who has a home in Crans-Montana, called for better safety checks in bars. “We need more safety in these places because it’s not the only place like this. Why didn’t the town do the proper checks? For me that’s terrible,” she said.During the hour-long mass, the bishop Jean-Marie Lovey said condolences had poured in from around the world, including from the pope.“Countless people join us – people whose hearts are broken,” Lovey told the congregation. “Many expressions of sympathy and solidarity reach us.“Pope Leo XIV joins in our sorrow. In a moving message, he expresses his compassion and his care for the victims’ families and strengthens the courage of all who are suffering.”View image in fullscreenPeople attend a memorial mass at the Chapelle St-Christophe.Photograph: Baz Ratner/APThe Rev Gilles Cavin spoke of the “terrible uncertainty” for families unsure if their loved ones were among the dead or still alive among the injured.“There are no words strong enough to express the dismay, anguish and anger of those who are affected in their lives today. And yet we are here, gathered, because silence alone is not enough,” he said.‘It has hit us very hard’: grief grips Crans-Montana as police identify more victimsRead moreSwitzerland will hold a national day of mourning on Friday, with church bells ringing across the country and a minute’s silence planned.“In this moment of reflection, everyone in Switzerland can personally remember the victims of the disaster,” the Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, told the Sonntagsblick newspaper.Investigators believe the fire started when sparkling candles wereheld too close to the ceilingof the venue’s basement level, the region’s chief prosecutor has said.Two people who ran the bar areunder criminal investigationon suspicion of offences including homicide by negligence, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, prosecutors said on Saturday. The announcement did not name the managers.Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.There were 119 people injured, including many with disfiguring wounds, and several were transferred toburns units in hospitals across Europeto assist Switzerland’s overwhelmed clinics.Authorities said the severity of the victims’ burns had required the use of DNA samples and dental records to help identify the bodies.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Many of the new arrivals are vulnerable and arrive in the UK traumatised.Under new powers, officers will be entitled to make arrivals remove an outer coat, jacket or gloves at UK ports to search for devices. They will also be able to conduct searches inside someone’s mouth for a hidden sim card or small electronic device.Home Office sources have previously told the Guardian that, if deemed clearly necessary and proportionate, children could also be subjected to these searches.Officials say the mobile phone searches will enable them to collect intelligence on asylum seekers’ journeys and to arrest people-smugglers. The powers come after the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.Alex Norris, the borders minister, said: “We are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.”On Sunday, the prime minister said that the UK will start to see “evidence” of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.Starmer told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”The Guardian has disclosed that the Home Office plans to send the first group of asylum seekers toa military site in East Sussexwithin weeks.A total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK in 2025 after crossing the Channel – the second highest annual figure on record.The yearly total was 13% higher than the figure for 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023’s total of 29,437. It was 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.Opinion polls put Reform significantly ahead of Labour, with a More in Common poll suggesting the party would win 381 seats.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Negotiations over the new food and drink (SPS) agreement announced in May, as well as a youth mobility programme, are continuing but with several significant points of dispute.Any further alignment with the EU is likely to come with a further Brussels demand for relaxation of migration restrictions. Starmer said there would be no return to full freedom of movement rights as part of any future negotiations, but defended the deal for ayouth mobility scheme.“We are looking at a youth mobility scheme which will be for young people to travel, to work, to enjoy themselves in different European countries, to have that experience.”The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, called the remarks a “Brexit betrayal” and said Starmer was “surrendering our freedom to cut regulation and strike our own trade deals”.The leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, said Starmer’s comments were “a breach of good faith with Labour voters” and criticised the co-operation with the EU on energy markets that is being explored, saying it would tie the UK to “crazy EU net zero policies and carbon taxes”.The battle over closer ties with Europe is likely to be a key dividing line that Labour seeks to draw with Reform. A Labour source said: “Nigel Farage’s biggest weakness is his militant opposition to any relationship with Europe. Couple that with anything to do with clean energy and you can see how he has wound himself up today.“But it comes from something much more sinister, too. He doesn’t want British businesses to find things easier. He doesn’t want bills to come down. If Britain struggles, that fuels his politics of division.”Starmer has given hints in recent months he would like to revisit strengthening ties with the EU. In November, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister in charge of EU negotiations, was promoted to full cabinet rank.Minouche Shafik, the prime minister’s economic adviser, is among those close to Starmer who have suggested internally that returning to the customs union could be one of the most effective ways of generating growth.But Starmer himself has been more reticent, having signed numerous international trade deals while in office including with India and an economic agreement with the US, which he has been able to tout as some of his successes.Backbench pressure has been growing within the Labour party, with 13 of its MPs backing a Liberal Democrat proposal to join a customs union in a Commons vote last month.The intervention from Streeting in anObserver interviewlate last year that a customs union would bring “enormous economic benefits” was widely seen as a challenge to Starmer amid speculation over the prime minister’s future.In hisinterviewwith the BBC, Starmer warned his internal rivals they would be opening the door to a government led by Nigel Farage if they recreated the “chaos” of the Tory leadership battles.“What I don’t think will help us is if a Labour government turns back to the chaos of the last Tory government. That would gift Nigel Farage,” he said.He said he believed Labour could still win the next election – and said he would be judged at that moment: “I was elected on a five-year mandate to change this country. I intend to deliver on that mandate. I will be judged at the next general election on whether we have brought about the change that people voted for.”Starmer said the next election would be “unlike any election we’ve seen in this country for a very, very long time”.“Because my strong view is it’ll be a Labour government up against a very rightwing proposition in Reform,” he said. “And that Reform proposition will be a proposition of toxic divide of this country. The next election is going to be about a question of, what is it to be British? And I believe to be British is to be compassionate, reasonable, live and let live, and diverse.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyKeir StarmerBrexitEuropean UnionForeign policyLabourEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Nothing – not even this will defeat you my friend.”At the time of the accident,Lilly shared photos of her bloodied face post-injuryand described what had happened on Substack. “I pull my face from the sand and take a breath. My mouth and nose are full of blood,” she wrote. “My partner says that when I black out, I look like I die. He gets very afraid. My eyes roll back in my head and all life leaves my body.”She explained how she had experienced fainting spells since she was a child, with doctors initially believing it was due to hypoglycemia, which was later ruled out.“I have come to believe that this ‘checking out’ is a result of my little soul reaching her limit of what she feels she can cope with in this life, and she ‘leaves the building,’ so to speak,” she wrote.But she also shared her gratitude, writing: “It might seem crazy looking at my face and my busted tooth, but I feel so grateful that I blacked out. I needed the reset.”Lilly has been on hiatus from acting for three years, with her last role being superhero Hope van Dyne, or the Wasp, in the 2023 Marvel film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania. She told Varietyin a statement in Junethat she was “not actively pursuing any work in the industry” and was now “devoting my time to my humanitarian work and my writing.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMarvelCanadaLostAmericasTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Our advice is to plan ahead and consider if your journey is really necessary during the weather warnings.”The Scottish transport secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said: “We’ve already seen challenging conditions and freezing temperatures, with more snow and ice on the way for the same areas. Of course for many Monday marks a return to work from the festive break. If you have to travel then please ensure your vehicle is winter ready and have a winter kit in your car.”She thanked the gritter drivers, chainsaw gangs, police and others who had been out in force over the weekend.Matthew Lehnert, a Met Office chief meteorologist, said that elsewhere in the UK there would be snow showers, ice and frost but “milder air will make attempts to spread eastward” from Tuesday.He added: “This will mean rain becomes more likely in the south, but there is also the possibility of more organised snow along the boundary of the mild and cold air masses. Strong winds could also be a feature later in the week.”The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued amber cold health alerts acrossEnglanduntil Tuesday.Agostinho Sousa, the head of extreme events and health protection at the agency, said it was vital to check in with family, friends and neighbours who were most vulnerable.He said: “The forecast temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Police called the outburst of hate an attempted pogrom, one that made headlines around the world.Six months later, several houses around Clonavon Terrace are still scorched, empty shells, and the homes that remain occupied tend to have curtains drawn even during the day.View image in fullscreenHouses in Ballymena targeted during riots in June 2025 remain boarded up six months later.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian“Everybody is being very careful. It’s on a knife-edge,” said a health worker from Africa who declined to share his name or nationality. Another resident, from the Czech Republic, said he ventured out only when necessary. “Men with masks drive up and down. They slow down and look at you.”It is a bleak aftermath tothree nights of mayhemin June when hundreds of riotershurled rocks and petrol bombsat phalanxes of police, leaving dozens injured and turning Ballymena, a predominantly Protestant working-class town 25 miles north-west of Belfast, into a byword for intolerance.Many residents reject that description and say there is a misconception about what happened. The violence was not intended to terrorise all foreigners. Only the Roma.Other nationalities were targeted in error, said Hugh, 61, a hotel worker. “When people are rioting, accidents can happen. Innocents get caught up in the crossfire.” It was “unfortunate” that the community had to resort to such methods, he said. “They needed them people out. It seemed the only way. I think it’s better they [the Roma] stay away.”A “hardline” element lashed out at all foreigners but most in the mob were focused on the Roma, said another Ballymena native, a man aged 40. He was ambivalent about the riots. “Shameful, a sad thing, but that’s what happens when you try to mix people too quickly.”Asked if the violence constituted ethnic cleansing, he nodded. “Yes. A certain group of people were made to feel not welcome. And the town is better for it. There used to be hundreds of Roma around here, now you don’t see any.” Residents who appreciated the outcome preferred to not dwell on the method, he said. “It will be swept under the rug. People don’t want to talk about it.”View image in fullscreenA house in Ballymena remains in ruins six months after its Roma occupants fled a riot in June 2025.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianIt is a common refrain: the riots were ugly but an overdue response to antisocial and criminal behaviour. The “good” foreigners who remain are welcome to stay and continue working in healthcare, and meat and bus factories.The sense of mission accomplished tinged with unease may partly explain why members of Mid and East Antrim borough council – the Guardian approached all the main parties and several independents – did not respond to requests for comment. Asked if any representative might speak, a council spokesperson responded: “The council will not be putting anyone forward for interview at this time.”While 95% of Ballymena’s population is white, a disproportionate number of Northern Ireland’s 1,500-strong Roma population – 740 people, or almost half – lived in the town and nearby areas, according to the 2021 census.Since then Ballymena’s Roma population more than doubled to between 1,500 and 2,000, according to one source with links to the community. “They want to build a life just like anyone else. They work hard in the factories.”However, the concentration in the Clonavon area, where landlords packed tenants into terrace properties, and where there is a tendency for men to congregate on footpaths for much of the day, left local girls and women feeling intimidated. Many also complained that the clusters of men did not step aside and thus obliged passersby to step on to the road – an ostensibly minor grievance that nevertheless cropped up in several interviews.The arrest of two men last year on suspicion ofhuman trafficking and controlling prostitutionfuelled overblown allegations of Roma criminality, creating a febrile mood. The rioting flared after two 14-year-old Roma boys were accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.Unrest spread to Larne, Portadown and other towns, which led to a rise in race-hate incidents: the 347 incidents recorded in June were the second highest monthly level in Northern Ireland on record. The annual number of race incidents (2,048) and race crimes (1,280) for the 12 months preceding October are the third highest since the data series began in 2004-05.Amnesty International called 2025 a “shameful year” for the region. Behind every statistic there was a real person or family left living in fear, said Patrick Corrigan, the organisation’s Northern Ireland director. “Yet too many politicians have echoed anti-migrant misinformation that provides the backdrop to these attacks, rather than stand with the victims of hate crimes.”Last month the two Roma boys who were accused of rape were released from juvenile custody after prosecutorsdropped all charges, saying: “The test for prosecution is no longer met on evidential grounds.”Instead of prompting consideration that the boys might be innocent, in Ballymena the decision prompted accusations that the Public Prosecution Service was the “paedophile protection service”. A Facebook group with 10,000 followers dedicated to action against “Roma gang masters” said that if the boys’ families returned to Ballymena “we will find out”. It urged members to seek a third alleged attacker, who is no longer sought by authorities. “Maybe they’re not looking any more, but we certainly still are.”A veteran loyalist activist in his 60s who has tried to calm tensions spoke of formidable obstacles. “Our biggest enemy is Facebook. It’s toxic. The war between republicans and loyalists is over but unfortunately this is a new war with a different set of warriors.”Many loyalists, including those with a tradition of labour activism, are keen to counter misinformation, said Peter Shirlow, the director of the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies, who found a receptive audience when he challenged myths about immigration at a workshop in Ballymena. “Some people are taking an awful lot of flak for standing up for migrant rights,” he said.There are no official statistics but it is estimated that almost three-quarters of the Roma population fled after the riots – and that since September most have quietly returned but avoided the Clonavon area and dispersed across other neighbourhoods.“They’re hoping for the best and doing what they can to keep their heads down,” said Jacqueline Monahan, coordinator of the Roma support hub in Belfast. Roma residents approached by the Guardian declined to speak.A tense calm prevails. Rioters claimed victory after purging Clonavon of Roma but more than 90 people have been charged with riot-related offences, which has tempered calls for further all-out mobilisation. Instead, small groups patrol neighbourhoods to monitor and intimidate. The message is clear: they know where the foreigners are.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRoma, Gypsies and TravellersImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet they’re in grounds that look as if they might have been owned by rich, exploitative mine owners.The building is Redhills, the headquarters since 1915 of the Durham Miners’ Association, which has reopened after a £14m restoration with a hugely ambitious purpose that aligns with the original aims of the site.Redhills is considered one of the world’s finest trade union buildings. Famed for its “pitmen’s parliament” and regarded as “Durham’s other cathedral”, it was once named asone of the 10 buildings that helped change Britain.Andrew McIntyre, the interim CEO of Redhills, said it was far more than just a building. “You’re kind of standing on the spot where the welfare state was first imagined,” he said. “It has always had an aura … a magic.”View image in fullscreenRedhills, in Durham city centre, is regarded as one of the finest examples of trade union architecture.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe building has been slowly, quietly reopening since the restoration was completed this year. It decided against a grand reopening event in favour of a softer relaunch but it has not gone unnoticed.“We’re barely open and all of our guided tours are sold out into next year,” said McIntyre.Bill Moir, who will be leading tours, took the Guardian around what is few people’s idea of what a miners’ hall should look like.“It was designed like this so that the men of the coalfields, when they came to represent their pits, would enter an entrance hall equally as glorious as the entrance hall of the owners of coalmines,” said Moir. “It was built on this grand scale to equal anything built by the aristocracy.”View image in fullscreenThe Austrian oak chamber where the ‘pitmen’s parliament’ convened.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe restoration has been long and painstaking but much needed. The Austrian oak chamber where the “pitmen’s parliament” convened looks magnificent today, “but if you had come here three, four years ago, not only would the smell of mould nearly knocked you out, but the floor was starting to deteriorate, it was just rotten”.It was built, said Moir, in the style of a Methodist chapel in the expectation there would be “collaboration and cooperation” rather than combative discussions.It was here that miners discussed ideas of a welfare state, long before this was created in Britain, as well as community infrastructure, models of universal healthcare and levels of fair compensationThat history drives the new Redhills, said McIntyre.View image in fullscreenGuided tours of the refurbished building are sold out into next year.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe restoration was part-funded by the national lottery but before the bid, Redhills consulted communities. “We asked people what they wanted the future to be and they were absolutely adamant that it wasn’t a museum and it shouldn’t be a heritage centre. They didn’t want us to build a memorial or a mausoleum to the past.“They were arguing that it’s the beating heart of a living culture, not just the brass bands and the banners.”There will be weddings, funerals, conferences and concerts at Redhills but the bigger idea is that it becomes a kind of mothership of cooperative endeavour.“People are enormously proud of where they’re from, of their heritage, of their family history, of their mining heritage and culture, but what they lack is hope,” said McIntyre.The new Redhills wants to replicate what the Durham Miners’ Association was doing 100 years ago when it was creating a kind of working-class commonwealth and building parks, sports grounds, houses for aged mining families and more.View image in fullscreenA photograph on display at Redhills.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe first project is centred around the once prosperous village of Horden in east Durham, a place that already has Ensemble 84, a theatre company led by the acclaimed theatre director Mark Dornford-May and which, earlier this year,staged a new Lee Hall version of Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage.McIntrye says there are opportunities for homes to get cheap heat from mine water, to have the community take control of housing stock and then after that, why not social care?“The council is paying out millions of pounds but they’re paying it to private companies who are skimming off a huge percentage of the budget and just taking that as profit and that’s being shipped out of Durham straight away,” said McIntyre.Since the pits closed 40 years ago, people in Durham have waited and waited for governments to come and do things, he said. “How many elections have we had since the pits started closing? Not many of them seem to have changed much.”Explore more on these topicsTrade unionsCounty DurhamNorth of EnglandHeritageMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Archive image: courtesy of Paterson JosephBorn in Willesden, north-west London, in 1964, Paterson Joseph is an actor and writer. A graduate of Lamda, he worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company before moving into TV and film, with roles including Alan Johnson in Peep Show and Keaty in The Beach. He published his award-winning debut novel,The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius Sancho, in 2022. His children’s book,Ten Children Who Changed the World, is out now. Joseph is a judge for the debut fiction category of the 2025Nero Book Awards. The winners will be announced on 13 January.This was taken by my sister Glenda, who had decided she wanted to get into hair and makeup. She was pulling together a portfolio and used me as a guinea pig, something my sisters had done since I was small. I was going for that slightly curmudgeonly old man expression, but it came out more like a smirk.At 17, I was shy, imaginative and not particularly ambitious. I was working as a chef at the Royal Free hospital. I was not in any way a showman, but I was interested in storytelling. I was always writing, but didn’t dare share my words with the world.My childhood was spent in a bog-standard flat above a shop in Kensal Rise. My memories of that time are of a happy, communal living space. It had three bedrooms and there were seven of us for the first 10 years of my life. I had energetic siblings, and I had to avoid getting into any major disputes with the older ones so I wouldn’t get smacked around. As we lived above the High Road, we couldn’t play outside easily, so had to be self-contained and creative. Mum worked in the McVitie’s factory, so there were always a lot of biscuits – though they were rationed to three each per night.I was four-and-a-halfwhen I realised the school system wasn’t fair. I went to a predominantly white school, so I already stood out. But on my first day, my teacher sat me down in front of the class and pointed at a picture of a tiger. She asked: “What’s that?” I knew it was a tiger, but I panicked. I thought it was a trick question, so I said: “A lion.” She shut the book. After that, I was completely dismissed. I was a small boy, but very much awake to the irrationality of the world.The through-line in every character I play is the outward show of control versus the inward panic and scramblingI got lucky later on, when I had a teacher from Goa called Mrs Bird. Although I was a shit pupil, she took a shine to me. I was cheeky and she quite liked that. We always kept in touch, and when I was in my 40s she told me: “Every time I wanted to try something new with the kids, the headteacher would say, ‘Don’t worry with the Irish or the Caribbean kids – they’re never going to amount to anything.’” Essentially the poor, working-class kids and sons and daughters of immigrants were overlooked, unless they were exceptional.My sanctuary became Willesden Green library. I liked all types of books: by the time I was 15, I was reading Guy de Maupassant in translation, Oscar Wilde short stories and the whole awful Forsyte Saga. Plus, lots of Mills & Boon, because my sisters loved them. Harold Robbins was also a favourite, because I was a teenage boy and it was filled with descriptions of sex.I auditioned for the National Youth Theatre (NYT) when I was 14. It was the first time I’d come across Shakespeare. When I read The Merchant of Venice, I realised I loved the articulation of his words in my mouth. Sadly, I didn’t get in because of terrible shyness. I was asked: “What drew you to the immersion of youth theatre?” by a very nice middle-class person interviewing me. I looked at the ground for about 30 seconds and said, “Because I like meeting people.” I didn’t really mean that, I just didn’t have the confidence to say anything else. Eventually, Glenda taught me how to play the game, to look someone in the eye and have self-belief, even if it’s just pretending.When I failed to get into the NYT,I auditioned for a place called The Cockpit, in Marylebone. It was the first time I saw people younger than me who were super-confident and at ease with themselves. I thought: “Whatever that is, I’d like some of that.” When I started, I was still mumbling, quiet and reticent. But that place was transformative.If that teenager in the photo could see what I became, he would be shocked, confused and mostly pleasedThe through-line in every character I play is the outward show of control versus the inward panic and scrambling. I suspect all people in authority to be flailing underneath, even if they appear to have Donald Trump-levels of confidence. Their inner soul is in a terrible flap, because of the fear they’re going to get caught out. This was definitely the case for Peep Show’s Johnson. The creators were after a character who could be an absolute arse and quite sociopathic – someone who thinks they’re great but is actually an alcoholic, a failure and a fool. He is a horrible person who I wouldn’t want to spend five minutes with, but I love him.Maybe it’s a lack of self-esteem,but when I got my role in The Beach, I didn’t think: “This is the start of my Hollywood career.” I knew it was a one-off – which it kind of was, aside from Wonka. I had to be topless, but I was militantly against the idea that as a black actor I had to get ripped and look like a muscle guy, as I considered myself to be an intellectual artist. In the end, it was so hot there was not an ounce of fat left on anybody. Leo [DiCaprio] was really put through it – he had to work hard to look thin because he was a podgy Italian boy. But he was lovely to hang out with, a proper artist who didn’t want to be a Hollywood pretty boy. Tilda Swinton was similarly inspiring. We used to play cards together and have deep conversations. One day, she asked: “If you were dying, what would you want to be remembered for?” What Tilda was really asking was – “So you’re just going to be an actor? What about the storytelling obsession you have?”Anna Maxwell Martin looks back: ‘I was bullied a little bit, but it didn’t affect me because I was a happy weirdo’Read moreI thought for a while and replied: “Someone who wrote a book or theatre show about black people in Britain before the Windrush.” That chat was the catalyst for everything that came next. I wrotea one-person showabout Charles Ignatius Sancho, which became the nonfiction book Sancho: An Act of Remembrance. Then, in lockdown I wrote my novel. I put myself in a pressure cooker – this was the one thing I had to complete before I died.Because of my experiences of being written off at school, there was a sense of validation when I got published, but not in a vengeful, two-fingers-up-at-the-teachers kind of way. Instead, it felt full circle. When I was eight, I had a notepad and would write a load of motivational statements in it, like: “I am a great writer. I am a really good friend.” I would read it again and again, as if I was doing my lines.The 17-year-old version of me would be amazed that any of those things came true. Back then, the world wasn’t offering me anything. “Be quiet, sit down” – that’s what I expected my life to look like. If that teenager in the photo could see what I became, he would be shocked, confused and mostly pleased. In spite of everything, I went and did it anyway.Explore more on these topicsPaterson JosephFlashbackTelevisionHistory booksFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But tonight, the music is low and the loudest sounds come from the clacking of vintage mechanical typewriters. About 30 people in the bar are drafting poems about horses, sunsets and Stetson hats – which are plentiful atop the heads in the crowd.They’re here to take part in CowboyPoetryLos Angeles, a collective dedicated to preserving the history of the American west through authentic storytelling. For city slickers unfamiliar with cowboy poetry, it’s a folk art that emerged from oral traditions. Around the 1870s, during long cattle drives west from Texas, men would trade stories and sing songs about their adventures on the frontier.There’s a misconception that cowboy poetry is a dying art form, but some 150 years later, the movement is experiencing a revival. The Eastwood workshops are just one example of new poetry gatherings sprouting across the nation. In 2021, Dakota Holdaway established theJuab Cowboy Poetry Gatheringin Nephi, Utah. That same year, Leslie Miller launchedthe Rodearin Bridgeport, California, an arts and culture festival that highlights talent from young women across the west.While many of the US’s leading cowboy poets skew older, events like these are fast becoming a creative outlet for a younger, more diverse crowd. Cowboy Poetry Los Angeles stands out because it is one of the few scenes emerging in a major city.View image in fullscreenNico Patino prepares to write at Eastwood bar in Los Angeles, on 20 November.Kristin Windbigler, the chief executive officer of the Western Folklife Center, which organizes the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, is thrilled to see the group thriving in Los Angeles. “It allows cowboy poetry to reach an audience that it might not necessarily reach,” she said.On this warm August night at Eastwood, Cowboy Poetry LA’s co-founder Amir Beardsley, 31, takes the stage. Though he’s often backed by music, today he’s performing solo to give a crisp demonstration of the art form, and chooses to recite his poem Black Friday, about the bull that nearly ended his pro rodeo career.Heck, they thought they killed me back in15flew me out in a chopper, covered me with a sheet.A big bad bull whipped me downand sent me whirling, whirling all around.He holds the microphone confidently as he paces on the stage, reciting the poem in a calm, rhythmic cadence. His free hand rests on his hip, drawing attention to an ornate belt buckle he won during a junior riding championship. The audience, some seated at typewriters, others in front of blank white pieces of paper waiting for inspiration to hit, listen in rapt attention and occasionally take notes when a piece of imagery feels particularly western, like when Beardsley compares rodeo tales to war stories.When Beardsley performs, the words flow gleefully, like he’s been telling these stories his entire life. As a teen visiting Elko’s poetry gathering, he once complimented an older poet’s reading, and the cowboy offered a bit of wisdom that would shape Beardsley’s style.“He said: ‘Young man, I recited that poem. I did not read it,” Beardsley said. To be a cowboy poet, one has to memorize their poems.View image in fullscreenA participant at Cowboy Poetry LA, on November 20.A living historyBy the time east-coaster-turned-trail-hand Jack Thorp had published thefirst recorded bookof cowboy poems, Songs of the Cowboys, in 1908, cattle drives were on thedecline. Yet the book helped spark a larger interest in the art of cowboy poetry, and people with connections to the west, whether it be through their upbringing, ranching or rodeo, began holding informal open mics where they could share their stories. In 1985, a rancher and renowned cowboy poet named Waddie Mitchell launched the first organized cowboy poetry celebration in Elko, Nevada, and today, theNational Cowboy Poetry Gatheringremains the largest cowboy poetry event in the nation.Beardsley, who grew up among cowboys in rural Red Bluff,California, started writing and attending the gatherings in high school. It was there that he learned some of the signature characteristics of a cowboy poem: vividly descriptive landscapes, honoring one’s relationships with animals and an exploration of isolation or solitude.Beyond that, a cowboy poem can take whatever form the author wants. It can be flowery or direct, it can rhyme or clash, and it can focus on the present instead of the past.“For me, it’s about the storytelling,” Beardsley said. “A lot of my poems I started out writing were telling stories about the life I lived being a young bull-rider.”View image in fullscreenA participant reads cowboy poetry at Eastwood bar.When Beardsley moved to Los Angeles three years ago, he linked up with his cousin, Zane York, 33, a consultant at a skateboarding non-profit. Whereas Beardsley is often described as “the real deal” because he grew up in rural America, York, who functions as the Cowboy Poetry LA hype man, says he’s “a real California kid”. He grew up in suburban Claremont, where he skated in strip mall parking lots and developed his sensibilities from hippies and musicians. He’s the son of John York, a bassist for the band the Byrds, and inherited his father’s passion and aptitude for music, which blended perfectly with cowboy poems.“I don’t claim to be a cowboy,” York admits, “but I’m still a man of the west.”In April 2024, an acquaintance learned about Beardsley’s poems and invited the cousins to perform at a basement concert in the Venice neighborhood. Beardsley read his poems while York strummed a backing tune on his guitar. That was the beginning of Cowboy Poetry LA. Within two years, they’d participated in more than 30 events, and have played at art openings, the western-themed wellness retreatRanch Resetand the Autry Museum of the American West, a prominent museum in Los Angeles.The cousins had both performed at the open mic at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering and wanted to share their love for the art form with their generation. As millennials, Beardsley and York are younger than the typical cowboy poet. Most of the famous wordsmiths, like Mitchell and Red Steagall, are well into their 70s and 80s; in Elko, there are even discounted tickets for attendees under the age of 35.Beardsley and York wanted to jump right into a Los Angeles gathering, but they couldn’t find many local poets. They realized they’d have to teach the craft to their peers, and that they could take advantage of the current trend of cowboy-core to build intrigue. Between the Yellowstone series settingstreaming recordsand Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tourraking in millions, western culture is more popular than ever, and the cousins attract newcomers to their workshops by advertising live country music, which takes place after the workshop, and a prize for the best western wear. It’s just a bonus that guests will also learn about the art, write a poem on a vintage typewriter, read it on stage – and maybe get hookedView image in fullscreenAmir Beardsley, co-founder of Cowboy Poetry LA, Eastwood bar in Los Angeles, on 20 November.Despite leaning into the current western fads, Beardsley and York don’t want writers to slip into a caricature, as they consider it a reductive portrait of the cowboy. Rather, they want to help people embrace that authenticity actually means recognizing that the west has always been a diverse place.York points out that “Gene Autry was the first movie star in the USA, and he was a white cowboy who had a rifle and fought Indians”. Unlike these Hollywood stereotypes that embody colonial ideas like manifest destiny, machismo and hyper-masculinity, the cowboy evolved fromvaqueros, or Mexican cattle ranchers, and historians estimate thatone in fourcowboys were Black.This issue is deeply personal to the cousins, who identify as Arab Americans of Jordanian descent. Beardsley said that he never met another Middle Eastern competitor while on the pro rodeo circuit, and thinks he may have been the first. Other riders would razz him for his heritage, but it only made Beardsley bolder, and he commissioned a pair of chaps with the colors of the flag of Jordan to wear during competition.“I say I’m half Jordanian, half cowboy,” Beardsley says.An intergenerational communityWindbigler has worked hard to bring more poets under the age of 40 to the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, and at the next event, they’ll represent at least one-third of the lineup. Windbigler is especially thrilled to welcome Los Angeles Cowboy Poetry as special guests for the upcoming gathering in January, where they’ll be bringing their typewriters and facilitating a workshop similar to the one they host at Eastwood.She also pushes back against the idea that cowboy poetry is a dying art, noting that the gathering’s ticket sales have grown 53% in the past decade. In 2025, roughly 8,000 people came to Elko, surpassing the peak attendance the gathering attracted in its early heyday.As cowboy poetry gains renewed popularity with young folks, it also sparks dialogues between generations. Elders pass on their lyricism, knowledge and stories, helping the younger poets become stronger writers. In return, the younger generation preserves their mentors’ legacies by learning their poems and reciting them at their events, helping the tradition stay alive.“Our whole deal is passing on these creative traditions to the next generation,” Windbigler said. “You can’t do that if the older generation isn’t there or the younger generation isn’t there.”View image in fullscreenLori Hofschneider at Cowboy Poetry LA, on 20 November.Back at Eastwood, Beardsley gently checks in on the burgeoning poets. He weaves through the crowd with a black cowboy hat filled with poetry prompts for struggling authors. They include wistful images, like “write from the perspective of someone watching a cowboy ride away”, and reflective challenges, including “a moment when the rope missed – or landed – at exactly the right time”.The bar hosted events throughout the autumn, including one in November attended by Charles McGarrigle, 30, a story producer in the entertainment industry. At that event,he wrote a poem about his partner, Lauren Hofschneider, 31, a psychology professor, who was born on the island of Saipan and moved to California after she turned 18. Despite the apparent cultural differences between islanders and people from the west, Hofschnieder’s journey of migration and isolation, of moving alone from a small, remote town to a hustling city, felt in line with the cowboy experience.“I don’t see myself as a cowgirl, obviously, but him phrasing it that way made me realize there have been many moments in my life where I was wandering alone,” Hofschneider said.This was McGarrigle’s second workshop, but his first time reading a poem. “I didn’t perform because I was almost intimidated by so many cowboy hats and thinking that I didn’t belong, and I’m a poser,” he explained. “But Amir and Zane do such a good job of reassuring the crowd by saying, even though the theme is cowboy poetry, it’s just about getting up on stage.”View image in fullscreen‘Being a cowboy, it’s not what you do, but who you are and how you respect yourself, others and the land.’Katie Meza, who attended her first workshop in August, also felt that Beardsley and York quickly embraced her.“I’ve never touched a horse in my life, but we all get to appreciate the culture equally,” Meza said.She came to the August eventwith her ex-boyfriend, Michael Salonius, 51, an elk rancher from Crescent City, Oregon. The 13th-generation mountaineer grew up hearing cowboy poetry in his hometown bar, and was excited when he discovered the event through Instagram. He was bracing for a dingy room with just a handful of old men, and was shocked by the young, energetic crowd.“It exceeded my expectations,” Salonius said. “To see this many young people doing it, taking it seriously, and the diversity of poems … ” He trailed off, then cracked a wide smile. “It’s fucking rad,” he said.Towards the end of that night, Jarod Ramirez, 25, took the stage. He grew up in Hesperia, a town surrounded by the Mojave desert, and said the workshop was helping him reconnect to his roots. His grandfather was born in New Mexico, and Ramirez remembered him as the embodiment of a western lifestyle. He sported his grandfather’s old silver bolo tie, which was in the shape of a bean and embedded with red and blue turquoise stones.“This is my first time doing cowboy poetry, so we’ll see if it’s good or not,” Ramirez said, then launched into An Ode to the Hatch Chili:Green or redthe favorite color can end in a brawl.But you’re more subtle than that.If asked, I’d say green,if one appreciates the color of cacti and spikes of Joshua trees,red if you’re hot-blooded and savor the sunset.But what is it that makes you so special?Being of Old Mexico. I’ve had my fair share of spicesbut my New Mexican familyhad some kind of magic.They capture the taste of a wild desert, fire,and put it on the top of my tongue.The audience loudly clapped and cheered. With that, Ramirez was on his way to becoming a cowboy poet; all he needs to do is write, be kind and nurture his appreciation for the west.“I like to tell folks being a cowboy, it’s not what you do, but who you are and how you respect yourself, others and the land,” Beardsley said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPoetryWesternsWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The visions he experienced during his recovery set him on the path to a new careerPatrick CharnleySun 4 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTShareOn the evening of Monday 1 February 2021, during the third Covid lockdown, my wife Alexa and I sat down on the sofa to have sausages and chips in front of the TV. The children were tetchy, and we were worn out from trying to home-school them while working from home, me as a lawyer in the music industry and Alexa as a charity fundraiser. But at least, Alexa said to me, we had made it through January.Then I started making strange noises. “Are you joking?” she asked. Then, “are you choking?”She knew it was my heart. Days before, my cardiologist had told me I would need surgery within the next six months to repair a leaking valve that had been getting progressively worse for years.“What if you don’t have the surgery?” Alexa had asked. I replied: “I’ll just drop down dead.” I was joking – my heart problem wasn’t thought to be  that serious – but as it turned out, I was right. By the time my dinner tray started slipping from my lap to the floor, I was already clinically dead. My heart had stopped beating and I wasn’t breathing. I was having a cardiac arrest.I am alive now only because of my wife and son who got help, my friend and neighbour Peter who gave me cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the paramedics who eventually got my heart started again – 40 minutes after I had stopped breathing.I was taken to hospital in a state of deep unconsciousness, leaving Alexa standing in our living room, where the furniture had been pushed aside and there was mud on the floor and debris from the paramedics’ equipment strewn everywhere.It would be two months before I’d return home, visually impaired and with a brain injury, my perspective on life altered completely.Part of my brain had been turned off; I only experienced sensations not thoughts – it was like the silence after a crashThe days after my cardiac arrest were a time of total contrast: Alexa was living a nightmare, not knowing whether I would live or die, while I was in a coma, oblivious to what was happening.Then, on Friday, I woke up. The hospital set up a video call for me to talk to Alexa, but I was making no sense. The following day, it became clear that I was blind. That’s when the doctors started talking to Alexa about a brain injury caused by the lack of oxygen, and her relief at me having survived turned into a sense of dread about what this might mean.A few days later, Alexa was allowed to visit me in the hospital as an exception to the lockdown rules; the doctors thought it could help me as I was so confused and disoriented. I was also hallucinating. When she arrived, I had just had a brain scan, and when she asked me about it, I told her I had been to a premiere of a film about bees.Over the coming days, when Alexa wasn’t visiting, we would video call a lot. She says I was laughing and joking as if I was hosting a dinner party, completely unaware of what had happened. She, the doctors and the nurses would tell me time and again that I’d had a cardiac arrest and that I had a brain injury, but I would immediately forget anything that I’d been told.Weeks later in neurological rehab, I underwent extensive testing which found my memory and other cognitive functions were in the bottom 2% of the population. One day in hospital I asked why my mother hadn’t been to visit, and Alexa had to tell me that she had died three years before.During the second week, my sight began to return, but only partially and I had trouble processing what I was seeing. I remember sitting by the hospital window one day, feeling cold air seeping through the window frames, craving a breath of it. It had snowed overnight, and I was looking out at Hampstead Heath, unable to understand why it was white.Throughout this time, the hallucinations – caused by the brain trying to compensate for my loss of vision – continued. One had a significant impact on me, and really my novel,This, My Second Life,came from it.In it, I was in a cottage hospital in Dublin, some time in the past. I was alone in bed in a small dark room. The door was ajar and outside a group of young nurses with lilting Irish accents were sitting round a table in the soft glow of an oil lamp, talking very quietly. Murmuring, really. I felt so looked after, like nothing could possibly hurt me, and it had a profound effect on me.I believe I had that hallucination because I was being looked after like that in real life. I still remember and am grateful for the extreme kindness of the doctors and nurses and other people working at the hospitals I stayed in, and those who have cared for me since.Around that time, I felt as a baby with a belly full of milk must feel: content and untouched by the world. Before, I’d been trying to balance a stressful job with lockdown and home schooling. Now I just sat or lay for hours without thinking about anything, floating through time. The busy part of my brain had been turned off, and all I experienced were sensations, not thoughts. It was like the silence after a monumental crash.When I returned home from hospital, I wanted to hold on to this feeling, to record it, and I began to write. I can see now that with my writing I was creating a world that reflected the tranquillity that I was experiencing. I was building a sanctuary that I could go to for that sensation of total peace.I remember a hot day, lying outdoors and writing in my notebook. I carried on like this, writing small amounts by hand, once every few days, often forgetting what I had written before, and hampered also by dyslexia and extreme fatigue from the brain injury.I see the world differently now – although I am more limited in what I can do, my life feels freerAs I wrote slowly over the next three years, I came to realise how fundamentally my experience had changed me. I see the world differently now, and although I am very limited in what I can do compared with before, my life feels freer and more open.It was important to me to have a connection to the work of my late mother, the writer Helen Dunmore. My main character is called Jago, the name of the young boy in a picture book my mother and I worked on together years ago. I also reincarnated the character of Granny Carne from my mother’s Cornish Ingo books, a wise woman as old as the hills who helps Jago adjust to his life after suffering the same health crisis as me. So, although I can’t tell my mother about my book, I am happy that there is a thread through time connecting her work to mine.When I finished writing the novel, I put it away and didn’t do anything with it. Trying to publish it would have been a step too far back into the world.But I also knew that I needed more from life than just drifting through, that I had a second chance, so I sent my novel out. When I was offered a publishing deal for it, I felt as if I was being given a new start, and I understood that writing is what I will do.In a way, This, My Second Life is not only about Jago’s second life, but about mine too. I have a lot of problems, but I am alive, I can see, I have my family and friends, and I can write. My greatest hope for my novel is that it leaves readers feeling uplifted and with the sense of peace, contentment and possibility that it has given to me.This, My Second Life by Patrick Charnley is published by Hutchinson Heinemann.

I was headed home to Queensland early the next morning and had set my alarm to wake me for the taxi I had ordered to the airport. But when I woke up, I realised that I had forgotten to allow for daylight savings. I was now running an hour late to the airport, with no taxi to get me there.I ordered another taxi and made my way out to wait in front of the motel, in despair that I might miss my flight. I stood on the dark footpath and spoke on the phone to my sister in Queensland about how I had missed my taxi and how unwell I felt. My health condition can affect my ability to think clearly, and I was telling her how my brain just wasn’t working that day. Then the taxi arrived – phew. Except, as the driver told me when I opened the door to get in, it wasn’t for me.The kindness of strangers: a boy picked up my spilled shopping when I was too pregnant to reach the groundRead moreA well-dressed, professional-appearing man appeared out of the shadows and stood beside me. He must have overheard my conversation. The taxi was for him, but he asked the driver to take me too.I gratefully got in and, in conversation, explained my situation to the man and driver, who were both very kind. At one point, the man said something to the driver, but I didn’t hear what. I noticed later that we were on the way to the airport and realised the gentleman had asked the driver not to drop him off at his destination, but to take me to the airport first. I tried to object but the man wouldn’t hear of it.When we arrived, the gentleman wouldn’t let me pay for the fare, and even hopped out to escort me inside the terminal and make sure I knew where to go and what to do. I felt overwhelmed with gratitude.When you have a chronic health condition like mine, it can be an invisible illness. People tell me they wouldn’t know there’s anything wrong just from looking at me. It means you don’t always get empathy from people when you don’t feel well, but that man was all empathy.I intended to write to a local newspaper to thank him at the time, but I became less well again and it fell to the back of my mind. I’m hoping he sees this now, after all these years. So to that well-dressed gentleman: thank you for being kind when so many others aren’t.

With democracy itself threatened, is it time to go back to a previous world of landlines, letters and face to-face-contact, audiotapes and Ansaphones?

I am messaging family on the other side of the Atlantic. And you want me to turn that off? The problem isn’t the internet, it’s the people.1EloiseAccording to Google’s AI Overview: “Come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough.”EddieChorepostWithout Google Maps I would probably still be walking in circles in the middle of Epping Forest.1AngryManThanks to Google maps, Iamwalking in circles in the middle of Epping Forest!!Doomxsfsddgvhyt)I won’t be the first to point out what the internet has offered to disabled people. It’s a place where someone I know, who finds speaking nearly impossible due to physical challenges, can be fluent, authoritative and, most importantly, properly listened to at last. And that’s just one example. It’s not for me or anyone else to take that away. I actually hate web 2.0 with a passion and for any number of reasons, but I can’t refute this point, nor would I seek to.AsureaHonestly, without the internet I would be isolated and alone. I have a conservative family and am in the closet and queer and trans. With the internet my world finally expanded and I finally became free. I learned about myself and became happy and at peace. I met my most important person after a lifetime of difficulty connecting to people and I found things I loved that changed me. The internet has done a lot of harm, yes, but it’s not black and white and has been a lifeline for queer and disabled folk such as myself. I am so grateful for the connection and friendship I found thanks to the internet.Kati777The internet itself is a magnificent technological achievement, not a moral failure. It has democratised access to knowledge, lowered barriers to publishing, connected marginal voices and transformed education, science and culture in ways that are hard to overstate.The problem is not “the internet” so much as the concentration of power in a handful of social media platforms that algorithmically amplify outrage, misinformation and fringe belief while disclaiming responsibility for the consequences.Most of the damage could be addressed by treating these companies as accountable intermediaries rather than neutral pipes: enforcing transparency around amplification, meaningful liability for harm, and standards closer to those long applied to publishers and broadcasters.Rolling back to landlines and letters would mean losing real, hard-won freedoms. The challenge is not to abandon the online world, but to civilise it.littlewasterPlease God yes. However nice and convenient it is to book a train ticket or transfer money from my bank account, none of it compensates for the breakdown in society which is occurring because of what is now a malignant online world.Kirsty McNally, by emailI don’t know anybody who thinks society has improved in the last 30 years. I miss how fun and open-minded we used to be, and I miss being engaged with the real world, in all my time awake on this planet. Is there any chance of this actually happening? I hope so.Peter Rizzo, by emailShould we turn radio off? Should we turn newspapers off? Should we turn the printing press off? And books? Should we turn off writing on paper and drawing on cave walls? These questions were probably all raised by someone, not very long after those respective inventions escaped the control of their inventors. Each time, the previous elite lost control to the masses over information and discourse, history keeps repeating.Randomusername222No. We would miss that which is a deeply embedded and nearly indispensable need of humanity – connection. The internet allows us to quickly engage with other humans (around the planet!), which could be a lifesaver for those of us who cannot find community and acceptance in our immediate surroundings.In being able to share our experiences we can galvanise opinion to push for change (I’m thinking of the murder of George Floyd and following outrage, and also that in an era before the internet, it was through the sharing of images of brutalised peaceful protesters for racial equality in the American south that the country was shamed into reform).The internet enables sharing in a way unprecedented in human existence; it is this ability to join minds and hearts, sometimes across all known and artificial divisions that helps us find ourselves as individuals and communities, nations, and maybe one day as a planet.Henry Thorpe, by emailView image in fullscreenHappier days or a time of limited contact?Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockThe internet is a communication medium, it is not the communication itself. Blaming “the internet” is like blaming the post office if you get a nasty letter. Turning off the internet would be like turning off mains electricity, or banning road transport other than horses.You can’t turn the clock back. There was no long-lost golden age.DopFnordMy job in IT heavily depends on it. Outside my job, I’ve deleted all social media apps from my phone. It’s been quite a liberating experience. That whole realm has been hijacked and I find it worrying how many people use it as their primary source of news and information. Thankfully this paper seems to be one of the few places of resistance.AyJayEmObviously it’s far too late to put the genie back in the lamp (perhaps a more accurate metaphor would be to unwet the mogwai), but I often find myself wishing we could roll things back to just before the invention of the smartphone. That way, we’d still have most of the benefits of the internet, but it would be contained within a bulky device that lived in the corner of a room in our homes and on our desks at work. We’d be able to turn our backs on it whenever we left the house or office, and we wouldn’t be obliged to carry it with us all the time (I know in most cases we’re not “obliged” to carry smartphones with us, but it takes tremendous strength of will to swim against the tide all the time, not to mention how difficult many organisations make it to do things offline).To me, that seems like a pretty good balance between enjoying the advantages of the internet while preserving those priceless and eminently human aspects of our lives that the internet has done a great deal to damage, if not outright destroyed.SignedUpToWriteThisThe best option is to use the internet in moderation and never to switch off your brain.willemijnheidemanThere is nothing on the internet that does not leave a digital footprint. Governments could so simply make “social media” responsible for the accuracy of what they publish, in the same way that a newspaper is responsible. If they can be sued, they will control the crazy people spouting lies. Make them responsible. Sanction their owners. China and Russia control the internet. It can be done.CynicalGeorgeIf anything, this article and comments has shown me that a huge amount of Guardian readers don’t know what the internet is or what aspects of modern life would be affected by “turning it off” (nearly everything, most likely from the power grid on up).unhelpfulThe question poses “the internet” as both the root cause of that which ails modern society and as the antithesis of liberalism and human freedom. This is, of course, leading the witness. The internet is not designed to respect geographical borders. Its technology is not free of political bias, though having been devised in the US that bias is towards the modern western conceptions of freedom that the writer holds in such high regard.The former GDR (East Germany) managed breathtaking levels of landline tapping and turning family members against one another. Conversations were frequently recorded. I do not see how a return to exclusively in-person contact, cassette tapes and landlines would intrinsically benefit those of us who value freedom.The internet is designed to be flexible, scalable and open at distance. The openness that doesn’t respect traditional notions of borders is the same openness that allows states to use marvellous technologies against their own populations, because here’s what governments understand: people want to feel connected to one another, those connections can threaten thestatus quo,ergothose connections need to be coralled and controlled.People and organisations campaigning for freedom have long gathered and communicated using the internet, predating by many years the modern “walled gardens” of social media. Those voices are still here and there and everywhere. Perhaps, if you step away from the noise of everyone shouting into the void, you’ll be able to discern them talking about running the world in a different way.DorkaliciousI have mobility issues, yet I’ve managed to do all my Christmas present shopping without leaving the house.

It’s simply a question of using it wisely.snowybeachI was diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in the early 80s and it was an extremely isolating experience. I knew no one else with the condition and just had to deal with things very much alone. It’s so much better now for newly diagnosed children to be able to connect to others in a similar position.AucklandCanaryView image in fullscreenEverything except the dial-up modem … the way things, recently, were.Photograph: Phiwath Jittamas/Getty ImagesPeople confuse the internet, which is a communication tool, with the various platforms, social media included, that use it. There are a lot of incredibly useful, practical things we do on the internet that benefit us. Not everything is a social media swamp, something we can choose to engage with, or not.The internet is still in its infancy, so we’re at the proverbial wild west stage of its development with a host of crazies, carpetbaggers, extremists and entrepreneurs allowed pretty free rein, so it can be grim. Governments and political campaigners have both tried to exploit this “freedom” and also failed to manage it, partly because they don’t understand it, so it’s a bit of a cesspool.Add the likes of all the tech bros, and it gets even worse.Not all bad though. Enshittification is now well recognised and people are getting pissed off with it. The days when everyone believed what they read are going fast, too, ironically hastened by the growth of AI slop and the likes of Trump and Musk. There’s more open criticism of such slop, and a lot more questioning of what’s the truth and what propaganda. The platforms are run by wealthy rightwingers but even now, much of the discussion is about obvious propaganda, fake AI-generated shopfronts and content. I believe social media has started to lose its attraction for many people, with people posting and engaging less.Almost half of young people would prefer a world without internet, UK study findsRead moreThe internet doesn’t need to be turned off, it just needs to be better managed and, on a personal level, used more carefully and responsibly. It needs to grow up.DJT1MillionWe’re in the corporate capture stage of the internet, which is why the user interface for most people now consists of checking the same four apps over and over again, and posting the same content from one of them on to one or more of the other three.Being online is no longer really enjoyable, it’s merely compulsive behaviour orcompulsoryfor participating in society – and is frequently actively annoying and frustrating in proportion to what you get out of it.In its first decade the possibilities of the internet seemed democratic and limitless.

I read more actual books from cover to cover and my attention span was longer. I now struggle to focus for longer than a few minutes. I once used the phone a lot to book things, which meant having to speak to actual people more. Friends reunited was fairly innocent fun, but then Facebook was born, Snapchat, TikTok … .ChrisPookThere are conceptually simple enough solutions to the stink of the internet sewer. One is to forbid anonymity. All uploads to incorporate a source address.The other would be an even greater boon – to tax ads.nosuchzoneNo. But democracies will need to learn how to address misinformation to challenge the mobocracy. Besides, it still has so many positive and benign uses. As a musician, I would miss the ease with which new skills can be learned and ideas shared. I’m sure others will find reasons of their own for not wanting to turn the clock back.fender64Maybe a world internet-free day might be doable as a way of reflection on being too dependent on it. I will never forget that day in April in Spain when all the electricity went off and one couldn’t access the internet. People were much nicer to each other and helped one another out. You couldn’t access the news without a transistor radio and that wasn’t a bad thing.DaveTrollI’m sure I’ve read about surgeons who have to do something rare being able to get live expert guidance by video call.

Those people around the world who now have access to some form of education thanks to internet access might disagree with [turning it off].middle24Without the internet, I’d not have my job (engineer), my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, would’ve found it much harder to find my apartment and roommate, and couldn’t do most of my shopping online so would need to take longer and more frequent trips just to shop since I’ve chosen a car-free lifestyle.But I’m also only on one social network: Reddit, which allows me to read and interact with others about just the topics I select. I only enable notifications for things that actually matter on my phone. I’m also among the minority not staring down at my phone on a bus or train, partly because it gives me motion sickness. I also rarely wear headphones while out, due to preferring to tune into my environment or let my mind wander.So I think the problem is not the internet itself but how we use it. Many fall into the trap of semi-passive consumption of media, allowing those on the other side of that content to disproportionally influence their ideas and behaviors. Were more people wise and kind in their usage of the internet, that’s what would make it better.fr33_th1nk3rAviation is so integrated with the internet that there would be chaos at airports.

Although there are some areas of the internet which have become walled gardens of algorithms, AI slop and advertising, there are so many other areas where the spirit of the early internet lives on. One example is the “indieweb” where people amateurishly code their own websites, making public whatever content they want rather than staying within the bounds of media companies.The rise of the ‘indieweb’ also includes the resurgence of the email newsletter (or RSS feed if you like). Instead of scrolling on infinite social media feeds, I get my brain going with some thoughtfully written blog posts in my inbox, introducing me to perspectives I would never have come across in the offline world.

Anonymity and pseudonimity predominate and are exploited. You can’t tell the difference between a malign foreign actor and someone with a genuine grievance. Clickbait content is picked and amplified by the media giving it false weight. Frustratingly, the tools that ensure accountability and prevent anonymity have been around for over 20 years but technology companies have not implemented them. We are paying the price for the liberal and paranoid – albeit well-intentioned – philosophies on which the internet was founded which allow identity to be obfuscated. The ironic situation we now find ourselves means that criminals can communicate securely -using the said technologies- while keeping their identities secret. This wasn’t part of the plan but it could still be corrected. The question is, who is prepared to pick up the bill?ChrisGilbertI spend all Sunday alone in my flat.

The progressive fightback must start nowSun 4 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 14.08 ESTShareAcouple of the more disruptive boys in the class put red laces in their Dr Martens, because someone had told them that was how youshowed your support for the National Front. “Jew” was an everyday insult and the N-word was in regular circulation. There were no more than four or five non-white kids in the whole school: I can recall one Asian girl finding her art folder had been covered in racist abuse, and some adolescent desperado singling out a black boy for a spoken version of the same treatment, before insisting that his victim was in on the joke. He wasn’t: he looked at the ground and rushed away, full of the hurt he must have felt every day.This was what it was like in a Cheshire comprehensive school in the early-to-mid-1980s. Teenage racism was there in plain sight, and there was a scattering of people who seemed to take their prejudices – presumably passed down from parents and elder siblings – very seriously indeed. In what is now known as year 7, for example, each class was given a group of “sixth-form counsellors”, meant to show up once or twice a week and encourage ambition and hard work. One of ours was a tense, soft-spoken young man who liberally used racist epithets, backed the National Front and said he wanted to be a policeman. His view of the world, as far as I could tell, was summed up in a chant that a certain sort of playground thug knew by heart: “There ain’t no black in the union jack/Get back, get back, get back.”As all those allegations about Nigel Farage’s behaviour at Dulwich college have mounted up, the Reform UK leader hasfollowed his lawyers’ insistencethat they are “wholly untrue, defamatory, and malicious” with the claim that he “never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody”. And amid the resulting noise, thousands – possibly millions – of people must have instantly recalled experiences like these.They will also have heard echoes of their schooldays in what the accusations have inevitably triggered: yet another argument about the UK’s past, split between some voices whoput any alleged racismdown to different times and harmless high jinks, and others who understand that they came of age amid dire social attitudes that it took years to overturn. That second point of view, moreover, is now combined with a rising sense of alarm, because ideas and beliefs we thought had been defeated are rapidly eating into politics and the public mood.View image in fullscreenRightwing protesters hold a rally at the Port of Dover, as they clash with anti-fascist protesters over immigration, 30 January 2016.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyOn 30 December, the Institute For Public Policy Researchpublished a much-publicisedreport about how what it calls “ethnonationalist narratives” are winning over voters. Some of its findings suggested reasons for hope: a mere 3% of us, for example, think that being a good British citizen involves having white skin. But just over one-third of people nowthink true Britishnessis something people have to be born with, up from about one in five in 2023. This, the authors say, symbolises something that demands urgent action: “No longer consigned to the fringes of British politics, a view of the national community defined in ethnic terms and society as a hierarchy is stirring fear, anxiety and anger in people of all backgrounds.”Look at how fast all this is suddenly moving. Most provocations about the supposedly ethnic foundations of national identity used to be centred on Englishness; now, what is generating the most noise are claims about what it is to be British. Mainstream media outletsgive a platformto people who think that those “without native British ancestry”should be barred from being MPs. The Reform MP Sarah Pochinhas complainedthat: “It drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people.”The right’s obsession with immigration is starting to tip into an insistence on “remigration”, the polite term for the old idea of “sending ‘em back”. Beyond the arguments about new arrivals pulling down wages or eating up public services, we now hear claims about “cultural coherence” – yet another example of 21st-century rhetoric updating a familiar insistence: that what the union jack has always supposedly symbolised leaves no room for anything that isn’t stereotypically white.Which takes us back to the politics of history. Much of the political manoeuvring of the new right boils down to people who grew up in the same horrible cultural atmosphere that I did, basing a huge amount of what they say on the belief that the UK was simply a better place back then. They want, in other words, to live in a much more monocultural country, where Farage wouldn’tfeel his infamous uneaseabout the ubiquity in modern London of foreign languages, and white Britons could be more authentically themselves, free of liberal disapproval. Theirs is a retro utopia of camaraderie and freedom: if red bootlaces and everyday racism were once part of the same picture, they were mere trifles.Farage plays these games comparatively cleverly, mostly via rhetorical nods and winks. A much more clunky practitioner, by contrast, is the free-ranging shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, who followed last October’s reports ofhis claimsthat he had not seen “another white face” on a trip to an area of Birmingham withhis thoughts on the modern historyof English football. His focus was a period when he was just starting primary school, and the game was still indeliblyassociated not just with racism, but disorder so extreme that English clubs werebanned from European competition between 1985 and 1990, while Margaret Thatcher set upa “war cabinet”to somehow deal with the issue. In Jenrickworld, none of this happened. Despite “language, chants, and antics [that] were – at times – less than well-mannered”, he says the culture surrounding football in the 1980s “was largely all good-natured fun … where there was violence, the police put a quick but firm end to it. Such was the rhythm of British life.”View image in fullscreenJenrick has described 1980s football culture, when racism was endemic, as “largely all good-natured fun”.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesThat picture is hilariously wrong, but it stands as another example of a very modern trick: rightwing politicians shutting down their obvious links to the horrors of the UK’s past by denying that there were any such horrors in the first place. And so far, we have not heard nearly enough of the most effective response: that the Britain of yesteryear may have offered some of its people order and “fun”, but it was also a country of deep racism, petty violence, bitter industrial strife, riots, appalling police brutality, corruption in plain sight, awful attitudes to disability and more. You would have to be mad – or downright evil – to want to go back there: in every conceivable respect, modern Britain is better.Labour, it seems, has resolved to start the new year by launching renewed attacks on Farage and his party, based on Keir Starmer’s insistence that he isinvolved in“a fight for the soul of the country”. But whether a prime minister so wooden and mistrusted can successfully lead that battle seems doubtful. Besides, the pushback would surely be better helmed by musicians, film-makers, sportspeople, authors,YouTube influencersand whoever else might usefully contribute – the kind of people who could campaign with wit and optimism, reach broad audiences and take things out of the toxic, yah-boo atmosphere of Westminster politics.What they ought to be focused on is obvious: whether, from the perspective of the 21st century, the hatreds and delusions that once coursed around playgrounds, pubs and football grounds are going to look like pointers to the future or reminders of what we have to once again defeat. At some point over the next 12 months, we may well know the answer – which is why 2026’s stakes are so unbelievably high.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionNigel FarageRaceRobert JenrickcommentShareReuse this content"

He may also overstep now as regards IranSun 4 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 10.21 ESTShareDuring his presidential campaigns,Donald Trumppledged to end “forever wars”, abandon “nation-building” interventions and focus instead on reviving a US economy that, in his telling, had been deindustrialised by a floodtide of imports. Though Trump’s electoral victories cannot be attributed to any one thing, his “America first” narrative certainly struck a chord.But Trump’s use of force toseize the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, his full-bore support for Israel’s demolition of Gaza and hisbombing of Iran’s nuclear enrichment installationsshow that he’s no less willing than his predecessors to resort to military interventions.Trump already had Maduro in his sights. He offered a$50m bountyfor information leading to his capture,blockaded Venezuelan portsto stop sanctioned oil tankers and accused Maduro of involvement in drug trafficking. Still, it’s a safe bet that few outside the administration expected Trump to swoop into a country, grab its president and haul him to the US.Maduro will be tried for drug trafficking and “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, a fuzzy formulation suitably ominous to justify a move of dubious necessity and legality. The Trump administration hasn’t provided evidence tying Maduro to narcotics trafficking, nor has it proven thatVenezuelaposed a clear and present danger necessitating an armed attack.Venezuela has many problems, including drug gangs and authoritarian rule, but they hardly justify what Trump has done. If bad governance and repression by foreign leaders justify abducting them, Trump has a long list of offenders to choose from, including some backed by US economic and military support.Trump’s move can’t be justified by self-defence provisions in international law. Venezuela never threatened to attack the US (it lacks the capacity to do so), let alone attacked it. It’s the other way around: the US has attacked Venezuela and taken steps, such as the naval blockade, generally used in wartime.Trump says that the US constitution permits his intervention – that as commander in chief, he is duty bound to protect American personnel in danger. But Venezuela hadn’t put any US personnel at risk, let alone harmed them. Plus, Trump was building a case for tightening the screws on Maduro, and the Venezuelan leader would have been a fool to provide him with acasus belli.Trump’s most prominent charge against Venezuela’s government is that its drug traffickers have, with Maduro’s complicity, deluged the US with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, which is also used to alleviate severe pain. Even a2 milligramdose can prove fatal.The illegal use of fentanyl and other opioids in the US has certainly been rampant and deadly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)reports thatdeaths tied to synthetic drug overdoses, mainly fentanyl, soared from 782 in 2000 to 72,776 in 2023. However, they are estimated to have plummeted to 47,735 in 2024. Even so, the Trump White Housereckons thatthe costs attributable to “illicit opioids, primarily fentanyl” (including death, treatment, crime and lost labour productivity) totalled $2.7tn in 2023.The question, however, is what Venezuela has to do with any of this. Virtually all of the fentanyl smuggled into the US comes fromMexico, by way of China, which supplies the precursors, something theTrump administration itself concedes. The president neverthelesstold an audienceof top military officers in September that the US was attacking boats off Venezuela’s coast because they “were stacked up with bags of white powder that’s mostly fentanyl”.And Trump contends that Maduro is directly linked to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua criminal gang, adding that it’s “threatening an invasion” of the US – but, again, without providing proof and ignoring the fact that the gang has no army. Besides, Maduro’s government hasbeen on the offensiveagainst the group in recent years. The presidentalso insiststhat Venezuela “previously stole” oil and land that belonged to the US and that he would get these “assets” back. Like his other allegation, this one is fact-free.Venezuela began nationalising itsoil industry in 1976. Hugo Chávez, who served as president from 1999 till his death in 2013, expanded that policy. He mandatedin 2007that PDVSA, the state oil company, take a majority stake in projects in the oil-rich Orinoco region, including those of the US petroleum behemoths ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, both of whom wound up their operations rather than comply, unlike Chevron, BP, Norway’s Statoil and France’s Total. But there are no grounds for claiming that either the US government or any US petroleum company literally owned Venezuela’s oil or land and was robbed.The possible consequences of Trump’s intervention are worrisome for at least two reasons.First, we can’t know what will follow Maduro’s abduction. Venezuela’s state institutions, including the security services, remain intact and an interim president is in place –Delcy Rodríguez, who has been vice-president since 2018. But if street protests segue into clashes between the people and the state, things could quickly spiral out of control, just as they could if Trump’s interventionist agenda expands and encounters resistance.Venezuela’s main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel peace prize,welcomed US pressureto topple Maduro well before he was captured. Now she has hailed Venezuela’s “hour of freedom”. That could provide Trump cover to go further, though, as for Machado herself,he says she“doesn’t have the support within or the respect” to govern. Already, hehas announcedthat the US will “run” Venezuela temporarily, suggesting that he plans to do more than simply put Maduro in the dock. The same can be said for his arrogating the right to open up Venezuela’s oil sector to investments from US corporations.Second, Iran’s government is facing a nationwide uprising, andTrump warnedthat “we are locked and loaded and ready to go” if the regime starts killing protesters. Some havealready been killed.It’s hardly a given that Trump’s Venezuelan gambit will tempt him to try regime change in Iran. But if he does wade into Iran’s upheaval, the consequences – for Iran, the US and Iran’s neighbours – will be much more dangerous than anything that might happen in Venezuela. And Trump is nothing if not unpredictable.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAmericasIrancommentShareReuse this content"

The choice underlined the fact that while AI is being widely embraced, not least by corporate bosses keen to cut payroll costs, its downsides are also becoming obvious. In 2026, a reckoning with reality for AI represents a growing economic risk.Ed Zitron, the foul-mouthed figurehead of AI scepticism, argues pretty convincingly that, as things stand, the “unit economics” of the entire industry – the cost of servicing the requests of a single customer against the price companies are able to charge them –just don’t add up. In typically colourful language, he calls them “dogshit”.Revenues from AI are rising rapidly as more paying clients sign up but so far not by enough to cover the wild levels of investment under way: $400bn (£297bn) in 2025, with much more forecast in the next 12 months.Another vehement sceptic, Cory Doctorow, argues: “These companies are not profitable. They can’t be profitable. They keep the lights on by soaking up hundreds of billions of dollars in other people’s money and then lighting it on fire.”It’s not new for frontier businesses to be loss-making, sometimes for years. But moving into profitability tends to happen as costs fall. Each iteration of large language models (LLMs) has so far tended to be more expensive, burning up more data, energy and highly paid tech experts’ time.The vast datacentres required to train and run the models are so expensive to build and kit out that in many cases they are financed by debt, secured against future revenue.Recent analysis by Bloombergsuggested there had been $178.5bn of these datacentre credit deals in 2025 alone, with inexperienced new operators joining Wall Street firms in a “gold rush”.Yet the precious Nvidia chips with which the datacentres are equipped have a limited shelf life, potentially shorter than that of the loan agreements.As well as leverage – borrowing – the boom increasingly involves another bubble indicator: financial engineering, including the kinds ofcomplex, circular funding arrangementsthat carry ominous echoes of past corporate crashes.Believing generative AI will eventually produce enough revenue to match the colossal sums invested, relies – as in all bubbles – on telling big, dramatic stories about the scale of the transformation under way.So LLMs are not just brilliant tools for analysing and synthesising large amounts of information. They’re fast approaching “superintelligence”, as OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has it; or about toreplace human friendships, according to Mark Zuckerberg.They certainly do seem to be replacing some unfortunate human employees in specific sectors. Brian Merchant, the author of Blood in the Machine, which compares the backlash against big tech to the Luddite rebellion of the 19th century,has assembled scores of first-hand testimoniesfrom writers, coders and marketers laid off in favour of AI-generated outputs.Yet many of them highlight the bland quality of the work being produced by their digital replacements, or worse, the risks at play when sensitive tasks are shifted outside human control.Indeed, the dangers of charging headlong into replacing human workers wholesale have become increasingly apparent in recent months.In the UK, the high courtissued a warning about lawyers’ use of AIafter two cases in which examples of completely fictitious case law were cited.Police officers in Heber City, Utah, learned tomanually check the work of a transcription toolthey were using to draft write-ups from bodycam footage after it mistakenly claimed an officer had turned into a frog. Disney’s The Princess and the Frog was playing in the background.Specific examples such as these fail to take into account the costs of what Merchant calls the “slop layer” of AI-generated content coursing through every online space, making it harder to identify what is real or true.Doctorow argues: “AI isn’t the bow-wave of ‘impending superintelligence’. Nor is it going to deliver ‘humanlike intelligence’. It’s a grab-bag of useful (sometimes very useful) tools that can sometimes make workers’ lives better, when workers get to decide how and when they’re used.”From the AI bubble to Fed fears: the global economic outlook for 2026Read moreThought of in this way, these technologies may still have significant productivity benefits, but perhaps not quite significant enough to justify today’s toppy valuations and the tsunami of investment under way.Any rethink would cause chaos on financial markets. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)recently pointed out, the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks now account for 35% of the S&P500, up from 20% three years ago.A share price correction would have real-world consequences far beyond Silicon Valley, rippling out to hit retail investors on both sides of the Atlantic, Asian tech exporters and the lenders, including loosely regulated private equity firms, that bankrolled the sector’s expansion.In the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimatedin its budget forecasts, that a “global correction” scenario, in which UK and world stock prices fell 35% in the coming year, would knock 0.6% off the country’s GDP and cause a £16bn deterioration in the public finances.That would be relatively manageable compared with the 2008 global financial crisis, in which UK institutions were leading players. But it would still be keenly felt in an economy struggling to find its feet.So while it is perhaps understandable to anticipate a frisson of schadenfreude at the thought of big tech’s super-rich boss class being humbled, we’re all living in their world, and we would not escape the consequences.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Economics viewpointEconomicsGlobal economyComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Do read onSun 4 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 15.22 ESTShareIlove spoiling the plot for myself. It’s something I do fairly regularly. Before watching a film, I tend to open Wikipedia and read the entire plot synopsis. If every episode of a series has been uploaded to a streamer, I often open the last episode, watch the final five minutes, close it and then start from the beginning. I did as such when the final season of Top Boy dropped in the autumn of 2023. When I tweeted about it from my now-deleted X account, I drew a range of bewildered and outraged responses, including from the officialTop Boy Netflix account.I’m sure you also probably think I’m a sociopath, a philistine or stubbornly impatient (the last has some truth). But the fact is, sometimes spoilers relieve a sense of burden – that you might have to stick out some film or TV show with this uncertainty hanging over you, this itch to just know who gets snuffed out or who did the snuffing. Isn’t that the point of watching something, I hear you say. Well, yes. But frankly, I’m not willing to put that effort into every bit of media I consume – particularly in the streaming age where there is such a constant abundance of things to watch, all of it varying in quality, and the pay-off is not always guaranteed.I find that knowing what happens brings a different kind of pleasure to the viewing experience, too. You feel like you’re one step ahead of the characters, and you point out the bits of foreshadowing and feel pleased with yourself. The ancient Greeks often knew how tragedies were going to end from the onset; early on in Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex, it is prophesied that Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother, and the entertainment comes from watching him unknowingly hurtle towards his destiny.Sometimes, plot points have been spoiled simply because the text is so old that everyone publicly discusses it anyway. I watched Cruel Intentions for the first time the other weekend, to my mind an unfairly maligned teen film, having already seen the thrilling conclusion with Kathryn Merteuil’s character, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, exposed at the funeral of her stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont. Knowing what happened at the end didn’t make the downfall any less exquisite; if anything, Kathryn’s repeated cruelty made me even more excited for it. And I think old art is the best case for why spoilers are sometimes good – if you’ve repeatedly watched something and your enjoyment hasn’t diminished, then surely it’s about the writing and entertainment rather than the big reveals?Now don’t get me wrong – I don’t believe in spoiling things for other people, and would never casually post plot twists or key scenes on my social media. I think that’s a bizarrely selfish practice. And I won’t read spoilers for everything – whenever I watch a new film in the cinema, I don’t bring out my phone to Google the plot, because I think there’s a sanctity to the theatrical experience. Perhaps this all speaks to how streaming has cheapened our consumption habits; if you’re watching a series on your phone, why not read up on it at the same time on the same screen? Who knows, but anyway, I’m about to go Google whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio survives at the end of Titanic.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsExplore more on these topicsFilmThe hill I will die onTV streamingSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

What tomorrow?Stephen WertheimHe took office promising to annex Greenland and take back the Panama Canal. Now that he has ousted Maduro, other countries could be nextSun 4 Jan 2026 01.27 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 08.16 ESTShare“This is genius,” Donald Trump enthused. It was 22 February 2022. Vladimir Putin had just declared parts of eastern Ukraine to be independent and sent in Russian troops to serve as so-called peacekeepers. The once and future American president was impressed, even inspired. “We could use that on our southern border,” Trump mused.Trump didn’t know then that he was speaking at the start of a full-scale invasion that has lasted nearly four years and inflicted upwards of 1.5 million casualties and counting. And Trump doesn’t know now what he has unleashed in Venezuela. The South American country is not Ukraine, nor, for that matter, is it Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. But by ordering military strikes to seize dictator Nicolás Maduro, Trump has thrown a country of around 28 million people into uncertainty and tossed aside the most obvious, hard-won lesson of decades ofUS foreign policyfailures: regime-change wars are easy to start and hard to win, much less to turn into anything resembling genuine success.So far, Trump has taken step one, if that. He has yet to bring down Venezuela’s regime, only to decapitate it, scooping up the man at the top. In his speech announcing the war, however, Trump played the conquering hero. The president boasted at length about the “overwhelming military power” he had exhibited, as though the United States did not possess a long record of smashing operational triumphs — recall “shock and awe” in Baghdad – that gave way to strategic disaster.To hear Trump tell it, the hard part is probably over. Now the peace, prosperity and freedom will begin. “We are going to run the country,” he declared, and to do so, Trump said he was willing to put boots on the ground and eager to get oil gushing out of it. Plan A for post-Maduro governance, Trump suggested, was to leave Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, in power, because she would help the United States do what it wanted. Within two hours, Rodríguez insisted that Maduro remained Venezuela’s rightful leader and denounced the United States as an illegal, imperialist invader seeking to plunder the country.On to Plan B, then.Whatever happens next in Venezuela, the consequences will not be confined there. Trump plainly intended his attack to assert US ownership of the entire region. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he intoned. In the national security strategy released last month, the administration declared a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, claiming a mandate to use any means necessary to excise almost any kind of external influence from theAmericas. The administration has barely begun to apply its ballyhooed corollary. Trump prefers to cast entities closer to home – migrants, gangs and cartels – as existential threats to the United States, invading the country from without, subverting it from within.Trump’s attack on Venezuela confirms what his semester of speedboat strikes in the Caribbean suggested: the United States is transmuting the now-exhausted war on terror into a war on so-called narco-terror. Enmity once directed at terrorists in the Middle East is turning toward a kaleidoscope of border-crossing threats in the western hemisphere. Trump’s definition of these threats is almost infinitely porous, extending to what he has repeatedly called “the enemy from within”. Not for nothing did Trump pause from his address on Venezuela to ad lib about the troops he has sent to patrol American cities.Today, the target was Caracas. What tomorrow? Trump has already drawn up a menu. He took office promising to annex Greenland and take back the Panama Canal. Now that he has ousted Maduro, he could apply much the same rationale to attack any number of countries. Trump claimed yesterday that “the cartels are running Mexico”, an assertion that contains all the justification Trump would need to invade it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, warned the government of Cuba to be concerned.Even if the best-case scenario transpires in Venezuela – if a stable, oil-gushing, pro-American democracy suddenly springs to life — success may embolden the administration to find out just how far it can go to remake the region to its liking.But best cases rarely come to pass. More likely, Donald Trump’s luck with hit-and-run military strikes is about to run out. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he said in his first term. Then what kind of nation is Trump’s America?Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law SchoolExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUS foreign policyAmericasUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Its repercussions will be felt far beyond the regionSun 4 Jan 2026 13.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 15.16 ESTShareAmid the immense confusion surrounding the USstrikeson Venezuela, the seizure of the president, Nicolás Maduro, and Donald Trump’s announcement that the US will “run” the country and“take back the oil”, one thing is clear – they set a truly chilling precedent. The US has agrim historyof interference, invasion and occupation in the region, but the early hours of Saturday saw its first major military attack on South American land. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Mr Trump declared. The decision to unilaterally attack another country and abduct its leader – days after hepublicly sought an off-ramp– has still wider repercussions. It should alarm us all.Venezuelans have endured a repressive, kleptocratic and incompetent regime under Mr Maduro, widely believed to have stolen the last election. They now face profound uncertainty at best. Mr Trump has suggested thatMr Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, would follow US instructions, and dismissed the rightwing opposition leader and Nobel prize-winner María Corina Machado as a plausible replacement. But Ms Rodríguez, now interim president, has so farstruck a defiant tone– and other parts of the decapitated regime are more hardline.A man who won power promising to abandon foreign wars now says he is “not afraid of boots on the ground”. Rebranding the Department of Defense as the Department of War was more than posturing. He does not see the world’s superpower as policeman; he is turning it into a rogue state. He believes the US’s might allows it to do as it wishes with minimal cost: witness the strikes on Nigeria, on Iran’s nuclear facilities and elsewhere. He promises that Venezuelan oil means this latest episode “won’t cost us a penny”.George W Bush invaded Iraq on a lie. But thisillegal attackcame withoutUN resolutions of any kindor congressional approval; Democrats were not even informed and say they were actively misled in briefings. Mr Trump doesn’t seek to bend international norms, but to destroy them. Put aside the message this sends to Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and others, and ask where the US itself is heading. While the raid reportedly killed 40 Venezuelans, including civilians, no US personnel died. Mr Trump’s growing sense of invincibility will surely embolden further adventurism. He has not ruled out military action overGreenlandandtold Fox News: “Something is going to have to be done with Mexico.”No one buys the pretext that this is about drugs. Venezuela is only a minor conduit for cocaine; Mr Trump recentlypardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernándezfor drugs and weapons crimes. And Mr Trump himself made it clear that he is driven by the lure of oil as well as machismo, the ideology of some in his administration, and the desire for glory as domestic popularity wanes.The global reaction, especially in Europe, has – with honourable exceptions – been shockingly muted. That’s not due to Mr Maduro’s sins, but fear of Mr Trump’s wrath. The strong reaction from the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, was welcome, but this episode underscores the institution’s growing irrelevance. Mr Trump’s anti-interventionist domestic base could yet press him to turn attention back home – but soaring healthcare premiums, economic unhappiness and the Epstein files increase his appetite for distraction.We are not yet 12 months in to his four-year term. Sir Keir Starmer and others may regret it if they stay silent now, given what – and who – could be next.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But his affordability agenda speaks to the timesSun 4 Jan 2026 13.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe multiplefirstsachieved by New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, have been well chronicled: he is the first Muslim to occupy that role, the first south Asian and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the youngest mayor of the largest city in the United States for over a century, havingreceivedmore votes in November’s election than any candidate since the 1960s. And politically, he is probably the most leftwing incumbent of the office sinceFiorello La Guardiain the 1930s and 40s.Hardly surprising then, that Mr Mamdani’s extraordinary rise to prominence should be accompanied by high expectations and tense anticipation. At last Thursday’s inauguration ceremony, he promised to “govern expansively and audaciously”. Whether he succeeds in doing so will have considerable ramifications for progressive politics more widely.Pledgingto make New York “a city we can afford”, Mr Mamdani campaigned on plans to introduce free universal childcare, hugely increase the availability of cheaper housing, and generally reduce everyday costs of living for residents. In order to finance this programme, he has restated his intention to raise tax rates on the very wealthy, and on corporations. Linking the vision of a livable metropolis to a politics of redistribution, this approach has assembled a coalition of voters ranging from young renters to union members, migrants and the professional middle classes.Progressive parties around the world have taken note. The political dynamics of New York, the home of Wall Street and a global centre for the arts, are not straightforwardly generalisable. But the affordability agenda that delivered Mr Mamdani’s flagship success has also fuelled a political revival for Democrats instatessuch as New Jersey and Virginia. In Europe too, the centre-left has fared best when focusing relentlessly on improving everyday life for the less well-off. The surprisevictoryof the D66 party in the recent Dutch election, for example, was largely attributed to its apparent seriousness about addressing the Netherlands’ chronic housing shortage.Mr Mamdani thus finds himself a youthful trailblazer for a radical politics of civic renewal and inclusion that, if it works, could counter more generally the rise of the populist far right. Donald Trumppromiseda “blue-collar boom” when he was re-elected. He has insteadpresidedover a widening equality gap, in which the wealthy have disproportionately benefited from tax cuts and a soaring stock market. There is space here for a new working-class politics of the left. In that spirit, Mr Mamdani’s head of budget, Sherif Soliman, hasstatedthat New York needs to be a livable home not just for Wall Street bankers, but for “low-wage workers, be it in retail or healthcare”.Formidable headwinds await, not least federal funding negotiations with a hostile Mr Trump, and opposition to what – inhistoricalterms – would be modest tax rises for high-income earners. There will also need to be some skilful coalition-building, not least with the Democratic governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, who haspreviouslyspoken out against the hikes. Nevertheless, the political courage shown by New York’s charismatic new mayor during his ascent to power suggests that, in the heartland of global capital, he has the ability to make a difference. In an era in which swathes of blue-collar voters continue to drift rightwards, the stakes are high indeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If, for those who are not white and born in the UK, citizenship is a gift of the state that can be withdrawn, then it’s not citizenship at all but a form of limited leave like any other.ThusShamima Begumis left to rot in a refugee camp, despite never having been tried for any crime, while the fascist nail bomber David Copeland is serving a sentence in a UK jail. If the Overton window is shifting on this issue, it’s being pushed by the fact that Keir Starmer is “tell[ing] a story about what Britain is and what he wants it to be” (Abd el-Fattah citizenship row shows shift on questions of national identity, 29 December), and it’s one that echoes the rhetoric of Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch.Labour’sFebruary 2025 policy changeestablishes a blanket presumption against granting citizenship to anyone who previously entered the UK illegally, regardless of how much time has passed. Moreover, theDeprivation of Citizenship Orders (Effect during Appeal) Act 2025, recently hurried through parliament, represents a fundamental shift in how citizenship deprivation cases are handled during the appeals process.Under the old system, individuals who successfully appealed against their citizenship deprivation had their status restored while government appeals continued. The new act ensures that deprivation orders remain in effect throughout all appeals processes, including any further government appeals to higher courts.This means that individuals stripped of their citizenship would remain non-citizens until every legal avenue has been exhausted. So long as citizenship remains an absolute right for some, whatever they do, however abhorrent, and a conditional gift for others, the perception that only white British-born people are really citizens will be further entrenched.Nick MossLondonThank you for Naomi Klein’s thoughtful reflection (Alaa Abd el-Fattah’s tweets were wrong, but he is no ‘anti-white Islamist’. Why does the British right want you to believe he is?, 31 December). I was uncomfortable listening to the shadow home secretary on the BBC refer to him as a “scumbag” repeatedly, despite governments of all hues having fought for his release. I thought such playground name-calling should be beneath a member of the shadow cabinet.Reading Naomi Klein’s piece reminded me of Abd el-Fattah’s courageous activism and invites us all to judge him on his deeds. To defend only speech with which we agree and not accept Abd el-Fattah’s apology for old, regretted posts is a very slippery slope.Sally MarchLondonKemi Badenoch has called into question Alaa Abd el-Fattah’s British citizenship on the grounds of his “social media activity, public statements and patterns of belief”. I look forward to her comments on Nigel Farage’s citizenship.Dr Richard CarterPutney, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The planet is already adapting to its future. The question is whether we will do the same.The problem is not simply technical or financial; it is profoundly moral. The world is divided into three groups: those in need, who are already suffering and losing homes and livelihoods; those driven by greed, who profit from delay and denial; and those who claim to care, but hide behind endless excuses for inaction. Meanwhile, the clock keeps ticking.Poorer nations, which did least to create this crisis, are being asked to pay the highest price. Wealthy nations debate costs and political convenience while lives are being lost and futures erased. That is not policy failure; it is injustice.Adaptation funding is not charity. Emissions cuts are not optional. Honesty, courage and compassion are now survival tools. Anything less is betrayal.Keith NichollsSwanseaYour leader says “What we can do to minimise, or at least reduce, the risks to life from such events [as violent storms]– as well as more gradual changes – is what climate adaptation experts think about all the time.” Accompanying such storms will be sea level rises, affecting coastal infrastructure.This raises the question of the efficacy of building new energy plants on vulnerable coastal areas, such as the North Sea coast in Suffolk and the Somerset Levels. The Office for Nuclear Regulation has hosted several roundtable discussions on these dangers in the past year.The two newest nuclear plants are at Hinkley C, in an area that suffered Britain’s biggest everflood in 1607; and at Sizewell C, where huge sea walls are having to be constructed to protect the plant from a Fukushima-style inundation from North Sea level rise and increased storms.It is ironic that nuclear proponents argue such plants are needed to combat climate change.Dr David LowrySenior international research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security StudiesToo many people are left to carry on their daily lives in complete denial of the new climate reality that is unravelling around us. Political leadership is urgently needed, but most of our electorate seem blissfully ignorant of the implications of our maximised consumer lifestyles.Previously our government has brought in laws replacing cigarette and tobacco branding with succinct facts and hard-hitting pictures. This precedent could now be followed with laws to replace all petrol station branding with informative facts from the latest attribution studies and scientific research, together with pictures of the destruction, devastation and human impacts of recent extreme weather.The terrifying reality of our current direction of travel needs to be spelled out in a concerted “government health warning” style of information campaign to get enough people supporting the kinds of change required to leave a livable planet for future generations.Leo YoungOxfordExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisClimate financelettersShareReuse this content"

In the year to come, please remember that, 29 December), Tony Hall makes a reference to how important Radio Cumbria is to the people of Cumbria, and tries to suggest the same is true for Radio Scotland and Radio Wales “serving the nations”.In reality, and unlike in England, BBC Radio no longer serves local communities inScotlandand Wales. For example, Radio Scotland’s morning news programme tends to repeat the same news stories you can hear on Radio 4’s Today programme, except where there are occasional news stories affecting the whole of Scotland.Radio Cumbria (as with other English local BBC radio stations) will include items about Carlisle, Kendal, Barrow and many other parts of the county and also report decisions and debates in local councils. Radio Scotland – based in Glasgow – provides no local community coverage in Scotland. As a result, residents of Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, Fort William and so on have a greater affinity with their more community-based commercial/independent local radio stations than the BBC. The same is probably the case inWales.If there is one thing the BBC could do to improve community representation in Scotland and Wales, it should break up these “national” radio stations and emulate what it does inEngland– a network of genuinely local community-based radio stations. With the ongoing decline in regional newspapers, the need for this is essential to give local communities the strong voice they deserve, but currently do not get.Stuart WalkerInverkeilor, AngusHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromMike Hine,Torran TurnerandTed WatsonSun 4 Jan 2026 12.33 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 15.22 ESTShareI respectfully disagree with the suggestion that the use of “six-seven” represents a decline in logic or understanding among pupils (Letters, 29 December). From a developmental perspective, this kind of behaviour is a normal and even healthy part of growing up. Children and young people often adopt shared phrases, jokes or nonsensical trends as a way of belonging to a group. The meaning is not always the point; participation is.As a teacher, understanding and acknowledging this behaviour helps me connect with pupils’ lived realities. When students feel seen and understood – rather than dismissed for engaging in harmless trends – trust is built. That sense of connection plays a crucial role in the learning process: pupils are more likely to engage, take risks and respond positively to guidance when they feel their world is recognised within the classroom.Being part of a group – even one built around something as trivial as repeatedly saying “six-seven” – supports social development, identity formation and emotional wellbeing. Not everything children do needs to be logical, purposeful or productive. Playfulness and shared silliness are essential parts of human interaction and growth.While it remains important to teach critical thinking and to help pupils reflect on why they do things, this should sit alongside an understanding that harmless humour does not indicate a lack of intelligence.Hope in schools is fostered not only through kindness and honesty, but also through laughter, shared experiences and relationships built on mutual respect. Allowing space for these moments strengthens learning rather than undermining it.Alexsandro PinzonMitcham, London“Six-seven” may well be, as Marlon Minty says, “the embracement of idiocy”, but I think that the “promotion of logic and understanding” is not best served by calling primary schoolchildren “students” – the kind of language inflation which has moved the term from clearly meaning those in further or higher education, to meaning anyone in secondary school, to now apparently meaning any school attender over five years old. Can play-group “scholars” be far behind?Mike HineKingston upon Thames, LondonI read Marlon Minty’s letter on how saying “six-seven” is embracing idiocy with some sadness. I personally think Doctor Who put it best when the 14th Doctor asked Donna why Mrs Bean is funny – some things just are, to some people. In the same way Dick and Dom yelling “bogeys” at ever louder volumes was funny to a younger generation, or how my younger sister could be brought to hysterics by merely saying the word “pants” to her as a child.If it’s not grounded in something harmful such as racism or sexism, I don’t think it does kids any disservice to enjoy the nonsensical. They find it funny; for us grownups, ours is merely to wonder why. When we pooh-pooh it from on high, or demand it makes sense, all we’re really doing is telling children that the things they find funny or enjoy are wrong, and with it we steal a little bit of their childhoods in a way that is unkind. We don’t have to understand it for them to enjoy it. It all boils down to a short sentence: let people have nice things. Like any fad, it will fade in time. Let them have the joy it brings for now.Torran TurnerLittleborough, Greater ManchesterI must disagree with Marlon Minty about the “six-seven” craze when he says: “When we do stupid things without any understanding of what or why we are doing it, we reduce ourselves to idiots.” However, as Coco Khan says, it’s “deployed at random to annoy adults”. That is one point to it. I remember as a child in the 1960s doing very similar thingsFor example, the whole class would spread their fingers on their heads when a teacher entered the room – no idea why.More to the point, embracing the illogical and nonsensical is a hallmark of surreal and absurd comedy, of the dadaism kind. Even though the kids may not invokedada, it is the same illogical, surreal nonsense as “performance art”.Ted WatsonBrightonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The 40-year-old is believed to have been informed of this on the authority of Wilcox, who reports to Omar Berrada, the chief executive.Amorim took over United in November 2024. While Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who leads United’s football policy, previously stated Amorim should be given three years to prove his worth, it is understood there are now reservations within the hierarchy regarding the Portuguese.Matheus Cunha earns Manchester United point as Leeds keep up unbeaten runRead moreThese concerns were in place before his public outburst on Sunday after the1-1 draw against Leeds, when he insisted he is United’s manager, not just the coach, and said that he may “move on” when his contract runs out in 18 months.These earlier misgivings were underlined by the Guardian reporting in mid-December areluctance to sell Kobbie Mainoo, who is out of favour under Amorim. The 20-year-old midfielder, who is currently injured, is yet to start in the Premier League this season but the hierarchy believe Mainoo could convince Amorim – or a future United head coach – he is worth a regular place.On Friday Amorim refused to clarify previous comments he made on Christmas Eve. Then he said: “I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen.”Asked if this was because he had been informed of a change in budget or if Wilcox had spoken to him, Amorim said: “I don’t want to talk about that … You are very smart.”Amorim is considered at United to be temperamental, making his position unclear. Although the head coach stated after the Leeds match he would not resign, whether Amorim remains in place is yet to be decided. As Berrada’s appointment, Wilcox is thought to have the greater support from the chief executive.Amorim further inflamed the situation on Sunday with his impassioned press conference at Elland Road, in which the Portuguese also pointedly told the scouting department and sporting director “to do their job”.“I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,” he said after Matheus Cunha’s goal cancelled out Brenden Aaronson’s opener, keeping United sixth in the table. “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United – not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear. I know my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, [José] Mourinho or [Antonio] Conte but I’m the manager.“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit, I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”When asked about transfer policy, he said: “Every department, the scouting department, the sporting director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.” He added: “If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club”, before abruptly ending the press conference.The 40-year-old’s official job title is, in fact, head coach. It has also been reported that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, has questioned his tactics.Additional reporting by Aaron BowerExplore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimLeeds UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The former Hull City manager was accompanied by ­Strasbourg’s president, Marc Keller, and sporting director, David Weir.Chelsea’s board and sporting directors are big fans of Rosenior. It remains to be seen if he is installed in time for the Premier League side’s trip to Fulham on Wednesday. Chelsea’s Under-21s coach, Calum McFarlane, was in interim charge for Sunday’s1-1 draw with Manchester City.Rosenior was placed on a small shortlist after Maresca parted ­company with Chelsea. Porto’s ­Francesco Farioli is admired and there was also interest in Filipe Luís of Flamengo. Luís led ­Flamengoto victory against Chelseaat last summer’s Club World Cup. The Brazilian also played for the club.BlueCo are keen to find a quality replacement for Rosenior at Strasbourg. Filipe Coelho and Jean-Marc Kuentz are expected to take interim charge. It is understood that the former Wolves manager Gary O’Neil is a contender to take over on a permanent basis.

The Panthers won the tiebreaker with the best record within the division.The Falcons completed a season sweep of the Saints (6-11), who had their four-game winning streak end.Trailing 16-10, the Saints drove from their 25 to the Atlanta 20 before Alford returned his interception of Tyler Shough’s pass intended for Dante Pettis 59 yards to the Saints 27 with 3:14 remaining. The play set up Zane Gonzalez’s fourth field goal, a 38-yarder, to extend Atlanta’s lead to nine points.Shough answered with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ronnie Bell with 1:11 remaining, but Atlanta’s Kyle Pitts recovered an onside kick.Cleveland Browns 20-18 Cincinnati BengalsMyles Garrett set the NFL’s single-season record with his 23rd sack and Shedeur Sanders led a late scoring drive that was capped by Andre Szmyt’s 49-yard field goal as time expired to help the Cleveland Browns rally for a 20-18 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in the season finale Sunday.Garrett sacked Joe Burrow with 4:09 remaining in the fourth quarter for the record-setting sack, surpassing the 22 and a half by Michael Strahan and TJ Watt. Burrow was in the shotgun formation on first-and-10 at the Browns 45-yard line.After Ja’Marr Chase’s four-yard touchdown catch gave the Bengals (6-11) an 18-17 advantage with 1:29 remaining, Sanders directed a 10-play, 40-yard drive to give the Browns (5-12) two straight victories for the first time in two years.Sanders was 3 of 6 passing for 33 yards on the final drive, including an 11-yard completion to Jerry Jeudy with 31 seconds left to get the Browns in Szmyt’s range. Dylan Sampson had two carries for seven yards to get it closer for Szmyt.Sanders finished 11 of 22 for 111 yards. He also had a fumble in the first quarter that led to Cincinnati’s first touchdown.Dallas Cowboys 17-34 New York GiantsJaxson Dart threw the 14th and 15th touchdown passes of his rookie year and the New York Giants ended their lost season on a two-game winning streak by beating the Dallas Cowboys 34-17 on Sunday.That and other results around the NFL took the Giants (4-13) out of the running for a top-two pick and clinched No 1 for Las Vegas. New York routed the Raiders last week to end a nine-game skid.Dart has said he cares more about winning than draft position and played like it in his 12th professional start. He was 22 of 32 for 231 yards with TD passes to Daniel Bellinger – on a shovel pass-and-run – and Tyrone Tracy.While the Giants were shorthanded because of injuries and illnesses, they treated this like any other game with their starters going the distance. Dallas (7-9-1) took it more like an exhibition game, including Dak Prescott exiting after halftime.Prescott completed seven of 11 passes for 70 yards and lost a fumble off a botched snap before being replaced at quarterback by Joe Milton to begin the third quarter. Prescott finished the season with 4,552 yards passing, the second most of his decade-long career behind only 4,902 in 2019.View image in fullscreenCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett celebrates after setting the NFL single-season sacks record.Photograph: Jeff Dean/APGreen Bay Packers 3-16 Minnesota VikingsJJ McCarthy had a productive first half before he was injured again, fullback CJ Ham rushed for a short touchdown, and the Minnesota Vikings finished a frustrating season by beating the resting Green Bay Packers 16-3 on Sunday.Green Bay (9-7-1) were locked into the No 7 seed in the NFC playoffs and had nothing to play for.McCarthy, who went 14 for 23 for 182 yards passing, pulled himself out after his first throw of the third quarter so the athletic training staff could examine his right hand and did not return. Backup Max Brosmer took it from there, helping Justin Jefferson reach the 100-yard mark for the first time in 12 games as the Vikings (9-8) coasted to their fifth consecutive victory.Jefferson had already secured his sixth straight 1,000-yard season, only the third receiver in NFL history to accomplish that feat.With Jordan Love safely watching on the sideline and Malik Willis recovering from injuries, the Packers gave Clayton Tune his second career start at quarterback and netted minus-7 passing yards. Dallas Turner had two of Minnesota’s four sacks that racked up 41 lost yards for Green Bay.Tennessee Titans 7-41 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes, breaking the franchise’s single-season record for total scores, and the Jacksonville Jaguars won the AFC South and earned a home playoff game with a 41-10 drubbing of Tennessee on Sunday.It was most lopsided outcome in series history.The Jaguars (13-4) clinched their third division title in nine years, swept the Titans (3-14) for the third time in four seasons and topped a dozen wins for just the second time in the team’s 31-year history.Jacksonville, though, will have to wait several hours to learn its postseason seeding and opponent. The Jaguars could land the AFC’s No 1 seed but more likely will end up as the third and host Buffalo, Houston or the Los Angeles Chargers next week.No one should want to play the Jaguars, who have won eight in a row and nine of 10 since their bye. And Lawrence has been the hottest quarterback in the league during the streak.Indianapolis Colts 30-38 Houston TexasCJ Stroud accounted for two touchdowns and Ka’imi Fairbairn made a go-ahead field goal with 12 seconds left to lift the Houston Texans to a 38-30 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday that extended their winning streak to nine games.The victory gives the Texans (12-5) the No 5 seed in the AFC playoffs.Defensive tackle Tommy Togiai scooped up a fumble on the final play and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to pad the lead.The Texans clinched a third straight postseason berth last week and they had a chance to win the AFC South with a victory and a Jacksonville loss. But with the Jaguars up big over the Titans at halftime, coach DeMeco Ryans opted to rest quarterback Stroud, defensive stars Will Anderson Jr, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley and several other starters after the break.The Colts led 30-29 after a field goal with about two and a half minutes to go before Fairbairn’s 43-yard kick put the Texans on top 32-30 and gave him a career-high six field goals in the game.Kansas City Chiefs 12-14 Las Vegas RaidersDaniel Carlson made a career-long 60-yard field goal with eight seconds left to give Las Vegas a 14-12 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday and end the Raiders’ 10-game losing streak.Carlson and Kansas City’s Harrison Butker each made four field goals, with Butker hitting a 41-yarder with 1:01 left to give the Chiefs a short-lived 12-11 lead.This was the first victory for the Raiders (3-14) over the Chiefs (6-11) at Allegiant Stadium. The Chiefs, who had won all five previous meetings in Las Vegas, lost their sixth straight game and eighth in 10.Las Vegas’ Ashton Jeanty rushed for 87 yards, giving him 975 for the season that is second among Raiders rookies to the 1,150 yards Josh Jacobs gained in 2019. Jeanty’s 1,321 yards from scrimmage broke the club rookie record set by Jacobs (1,316).Much of the intrigue about the outcome was eliminated before kickoff when the New York Giants defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-17, guaranteeing the Raiders the top pick in this year’s NFL draft. A Giants loss would have meant that Las Vegas would get that selection only with a loss to the Chiefs.View image in fullscreenNew England Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson, left, stiff-arms a Miami Dolphins cornerback while running for a touchdown on Sunday.Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/APNew York Jets 8-35 Buffalo BillsAfter taking the first snap, Josh Allen headed to the sideline and joined the 70,000-plus fans to watch backup Mitch Trubisky throw four touchdown passes as the Buffalo Bills bid a likely farewell to their long-time home with a 35-8 rout of the New York Jets on Sunday.Gabe Davis caught two touchdown passes and Ty Johnson had a TD run and a scoring catch in an outing during which the playoff-bound Bills (12-5) rested a majority of their starters.Buffalo’s defense, meantime, manhandled an injury-depleted and backup-filled Jets offense that was blanked through three and a half quarters and finished with 122 yards offense and nine first downs.The win, coupled with the Los Angeles Chargers’ loss at Denver, led to Buffalo moving up one spot in clinching the No 6 seed. The Bills will travel to play the AFC South champion Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round next weekend.It’ll be the third playoff meeting between the teams, with Jacksonville winning both. The Jaguars defeated Buffalo 30-27 in what stood as Bills Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly’s final game in 1996. More recently, the Jaguars beat Buffalo 10-3 in 2017 in the Bills first playoff appearance after ending a 17-year postseason drought.Arizona Cardinals 20-37 LA RamsMatthew Stafford passed for 259 yards and threw two of his four touchdown passes to Colby Parkinson, and the Los Angeles Rams secured the No 5 seed in the NFC playoffs with a 37-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.Tyler Higbee returned from injury with five receptions for 91 yards and a key fourth-quarter TD for the Rams (12-5), who will visit the NFC South champion Carolina Panthers (8-9) in the wild-card round.Puka Nacua made a one-handed TD grab among his 10 catches for 76 yards for the Rams, who snapped their first two-game skid of the season. Stafford passed Dan Marino for seventh place on the NFL’s career TD passes list while finishing his MVP-caliber season leading the NFL with 4,707 yards passing and 46 TDs – the second most in league history by a quarterback at least 37 years old.Sean McVay’s team clinched its third straight playoff berth last month, but the Rams blew the No 1 overall seed with road losses to Seattle and Atlanta in their past two games. Now they’ll have to win in Charlotte, where they lost 31-28 on 30 November.McVay went against his usual policy and didn’t rest his starters for the relatively meaningless regular-season finale because he wanted his team to snap out of its costly two-game slump.LA Chargers 3-19 Denver BroncosThe Denver Broncos secured the AFC’s top playoff seed with a 19-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers’ bevy of backups Sunday, a victory fueled by Ja’Quan McMillian’s 45-yard interception return for a touchdown.Wil Lutz was 4-for-4 on field goals as the Broncos (14-3) tied their franchise record for most victories in a season and earned their first No 1 playoff seed since 2015, which they parlayed into a third Super Bowl title.They’ll get a week off before hosting their first playoff game in a decade, which could be against these same Chargers (11-6) if L.A. beats the Patriots (14-3) at New England in the wild-card round next weekend.Broncos quarterback Bo Nix had one of his worst games of the season, throwing for just 38 yards in the first half and 141 overall, but he tied Russell Wilson’s record of 24 wins in his first two NFL seasons.With no chance to win the division, the Chargers treated this game much like a bye week as they prepare to hit the road for the playoffs in the wild-card round. Coach Jim Harbaugh sat several of his starters, most notably quarterback Justin Herbert, safety Derwin James and OLB Tuli Tuipulotu.Miami Dolphins 10-38 New England PatriotsRhamondre Stevenson ran for two touchdowns and caught another from MVP contender Drake Maye, and the New England Patriots completed their remarkable turnaround season with a 38-10 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.Stevenson rushed seven times for 131 yards as New England posted its first sweep of the Dolphins since the 2016 season. TreVeyon Henderson added touchdown runs of 2 and 5 yards.The Patriots finished 14-3, their most victories since they won the Super Bowl to cap the 2016 season. The AFC East champions will be No. 2 seed in the playoffs and host the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round next weekend. Denver prevented New England from earning the AFC’s top seed by beating the Chargers 19-3 on Sunday.Miami (7-10) finished with its second straight sub-.500 season under coach Mike McDaniel following back-to-back playoff appearances in his first two seasons.Maye completed 14 of 18 passes for 191 yards and a touchdown before taking a seat early in the fourth quarter. Henderson’s five-yard TD run was set up by a 56-yard run by Stevenson on the second play of the Patriots’ game-opening drive.Detroit Lions 19-16 Chicago BearsJared Goff led five scoring drives, Jake Bates kicked a 42-yard field goal as time expired and the Detroit Lions regrouped to beat the NFC North champion Chicago Bears 19-16 on Sunday after blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter.The Bears (11-6) stumbled into the playoffs with back-to-back losses, though they secured the No 2 seed in the NFC with Washington beating Philadelphia. Chicago will host Green Bay in a wild-card game next week and would have home-field advantage in the divisional round if it beats the Packers.Caleb Williams set the franchise’s single-season passing record and threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes as the Bears wiped out a 16-0 deficit.The Lions (9-8) ended a disappointing season on a winning note when Bates nailed a 42-yarder. A 26-yard pass from Goff to Amon-Ra St Brown helped set up the field goal, and Detroit came out on top after losing three in a row.Washington Commanders 24-17 Philadelphia EaglesThe Eagles’ backup plan backfired, and the Super Bowl champions will start their postseason defense of the title as the No 3 seed in the NFC.With Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and most key Eagles starters sitting out even with playoff seeding at stake, the Washington Commanders got fourth-quarter passing and rushing touchdowns from Josh Johnson to beat Philadelphia 24-17 on Sunday.The NFC East champion Eagles (11-6) will open the playoffs at home next weekend against San Francisco.The Eagles needed help to earn the No 2 seed. They had to beat the Commanders and Detroit needed to win at Chicago. Sure enough, the Lions beat the Bears 19-16 to add some sting to the Eagles’ loss.With Jayden Daniels shut down and Marcus Mariota dealing with a leg injury, the Commanders (5-12) started Johnson, their 39-year-old third-stringer. Johnson rallied the Commanders from a 17-10 hole with a two-yard touchdown pass to John Bates and then scored on a one-yard run with 2:32 left.Explore more on these topicsNFLCarolina PanthersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Certainly there was little reaction when the ball came back to the Fulham substitute with 97 ­minutes gone.Liverpool­simply stood off, almost daring Reed to shoot, and they rued their lack of urgency when one of Fulham’s more unfashionable ­players rescued a point for Marco ­Silva’s ­stubborn side by ­ripping a stunning shot into ­Alisson’s top corner.It was a jawdropping moment – after all, it was only the scurrying 30-year-old midfielder’s fourth goal in six years in west London – and it spoke to some of Liverpool’s issues this season. The champions were vague in attack despite scoring twice and, where once there was the determination to force themselves over the line, here there was only defensive inertia when the task was to hold on after going 2-1 up through Cody Gakpo in the fourth minute of ­stoppage time.Manchester City v Chelsea: Premier League – liveRead moreThe problem is this was no one-off. Liverpool, who missed a chance to tighten their grip on fourth place after a second consecutive draw, were similarly chaotic when leading against Tottenham’s 10 men last month and it is not lost on Arne Slot that his side’s inability to manage games has become a trend.“If you are not part of Liverpool then you think you have won it [at 2-1],” the head coach said. “But I am used to it.” Slot felt that his side ­controlled the game. Dwelling on the equaliser, he argued that Liverpool had only dropped so deep because they anticipatedFulhamhurling a long throw into the area. Still, though, he acknowledged that there had to be a reaction when Fulham went short. Instead, Reed was left in acres of space and when the goal was played back it was hard not to linger on the image of Virgil van Dijk failing to get out in time to block the shot.It had been another jittery performance from Van Dijk at the heart of a defence where Ibrahima Konaté also toiled. Raúl Jiménez troubled Liverpool’s centre-backs and was the brains behind Fulham’s opener. The striker sent Harry Wilson through and the former Liverpool academy player collected his sixth goal of the season.Liverpool were poor during the first half. They lacked inspiration with Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitiké missing and benefited from a curious video assistant referee decision ruling Florian Wirtz’s equaliser onside when it seemed the £116m German had strayed just beyond Issa Diop before making it 1-1 early in the second half. “I was sure it was offside,” Wirtz said of his second goal in three games. “I didn’t even celebrate.”Gakpo certainly did when he ­fastened on to a cross from the ­substitute Jeremie Frimpong to nudge ­Liverpool ahead in the dying stages. Yet this was not a flowing performance. Ekitiké’s absence with a hamstring injury forced Liverpool to contend without £194m of forward talent, leaving Slot to field a team with only 12 league goals between them at the start of play.View image in fullscreenHarrison Reed (right) watches as his long-range shot flies past Alisson.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSlot adjusted by using Gakpo as a central striker, with Curtis Jones, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wirtz offering support, but the ploy proved ­ineffective for much of a tepid first half. Shorn of natural width with Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Liverpool were predictable.“The first half was good,” Silva said of Fulham’s efforts. “We blocked almost everything.” Fulham switched to a back five, gave up possession and made the most of very little in the 17th minute. Jiménez provided the spark by catching Liverpool out with a beautiful flick. Conor Bradley and Konaté were dozing on the right and Wilson, who was played onside by Van Dijk and Milos Kerkez, ran through to score with a brilliant low shot.Liverpool’s best moments before half-time came from Gakpo. He scuffed badly wide at 0-0 and later headed against a post but more urgency was required. Liverpool pushed after the break and Alexis Mac Allister headed against the bar.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo puts Liverpool ahead in stoppage time.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersLiverpool’s mentality had transformed. There was more urgency to the press and Bradley stepped in to win possession. Fulham backtracked and allowed the right-back to poke the ball through to Wirtz, who curled past Bernd Leno.Controversy followed. The flag went up but there was surprise when a lengthy review ended with the goal being awarded. The official explanation? Thicker lines are being used to assess offsides this season and more benefit of the doubt is being given to attackers. Liverpool were grateful for the help. It became more open. Gakpo shot wide before a mix-up led to Wilson hitting the bar. Tension grew; Gakpo made it 2-1.But Fulham have scored crucial late goals in each of their past three games. They have lost key players to Afcon but they keep going. When Reed came on he was making only his seventh appearance of the season. It was the most memorable of cameos.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That is the Littler effect in action. But after thrashing the Dutch playerGian van Veen 7-1in the final, he promised that his latest success – and the £1m first prize, a record for his sport – would not change him.Shrek, sherbet and sausage dogs: Ally Pally fancy dress parade – in picturesRead more“I’m just me as you see me – outside of the darts, inside of the darts, I’ll never change,” he said. “This is how I am. Even my mum and dad, from the first worlds were saying to me, ‘don’t change anything, just be yourself’. That’s how it’s going to be.”What makes Littler’s dominance even more remarkable is that he is not a slave to the grind. During lockdown, he practised five or six hours a day to hone his technique. Nowadays it is a lot less. Yet he seems able to turn on a switch and the talent oozes out.Such was his dominanceduring these world championships that he won 32 sets and lost just four over his seven matches. But despite having already won two world titles while still a teenager,Littler still thirsts for more. “I want to dominate everything,” he says. “I want to try and win everything.”However this was not only victory for Littler, but darts too. The 170,000 tickets for this year’s world championships sold out in pre-sale, with 20% of tickets going to non-UK based supporters. Fans from Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Ireland and the United States, turned up in droves – many of them in fancy dress.The PR guru Mark Borkowski, who has worked with Ian Botham, Michael Jackson and Led Zeppelin, among others, told the Guardian that it was a further sign that darts really has gone global. “The event has become the Glastonbury of sport, in a sense. It’s got that weird mixture of pantomime, cosplay and live sport,” he said. “The spectators know that they add so much to the event, turn up in their costumes, and boo and cheer along. Those in charge have done a remarkable job to create that spectacle.”It helps, of course, that darts has struck gold with Littler: an everyman with an extraordinary talent. After his win over Van Veen, for instance, he also admitted that he had forgotten to eat until he arrived at Alexandra Palace, when he fuelled himself for the final with a margherita pizza. “All sports need new heroes, and of course, Littler is that new hero,” says Borkowski. “He is an extraordinary talent. But he could also be any kid from any street in Salford, Sheffield, Southampton. That’s part of his appeal.”View image in fullscreenThe 170,000 tickets for this year’s world championships sold out in pre-sale.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd the sport continues to grow. This year’s PDC world championships was staged in Alexandra Palace’s West Hall, which has a capacity of 3,200. Next year’s event will be in the Great Hall, which has room for more than 5,000 fans. The audience is getting younger and so are the players, with Littler attracting more kids to a sport with almost no barriers to entry. “In most sports they coach people to within an inch of their lives,” says Borkowski. “But darts has got massive authenticity in an age of Instagram. And there’s going to be a lot of talent out there looking at him and thinking, ‘I can do the same.’Luke Littler joins pantheon of greats at sport’s biggest pantomime | Sean IngleRead moreHowever Borkowski, who has also worked with the likes of Macaulay Culkin and helped celebrities protect their reputations, warns that Littler will inevitably face a few bumpy moments as his popularity grows and some fans find his dominance boring. “We talk about the upside of fame, but very few people talk about the downsides,” he says. “And the sophistication in managing fame, particularly in an age of a million cameras, is just so difficult.”The fact that Littlerbit back at fansafter being booed earlier in the tournament was a sign, Borkowski says, of how difficult that balance can be. “Whether it’s in industry, entrepreneurship, entertainment or sport, we build people up to kill them. Culturally, that’s what British people do. They distrust dominance,” he adds. “They don’t like success, especially when it arrives too quickly. It is a game of snakes and ladders.”But having joined Gary Anderson, Adrian Lewis and Phil Taylor to have won successive PDC World Championships, Borkowski hopes Littler will be given room to continue to thrive. “Littler will have a thousand brands crawling all over him, but there’ll be one or two who will think: ‘Let’s just see how he behaves’,” he says. “But I think he’ll come through it.”Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipLuke LittlerDartsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A clinical and cohesive performance by Geoff Parling’s side has them looking upwards, contemplating the playoffs, while the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, must reflect on his team’s inconsistency. As the regular season reaches halfway this was a highly significant mid-table encounter: Leicester in fifth, and sixth-placed Saracens still have ground to make up on the top four, but the home side narrowed the gap with an accomplished win.There were plenty of illustrious names on the teamsheet but it was Billy Searle, the Leicester fly-half, whose headline-grabbing performance won him player of the match. At 29, Searle has already played for five different professional clubs in England and three in France. On this sparkling form you wonder why any of them let him go. Adam Radwan, meanwhile, is trying to force his way into the thinking of Steve Borthwick, the England head coach. The former Newcastle wing is increasingly adding power and perceptiveness to his prodigious pace. Performances this good will spark a conversation or two at Pennyhill Park.Bath break Exeter’s hearts with last-minute try to foil dramatic comebackRead more“There’s load of unbelievable wingers [available to England],” Radwan said. “But the only thing I’m focused on is playing for Leicester, I absolutely love it. Whatever comes off the back off that, comes off the back of that.”An industrious opening, in Leicester’s time-honoured physical style, barely gaveSaracensa look-in and must have pleased the onlooking Martins, Johnson and Corry, among the capacity crowd. Leicester moved the ball well, too, and the full-back Freddie Steward soon dived on a perceptive grubber kick by Searle. The No 10 was denied a try of his own, held up after darting over, but Leicester kept Saracens pinned back and Olly Cracknell crashed over to make it 14-0 after Searle’s second successful conversion.Saracens had not had a sniff, but showed there was nothing wrong with their own game when the flanker Theo McFarland applied a twisting finish from close range.Searle soon spotted a gap in midfield and roared down the middle. A superb grubber, angled right for Radwan, allowed the wing to dive over in the corner – while Elliot Daly was sent to the sin-bin for a late hit on Searle. It was an expression of frustration by Daly, who limped out of Welford Road after what looked a painful leg injury, at Leicester’s dominance. Sarries also simultaneously lost Jamie George and Nick Isiekwe to failed head injury assessments.View image in fullscreenAdam Radwan carries the fight to Saracens.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAHarry Potter left Leicester a couple of years back – but they still have a bit of midfield magic in Will Wand, drafted in late to replace Izaia Perese. The 24-year-old outside-centre had been lively, and was held up over the line as the Tigers threatened to take the game away from McCall’s team.McFarland escaped punishment for a high hit on Searle just before the break – penalty aside – and it seemed Saracens would be nursing a 12-point deficit at the break. But when Ollie Chessum chugged over halfway, Wand progressed on the Leicester right, and the prop Joe Heyes applied an impressively powerful finish to claim their bonus point. That was 26-7.When Saracens’ Rotimi Segun ran an excellent line after half-time, the Leicester replacement Emeka Ilione was penalised, arguably harshly, while effecting a turnover. From the resulting position, Rhys Carré powered over, and it was a 12-point game. Ilione’s breakdown work was impressive on his first appearance for 10 weeks, and will have been noted by Borthwick. After Searle added a penalty, Radwan pounced on a pass by Ivan van Zyl and ran most of the length of the pitch to score and whip the crowd into a frenzy.There is a reason Saracens are the only side in the Prem with a double-figure bonus point tally, though, and they persisted. Max Malins touched down, only for what would have been their fourth try to be ruled out for a knock-on. Leicester fought to prevent the visitors taking a bonus point – but Charlie Bracken nicked one a minute from time. It was little consolation for McCall.“We allowed them to run at us. They played well but we allowed them to – much more than we should have,” he said. “And there were periods when we showed better team fight … As a team we want to know what we’re going to get from each other every week … at the moment, we don’t.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyLeicesterSaracensRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu was replaced by Katie Swan, who performed well against a much higher-ranked opponent before losing 7-6 (4), 6-1 to Osaka. In the decisive rubber, Neal Skupski and Olivia Nicholls used their doubles expertise to seal the tie with a 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 win over Nao Hibino and Yasutaka Uchiyama.The first week of the tennis season has done little to change public opinion of Britain’s top players, Draper and Raducanu, whose young careers have been filled with numerous physical problems.The duo were two of the earliest commitments for the United Cup, an exciting team that immediately established Britain as one of the tournament favourites, but once again Draper and Raducanu have instead had to manage their frail bodies.Draper wasforced to withdrawfrom the Australian swing as he continues to recover from bone bruising to his left arm, extending his absence to six months. Raducanu’s problems are less severe, but this foot injury has affected her for more than two months after she prematurely ended her 2025 season because of injury and illness in October. Raducanu has spent the past week in Perth training hard, but this is still another disappointing setback.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu speaks to media before the United Cup tennis tournament in Perth.Photograph: Colin Murty/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter his team’s victory, the Great Britain captain, Tim Henman, shed more light on an injury that has seriously affected Raducanu’s preparation for the new season.“She struggled with her foot for the end of last year,” Henman said. “The improvement that she’s made has been fantastic. She’s been practising in London, really only doing static drills, to be out on the practice court and moving and playing games. She is very close.“In terms of [Monday], it’s still a little bit up in the air. We’re kind of forced to put Emma on the list because if we didn’t do that, then that only gives us one option. When we get back tonight, we’ll discuss it as a team.”The 23-year-old was present all day inside the RAC Arena, loudly cheering and offering her colleagues advice on the Great Britain team from her bench alongside her coach, Francisco Roig.Before Swan took to the court, Raducanu struck a hopeful tone. “At the end of the day, it’s a team event and Katie’s playing great so it gives me an extra day, so looking forward to this match,” she said.The absence of the top British men’s and women’s players represented an opportunity for the remainder of the GB team, and they took it admirably. Harris, the men’s No 128, only learned that he would be taking Draper’s place in this event on Christmas Eve, less than a week before most players began to travel to Perth. Last year, he also replaced an injured Draper at the United Cup, performing well against higher-ranked opponents but losing all three matches.Tom Jenkins’s best sport photographs of 2025Read moreThis time, Harris took advantage of a winnable matchup to secure his first victory in the competition, overpowering the world No 99, Mochizuki, with his superior serve and forehand. Swan, ranked 260 ranking spots below Osaka at No 276, played a strong first set and led 5-3 before the four-time grand slam champion found her form and took control to level the match.In the decisive rubber, Nicholls and Skupski held their nerve in the final stages of a tense final-set tie-break to seal the victory. “We tried to stay positive, stay together, keep the communication high,” said Skupski. “We had great support from the bench. That’s kind of what I think got us over the line.”Great Britain will face Greece next for a guaranteed spot in the quarter-finals. The Greek team, which easily defeated Japan on Friday, is led by the former top-three players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But in a year marked by three category 5 hurricanes, record summer humidity and heat, and deadly fires and floods, the cracks have already begun to show.Fema, bereft of strong leadership and sinking under low morale and large gaps in its workforce,went into hurricane season without a plan in place. Gutted weather-balloon networks in Alaska failed toadequately warn residentsin advance of what would become one of the most destructive storms in state history. It took administration officials more than 72 hours to authorise the deployment of federal search-and-rescue teams after the Guadalupe river in Texas surged into a summer camp and through nearby communities in July, a flood that left more than 135 people dead.Even as Trump sought to slash federal funding, the cost of disasters continued to climb.View image in fullscreenA truck drives through a flooded road as category 3 Hurricane Erin leaves the region, in Naguabo, Puerto Rico, on 16 August.Photograph: Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the first half of 2025 alone, damage from weather and climate disasters across the nation totaled more than $101bn, according to Dr Adam Smith, who tracked the data for Noaa until the federal database that cataloged these costs was discontinued in May. “That cost is by far the most costly first half of any year on record dating back to 1980,” he said. Smith now works as the senior climate impacts scientist for the non-profit Climate Central, where he is continuing to build the database.“We are in the perfect storm,” said Monica Medina, who served as the principal deputy administrator of Noaa during the Obama administration. Ever-escalating threats are being met with a crumbling safety net, she added, as mismanagement and cuts in funding corrode an emergency response system already close to the brink.“We need to have a whole new attitude about preparedness for the types of weather events we are seeing,” she said. “People will suffer. It is just that simple.‘This is what it looks like when things fall apart’Emergency management has long been messy. Vaguely defined areas of responsibility for preparation and recovery sprawl across multiple levels of government and a chaotic matrix of non-profits, businesses and individuals.Investments made under Joe Biden took aim at some of these problems and initiated a broader focus on environmental justice and building resilience in vulnerable, disadvantaged communities where it was needed most. Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law injected billions of dollars into climate-resilience projects, including improving threatened waterways, supporting underpaid federal wildland firefighters, and protections against extreme heat.“We needed to go a lot further, but we had a good start,” said Shana Udvardy, senior climate resilience policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Fema, however, was already facing a catastrophe of its own.View image in fullscreenWildfire victims seek disaster relief services from Fema at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California, on 14 January.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesGrappling with staffing constraints, funding shortfalls and an ever-expanding mission caused by the increasing frequency, severity and cost of extreme weather events, a federal analysis created for Congress recommended more money for the beleaguered agency, and investing in the federal disaster workforce to ensure shorter deployments, more support and better training that would curb widespread burnout.Trump went in a decidedly different direction.“We want to wean off of Fema, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” the president said at a briefing on hurricane and wildfire preparedness in June, claiming the agency was too expensive and “doesn’t get the job done”. “The Fema thing has not been a very successful experiment,” the president concluded.A taskforce created by the president was due to publish recommendations in December that would greatly determine Fema’s fate, but the vote on a draft report was pulled afterdetails revealing the dramatic reductionsbeing considered was leaked to the press.“The council report recommendations as reported would gut Fema, leaving states to shoulder the burden of disasters and putting disaster victims at risk of serious harm, especially those with the least resources,” Udvardy said. “Council members should release their original report,” she added, urging more congressional oversight of what’s proposed.With the agency’s future hanging in limbo, capacity was systemically slimmed throughout the year.Hundreds of millions of dollars in national preparedness funding was cut in 2025, and Fema lostroughly a third of its full-time staff– experienced leaders among them – to firings, retirements and resignations.Congressionally appointed advisory councils that provide science-based recommendations were disbanded, and Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, put Fema on a much tighter rein, requiring personal approval for spending over $100,000 – an amount easily surpassed by often-costly disaster contracts and grants – gumming up the agency’s ability to rapidly respond when disasters struck.More than a dozen Fema workerswere investigated and put on forced leaveafter they signed an open letter to Congress warning of the dangerous outcomes that could come from the administration’s changes.Now on its third acting administrator in less than a year – none of whom were approved by Congress or had substantial emergency experience – leadership is frail and staff have reported exceedingly low morale, with confusion about core mission and fears of reprisal for speaking out.States are not yet equipped to pick up the slack. “There are budget cycles, there’s legislation. It could take years to make these changes,” said Bill Turner, the emergency management director at the Connecticut department of emergency services and public protection, who also serves as the resilience committee chair for the National Emergency Management Association, a non-profit professional association for US state and territory directors. “We need time to adjust.”View image in fullscreenA destroyed home in Hunt, Texas, on 6 July.Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty ImagesThe problem is especially concerning for smaller towns and rural communities. Many don’t even have dedicated emergency management departments.Local work to prepare has also been limited by the administration’s crackdown on climate-resilience policies that interfere with Trump’s energy-extraction priorities. Grant programs, including Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (Bric), Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) and Next Generation Warning System (NGWS) – which support states and communities in completing risk-reduction projects – were also suspended or blocked by theTrump administration.“A lot of the states are just trying to figure out what the future looks like,” Turner said.But the problems go beyond Fema. Holes in preparedness have grown even in areas Trump has said he prioritizes, including preventing catastrophic wildfire.Trump championed firefighters and called for bolstering preparedness for a year-round fire season, using the devastating Los Angeles wildfires as a call to action. In June, Trump signed an executive order that claimed to strengthen mitigation and improve land management practices. He also oversaw efforts to create a new federal firefighting force, housed in the Department of the Interior, long called for by firefighters and experts.View image in fullscreenThe Pickett fire in Calistoga, California, on 21 August.Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesBut after slashing thousands of jobs from already understaffed land management agencies, including the US Forest Service, lots of essential work was left undone. Chaos reigned as fire risks began to mount over the summer, and firefighting crews reported being left without power for weeks due to cut maintenance workers, paychecks being late or halved because administrative roles were left empty, or having to mow lawns outside their offices, manage campsites and do plumbing work at their barracks in addition to their other duties.Hazardous fuels reduction work – which includes prescribed burning, brush clearing and other techniques to cull highly flammable vegetation from high-risk areas –was down roughly 38% in 2025, according to a new analysis by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an organization made up of current and former federal wildland firefighters.“This is what it looks like when things fall apart,” said Udvardy, “and it’s going to take years to build it all back up.”A profound impactOnce considered a global leader in climate science and weather forecasting, the US has sharply changed direction under Trump, starting with Noaa, the agency tasked with the nation’s weather forecasting and climate monitoring.Thousands of staff left, including hurricane hunters, researchers, meteorologists and operations staff, and the holes left behind hobbled the agency’s ability to perform essential functions right as severe storms began to brew.In the spring, roughly a quarter of the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices werelacking chief meteorologists. Several offices across the US also had to cease overnight monitoring due to staff shortages, and weather balloon launches that collect data for forecasting had to be vastly reduced, undermining accuracy. By September, hundreds of jobs were unfilled after one in seven NWS workers left through resignations, retirements or firings.View image in fullscreenA meteorologist prepares to release a weather balloon in Gaylor, Michigan, on 28 April.Photograph: Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe NWS was given permission to begin refilling its ranks in late July, reopening 450 of the roughly 550 jobs cut, after policymakers and the public raised grave concerns over impacts on public safety. But progress has been sluggish. In December, only80 final job offers had been accepted, CNN reported.Even if those jobs are restaffed, experts have lamented the enormous amount of experience lost –roughly 27,000 years of collective experiencetallied from Noaa job losses alone.The White House canceled the contracts that produced legally mandated nationalclimate assessments, websites that were relied on by local governments, states, businesses and residents to prepare for climate events, and pulledclimate.gov, a widely used portal chock-full of resources, from public view.Nine Noaa stationstracking tsunami-causing earthquakes went offlineat the end of November, after the administration pulled funding from a lab that’s spent decades monitoring seismic activity; satellite instruments that track carbon dioxide levels and provide intel on water and air pollution are also on the chopping block.While these losses are expected to have a profound impact on the American public, they will be felt globally, too. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites, studies and intelligence, including data-sharing that tracks severe weather across Europe, coordination of disaster response in the Caribbean, and the monitoring of deforestation and the effects of the climate crisis in the Amazon rainforest.View image in fullscreenTropical analysis meteorologist Aidan Mahoney at his station at the Noaa National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, on 30 May.Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images“This is an essential part of the social safety net we depend on the government to provide – that is why we pay taxes – and this administration is dismantling it,” Medina said, pointing to US research that she said has long provided a public good at extremely low cost. The gaps in data and research and the loss of scientists from the federal workforce will be challenging to build back, even if the government changes course.“You can’t just buy the data you never collected,” she added. Even corporations hoping to meet the demand rely on federal forecasts and infrastructure. “The private sector sits on top of a foundation of government science that is falling apart,” she said.No longer relying on the federal governmentThe disasters of today are already packing a punch. But during the next decade, Earth is expected to blow past the critical 1.5C threshold, officials with the United Nations Environment Programme said in November, and extreme events will get exponentially worse.“Each year above 1.5 degrees will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage,” the UN secretary general António Guterres said in November in Belém, Brazil, speaking at the global Cop climate summit, where a US delegation was notably absent for the first time.Trump has repeatedly sown doubt in the climate crisis and in policies to protect against it, and has consistently worked to undermine scientific warnings, shifts to renewables by other governments, domestic and international, and rolled back regulations in the US. In 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency made cuts to climate and resilience programs, limited clean air and water investigations and enforcement, and moved to rescind the endangerment finding under the Clean Air Act, which links greenhouse gas emissions to poor public health outcomes.View image in fullscreenA man comforts his daughter on the charred ruins of their family home after the Eaton fire in Altadena, California, on 9 January.Photograph: Zoe Meyers/AFP/Getty ImagesFacing a future with less federal support as extremes intensify, emergency managers have encouraged the public to stay vigilant.“Everyone has a role in preparedness,” Turner said. “We’re not going to let the noise change the core of what we do every day.”But big gaps remain – and they might grow.“We are trying to break down that misconception that after a major disaster, the state or federal government will be able to come in and make you whole,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNatural disastersClimate crisisTrump administrationExtreme weatherUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It absolutely wants to see systematic paralysis here and is eager to find ways of undermining the fabric of our nation,” he said.“That dovetails with what the far right wants and what it believes. It’s even more than just groups and individuals on the far right being used as proxies. They are literally a vehicle for attacking the ideas that underpin our democracy.”Russian “influence operations” in Britain have been ratcheted up in recent years, in addition to espionage operationsranging from arsontospy rings.However, there have also been worries about more subtle attempts to sow societal divisions. TheGuardian revealed earlier this yearhow a network of Telegram channels with Russian links was encouraging UK residents to commitviolent attacks on mosques and Muslimsand offering cryptocurrency in return.There have been calls for a ban on Patriotic Alternative, regarded as the UK’s largest far-right group, albeit one that has faced challenges from newer rivals.Collett, once a young acolyte of the then BNP leader Nick Griffin and now a veteran far-right figure, founded the group after splits in theBNP. It quickly became a home for a digital-savvy younger generation of activists.He confirmed to the Guardian that he had attended the Russian event, as an online participant. Collett said that he gave a three-minute speech discussing birthrates and immigration in Britain, how white Britons would be reduced to a minority in future “and that eastern European countries must not allow the same thing on their soil”.Collett said he had been invited by the Brotherhood of Academists, a nationalist student movement operating in universities across Russia and in occupied parts of Ukraine.“I do not believe that Russia desires war with the west, or with Britain. What’s more, I have never received any contact or payment from anyone within the Russian establishment, so the idea that myself or Patriotic Alternative is being ‘used’ by the Russian state is absurd, and a groundless suggestion,” he told the Guardian. He believed the conflict in Ukraine was “stoked” by the previous US government because it desired a proxy war with Russia.The key figure behind the event, which took place at St Petersburg’s Legislative Assembly building on 12 September, was Konstantin Malofeyev, a banker whose business interests include the Kremlin-supporting Tsargrad media group and who founded the Brotherhood of Academists.Malofeyev, who has been described by the US authorities as“one of the main sources of financing”for the promotion of Russian interests in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, hailed the conference in apost on Telegram.“More than 50 delegates from 15 rightwing patriotic organisations across three continents came to St Petersburg. Diverse, but united on key issues: a desire to defend Christian values, a fight for national identity and sovereignty, and resistance to our common enemy – globalism,” said Malofeyev, who is known as the “Orthodox oligarch” because of his support for the Russian church.He said that the event opened with a “Christian memorial” and a moment of silence for the rightwing US activist Charlie Kirk,who was killed two days before the forum.The Guardian has previously reportedhow Malofeyev appears to have been involved in the movement of millions of dollars through the global banking system with the help of a Cypriot financial services firm after he was placed under sanctions by western governments.In addition to Collett, other participants included the French author Alain de Benoist, the Franco-Swiss ideologue Alain Soral and a German politician, Alexander von Bismarck.Explore more on these topicsThe far rightRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now another prime ministerial pet is proving a social media hit in Belgium.Maximus Textoris Pulcher wasannounced in Augustas an official resident at the Belgian prime minister’s office, Rue de la Loi 16 in central Brussels.The grey rescue cat is now thought to have the second most popular political account on Belgian social media, with more than142,000 followers on Instagram– second only to his master, Bart De Wever, whobecame Belgium’s prime ministerin February.The cat’s full name is a mock-grandiose title rooted in the prime minister’s love of Latin and Roman history, conveying the meaning “De Wever’s beautiful Maximus” (textorisbeing “of the weaver”, or De Wever).De Wever adopted the cat, an abandonedScottish fold, from a refuge. “I have a cat in my office, it is grey and it does not catch … mice, but I love it anyway,” he told journalists during a recent press conference.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

In another post when De Wever’s eclectic five-party coalition was locked in budget talks, a grumpy-looking Maximus lies on the floor with a thought bubble reading: “Even on Sunday, these nuisances [cabinet ministers] are here.”A source close to De Wever – described as “a cat person all his life” – said the account was a low-effort part of his team’s work and offered the public a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Rue de la Loi 16.View image in fullscreen‘Even on Sunday, these nuisances [cabinet ministers] are here.’Photograph: InstagramProf Dave Sinardet, a political scientist at the Free University of Brussels, said the account fell in the long tradition of politicians being portrayed with animals to show an appealing side.This was especially true, he said, for De Wever, “who is perceived as quite competent, as a strong debater, as someone with clear ideas, but maybe as a less warm person … It can help to reinforce his warmer side.”The Maximus account had “a subliminal political message”, Sinardet said, citing the frequent posts of the prime minister reading papers at night next to his cat. “Very often you see Bart De Wever as a hard worker, he is doing his best, he is working on Saturday night.”De Wever, the first Flemish nationalist prime minister of Belgium, is known for his dry humour and has long used social media to share curated images of a seemingly unpretentious everyday life. Hisown Instagram accountshows him taking a tram and ironing a shirt in a Copenhagen hotelbefore an EU summit.The account “also creates a positive vibe” for people who find politics boring or conflictual, although Maximus played into that, said Sinardet. In one picture, showing Maximus outside the window of a cabinet meeting, the speech bubble reads: “And they complain about my mewling.”And while the running gag is that Maximus is the real boss, the cat may ventriloquise De Wever’s own thoughts. “Congratulations, you are a hero,” Maximus tells De Wever, the day aftera hard-fought EU summit. While the joke is that the cat is buttering up his master for more attention, it also suggests De Wever saved the day.View image in fullscreen‘Congratulations, you are a hero!’ Maximus tells De Wever.Photograph: InstagramBut politicians who complained about Maximus’s posts did not usually win public sympathy, Sinardet suggested. “That only reinforces De Wever because they come over as sour people … when, this is, supposedly just a funny, positive cute cat account.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaBelgiumCatsInstagramEuropePetsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an emotional Instagramvideoposted on Sunday, Nelson revealed the girls had been diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1).“We were told that they’re probably never going to be able to walk; they probably will never regain their neck strength, so they will be disabled, and so the best thing we can do right now is to get them treatment, and then just hope for the best,” she said.“Thankfully, the girls have had their treatment, which you know, I’m so grateful for because if they don’t have it, they will die.”Nelson said the twins had been diagnosed after four months of “gruelling” hospital appointments, and she wanted to raise awareness of the condition and the signs to look out for because “time is of the essence” with the disease.SMA1 is the most severe and common form of the genetic neuromuscular disorder and causes muscle weakness, progressive loss of movement and paralysis.“I just think that I can raise as much awareness about this as possible, and the signs, then, you know, something good has to come out of this,” said Nelson.She added that the signs to look for were floppiness, an inability to hold themselves up without support, a “frog-like” positioning of the legs without much movement, and rapid breathing in the tummy.She added: “If anyone is watching this video and they think they see these signs in their child, then please, please take your child to the doctor, to the hospital, because time is of the essence, and your child will need treatment. And the quicker you get this, the better their life will be.”According to the NHS, about 70 children are born with SMA each year in the UK, and without treatmentfewer than one in 10 (8%)will survive to the age of two.The website of the charitySMA UKsays that“early detection of the condition is critical”for better outcomes for babies, adding that the UK is “shockingly far behind” in not including SMA in the NHS newborn blood-spot screening test, which is offered when a baby is five days old and currently looks for nine rare but serious conditions.Three“transformative” new SMA medicineswere rolled out on the NHS from 2019, including disease-modifying treatments such as gene therapy. In September last year NHS Scotland added SMA to its newborn screening programmeas part of a two-year pilot scheme. Babies treated before symptoms developed could, in many cases, “follow normal developmental pathways”, said NHS Scotland.Nelson said the diagnosis was made after her mother noticed the twins “were not showing as much movement in their legs as they should be”, and they later began to struggle with feeding. But because the twins were premature the couple had been told their development was likely to be behind that of other babies and when they first went to see the doctor they were told not to worry.“The reason I wanted to make this video was because the last few months has honestly been the most heartbreaking time of my life,” said the singer.“I literally feel like my whole life has done a 360, I almost feel like I’m grieving a life that I thought I was going to have with my children, and I’ll have to be grateful because at the end of the day, they’re still here, and that’s the main thing, and they’ve had their treatment.“And I truly believe that my girls will fight all the odds and, with the right help, they will fight this and go on to do things that have never been done.”The singer has already used social media to speak about complications during her pregnancy, including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which affects 10% to 15% of identical twins who share a placenta and “can have serious consequences”, according to the NHS. The singer underwent an emergency procedure and spent 10 weeks in hospital before giving birth prematurely at 31 weeks on 15 May.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthHealthParents and parentingChildrenLittle MixnewsShareReuse this content"

The tech corporations are in the hands of men with power which we give them,” the group said. “One day we will simply sit before bright screens or dead machines while dying ourselves of thirst and hunger.”View image in fullscreenCars and pedestrians pass a square where lighting has been set up using a power generator in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf district of Berlin.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersThe group said it wished to apologise to the less well-off who had been affected by the power cut, but said its sympathy was limited “for the many villa owners” now in the dark.The area affected by the power cut includes many elderly care homes and hospitals as well as high-rise buildings with residents who are reliant on elevators that are now out of order. Berlin received moderate snowfall at the weekend and night-time temperatures plunged well below freezing.Berlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, said he was convinced the mass blackout had a political motive, while security experts said it bore thehallmarks of previous far-left attacks.“It is unacceptable that leftwing extremists are once again openly attacking our electricity grid and thereby endangering human lives,” Wegner told reporters during a visit to an emergency shelter for those without heat and hot water.With mobile networks down, police used loudspeakers attached to their vehicles to inform the public as they assisted people in need of care. Several regional commuter lines were interrupted and many pupils who were to return to school on Monday may see their holiday extended well into the week.A previous arson attack attributed to the far left in September knocked out electricity for 60 hours in the south-east of the city in what was reportedly Berlin’slongest power cut since the second world war.Preliminary theories for the weekend power outage had included possible Russian sabotage, asGermanyhas been on high alert for attacks on its infrastructure from foreign actors.In March 2024, Vulkangruppeclaimed an arson attack against a pylon at the Tesla gigafactoryoutside Berlin that cut off electricity to the plant and temporarily halted production.In its 2024 annual security report, Germany’s domestic intelligence watchdog cited repeated attacks on the regional power grid by Vulkangruppe, which it classes as a leftwing extremist organisation.It said the group, believed to be about 14 years old, chose targets for their “palpable effects on the population”, intending to cause destruction requiring painstaking and lengthy repairs with little concern for collateral damage.Stromnetz Berlin said that initially 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses in the districts of Nikolassee, Zehlendorf, Wannsee and Lichterfelde had been affected by the power cut that began at about 6am on Saturday.By midday on Sunday, the company said on its crisis page on its website that about 10,000 households and 300 businesses in Lichterfelde had had their electricity restored.But cold weather was hindering efforts to lay new underground cables, meaning the remaining households may have to wait until Thursday afternoon to get their light and heat back on.“Our teams are on the ground and we are working flat out to restore supplies,” Stromnetz Berlin said.Experts said attacks on energy infrastructure required little specialist knowledge to have a dramatic impact, with maps featuring key components of the power grid widely available online and few contingency plans ready to be enacted in case of sabotage.Explore more on these topicsGermanyProtestEnvironmental activismAI (artificial intelligence)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If you’re a whistleblower you’re going to get in trouble in theNHS, if you’ve got coloured skin you’re probably going to get in trouble.”People of colour who work in the NHSare more likely to face disciplinary actionthan white staff, and minority ethnic doctors aremore likely to fear adverse consequencesif they raise patient safety concerns.Abdullah was suspended from Charing Cross hospital after signing a petition in support of a colleague after a patient complaint, and then writing a letter for the colleague in which he described the patient as a “professional complainer against NHS staff”.An independent inquiry, which Kapur helped bring about, found in 2018 that Abdullah “should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate” but it noted none of the other 18 signatories had been disciplined and concluded the 41-year-oldhad been “treated unfairly” by Imperial College healthcare NHS trust.Kapur, who is a member of Justice forDoctors, is also calling for other staff protections, including extending the maintaining high professional standards framework, intended to ensure fairness in addressing concerns about doctors and dentists, to all healthcare professionals.Additionally, he wants the healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to be split into two, with one body dealing with patients and the other with staff. Kapur said: “You need to have external scrutiny of trusts and also private healthcare bodies as to how they treat staff, especially whistleblowers and BME [black and minority ethnic] staff.”He is also calling for reduced use by the NHS of the “some other substantial reason” legal mechanism, which enables organisations to fire employees for reasons other than conduct or capability. Between April 2010 and September 2018,the NHS sacked 10,604 members of staff under the SOSR mechanism, commonly justified by a breakdown in relationships.Kapur said: “If I can do things to make sure that what happened to me and Abdullah won’t happen to people in the future, I will do until there are meaningful improvements.”A NHSE spokesperson said it was working with the Department of Health and Social Care to ensure protection for whistleblowers. They added: “It is completely unacceptable for any member of staff to feel silenced or unable to speak up about issues affecting them or their patients. We’d urge anyone who has concerns to contact theFreedom to Speak Upguardian in their organisation, to help ensure the NHS learns from mistakes so we can provide the best possible care for patients.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They alsorecorded the births of campaigners’ childrenand noted details about the lives of politically active parents, such as the fact theyhad a child with Down’s syndrome.Their surveillance reports were sent to MI5 at time when the Security Service was being criticised by civil liberties groups for overzealously snooping on leftwing and progressive campaigners. Even Stella Rimington, who led MI5 in the 1990s, said it was“over-enthusiastic”in targeting leftwing groups in the cold war.MI5 maintained voluminous files on individuals which it used to secretly vet peopleapplying for certain government posts. According to MI5, the agency was screening out people who could have leaked official secrets that damaged the nation but the service was accused of unfairly blocking many people it deemed too leftwing from getting government jobs.MI5 frequently asked the undercover police officers to supply specific details of individual campaigners, even requesting“shopping lists”of information such as home addresses, as well as photographs of individuals.In astatement to the spycops inquiry, a senior, unnamed MI5 official said it was “highly likely that some (possibly most)” of the information it requested from the undercover officers was used to vet the political views of people applying to work for the government.Richard Norton-Taylor reports on 100 years of MI5Read moreThe documents show that the undercover officers’ surveillance reports were a key source of information for MI5 which paid tribute to their “valuable” and “very significant” work.Stamped on the surveillance reports are a tell-tale sign – Box 500, a nickname for MI5 based on its wartime postal address – which confirms that they were sent to the Security Service by the police spies. MI5 also gathered information from other sources such as informants and telephone tapping.Working in tandem, senior police officers running the undercover spies and MI5 met regularly to discuss the political groups they wanted to infiltrate. On several occasions, MI5 warned that particular police spies were in danger of being rumbled by activists.Ben Gunn, a former senior police officer who oversaw Scotland Yard’s undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS),told the inquiry: “The Security Service knew exactly what we were doing in the SDS. They lived off the product. They enjoyed the product. They even targeted and helped targeting.”MI5 has been required to give evidence to the spycops inquiry which is examining how police used itsundercover officers to spy on political groupsbetween 1968 and at least 2010. The undercover police’s close cooperation with MI5 is one of the strands being examined by the inquiry.Sir John Mitting, the retired judge leading the inquiry, is scrutinising a series of controversies involving undercover officerssuch as deceiving women into intimate relationships and spyingon grieving families.The unidentified MI5 official, representing the Security Service, told the inquiry that for decades it monitored political activists as it was tasked with identifying so-called subversives.This ill-defined term – officially supposed to be confined to activists who had the capability to threaten the safety of the state, or overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy – in practice enabled the state to spy on many who merely held anti-establishment views and opposed government policies.The MI5 official said the Security Service formally stopped investigating subversion on an“active and wide-ranging”basis in 1996, as the threat posed by subversive groups had diminished. After that date, “MI5 retained a watching brief in order to monitor any threat from subversive activities in line with its statutory functions”, added the official.However,MI5 has saidthat it started “investigatingrightwing, leftwing, anarchist, and single-issue extremism in 2020”. The exact scope of these investigations, and the identities of the groups being monitored, is not known.Explore more on these topicsUndercover police and policingSpycops scandalMI5ProtestPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

May her memory be a blessing to us all.“Charles R.”Schloss grew up under the name Eva Geiringer in Vienna with her parents and brother.She later lived at Merwedeplein Square in Amsterdam where she met fellow teenager Anne Frank.As the situation in the Netherlands worsened, Schloss and her family moved from house to house for two years to evade capture but they were eventually betrayed by a Nazi sympathiser, who took them in then gave them away.On her 15th birthday they were arrested, brutally interrogated and, in May 1944, forced on to trains to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.Schloss and her mother were subsequently separated from her father and brother.During their three-day journey to Auschwitz, her brother Heinz told her that he and their father, Erich, had hidden 30 of his paintings under the floorboards of the attic.The sibling’s story was thesubject of an exhibitionput together at the Jewish Museum in London in 2017.Schloss later moved to England and lived in London for more than 70 years.The Auschwitz survivor got married in 1952 to Zvi Schloss and the couple had three daughters: Jacky, Caroline and Sylvia.When her mother, Elfriede, married Anne Frank’s father, Otto, in 1953, Schloss became Anne Frank’s stepsister.In 2017, Schloss told the Guardian: “Anne was much more mature and grown-up than me. She attended the Montessori school and was an academic year ahead of me. I went to an ordinary local school.”In 2021, aged 92, Schloss once again became a citizen of Austria, the country of her birth.In their tribute, her family said: “We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind.“We are incredibly proud of all that Eva stood for and accomplished, but right now, we are grieving.”Dan Green, chief executive of the Anne Frank Trust, described Schloss as “a beacon of hope and resilience”, adding: “Her unwavering commitment to challenging prejudice through Holocaust education has left an indelible mark on countless lives.“Her legacy will continue to guide and empower young people to build a world free from hatred and discrimination.“We at the Anne Frank Trust mourn her loss deeply and extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends during this difficult time.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustSecond world warKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

In December, a panel appointed by Kennedy voted to remove a longstanding recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that all newborns be vaccinated against hepatitis B.The CDC alsoupdated its website in Novemberat the instruction of Kennedy to claim that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism”, which top public health experts have decried as false.The agency’s move toward misinformation and away from public health leadership makes it more difficult to combat distrust in vaccinations inCanada, says Bowdish.In December, Canada’s health minister, Marjorie Michel, warned that US health and science institutions can no longer be depended upon for accurate information. In an interview with the Canadian Press, she said: “I cannot trust them as a reliable partner, no.”Michel also told CBC News that “some” Canadians could be influenced by Kennedy.The minister’s comments come at the conclusion of a disastrous year for measles in Canada, as the country wasstripped of its measles elimination status in Novemberafter more than 5,000 cases were reported across the country.A huge outbreak has made Ontario the measles centre of the western hemisphereRead morePhysicians pointed to drops in childhood vaccination rates, limited access to family doctors and surging misinformation in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic asjust some of the factorsfuelling the spread.Meta’s ban onthe sharing of newsin Canada, due to an ongoing dispute over legislation between the tech company and the government, also impedes reliable public health messaging, said Bowdish.In 2021, Canada published the results from a national survey on childhood immunisation and found 2.1% of two-year-olds had not received any vaccinations, an increase from 1.7% in 2019. Parents cited safety concerns or beliefs that vaccines did not work as their reasons for refusal.Bowdish said in 2021 that these reasons often were connected to not having a family doctor and were related to access rather than skepticism. But in the last four years she suspects misinformation has surged, and new data is not available.A Decemberpoll on vaccination hesitancyby research firm Leger Healthcare found that while most Canadians (74%) have confidence in vaccines, hesitancy has increased primarily due to fears around safety driven by social media and government mistrust.The survey also found that 17% of those who expressed a lack of confidence in vaccines say they get their information from US government websites.Kumanan Wilson, a doctor and professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa, said Canada can combat concerns about changes at the CDC by cooperating with other public health systems worldwide and taking the helm on developing health surveillance while US institutions languish.“If we build this system, it’s not only going to be great for Canada. We can provide really valuable information to the world,” he said.But Michel Grignon, a professor and health economist at McMaster University, warned that increased mistrust in vaccinations in Canada is the country’s own doing.He said the federal government instead needs to look at the homegrown causes of vaccine distrust, rather than focusing too much on the US.As Canada’s social safety nets have eroded over many decades, the pandemic was a further catalyst that disrupted social cohesion, pushing people to the margins of society and sowing distrust in government, he said.Grignon pointed to the2022 trucker protestsagainst Covid restrictions as a manifestation of the collapse of trust.“We are the source of our own problem, and our vaccine hesitancy has not much to do with the US. It has to do with us,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaHealthVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusInfectious diseasesTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

The judge confronted FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents waiting outside the room to arrest Flores-Ruiz and directed them to the chief judge’s office, according to an indictment.While the agents were gone, Dugan told Flores-Ruiz’s attorney that his client could attend his next hearing via Zoom and led them through a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz and arrested him after a foot chase. He was later sentenced to time served for illegally re-entering the United States and deported.Judge accused of helping immigrant dodge ICE agents found guilty of obstructionRead more“As you know, I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary,” Dugan wrote in a letter sent on Saturday to Tony Evers, the Democratic governor. “I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary. However, theWisconsincitizens that I cherish deserve to start the year with a judge on the bench in Milwaukee county branch 31 rather than have the fate of that court rest in a partisan fight in the state legislature.”The Republican Wisconsin assembly speaker Robin Vos praised Dugan’s decision, the Associated Press reported.“I’m glad Dugan did the right thing by resigning and followed the clear direction from the Wisconsin constitution,” Vos said.Democrat Ann Jacobs, the chair of the Wisconsin elections commission board, said she agreed with Dugan that Milwaukee should have a permanent judge while her defense team appeals her conviction.“Despite her situation, she is ever the champion of justice, wanting to remove the judiciary from a political battle over her fate,” Jacobswrote on X. “I’m sure this is terribly hard for her but she is true to her faith and her principles.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationWisconsinICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicsTrump administrationLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

He evoked US submarines prowling off Caribbean beaches and airborne troops attacking Caracas.View image in fullscreenHugo Chávez in 2011.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APIt was, in large part, theatre. A confection of claims to justify authoritarian rule, burnish anti-imperialism credentials and delegitimise opponents. Over time, even some supporters rolled their eyes at tales of the Yankee bogeyman.Yet now, 13 years after an ailing Chávez passed power to his protege, Nicolás Maduro,the fever dream is real. On Saturday US forces bombed Caracas and seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores – the “empire” of Chávez’s rhetoric made manifest.No UN mandate, no congressional approval, just raw military power.View image in fullscreenPresident Nicolás Maduro alongside the first lady, Cilia Flores, during his closing election campaign rally in Caracas in July 2024.Photograph: Fernando Vergara/APAmid the shock and uncertainty about what happens next there is a surreal twist. For years Chavismo – the ideology bequeathed by the late president – exaggerated the US threat in order to cry wolf. When the wolf showed up he turned out to be an American version of Chávez.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump in his Mar-a-Lago resort on Saturday watching the US military operation in Venezuela with the CIA’s director, John Ratcliffe.Photograph: @realDonaldTrump/ReutersDonald Trump’s populist authoritarianismechoes the Venezuelan strongman: both masters of thunder and dazzle who polarised voters, intimidated opponents and hijacked institutions. The real estate mogul obviously differs in myriad ways from an army officer who embraced socialism – but his ability to tap grievances, break norms, suck up all the oxygen and turn power into a TV show arepure Chávez.It transcends irony that Trump’s greatest spectacle is the operation to abduct Chavismo’s heir. Asinternational law lies in shreds, and Venezuelans swing between hope and dread, history has completed a bizarre circularity.‘It’s impossible not to feel relief’: UK Venezuelans on Maduro’s captureRead moreIn 2002 George W Bush’s administration tacitly backed a coup that briefly ousted Chávez – a move that elicited comparisons to the cold war era, when the CIA toppled leftist leaders across Latin America.Chávez, backed by barrio-dwellers and the military, regained power, won fresh electoral mandates and spent the rest of his reign taunting Bush as a donkey, a cowboy, a devil. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq – justified by false claims about Saddam Hussein’s weapons arsenal – many around the world agreed with Chávez that the US president was indeed more dangerous than a monkey with a razor blade.Chávez made repeated claims of US plots against him. Given CIA efforts to kill Fidel Castro and US military interventions in Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989, and Bush’s post 9/11 overreach, a strike against Venezuela was plausible. But none came. The US continued to buy Venezuela’s oil and sat back while Chávez hollowed out his economy.View image in fullscreenTwo US soldiers guard three Grenadian prisoners in St George’s, Grenada in October 1983, with an American M-60 tank behind them, after American troops invaded the island.Photograph: APMaduro, taking the reins in 2013, continued the fiction of an imminent US military threat. With the economy cratering and voters rebelling, Maduro needed to rig andsteal electionsto stay in power – and a Yankee bogeyman was more useful than ever. The dictator talked up limited sanctions by the Obama and Biden administrations as a blockade.In recent months Trump deployed his own distortions and fabrications. He accused Maduro of heading a “narco-terrorist” cartel that was “flooding” the US with drugs – an extrapolation of Venezuela’s role as a conduit for Colombian cocaine, which mostly goes to Europe. Trump also accused Venezuela of a role in his debunked claim that Joe Biden stole the 2020 US presidential election.On Saturday Trump claimed a victory for the ages. “This was one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history. No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved.”The US raiders cut the power supply to Caracas thanks “to a certain expertise that we have”, paving the way for a flawless operation that evicted a tyrant, Trump said.Trump says US will be ‘very strongly involved’ in Venezuela’s oil industry after military attackRead moreIn his mausoleum, Chávez must have spun. He used to blame power cuts – the result of a crumbling energy grid – on CIA saboteurs. He used to say the gringo superpower wished to reimpose the 19th-centuryMonroe doctrineof US pre-eminence in the hemisphere, and here was Trump declaring a “Donroe doctrine” of “dominance”.That extends to the US running Venezuela for an indefinite period, said Trump. “We’re going torun the countryuntil such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” He added: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.”Trump clouded the picture by saying the US would cooperate with Delcy Rodríguez, a Chavista who was Maduro’s vice-president and has reportedly been sworn in as president.Venezuelans, including the millions who have fled, are about to find out if they have woken from a fever dream or slipped deeper into nightmare.* Rory Carroll was based in Caracas as the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent from 2006to 2012 and is the author of Comandante: Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroTrump administrationHugo ChávezAmericasUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new rates come into effect on Monday.The move follows areduction in the Bank of England base ratein December to 3.75%. Mortgage brokers said it was good new year news for borrowers as rivals were likely to follow suit.“Many of the other big lenders will feel the need to also cut to remain competitive, which could result in a rate war,” David Stirling, an independent financial adviser at Mint Wealth, told the news agency Newspage.“HSBC has set the tone for 2026 early. This is a real statement of intent and shows that they are keen to lend en masse this year. Will we see a January rate war as others undoubtedly join the fold?”Approximately 1.8 million homeowners are expected to refinance mortgages this year, with many coming off super-low, fixed-rate deals secured before interest rates began rising at the end of 2021.Last week the financial data firm Moneyfacts said the average rate on a two-year fixed residential mortgage was running at 4.83%. The average two-year, buy-to-let residential mortgage rate stood at 4.7%.“We could potentially see sub-3.5% deals before the spring, with any luck,” Stirling said.City economists expect two more cuts to the base rate this year, despite the Bank of England warning that such judgments will become“a closer call”.The BoE’s monetary policy committeevoted five to fourin favour of the cut in December, with the governor, Andrew Bailey, switching his vote from hold to cut.Borrowers on variable rate deals tied to the base rate will see their repayment fall as a result. The cost of fixed-rate mortgages is based on the outlook for rates and on lenders’ desire to attract customers. Recently the trade body UK Finance predicted that demand for new home loans would fall in 2026,but remortgaging activity was set to rise.Nicholas Mendes, the mortgage technical manager at the broker John Charcol, said much of the predicted outlook for the base rate was already priced into fixed-rate mortgages.“The cheapest two- and five-year fixes remain below bank rate, reflecting expectations of further cuts,” he said. “As a result, fixed mortgage rates are likely to fall by less than bank rate from here, and by the end of 2026 could once again be priced above bank rate as markets judge rates to be close to their long-term floor.”Last week Nationwide, the UK’s biggest building society, saidhouse prices unexpectedly fell in December,with the market finishing the year with the weakest annual growth in more than 18 months.City economists had forecast a 0.1% month-on-month rise.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesMortgage ratesMortgagesBanks and building societiesHSBCBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead more“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.Describing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”This month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead moreLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.The institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.However, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.Dalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit moreslowly than manufacturers had expected.However, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.The UK went through a“dash for diesel”cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.However, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking offthe “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers wereresponsible for thousands of deathsand cases of asthma.Sales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.Battery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.Graph showing that electric cars will overtake diesel ones on roads in Great Britain by 2030Nevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.London is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because ofthe ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.View image in fullscreenThe ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) applies charges to more polluting non-compliant cars.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”However, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.The report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.Matt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAir pollutionPollutionGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingTravel and transportShareReuse this content"

Total FTSE 100 dividend payments are expected to set a new record of £85.6bn in 2026, Mould reported, finally eclipsing the peak of £85.2bn set in 2018.A poll by the trading company eToro found that UK retail investors are optimistic about the year ahead, with 53% confident the current bull market will continue throughout 2026.UK bonds could do wellRobert Timper, the chief global fixed income strategist at BCA Research, said it could be a strong year for UK government bonds, known as gilts, if the Bank of England cuts interest rates more rapidly than other central banks.He predicted: “UK gilts will go from second to the best-performing bond market [in 2026], backed by a dovish BoE and reduced fiscal concerns.”Global markets forecast to riseUBS has predicted that “supportive economic conditions should underpin global equities, which are expected to rise by about 15% by the end of 2026”, with gains likely in the US, China, Japan and Europe.Double-digit gains are expected on Wall Street. Under UBS’s base case scenario, the US S&P 500 index would end 2026 at 7,700 points – a gain of 12.5%.Deutsche Bank has a year-end S&P 500 target of 8,000 points (+17%), while Oppenheimer Asset Management is even more bullish, forecasting an 8,100-point year end.According to the consultancy OxfordEconomics, above-consensus growth and below-consensus headline inflation in the US next year will lift US stocks.UBS also recommends Chinese stocks. “China’s tech sector stands out as a top global opportunity,” it said. “Strong liquidity, retail flows and earnings – expected to rise to 37% in 2026 – should sustain momentum for Chinese equities.”Ostrum Asset Management predicts European equity markets will perform positively in 2026, driven by a return to earnings growth. However, it cautioned that this is dependent on companies’ ability to deliver against high expectations.But the investor Michael Burry, featured in the film The Big Short, doesn’t share the optimism, sayinghe sees several “bad years ahead”.Artificial intelligence impactAfter a year in which hyperscalers invested hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure, the technology sector is likely to shape long-term macroeconomic outcomes in 2026.Investors will be watching to see whether big AI companies justify their huge valuations – after strong stock market gains in 2025 – and deliver the productivity growth that policymakers are hoping for. If not, valuations could suffer.Though many argue AI investment remains at the early-adoption stage, there areconcerns that some players are entwined with their own suppliers and partners. That circularity blurs the true financial picture, creating fragilities that could splinter if AI optimism fades.While much of the AI focus in 2025 was on chatbots, the UBS chief investment officer, Mark Haefele, said capital expenditure in the sector could focus on agentic AI (systems or “agents” that can carry out knowledge work with little or no human prompting), physical AI (such as robots and self-driving vehicles) and AI video.UBS predicts about $4.7tn will be spent on AI capital expenditure globally by 2030 – roughly double the $2.4tn already planned, based on more than 40 announcements this year.The economic outlookThe world economy is expected to avoid a downturn in 2026, despite the rise in trade barriers in 2025. Kathleen Brooks, the UK research director at the broker XTB, predicts it will remain resilient, with little chance of a global recession.Goldman Sachs analysts have told clients that the main risks to global growth in 2026 are that a fragile job market sparks recession fears, or the equity market questions the value of AI-related revenues.Goldman anticipates “sturdy global growth of 2.8% in 2026”, with theUS economyforecast to “outperform substantially” thanks to reduced drag from tariffs, tax cuts and easier financial conditions. It also expects China to hold up well, as strong exports outweigh sluggish domestic demand.Goldman Themes for 2026$GSpic.twitter.com/pdorVukKDE— Special Situations 🌐 Research Newsletter (Jay) (@SpecialSitsNews)December 10, 2025UBS believes the global economy is poised to accelerate in 2026, helped by improved business and consumer confidence and extra fiscal stimulus in some advanced economies.The Dutch bank ING said it is “still relatively upbeat” about the US economy, expecting looser financial conditions to support growth in 2026.Deutsche Bank suggestedthe US midterm elections, due in November, could influence policy earlier in the year as Republicans try to avoid losing seats.CommoditiesThe price of oil will be highly sensitive to geopolitical developments during 2026, such as progress towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East.Forecasts of a supply glutcould also push prices down.The advisory company Oxford Economics predicts Brent crude oil will end 2026 at $58 a barrel, down from $60 last month, and drop further to $55 in 2027.MeCopper prices could be pushed up by shortages. Deutsche Bank predicts a “clear deficit” for the copper market in 2026, leading to peak prices in the second half of the year.Central banks and ratesThe money markets are pricing in two US interest rate cuts by December 2026, though this forecast is dependent on the outlook for the US economy and Trump’s choice for the next Fed chair.Richard Carter, the head of fixed interest research at the wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, said markets would be “on high alert for any erosion of Fed independence”.In the UK, one rate cut in 2026 is fully priced in, but several economists predict the Bank of England will ease rates at least twice.What could go wrong?Experienced City voices know that the market consensus will inevitably be wrong – the question is in which direction.Dario Perkins, an economist at the forecasters TS Lombard, suggested the picture could be stronger than expected.“The consensus: 2026 will be just like 2025,” he told clients. “Steady global growth, a bit of disinflation, and monetary policy returning to neutral, where it stays indefinitely. Zzzzz.”He continued: “Where could the consensus be wrong? Our bet is on a stronger rebound in activity, which stokes inflation and starts a debate [in the second half of the year] about monetary tightening.”But William Davies, the global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said “the risks of a misstep are accumulating”.He warned: “Growth has proven surprisingly durable, inflation has moderated (albeit unevenly), and markets have continued to climb. But beneath the surface imbalances are building. We believe the coming year will be defined by how successfully policymakers and investors can navigate the narrowing path.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpFederal ReserveUS economyStock marketsOilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was captivated by the sound effects, and Lennon shouting: “Full speed ahead!” When it got to the chorus, I remember thinking: “This must be music!”The first single I boughtWhen I was eight, I won a competition at school to pick a new record to play at the mini disco we had on Fridays. My teacher took me to Woolworths, and I chose Come Back My Love by [50s revivalists] Darts. The first single I bought with my own pocket money was Mull of Kintyre by Wings from a record shop in Colne in Lancashire. It was No 1 at the time, and I chose it when my dad pointed out that it was by one of the Beatles.The song I do at karaokeI honestly cannot stand karaoke and avoid it at all costs. But if I had to, I’d choose Summer Wind by Frank Sinatra.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toI recently realised that I know pretty much all the lyrics to The Boy in the Bubble, You Can Call Me Al, and every song on Graceland by Paul Simon.The best song to play at a partyIt depends what stage of the party you are at. Early doors it would probably be I Heard It Through the Grapevine by Marvin Gaye.

On that day in the fall of 2025, Waymon, an 81-year-old award-winning composer, said that memories flooded back of him playing organ in the house and cooking on the potbelly stove with his mother as a child in Tryon,North Carolina. He was overjoyed to see the large tree from his youth still standing in the yard. Simone, born Eunice Waymon, lived in the 650 sq ft, three-room home with her family from 1933 to 1937.After sitting vacant and severely decayed for more than two decades, the recently restored home is now painted white, with elements of its former self sprinkled throughout the interior. On the freshly painted mint-blue wall hangs a shadow box that encases the rust brown varnish of the original home. A small piece of the Great Depression-era linoleum sits on the restored wooden floor like an island of the past in a sea of the present.“It does conjure up wonderful tears of joy in my heart and in my eyes when I stand in that house, on the porch, going into the rooms where the stove is, and I’m saying, ‘Wow, this is actually real. The house is restored,’” Waymon said. “It’s like time travel.”Sounds like activism: musicians who fight for change – in picturesRead moreThe home was bought for $95,000 in 2017 by four Black artists behind the collective Daydream Therapy LLC – the contemporary artist Adam Pendleton, the painter and sculptor Rashid Johnson, the abstract artist Julie Mehretu, and the collagist and film-maker Ellen Gallagher. For them, the structure is a assertion that Black history is worthy of investing in. The restoration comes at a time when historians and researchers say that the federal government is attempting to diminish thecontributions of Black Americans. A presidential executive order has directed the vice-president, JD Vance, to discontinue spending on programs or exhibits based on race at the Smithsonian Institution and its museums and research centers. The restoration of Simone’s childhood home could serve as an example of how privately funded projects can preserve Black history during a time when federally funded programs are under threat.On 1 September, the total rehabilitation of the home was completed after several years of planning and fundraising of nearly $850,000 in materials, construction and engineering costs for the renovation, which began in June 2024. The project has been overseen by the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund (AACHAF), which is now working with a consulting team and the Tryon community to create a long-term management and programming plan for the site. They hope to create a cultural district around the home, which is projected to open to the public for tourism in 2027.View image in fullscreenNina Simone in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1959.Photograph: Herb Snitzer/Getty Images“What I love is the fact that they didn’t destroy the basic structure of the house; they improved and restored it. So I think when the public or anyone goes into the house, they can feel the spirit and the energy that existed in that house,” Waymon said. “If one believes in spirits, one would have a sense of that when they walk in that house [that]Nina Simone, Eunice Waymon, was there. And that’s the joy I get from that. It’s very strong.”It is pivotal for cultural sites within the Black community to be given as much weight as other populations, said Tiffany Tolbert, the AACHAF’s senior director for preservation. “Being able to preserve the birth or childhood home of these icons, activists and leaders in the African American community is really important so that future generations will understand where we came from, how these individuals came to be, the icons that we know them to be and also just understanding the African American experience more broadly in this country,” she said. “Having this home still extant, having it where people can visit, where they can learn, is significant because they greatly enhance the understanding of the African American experience in the middle 20th century in itself.”‘We are the ones we have been waiting for’The Simone home first came under Pendleton’s radar in the winter of 2016, when he received a message from a museum curator who alerted him that it was for sale. At first, Pendleton considered other people who might be able to preserve and protect the home, but then he pondered the final line from poet June Jordan’sPoem for South African Women: “We are the ones we have been waiting for.”“I eventually realized that the person was not someone else. The person was me,” Pendleton said. “It was a gesture, an act that I thought could have more impact if it was a group of people joining forces to protect and preserve Nina Simone’s childhood home.””View image in fullscreenSamuel Waymon sits in front of his and Nina Simone’s recently restored childhood home in Tryon, North Carolina.Photograph: Carri Bass PhotographyWith the help of another curator friend, Pendleton brainstormed a list of fellow artists who might be interested in joining him, and Johnson, Mehretu and Gallagher quickly came onboard.When the collective bought the home the following year, Pendleton was contemplating what constituted American culture and how it was represented. The home signified Simone’s contributions to American history. “So much of how we understand our culture as a country and understand our place within it is through memory. And memory is, of course, embodied in individuals. It’s also embodied in different art forms, from painting and sculpture, and of course, in the case of Nina Simone, her music,” Pendleton said. “Her music is powerful from a formal standpoint, but also from a political and cultural one as well, as she was such a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement during her time.”Walking through the home shortly after its purchase, Pendleton was struck by how much he felt the spirit of the home. “‘This is where it all started for Nina, in this humble home,’” he recalled thinking. “And it occurred to me, in that moment, that everything starts somewhere.”The artists then worked with the AACHAF, which developed a preservation strategy for the home. In 2020, the AACHAF created a preservation easement, a legal agreement that restricts any future changes to the property and prevents demolition, which will be overseen by the historic protection non-profit Preservation North Carolina. Architectural consultants and the AACHAF created a blueprint of what the home looked like when it was first constructed by researching typical African American homes in North Carolina during the early 20th century and using an old family photograph from when the Waymons lived there. They also took clues from the materials used for the foundation and the roof to reconstruct the building and prevent further deterioration. The architects created a restoration plan that involved repairing the entryways and walls, evening out the floors, and creating an accessible ramp.View image in fullscreenAACHAF executive director Brent Leggs at the Nina Simone Childhood Home Auction Exhibition at the Pace Gallery in New York on 19 May 2023.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe AACHAF has also been involved in preserving the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane’s homes in Long Island, New York, and Philadelphia. It has also offered direct grants to the preservation of the jazz trumpeter and vocalist Louis Armstrong’s home in New York and blues singer Muddy Waters’ home in Chicago.With the Simone home, Tolbert said, “a model is being built that blends both preservation of the building and program and interpretation of these spaces with an eye of having a greater understanding of the legacy and experience of these individuals, and how the communities where they lived or shaped who they became to be, both artistically as well as in their own right as leaders in the African American community”.Pendleton and the rest of the collective have continued to act as representatives on the project. In 2023, he partnered with the AACHAF and tennis player Venus Williams to create an auction and fundraiser at the Pace Gallery in New York. The project also received funding from the Mellon and Tejemos foundations.Now that the home is restored, the AACHAF and a consulting team are working with St Luke’s CME church, where Simone’s mother, Kate Waymon, preached, to incorporate the surrounding East Side neighborhood into future programming. Pendleton sees the future of the home as being a site for reflection, he said, and to “become a place where artists go with intention to write music, for example, or to perform in the town. In other words, if it can be a mechanism that propels history.”If Simone were to visit the house today, Waymon said that his sister would be amazed and grateful that it has been restored. Along with being a representative of the building’s legacy as Simone’s last surviving sibling, Waymon is also keeping her memory alive by releasing a new duet with his sister of the song Love Me or Leave Me in mid-January 2026. His sister’s voice was recorded in 1967 and Waymon added in his own several months ago to weave the present with the past. The project is a flashback in time, similar to how he felt as he stood on the porch of his recently restored family home.Explore more on these topicsNina SimoneCivil rights movementRaceJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Littler similarly adapted his production ofShe Stoops to Conquerto the interwar years, but now there are PG Wodehouse elements, most subtle but one blatant reference to Jeeves and Wooster – Jack Absolute’s manservant, Fag (Pete Ashmore) is renamed Gieves.View image in fullscreenPatricia Hodge as Mrs Malaprop and Zoe Brough as Lydia Languish.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe drama’s romances bring the comic shenanigans with Jack Absolute (Kit Young) parading as the lowly Sergeant Beverley in order to woo Lydia Languish (Zoe Brough), a bright young thing who romanticises the impoverished life while “Faulty” Faulkland (James Sheldon) emanates neurosis in his wobbly amours with Julia (Boadicea Ricketts). Patricia Hodge provides the malapropisms as Lydia’s imperious aunt who has a dubious grasp on vocabulary. Rebellion ensues and duelling male bravado is sent up, all before Jack’s father, Sir Anthony Absolute (Robert Bathurst), reinstates old-school order.It is all giddiness and froth, with an able cast, and Young a particular joy to watch for his physicality and speed. There are some sparkly eyed meta theatrical moments and a few contemporary references that slip into the period setting (one involving the TV series Traitors). Leah Harris’s movement direction is coordinated immaculately with a fast-changing set designed by Anett Black and Neil Irish.View image in fullscreen‘Faulty’ Faulkland (James Sheldon) emanates neurosis in his wobbly amours with Julia (Boadicea Ricketts).Photograph: Ellie KurttzIt is bubbly but not quite champagne, lacking the hard, sharp kick of Sheridan’s satire on power, class and poverty. The humour remains playful, unserrated around the edges, as if nothing more than a game. Hodge, in a pink froufrou hat, plays Mrs Malaprop with comic breeziness and plenty of hauteur but her version of the character lacks distinctive elements, and her romantic misfire with Lucius O’Trigger (Colm Gormley) does not land in its pathos. This is a long play, and it slackens occasionally.

But his career was stuffed with failures – and this documentary refuses to gloss over the most painful partsJack SealeSat 3 Jan 2026 19.00 ESTShareDavid Bowie’s story ended poignantly. On 8 January 2016, he released Blackstar, an album recorded with the knowledge that he would not live to make another. Two days later, on 10 January 2016, just as listeners andreviewers were starting to laud Blackstaras the tenderest ever expression of his craft,Bowie died.Perhaps only Bowie could have turned his demise into a perfectly timed creative event and, in Jonathan Stiasny’s feature documentary The Final Act, Blackstar is presented as a definitive masterstroke, the closing chapter that makes sense of the rest of the book. To make that case, the film has to take some narrative-shaping liberties, because in reality Bowie’s career was, like most artistic arcs, full of false starts and long pauses. The Final Act dabbles in some parts of the Bowie timeline and elides others before focusing intently on moments that don’t deserve the attention. But in its effort to find a new angle on Bowie and make us love him afresh, it succeeds.Blackstar is seen as a redemption, a coming to terms with the singer having lost his way in the 1980s and 90s. The programme begins in 1983, where we find Bowie at a level of mainstream fame that didn’t sit comfortably with him. “I didn’t want whatever it was I’d earned for myself with the success of Let’s Dance,” he says in an archive clip from some years later. Some might say he tolerated the anguish for quite a while, since the low point of this era, a Pepsi ad made with Tina Turner, was not until 1987. But The Final Act is all about showing us a vulnerable, fallible Bowie, so we’re not minded to quibble.David Bowie: Blackstar review – a spellbinding break with his pastRead moreHe rather overreacted with Tin Machine, the rock band formed, to the bellowed disgust of fans and critics, at the end of the 80s. Most bios skip over Tin Machine as quickly as they can, but this film – which ignores Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Station to Station and the whole Berlin trilogy – has built a thesis around it, so it digs deep. The group’s guitarist, Reeves Gabrels, makes a decent attempt at defending the intention behind the music.The reviews, however, were unforgiving. One of them is read aloud here by its author, Jon Wilde, who in the present day is visibly stunned by how viciously disrespectful he was in calling Bowie a “poor deluded fool” and a “fucking disgrace”. Wilde reports that when that week’s Melody Maker reached Bowie in Switzerland, the great man sobbed. Equally damning is a clip of Terry Wogan, having watched Tin Machine perform on his chatshow in 1991 wearing horrific collarless suits, skewering them with one of his trademark polite but devastating inquiries: “What are you trying to do?” Bowie was unsure of the answer for the rest of the 90s, dipping into rave culture and drum’n’bass.In between assessments of the fallow years, the programme leaps back to cover the sudden termination of the Ziggy Stardust persona in 1973 and Bowie’s brief but brilliant foray into soul with Young Americans in 1975. In the eternal debate about whether he was an alien genius beaming pure visions to us from somewhere between outer space and next week, or a canny magpie stealing whatever was cool from a cultural movement before travelling remorselessly on, The Final Act leans towards the latter: more than one interviewee candidly, but not at all bitterly, describes being on the end of Bowie’s tendency to find creators and form a deep bond with them, before ditching them once he had got what he needed.Eventually that relentless dilettantism created a barrier separating Bowie from his public, before the two came back to each other at the 2000 Glastonbury festival, where Bowie dispelled fears that he would do two hours of experimental jazz-rock and instead delivered a stunning stripped-down version of Life on Mars?, showing he was at last at ease with his status as a beloved heritage act with a corking back catalogue. His subsequent sporadic recorded work was retrospective and personal rather than self-consciously of the moment.If the Glasto show is lingered on – a few too many people are handed an iPad playing the footage, so they can mist up as they rewatch – the indulgence comes from a place of deep affection, and it sets us up to accept that the 2000 triumph began a journey towards Bowie accepting himself that Blackstar completed. That final record is still such a delicate, moving message from the edge of heaven, even more so with the benefit of the insights here from musicians who so carefully worked on it. Ten years on, the loss still stings, but this film brings Bowie a little closer.Bowie: The Final Act is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewDavid BowiereviewsShareReuse this content"

I thought that I was, at the time, a stupid person’: Chris Moore in Nova Scotia.Photograph: Carolina Andrade/The GuardianHealth & wellbeingInterviewAs a student, he was involved in a drunk-driving incident that killed a cyclist. Years later he would become expert in the healing powers of guiltEmine SanerPsychologist Chris Moore saw first-hand how powerful and complex an emotion it isSun 4 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareFuelled by the relief of having finished end-of-year exams, the pleasure of a warm late spring evening and quite a lot of alcohol, the house party was one of those that should have been remembered for all the right reasons. At some point, later in the night, Chris Moore and three friends were ready to leave. The party was some way out of town – Cambridge – and too far to walk, and, anyway, there was a car, temptingly, in the driveway, its keys in the ignition.Somebody – Moore can’t remember who – suggested they drive back, and with the recklessness of youth and too much beer, they all got in. “I ended up in the front passenger seat and fell asleep,” he says. He came to, being taken out of the car by paramedics, then sitting by the side of the road, his face streaming with blood, surrounded by the lights of the emergency services. They had been in an accident, and Moore had hit the windscreen, asleep, and had deep lacerations on his forehead. He was the only one of the four who had been injured. What he didn’t know until the next day, in hospital after surgery, was that they had driven into a cyclist and killed him.“I felt this incredible shock, that mass combination of emotions, obviously the horror of what had happened,” he says. “The massive regret of what we’d done.” He was also fearful of what it meant for him and the people he loved – what would his parents think? “There isn’t a simple story in terms of what the emotions were. It was just a roiling mass of different negative emotions. That’s why I think of guilt as being complex, because all of these other emotions were tied into it.”We should embrace healthy or productive guilt rather than try to hide from itMoore is speaking over Zoom from his office at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, where he is professor of psychology and neuroscience. He has been in Canada since 1985, where he met his wife and had a daughter, and his English accent is just about clinging on. Moore has written a book, The Power of Guilt, informed by his own experience and his 40‑year career as a psychology researcher. His argument is that while guilt is a painful emotion to experience, it’s ultimately helpful – at its heart it functions as a drive to repair relationships, between individuals but also societies. “I wanted to give guilt a makeover in terms of its reputation. We often think of guilt as not a nice thing, because it’s painful and ugly, and I wanted to show why it’s actually good for us, and how, if we treat it properly, we can benefit from it. We should embrace healthy or productive guilt rather than try to hide from it.”Guilt, he thinks, is not its own emotion, but a combination of others that are, he says, “perhaps more basic. So there’s anxiety, which is the fear that our relationships, or something we care about, has been harmed in some way. There’s compassion, sadness or empathy that we feel for the person we might have hurt, and there’s anger at ourselves for what we may have done. Those emotions can be mixed in different concentrations.” If self-directed anger dominates, “that can bleed into shame, which is the idea that you’re abad person, not just that you did abad thing. That tends to make you shy away from relationships rather than try to heal them.” In healthy guilt, those emotions are more balanced. “You realise you have responsibility, and that you need to make amends in some way. You feel that anxiety, but that motivates you to try to heal the relationship rather than to run away from it.”Even before the accident, Moore was familiar with guilt. He grew up in Surrey, the middle child of three in a Catholic family. “I was an overscrupulous kid when it came to religion,” he says. He remembers saying his nightly prayers before bed, and if his mind drifted and he hadn’t concentrated fully on each word, he would repeat the prayer again and again. “That was stimulated by the guilt about not doing it properly and therefore damaging my relationship with God,” he says. If that happened, he worried, he might not get to heaven. That sounds more like self-interest, I point out. But fear is another component of guilt, says Moore.“It was about fear for myself,” he says, “but that was combined with anger at myself.” There was also, looking back as an adult, “some compassion for harming God. I felt that empathy – Christ went so far for me and I can’t even be a good person in return. So there is a mixture of compassion and self-directed anger, combined with anxiety over the loss of that relationship [with God]. That is the feeling of guilt.”By his teens, Moore had abandoned Catholicism. He went to Cambridge to study natural sciences, struggling in his first year, but by the end of his second, when he discovered an interest in psychology, he had started to settle in and study harder. Like many students, though, “I did, unfortunately, get sidetracked by other pursuits and a lot of drinking, and not great behaviour”. Being part of a group that took someone’s car and drove drunk, was clearly stupid and a catastrophic mistake but, back then, not entirely out of character.It was incredible for them to be at my bedside and explicitly say, ‘We forgive you’Moore and two others in the car were sentenced to six months in prison (the driver got nine). In his book, Moore writes that, not unreasonably, they had been considered at fault as a group, but the lawyers for the passengers appealed, which was successful. By then, Moore had spent a week in a high-security facility, followed by nearly three months in an open prison.When he was in hospital after the accident, his parents arrived and, unusually for them, were gentle with him and told him they loved him – the first time he had experienced this from them. Their reaction was “hugely important”, he says. “I was in that transition from childhood to adulthood, and I was still part of that nuclear family. They were not expressive, loving parents. They were loving in the sense that the fact of their parenting showed they loved us, and of course they did, but they were not expressive in their love for us. It was what you might call a typical, middle-class British family of that time, but my feeling was there was always some doubt about whether I was loved, and that was dispelled at that moment. So that was huge.”The car had hit a group of cyclists, killing one and injuring others. One of the group came to see Moore in hospital, accompanied by some friends. They were all members of the Christian Union. “It was incredible for them to be at my bedside and explicitly say: ‘We forgive you.’ Their approach was that only God can judge, and that our duty as Christians is to forgive.” What reassured him that it was within their gift – as opposed to the family of the young man they had killed – to forgive him? (Later, the family did write to Moore’s parents to offer their own forgiveness.) “At the time, I was in no state to do much analysis of whether this was appropriate or not. Certainly we could question whether they had a right to do it, but it was the fact they did it that made the difference.”View image in fullscreenChris Moore and his parents at his graduation ceremony, Cambridge University, 1985.Photograph: courtesy of Chris MooreIt didn’t miraculously alleviate his guilt. “But an important part of it had been relieved. I’m not trying to say I had a right not to feel guilty any more. All I’m doing is reflecting on how the psychology of it works, how what people do within relationships or social interaction affects how we feel.”He writes that in the first few weeks after the accident, he couldn’t imagine ever escaping the weight of his remorse, but that forgiveness, particularly from the survivors of the accident, was absolutely key to being able to live a good life. “I was incredibly lucky, because if that had not happened, then there’s no question that guilt would have lingered for much longer and probably still would be affecting me significantly today.”It did shape his life, and the research and work he would go on to do, including this book. Of the four friends in that car, two have since died. Moore is in touch occasionally with the other one, and offered him the chance to read a draft of his book; he declined. “He’s left it behind. For him it hasn’t, perhaps, stayed with him in the same way it stayed with me.”Freud’s theory of guilt is that it starts in early childhood, based on a fear of losing the love of one’s caregiver, and that conscience develops as a self-punishing way of controlling one’s behaviour. In the mid-90s, Moore read a paper by the US social psychologist Roy Baumeister, who suggested guilt is the result of damaging a relationship (not, as once thought, about breaking the moral codes either of society or our conscience) and of empathy for another’s distress. This informed Moore’s own thinking.As parents, we can encourage our children to have a healthier relationship to guilt by encouraging empathy. “This approach uses what we sometimes call guilt induction,” says Moore (what many of us might think of as a “guilt trip”). “Imagine a child has done something mean to a playmate, and the parent says: ‘Look how you made Johnny feel, look how you made Johnny cry.’ You’re trying to induce that empathic side of guilt, to help the child recognise that what they did was probably wrong and that they should attempt some form of repair.” If the parent punishes the child instead, “that makes them feel bad about themselves, [think] they’re a bad person, and the argument is that’s going to be less conducive to repairing relationships”.Guilt doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent. It just means you’re sensitive to your child’s needsWhen does a guilt trip become damaging? “The question is whether you’re doing it for learning purposes versus trying to control the behaviour and trying to get more attention on you.” When children become teenagers, the danger can be that parents use guilt trips “to promote conformity to their own wishes and family ideals. That may be overtly troublesome in that there is tension and conflict, or the child conforms, but has more deep-seated issues.”Is parenting guilt inevitable? “I think it’s close to inevitable,” says Moore. “That doesn’t mean it has to be damaging, it just means you’re likely to feel it. Keep in mind that I’m thinking of guilt through the lens that it’s a positive emotion. It feels bad, but it’s good for you. You feel guilt as a parent because you want the best for your child, but it needs to be in the right dose. One of the problems is that parents, particularly mothers, are bombarded with all the things that could go wrong – whether they don’t breastfeed, too much screen time, all of the ways in which you parent.” Being a working parent is likely to create guilt. “It doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent. It just means you’re sensitive to the needs of your child. That’s why guilt arises, not because you’re doing a bad job.” People with pets, especially those with dogs, appear to experience similar parental guilt.View image in fullscreen‘A functioning life, and a functioning world, is all about strong relationships, and the point of guilt is to strengthen and manage relationships.’Photograph: Carolina Andrade/The GuardianWhy do I feel guilty when I walk past a police officer, even though I’ve done nothing wrong? “I do, too, but not because of my past,” says Moore. “This is the funny thing about the human mind: [seeing a police officer is] a stimulus to the things that you might have done wrong. That’s in connection to guilt within the context of authority figures, who provide us with exposure to the norms and standards that we ultimately adopt within our internal guiding system – our conscience. The set of rules that make up our conscience is never complete, there’s always a chance that there’s something else we need to pay attention to.” Seeing a police officer may be a subconscious reminder of that, he says.Women appear to be more prone to guilt than men. There is a cultural element, he says, to societal expectations, but women do tend to care more about relationships, and about relationships going well. “If guilt is about trying to manage your relationships and make sure they’re healthy, then women are going to feel more guilt.”As a society, individuals appear to be becoming more isolated and self-centred. Might this lead to less guilt? It isn’t going to lead to more psychopaths, he says, because that is as a result of brain dysfunction, but he does worry we can focus too much on ourselves as individuals. “We are ultimately a social species; we wouldn’t be where we are today in terms of evolution if we did not have such incredibly complex and sophisticated ways of interacting with other people. We are the most social species, and to think of ourselves as being sophisticated individuals is to miss the point that really it’s about the relationships that we have or should have.”How should people alleviate their own guilt? If you’re feeling guilty because you’ve harmed someone, then a genuine apology and an attempt at reparation is vital, says Moore. “For relationships to be healed, both sides have to want to heal it. Guilt is what motivates the one who’s done harm to try to seek forgiveness. Then, I think, there is some onus on the other to bend towards the person that harmed them and forgive them if they feel the relationship is worth keeping.” If there is a pattern of harm, he adds, this may not be the case.If the guilt arises from something long ago, or where it would be impossible to make amends, self‑forgiveness, says Moore, “is really the route to healing”. He stresses he is not a therapist, but one way that might help is to “step outside yourself and look at yourself from a third‑person perspective. Imagine you were the person you’d harmed, and that you had received the acts of reparation or apology that you provided – would you forgive that person? Would you forgive yourself for what you’ve done if you were somebody else? I think if you can honestly say you did all you could do, you felt genuine contrition and sadness, and wanted to heal the relationship, then you deserve forgiveness.” Some people, he adds, are over-conscientious “and they tend to be very guilt-prone. I think being aware of one’s conscience and the role that it plays in guilt is important, because then you can say: ‘Maybe it’s being unreasonable here.’”Moore was forgiven – not just by his parents and friends, and those affected by his part in that awful night, but by wider society. After a year’s suspension, his college allowed him to finish his degree, then do a PhD. He thinks he would probably not have gone on to have the career he has if his research in the 80s on developmental psychology had required a criminal record check. “And that seems, to me, to be overly harsh.” This can disproportionately affect certain groups – young black men in the US, for instance, whose records for relatively minor crimes have an impact on their opportunities over the rest of their lives.Should there be more guilt in the world? I’m thinking of politicians who inflict war on others, or whose decisions mean millions of people suffer as a result. “I think there should be a recognition of what guilt is and what it’s for,” says Moore. “I think there should be more attempts to keep our relationships strong, whether those relationships are at the individual level, or whether they’re larger scale in terms of societies. A functioning life, and a functioning world, is all about strong relationships, and the point of guilt is to strengthen and manage relationships.”Within the criminal justice system, Moore thinks restorative justice should play a bigger role, “because it puts relationships at the heart, and says that crime is an offence against individuals, but also the community, and we need to think how we restore those relationships in society”.The argument that individual Britons alive today weren’t involved in slavery, and therefore shouldn’t feel collective guilt, is weakThe idea of collective guilt is a current one. In the globalBlack Lives Mattermovement, the idea of “white guilt” reached the mainstream, although many activists argue it is unproductive. “You may feel [white guilt] for the wrong reasons,” says Moore. “Let’s say you know you’re not being progressive enough for your ‘in’ group, and you feel guilt about that, and that leads to virtue signalling and so on.”Collective guilt can also place too much emphasis on individuals, rather than the group. In the case of the UK’s role in slavery, and the question of reparations, the argument that individual Britons alive today weren’t involved, and therefore shouldn’t feel guilt, is weak. “You’re saying, for the purposes of this issue: ‘I’m not part of the group, I’m an individual, and I had no responsibility for it.’ The question is: did your group have responsibility for it? Did the UK as an entity, as a collective, a nation, have responsibility for it? And if they did, then there is a reasonable debate to have about reparations.” It’s not easy to resolve, Moore acknowledges. “I don’t want to say I have any kind of solution, but because you can think of society as about the relationships between groups, then in principle, you can say collective guilt can play a role.”Ultimately it comes back to healing relationships, whether individually or at societal level. “I really like to take a relationship-first approach to things. I don’t like to think of myself as an individual. I like to think of myself as the collective of relationships that I have in the world, whether it’s to my daughter or my wife, my colleagues or friends or whatever, that’s what makes me, not my individuality. I think if you have a relationship-first approach, it actually changes the way you go about trying to fix these things. I don’t want to make myself a better person; I want to make myrelationshipsbetter.”It’s not obvious from my laptop screen, but Moore has scars on his forehead from when he hit his head in the accident – he points to his left temple. Is that a daily reminder? “I’m still aware of it, obviously, but I don’t think about that event every day. The message that I want to get across is that, to some extent, anybody can do really stupid things and damaging things to other people.” For most people, he adds, “there should be a path of forgiveness and reconciliation; that’s really the message”.View image in fullscreen‘I was offered forgiveness, it’s my responsibility to accept that forgiveness.’Photograph: Carolina Andrade/The GuardianHas he spent his life trying to make up for it? To prove he is a “good” person after all? No more than anyone else trying to be a good person, he says. Because of that crucial week in hospital – when Moore was offered forgiveness by his family and one of the victims of the accident – “I didn’t come out of it with shame. I didn’t think I was a bad person. I thought I was, at the time, a stupid person. I’d done a stupid thing, drunk too much, agreed to get in a car that wasn’t ours, with somebody who was not capable of driving. But it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person.”More than 40 years on, does Moore still feel guilty about the accident? “There were different sources of guilt attached to different relationships that had potentially been harmed. So with my parents, I don’t feel any guilt, because they gave me their forgiveness. I don’t feel guilt in relation to my friends. I don’t feel guilt in relation to the criminal justice system. The only place would be guilt in relation to the person who was killed and the survivors. But I guess where I’m at is that because I was offered forgiveness, it’s my responsibility to accept that forgiveness.” He does still feel guilt, he adds. “But not nearly as strong as what I felt at the time.”The Power of Guilt: Why We Feel It and Its Surprising Ability to Heal by Chris Moore is published on 8 January by August Books (£20).

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 4 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareValerie, 73I’ve actually found that age has affected sex in a very positive way. Now I can have five orgasms in a rowI met Max in 1975 and in those early days sex was always romantic, with candlelight and incense. We realised then that sex was a big part of our lives, wherever we lived or whatever was going on.As we’ve got older, a lot of our friends have stopped having any kind of intimacy. It really makes me sad. They’ll say things like, “I had so much sex when I was younger, I don’t need it now.” I think that’s a shame, because intimacy builds intimacy. So no matter what, sex has always been a priority for both of us. There have been times when we’ve had surgeries or illnesses, or after our kids were born, when we took a hiatus from sex, but that was fine because we knew we were both anxious to get back to it.At our age, you don’t feel as attractive as you once were, but we’re both accepting of the changes that come with getting olderIf there’s ever a time when we can’t be intimate, such as after Max had a knee operation, then we make sure to cuddle and kiss.Of course growing old brings physical and mental changes, but I believe intimacy helps address those challenges. At our age, you don’t feel as attractive as you once were, but we’re both accepting of the changes that come with getting older. For us it’s a priority that we can still be intimate in the face of all that. We still dress up sometimes, and I’ll wear nice lingerie that I’ve had for years. We spend a lot of time cuddling, and if we don’t go to bed at the same time we’ll make sure to have a big kiss beforehand.I’ve actually found that age has affected sex in a very positive way. I’ve become more orgasmic than ever. Now I can have five orgasms in a row because Max’s so keen on it happening. I read about multiple orgasms before and I never quite believed it, but I guess it exists – even at 70.I just don’t want sex to end and for it to be the last time. I figured there’s got to be a last time for us, maybe in our 80s, even 90s if we get there, but I hope it won’t be for a long time. If something happened to Max tomorrow and he was gone, I don’t think I’d become intimate with someone else. I’ve had too many wonderful years.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

We have sex about once a week, and I think that’s pretty good for 73.Sometimes we joke about how we’d like to bottle our experience for our friends, because most of them don’t have sex any more. I want other elderly people to realise that age is not a barrier, and that if you do certain things to compensate for your age – such as lubrication – you can have a sex life way into your older years.Over the years, I figured out that if you really want to have good sex, make it so that your partner’s orgasm is the most important part. About 20 years ago our sex evolved from intercourse to what we call “outercourse”. I was having a hard time maintaining an erection, which I don’t think is all that uncommon for men who are over 50. So then we moved to oral sex and it’s been fine ever since.For us, sex is not a spontaneous thing. It’s usually Saturday night, which is our date nightI would say that what we do now is better than the intercourse of our youth. There’s a slowness to it, a lot of touching, a lot of intimacy.For us, sex is not a spontaneous thing. It’s usually Saturday night, which is our date night. It’s important that we kiss and snuggle, and we spend some serious time just getting hot before we start doing any touching. We’ll get to the ending where one person has this massive orgasm, and then we switch roles.There are no perfect marriages. Like everyone, we have our little ups and downs, but we still know we are madly, crazy in love and that is critical to our sex life.I believe great sex contributes to a great marriage, and vice versa. Of course, at our age we’ve got a few health issues going on, but our sex is better today than it was yesterday, and I expect it to be better next week.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Second, please also note that the Chinese restaurantPoon’s, byAmy Poon, scion of the Poon’s restaurant dynasty, recently rooted itself in the New Wing.Ice-skating itself I have nothing against, but we can all agree that these slippery yuletide stampedes on temporary rinks are the polar opposite of festive, so surely it would be far better to be hiding indoors in the warmth with a round of prawn wontons, a bowl of nourishing “magic soup”, or some wind-dried meat claypot rice. Plus, when the weather outside is frightful, the decor in Poon’s is utterly delightful. So gorgeous, in fact, that within two minutes of entering this dusky, muted salmon-pink, twinkly peach, womb-like space, I found myself asking for the name and brand of the paint shade, because it felt instinctively one that, if applied to my own walls at home, would solve many existential problems.View image in fullscreenPoon’s house pickles are ‘outstanding in their sharp, measured acidity’.Unsurprisingly, I later learned that Amy Poon had hired a feng shui master to advise on the whole delightful shebang. Does feng shui really work? Who knows. But do wild rose tones, tasteful, stencilled murals, embroidered benches and heroically pretty crockery make my heart soar? Hell, yes. On one mantelpiece at the end of the room stands a large, framed photograph of Amy’s father Bill, keeping a watchful eye over proceedings. Back in the 1980s, Bill Poon, a Hong Kong migrant, was the UK’sfirstChinese chef/restaurateur to nab himself a Michelin star. Somehow, his daughter managed to escape the greasy clutches of hospitality for decades – working in, among other professions, marketing, PR and the arts – until she set up firsta short-term pop-upin Clerkenwell in 2018, followed bya wontoneriaat Carousel in central London. There’s also a thriving shop and mail-order business that sells Poon’s signature sauces, oils and wind-dried meats. Casa Dentalwayshas Poon’s Extraordinary Chilli Oil and its chilli vinegar in the fridge, because it enlivens any old leftover.View image in fullscreenPoon’s vegetarian potsticker dumplings: ‘A sumptuously brown sear and a mushy, well-seasoned filling’.Notably, Poon’s at Somerset House stands starkly apart from the rest of the business. This is far from a gift shop for Poon’s products with a few tables, but rather it’s a romantic, elegant little nook that has about it the feel of a sublime afternoon tea spot, albeit one that serves bowls of zha jiang aubergines and thick, lardo-based prawn toast that is named, somewhat cryptically, “The Hill That Amy Didn’t Die On”.The cooking here is refreshingly light, delicate and, you might even say, wholesome. Crunchy house pickles are outstanding in their sharp, measured acidity, and a further bowl of crudites with a pungent, funky, fermented tofu dip really packs a punch – that dip alone is worth booking a table for. Vegetarian potsticker dumplings have a sumptuously brown sear and a mushy, well-seasoned filling, while a bowl of silken tofu with avocado and small chunks of century egg is subtle and balm-like, rather than punchy.View image in fullscreenPoon’s beef claypot rice: ‘gloriously stodgy’.A large plate of white-cut poussin is poached perfectly, carved and served skin on and on the bone, and comes with a separate pale green spring onion, ginger and chilli relish to add as you see fit. Next up, a heavy claypot arrives filled with gloriously stodgy rice topped with minced beef and a raw, orange-yolked egg that’s mixed in tableside. Even so, there’s a sense with many of the dishes that they’ve been pared back a little, to avoid huge thrusts of umami, heat or anything cloying. Poon’s also does a £28 pre-theatre menu, and you could definitely eat your fill here without worrying about snoozing through Jersey Boys. That said, if you drink enough of the Hong Kong milk punch with lemon vodka, Lillet rosé, black tea, guava, passion fruit and condensed milk, well, you might well be due a little nap.The one dish at Poon’s that really didn’t set me on fire with happiness, however, was the duck salad, which, in comparison with its companions on the menu, felt oddly drab; there wasn’t a lot of duck or soy dressing, either, and it was a bit heavy on the cabbage.

But just what goes in, and what should be left out?Felicity CloakeSun 4 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 08.03 ESTShareBreakfast tacos should not be confused with tacos eaten for breakfast. Of course, they oftenareeaten for breakfast, but the stuffed flour tortillas eaten on both sides of the southern US border are quite different from thetacos mañanerosof central and southern Mexico, the rich, corn-basedtacos de canasta(“tacos in a basket”) or thesmoky beef barbacoathat Monterrey-born Lily Ramirez-Foran recalls being her dad’s favourite Sunday breakfast. Instead,Texas Monthly explains, breakfast tacos “marry the key elements of an American morning – scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes – with the Mexican staples of salsa, cheese, refried beans … genius.”Although they’re originally a Mexican creation, according to José R Ralat, the magazine’s taco editor (what a job title!), these $3 treats are now so popular north of the border that they’re the subject of regular taco wars, mostly between those who claim Austin as their spiritual home (often blow-ins, according to their fiercest critics), and those who know that no single city can take the credit. The fillings may vary, from pork chops to chilaquiles and beans to cheese, but Ralat maintains that all should be salty, soft and, above all, comforting,and told the Washington Post a few years agothat “the greatest breakfast taco is the one made at home”. Which, if you live 5,000 miles from the Mexican border, is good news indeed.The tortillasBreakfast tacos are almost always housed in flour tortillas, rather than corn ones, as befits a product of wheat-growing northern Mexico. Though corn tortillas are far older, dismissing the flour kind as inauthentic is, as Ralat explains inhis book American Tacos, the product of the collective historical amnesia that occurred when Texas separated from Mexico; flour tortillas arrived there long before Washington did. Yes, you can use corn ones, if you prefer(J Kenji López-Alt’s recipefor Serious Eats gives that option), but, for me, the pillowy pliancy of flour tortillas makes them the better choice here.View image in fullscreenLisa Fain makes her own tortillas for her breakfast tacos. All inset photos by Felicity Cloake.I can’t recommend the highly processed, palm oil-laced, long-life “wraps” that have proliferated in British supermarkets in recent years, though – they’re too big and tough, and taste weirdly sweet, too. There are some decent tortillas for sale online, but, given how important they are to this dish, you might consider making your own. Happily, they’re much easier than the corn version, thanks to a little thing called gluten. Lisa Fain, better known online asthe Homesick Texan, hasa good-looking recipe.The eggsYou don’t need to have eggs in a breakfast taco – potato and chorizo,carne guisada(beef stew) and beans and cheese are also all popular choices – but the speed-to-reward ratio of the protein-rich egg can hardly be bettered (though plant-based alternatives such as tofu will give it a run for its money). Fain fills her tacos withplain scrambled eggs, made fluffy by the addition of milk, while bothHope Rodriguez,for 34 years the art coordinator at Texas Monthly, and Reyna and Maritza Vazquez of Austin’s much fetedVeracruz All Naturalchain, add tomato and onion. Add jalapeño (Rodriguez) or coriander (the Vazquezes) to turn the eggs intohuevos a la Mexicana, named after its patriotic colours. I prefer to keep the eggs simple and add the vegetables separately, but feel free to season them as you wish.View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt opts for fried rather than scrambled egg in his breakfast tacos.American scrambled eggs, in my experience, tend to be cooked hard and fast for a dry and fluffy result, rather than a loose and creamy one – indeed, López-Alt, who confesses that he has not historically been a breakfast taco fan, blames the eggs for that. “Rubbery and sulfurous,”he writes on Serious Eats, “they become too dense to absorb any salsa and too dry to add moisture, much needed no matter how great your fresh flour or corn tortilla is.”His solution is to swap the traditional scrambled egg for a fried one, “figuring the liquid yolk would make the perfect sauce”. I can’t argue that a runny egg is always delicious, but I feel strongly that, just as an ice-cream is much more enjoyable licked from a cornet than off a little plastic spoon, tacos, like pizza slices, are best consumed without the mediation of knife or fork, which makes López-Alt’s creation a very messy affair. It does, however, look great, so if that’s your primary focus, by all means fry them instead. At the same time, you might like to take a good, hard look at your priorities.The restI’m a big fan of beans for breakfast, and therefried onesdeployed by Fain are delicious and easy to spread over a tortilla – you could use cooked black or pinto beans, but I’d recommend mashing them with a fork first or they’ll all fall out when you pick up the taco, which you absolutely must. (Alternatively, you could mash a ripe avocado and use it in much the same way.)Potatoes are another popular choice for carb-on-carb lovers. López-Alt, for instance, dices and par-boils his, then sautées them in chorizo oil until deliciously crisp, while Carol Barclay of Portland, TX, whose recipe features in a Texas Cookbook I picked up in the gift shop of the Mission San José in San Antonio, calls for frozen hash browns. Unfortunately, I fail to realise until it’s too late that Carol probably doesn’t mean the aggressively crunchy triangles beloved of a certain fast food chain, but sauteed potatoes much like López-Alt’s. Both, of course, work, but my great lumps of fried potato do make the dish rather heavier than I suspect Carol intended.View image in fullscreenReyna and Maritza Vazquez’s breakfast tacos make thrifty use of stale tortilla chips.Alternatively, you might prefer the migas taco, an Austin peculiarity that turns stale tortillas into gold – though, to my relief,the Vazquezes recipeincluded in the book The Tacos of Texas calls for ready-fried tortilla chips, which bring a very satisfying crunch to proceedings. Definitely the best thing to do with that bag that’s been open since New Year’s Eve, assuming there’s not quite enough left to make nachos.I’ve gone for beans, so I’ve skipped both chips or potatoes, not least because, as Fain wisely observes, the genius of the breakfast taco is in how easy it is to eat: unlike, say, the breakfast burrito, they’re “nimble and efficient. They easily fit in your hand and your mouth, with all your breakfast needs self-contained in one neat, little package. While I don’t advocate eating and driving (or eating and walking), these are up to the task, though they are equally as delicious in a more proper, sit-down forum.” For this reason, breakfast tacos tend to contain only a handful of fillings – because they’re small, you can always order two or three different examples to cover all bases.Fain likes hers with bacon or sausage patties, López-Alt with chorizo, Barclay with “hot sausage”, which is easy enough to recreate with sausage meat and spices (I use what purports to be a“copycat Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage” recipecontaining cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sage, black pepper and coriander), while Rodriguez offers a selection of “refried beans, bacon, chunky hash brown potatoes, and fried chorizo”. I like the salty, savoury heat of chorizo (the soft Spanish kind we get here isn’t quite the same as the looser, raw Mexican variety, but it makes a fine substitute), and the way its fat perfumes the rest of the dish, but you may prefer to use another sort of sausage or cured meat, a vegetarian alternative, or indeed leave it out together. As Fain cautions, “Whether you choose to add breakfast meat or vegetables isn’t that big of a deal, just don’t add them all at once or your breakfast taco will be unwieldy and hard to handle”.The salsaAnyone still traumatised by the sweet, gloopy jarred salsas of the past, with their aggressive notes of dried onion, will be reassured to know there are some good pre-made salsas available these days, but the best kind will always be freshly made. I try theSerious Eats versionusing charred plum tomatoes, chilli, garlic and onion, andFain’s uncle Richard’s recipe, using raw onion and garlic, plus pickled jalapeños and tinned tomatoes, which isn’t dissimilar to Rodriguez’s slightly simpler version using blackened fresh chillies. Ready-cooked fruit is quicker and gives a richer flavour, especially in midwinter, but the smoky flavour of the grilled pepper and onion proves irresistible (I’ve left the garlic raw to give the salsa a bit of an edge).View image in fullscreenHope Rodriguez’s breakfast tacos are stuffed with refried beans, bacon, chunky hash brown potatoes and fried chorizo.The extrasLópez-Alt suggests soured cream (or Mexicancrema) and coriander, Fain grated cheddar, and the Vazquezes monterey jack and avocado – top it as you wish, but know that any taco is improved by a spritz of lime juice. Also, note that if you’re making breakfast tacos for a crowd, Barclay’s recipe mixes fried sausage meat, hash browns, chopped pepper, onion, celery and beaten eggs before baking it for 45 minutes, then allowing everyone to scoop their own spoonful of warm, potatoey filling into a freshly heated tortilla. Much easier, if perhaps slightly less fun.Perfect breakfast tacosPrep15 minCook30 minMakes2, to serve 1-2For the salsa (makes about 300g; or use a ready-made one)½ small white or yellow onion, cut into chunks1-2 mild green chillies(eg, jalapeño)1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed250g whole tinned plum tomatoesSalt and black pepperFor the tacos45g chorizo cooking sausage, diced, or 1 tsp neutral oil¼ red pepper, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely sliced½ mild green chilli(eg, jalapeño), cut into rings¼ small white or yellow onion, finely sliced4 tbsp refried beans2 eggs2 medium tortillas, preferably flour10g grated cheddar, or similar (optional)1 small handful fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to serve2 lime wedges, to serveFirst make the salsa.

Should I tell her family?Your friend fears dependency and wants to regain control. Is there someone you can talk to about your own feelings?Annalisa BarbieriSun 4 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTShareI am in my80s and an old friendhasseveral health issues.Shewill probably die in the not too distant futuredue to the inoperable cancer she has been aware of for some years.She has two adult children, withdomestic and career problems of their own, but she sees them frequently, and I know them both.Some time ago, talkingto herabout a mutual friend with dementia, I said if I were diagnosed withit, Iwould want to end my life while I was still me. She asked how I would do that,and has brought up the subject once or twice since.I was afraidshe would ask me to help her end her own life.While I could not bear to see her suffer(her cancer does not currently cause her pain), I’m not sure I would have the strength to do this.She recently showed me a pill bottle, which she said contained her way out.Shewas prescribed these tabletsandwarned not to exceed the dose, as that would prove fatal. She said knowing they are there means shecan cope with life withdebilitating conditions.When I told another friend about this,she said I should speak to her doctor and/or her sons, as she sounded clinically depressed. I didn’t do anything– who wouldn’t be depressed by being housebound, with limited mobility and terminal cancer?And my inclination is to continue to say and do nothing. I realisethis means I will have to keep the secret should she use the tablets.But she trusts me, and talks to me in a way she doesn’tto her sons and her siblings. Do you think I should continue to keep her confidence?I’m sorry to hear about your friend. I must point out that you cannot help her end her own life as that would be a criminal offence. So I’m glad she hasn’t asked you to do that.I went to clinical psychologist, psychotherapist and CEO of Tavistock Relationships Andrew Balfour. He is also the author of Life and Death: Our Relationship With Ageing, Dementia and Other Fates of Time, and we had a very long chat about your letter. He thought there was a great deal of “anxiety, loss and grief in your letter, which must be difficult to bear for both of you”. We discussed how your friend must be feeling: that she fears vulnerability and dependency and wants to regain control. Hence the pills. By telling you about them, she’s trying to tell you she’s scared.If your underlying feelings can be put into words, the conflict about what to do might reduceBalfour felt your letter “conveyed your feelings of being burdened with responsibility for what happens, expressed in your feeling of being stuck in such a difficult dilemma”. Can you find someone you can trust, a friend, or therapist, to think with you about your feelings? He said: “If such underlying feelings can be put into words, the conflict about what to do might reduce and there may be more space for understanding the deeper anxieties which are driving the situation.” Then you can think about how best to respond.Balfour also wondered if it might be worth getting in touch with your friend’s local palliative care team as there might be someone there who could talk to her in a more general way to help put her mind at rest; this would need to be timed carefully, otherwise you might risk more anxiety. Is there someone in her medical team who could offer her psychological support, or knows of someone who can?You can continue to support her as you have been doing: by being there and listening. She clearly trusts and feels safe with you: do not underestimate how important that is. By telling others what she’s told you, you would risk her confidence and trust. If they take the pills away, there’s no guarantee that she won’t find more pills or end her life in a different way. So no, I wouldn’t tell them. Balfour suggested you could, if you wish, check in with her children and express concern in other ways.Also, please ensure you have support too. This isn’t easy for you either.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.The caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.Unfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.Banks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using theelaborate digital wallet fraudand have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.Danai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”Santander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.UK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.What the scam looks likeThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.After a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.They may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.View image in fullscreenThe scammers use text messages to secure victims’ personal and bank details.Photograph: DCPhoto/Alamy“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay orGooglePay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.From there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.What to doBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.Nationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.HSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.UK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”Apple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.Google did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsBanks and building societiesScam watchScamsConsumer affairsBankingAppleGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I tried the usual tricks: switching off notifications, deleting addictive apps, moving icons around, greyscale mode. None of it worked. Without notifications, I just checkedmoreto see if something had happened. When I deleted apps, I used the browser instead. And when I deletedthat… I would eventually reinstall everything in a weak moment. (Which usually meant spending even more time on my phone as I had to log in everywhere again.)It slowly dawned on me that, vis-a-vis the smartphone, we cannot pretend to be fully rational adults with free will. I was addicted, of course. And if a system is designed to hijack your attention, the solution isn’t more heroic self-discipline. Ideally, big tech would be regulated: dopamine taxes, limits on algorithmic addictiveness, the whole package. But until that world exists, I needed a personal version of structural change: parental controls.So I deleted the addictive apps again, marched over to my wife, and asked her to set a passcode. And crucially, I asked her to block the browser, too. That sounds extreme for many, but it’s the key step. Of course, I kept the useful non-addictive apps such as Maps and Photos, but removed all the infinite-scroll dopamine traps.The feeling of liberation was … shocking. In the first days, I constantly grabbed my phone out of habit, only to stare at a device that couldn’t give me the sugar hit my brain was expecting. And slowly but surely, the compulsive urge weakened.I still relapse sometimes. When I need to update apps, my wife temporarily removes the block, and occasionally forgets to put it back. Within days I’ll find – with a mix of shame and fascination – that all the old addictive stuff has somehow found its way back on to my phone. It may sound slightly pathetic to outsource your willpower to your spouse, but until we regulate big tech properly, I genuinely recommend it to anyone who struggles as I did. Life is too short to let your phone win.Moral Ambition: How to Find Your PurposebyRutger Bregmanisout in paperback on15 January(Bloomsbury,£10.99);guardianbookshop.com.… get hangoversPatrick Grant, businessowner andjudge onThe Great British Sewing BeeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty ImagesWhen I turned 30, I noticed hangovers for the first time. I must have had them before, but I hadn’t registered they were annoying until that point. At 40, they got worse. By the time I was 45, they were debilitating. I was getting up in the morning and my brain was foggy and my body felt like mush. Even if I’d only had a couple of glasses, I was waking up feeling way below par.The final straw was when my friend had a divorce party and there was champagne, cocktails, wine with dinner, then dancing afterwards. I was downing absinthe like it was Lucozade. I ended up having a hangover that lasted from Saturday until Wednesday.The party was in October, and I decided to give up alcohol until January. November and December in the fashion industry means endless opportunities for serious booze consumption. I went to all the same parties and dealt with everybody raising their eyebrows and trying to foist drinks on me. And I got through the absolute tedium of drinking elderflower, which was the only alternative to alcohol then.It was like my brain had been taken out and rinsed and stuck back in my headWithin a week I felt different. Within a month, I felt considerably different. When I got to January, I felt I had achieved so much more in those two months than I had at any point in the previous 10 years. It was like my brain had been taken out and rinsed and stuck back in my head.So I decided not to start drinking again until Easter, and then my birthday, which is in May. And when I got to May, I thought, I’m just going to stop until after filming Sewing Bee, which was late summer, and then I thought, I might as well just do a year.By the end of that year I’d actually done all the hard stuff. The difficult bit is trying to work your way through all those social situations in which booze is the baseline: going to a party, pub, dinner, wedding, picnic, summer cricket matches in the sun – all the stuff that in this country is built on booze.The other difficult thing is the first or second time you hang out with friends who are still drinking, and try to rebuild a way of relating to them that doesn’t involve drink. You learn that, actually, all the funny things can still happen, because everybody else is still drunk. If you go into those situations willing to be carried along on the wave of it all, you can have fun, too.Eight years on, I have forgotten what hangovers feel like. I’m reminded because my girlfriend occasionally drinks. I am sympathetic, but also inside I think, “I’m so glad this isn’t me.”… carewhat people thinkAndi Oliver, chef and presenterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Serena Brown/The GuardianI have quit being pressured by external influences, and caring what others think of me. Or you could say, I’ve given up on giving a shit. On the one hand, I’ve always been quite a free person. When I was young, I was in a band with Neneh Cherry called Rip Rig + Panic. We used to feel so free on stage: we’d hurl ourselves around, tuck our dress into our knickers and dance barefoot. We were conscious of not conforming to stereotypical ideas of what beauty is, what body type we should have, how much room you’re allowed to take up as a black woman.But by the time I was 30, I had a massive nervous breakdown. It had been there in the background, squirrelling away at me all the time: “You’re not quite good enough, you’re a bit too fat, you’re a bit too black, you’re a bit too loud.”I had to examine where those messages had come from. And the answer was: everywhere. It was in Jackie magazine, where there was never one person who looked like me. I also lived in a racist place in Suffolk in the 1970s. Until I hit this breakdown, I hadn’t understood how deeply these ideas were embedded in me.So I started to get rid of that stuff. The older I get, the more I get rid of. Now, I live my life pretty free from caring about how other people have decided I am meant to look, how much noise I’m allowed to make, how many opinions I’m allowed to have. It’s wonderfully liberating.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Josie Long, Louise Hazel and Meera Sodha.Illustration: Billie J/The Guardian… eat low-fat foodJosie Long, comedianView image in fullscreenJosie LongPhotograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Tribeca FestivalWhen I was young, I was trapped in diet culture. I grew up with it, because I was overweight as a child. It sabotaged my relationship with food and my body. I went to a girls’ school, and it wasn’t that we were policing one another so much as constantly criticising and starving ourselves. I treated my body so cruelly and saw food in such a warped way. A lot of people of our generation are survivors of this horrible war on our bodies.In 2010, I was struggling with disordered eating; I was doing TV and felt under pressure and was critical of my body and myself. And then, that November, I was in a car crash. I was on tour with some friends and we were driving in Wales; we all nearly died. After the accident, we couldn’t believe we’d survived. We were staying with my friend on Barry Island and I went to the local Chinese takeaway and spent as much money as I could there. Then I went to the Spar for a feast of chocolate and prosecco.I don’t want to live on my knees eating some processed nonsense when I could have a thick dollop of Greek yoghurt with honey and a walnut on itFrom that moment on, I decided: I am here to live, and I am here to live well. So I’m buying butter. My parents bought margarine, which is so gross and bad, and butter is so delicious. Eating it makes me feel like a medieval puritan experiencing the devil’s pleasures. Never again will I drink semi-skimmed milk. Never am I going to eat a low-fat version of anything. I boycott Coke, but I’d never drink a diet cola. And I feel healthier for it. There is nothing sicker for your body than to be in a prolonged state of yearning and compromise. I don’t want to live on my knees eating some processed nonsense when I could have a thick dollop of Greek yoghurt with honey and a walnut on it.It is a wholesale rebellion against diet culture and the amount of time I wasted hating myself and my body by buying horrible little fake diet treats. Never again am I going to eat two squares of dark chocolate and pretend that is enough. I’m not interested in a parody version of what is good. I want to live a little.I feel so grateful for the intuitive eating and body positivity movements that have been popularised over the last 10 years. Raising two daughters, what I say to them is that everything is healthy and good if you’re eating it at the right time in the right way. I say, “Your body will get bigger and smaller, and that is normal. You never have to worry about what size you are.” And I am loving my body for them. But also, food is just so nice and I don’t want to eat a rubbish version of it. I want la dolce vita.…be a people pleaserMeera Sodha, cook and authorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jay Brooks/The GuardianI don’t like the term “people pleaser”. It sounds like sycophancy, constantly flattering others in a desperateattempt to be liked, but that’s not the case. Being a people pleaser means you tend to put others first and yourself to one side. It might seem easier in the short run to be this way – to always say yes and do everything yourself – but in the long run, the only person it hurts is you.I only found out I was one in later life. The seed was planted after the difficult birth of my daughter Arya in 2017. A therapist asked how things were at home; I said I was finding it really hard: my husband Hugh was doing a fantastic job of keeping the home fires burning, but all I wanted was for him to sit in bed and spend some time with us. “Why don’t you ask him?” the therapist said. This idea of being able to ask for something I wanted or needed, whether a glass of water or a hug, felt totally alien.A few years later, in 2021, I had a breakdown. I remember waking up and having this overriding feeling of not knowing who I was. I went back to therapy, and on exploring my childhood, I realised I was raised in a culture where the collective was more important than the individual. I wasn’t ever encouraged to have an opinion, and I quickly learned it was much better not to stand up for myself. As a result, I found it hard to articulate what I wanted. Sometimes, I didn’t even know.The moment I realised I was a people pleaser, I wanted to quit, but it’s still a daily endeavourNo onechoosesto become a people pleaser. It’s something that occurs as a result of the environment you grow up in. In our family there were a lot of loud voices, and in the wider Indian community, pressure to be a “good girl”, to do what your elders told you to do, and to serve those around you. It is referred to in the TV sketch show Goodness Gracious Me: you are expected to get good grades and live in a certain way, and it all gets played out between the parents, who compete over what their children have achieved. It’s funny, because it’s true.The moment I realised I was a people pleaser I wanted to quit, but it’s still a daily endeavour. Now, I will listen to what other people think, then I have to tune in to how I feel and ask myself what I want and turn the volume up on that. It’s not easy, but I am getting better at it and making sure that I’m not existing in somebody else’s ecosystem.It has definitely changed who I spend time with. I only want to be around people with whom I can be myself and I’ve stepped back from family members and some friends as well, which has been very painful. But quitting people pleasing has been liberating. I feel like there is a before and an after for me. I was living life, largely unconsciously, in service to others. Now, I wake up every day caring much less about what others think. I pursue my own pleasures and feel free enough to express myself – and that is one of life’s greatest feelings.…intermittently fastLouise Hazel,Olympianandfounder of LAgym SlayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Henry R Jones II/Henry JonesSince my retirement from athletics in 2013, when I was 27, my body has changed massively. I was in peak shape, training twice a day, and burning goodness knows how many calories. I had zero understanding of nutrition and the way my body works, but since opening my gym and qualifying as a personal trainer, I have the education and tools I was lacking as an athlete. It is crazy to think I was competing at world-class level with extremely basic nutritional support.I remember a competition in Sheffield one weekend and winning the long jump with 6.27m. The night before, I’d got together with friends for fish and chips. I always wonder: if I’d chosen a healthier option, would I have surpassed the 6.50m barrier? The perception of elite athletes is that we eat healthily all the time, but the reality is we struggle with the same challenges as everyone else: how do I stretch my food budget further? How do I manage to cook when I’m exhausted? If I’d had a protein-forward diet as an athlete, there’s no doubt in my mind I would have performed better.We must detach ourselves from the idea that a lower number on the bathroom scales is best for our healthWhen it comes to my clients, if I am going to guide them with their nutrition, I want to have tested it first. One thing I tried for the first time as a coach was intermittent fasting for two months in 2019. I can honestly say it had the most negative impact on my body and I became “skinny fat”: a slim but soft body. I was not eating until noon. From 6am until 12pm, I trained six clients back to back, and my activity tracker told me I burned 150 calories per client. So by 12pm, that’s 900 calories. Where was that energy coming from if I hadn’t eaten since 7pm the night before? The answer was muscle mass – it was being broken down and used as the primary source of fuel for my work day.I was becoming weaker. I lacked muscle tone and definition and I increased in body fat mass. This is the piece of the puzzle that most people don’t understand about “weight loss”: when you’re exercising but not fuelling, taking weight-loss drugs or overexercising and not eating enough protein, you reduce your muscle mass and become metabolically worse off.We need to get away from this culture of what we weigh being the be-all and end-all. Science has moved on, even if doctors haven’t. I tell the women I train to focus on body composition: a healthy ratio of lean muscle mass and body fat. We must detach ourselves from the idea that a lower number on the bathroom scales is best for our physical, mental and emotional health – it is simply not the case.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Billie J/The Guardian…drink caffeineMichael Rosen, authorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Karen Robinson/The GuardianI don’t think I was addicted to coffee, but I very much enjoyed it. It was part of the routine of my life, and then, in 2020, I just stopped it altogether. Some people are desperate to get off cigarettes, narcotics, or whatever, and they can’t find a way to do it. I don’t have any advice, but I did, as I say, just stop.It is entirely due to the corruption of my lovely wife that I started drinking caffeine in the first place. Before getting together with Emma at the turn of the century, I drank no tea, no coffee. She found this quite curious, and then made beautiful cups of coffee that lured me in. I thought, “This is brilliant. What have I been doing all my life?” On an average day, I might drink two cups of coffee in the morning and one or two cups of tea in the evening.Then in 2020, I was in hospital for 12 weeks with Covid-19. Being in hospital is incredibly disrupting to your sleep, because you can doze off in the middle of the day; if you do that, you can’t sleep all night. Then the cleaners come around at 5.30am, so you might not have got to sleep until 1am and find you’ve only slept four hours, and then you doze off again later. It is a weird cycle where maybe two or three sleeps happen.When I came home, that pattern continued. I was looking online for advice and read that it might help to stop drinking anything with caffeine in it. And so I went full on abstinence from caffeine, whatever that’s called: cee-total? I haven’t drunk a cup of coffee or tea since.Do I feel better for it? It’s a bit complicated to answer that, because there are various other things going on. I have an enlarged prostate, as a lot of blokes do at the age of 70-plus. So that means your sleep might well be disturbed anyway: you’ve had a good night if you sleep more than four or five hours. So what you try to do with advancing years is eliminate things that might make anything worse. That’s the “science” behind it.I have secret chats with elderly gents. When blokes get together, we do what Alan Bennett calls the “organ recital” – asking out of the sides of our mouths, “Have you got a prostate problem?” We quickly get on to the subject of sleep and swap notes: how many hours do you get? When do you stop taking liquids? Do you eat anything last thing at night? I quite often chip in with, “No caffeine!” Some people say they couldn’t possibly stop drinking tea – it is always tea, not coffee. “Can’t you? Oh right,” I reply, and the conversation peters out.I’ve taken to drinking cups of hot water with lemon. The combination of it being good for your voice box and a bit of heat inside you is very vivifying. If I feel tired, instead of a coffee boost I’ll have a nap. At the theatre I rely on being nudged. My offspring and the missus know that at any moment my head might go down, so their elbows are at the ready.… be on X, formerly TwitterLucy Prebble, playwright and screenwriterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: John Phillips/WireImageGiving up means two things. When we “give up”, we can be taking control, wielding our willpower. It is a strong thing, a hopeful thing, a belief in our future and ability to change. Or it can mean a fatigued crumpling, a relinquishing of hope into bleak acceptance. I can’t any more. I give up.X (née Twitter) would love that: a simple, shiny, binary idea. Cleaving the world wittily in two. “Isn’t it wild that giving up means two completely opposite things???!!” Wait for the likes, retweets and petty dissections to roll in. So it was last year I did both. I  “gave up” and gave uponX.It feels embarrassing to eulogise its early days. Elderly millennials lamenting how it used to be “all laughs”. But it did start that way, a free joke machine and a creative notebook, where I playfully scribbled down thoughts and ideas.When Elon Musk bought it, I shivered, but I’d always had him blocked so my user experience didn’t shift much. And aren’t all tech overlords the same, I thought? Since when did people willingly stay using a company they hate? Work for it, even? Since when did I? We all joked about being trapped in the hellsite, while decorating our cells with excellent points.It was a small thing – not to those involved, but to me – that finally changed my mind. The rerouting of a bus I was on in 2024 after a stabbing at Leicester Square. I can track my life through buses. A jumble of people thrown together, some always leaving, some always arriving, only gradually getting where they’re going. I was on one during the 7/7 attacks. I remember the panic as the information spread that day, as we disembarked, as I watched the rolling news back home, what could have been, what was. And then with Covid, after lockdown, there was something so disturbing about getting on a bus and seeing, again and again, even in the height of summer, that no one had opened any windows. I’d walk up and down the aisle, leaning over people, confused, apologetic, reaching for the handle. We know how the virus is transmitted. We know.Inside me, an unpleasant thought began to fester. Without harm being obvious, immediate, or without being forced to, maybe people just don’t … open the windows?So I began to feel panicky on that bus last year, as an announcement was made about an “incident”. Londoners will be familiar with the mixture of sighs and bag-gathering among this random, temporary community as we glanced around, trying to work out how worried to be. I did the habitual thing when a big event seems to be taking place. I looked down to look up. Burrowing for information, I was faced with tweet after tweet about an Islamic terrorist who had stabbed a girl and a woman in Leicester Square. The tweets were all worded the same, repeated and amplified by dozens of different “news” sources (none I recognised) attempting to go viral. I assumed the story must be based in a grabbed tabloid truth, but then tracked down a BBC piece and found not only was the mentally ill assailant not an Islamic terrorist, but the security guard who disarmed the knifeman andsaved the day was Muslim– this fact didn’t just slip by, but was actively repressed.I felt so sick that day. The violence that had happened, the violence that some now suggested should happen. I cancelled my account. But as days went by, I did miss the access, the community, the glaze of being informed. I decided to set up a blank account. That way I could check in on old faves, not seek followers, but still stay at the boiling frog party. I’m not sure why. In case something cool happened? You know, like a frog boiling to death?With no followers and not following anyone, here are the first things I was shown on my new X account: bodycam footage of an older American woman dry heaving on to the pavement after discovering the body parts of a murdered homeless man. Then some football stuff. Then a video simply labelled “human waterfall” – CCTV footage of a balcony collapse in which scores of people must have died. Then some footage of women being hit, framed in a jokey way – the joke being that they weren’t expecting to be slapped. It’s like the darkest You’ve Been Framed! of all time. That’s the default. That’s what it was promoting, knowing nothing about me. I closed that account, too.So I guess I’ve given up. I’ve given myself the illusion of control by rejecting the site designed to give me an illusion of control. Bravo. What a hero. Underneath is a much more profound and destabilising feeling. That, in fact, it’s the opposite of giving up that is required. What’s the opposite of giving up? Taking down? I know it has to be more than finding the perfectly weighted phrase. But if I could, there’s one refrain, one feeling that goes round and round in me through all of this: please, please, let’s open the window.… miss out rather than go aloneAnita Bhagwandas, beauty writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianRecently, I went to two gigs by myself. Just me, a tepid diet cola, and that slightly awkward shuffle through the crowd to find a vantage point where I – a short-ish person – could see the stage. One gig was in a sticky-floored, insanely hot, sold-out O2 Forum in Kentish Town to see grunge legend Jerry Cantrell, where the riffs were heavy and the 90s nostalgia even heavier. The other was a smaller show, to see rockabilly singer JD McPherson, where I got chatting to some vintage-loving lads on a stag do. I left with my ears ringing and my heart full – not because I’d had anyone to share it with, but because I hadn’t missed out.The idea of going to a gig alone would have given me palpitations five years ago. Bizarrely, despite this, I spent the early years of my music journalism career going to festivals and gigs on my own to interview artists and review shows. I hated it and felt deeply awkward, but at least I had a job: I was there to work and relay the experience back to an audience. My aloneness had a purpose; I’d scribble notes down in a pad or my Notes app, which gave me a sort of armour.But tochooseto go to a gig alone feels very different. I spent years missing out on artists I wanted to see because I felt there was something faintly tragic about going alone. In 2015, after trying (and failing) to persuade anyone to come with me, I booked a solo ticket to see Scott Weiland in London. But at the last minute, I lost my nerve and didn’t go. A few months later, Scott died – and I’ve regretted missing that chance ever since.I’ve spent far too long turning down things I really wanted to do, waiting for someone else to validate the planI had the same self-consciousness about booking solo travel. There were so many hurdles to overcome: finding a mate or partner who wanted to go where you did (and feeling responsible for their enjoyment if it wasn’t their first choice); managing to get leave at the same time; having the same budgets and expectations. I’d never considered booking a holiday solo; it felt like a plan gone wrong – a sign you hadn’t managed to find someone to share it with. A loser with a capital L.But in the last few years, I’ve realised something much more freeing: life is too short to wait around for company. And rather than sad, or lonely, going it alone is brave and dynamic, qualities that are top-notch in a human. I’ve spent too long turning down things I wanted to do, waiting for someone else to validate the plan. Like many people in their 30s and 40s, I’m surrounded by friends whose time is dictated by the rhythm and costs of family life. It means the spontaneous weekends away, the big girls’ trips, the sweaty nights in a crowd, or even the kind of niche trip I like to take (beauty history tours of old apothecaries, a visit to a skull-laden crypt) don’t slot easily into other people’s agendas. And for years, I let that stop me entirely.But something shifted. Maybe it was a post-lockdown perspective. Maybe I just got tired of looking longingly at Ticketmaster before closing the tab. Whatever it was, I’vefinallystopped waiting. I’ve done a fair few solo trips now: Venice, New York, Bangkok, St Lucia. I’ve eaten alone in restaurants (take a book), wandered through museums (no shame in spending most of your time in the gift shop) and taken myself for long walks with no pressure to make conversation. I’d still rather be with pals or partners, of course. And I definitely get a little bit lonely – but if the choice is going alone or not going at all? I’m choosing me.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingBody imageFitnessHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three “sides” will emerge, he claims: a Muslim population barricaded into urban enclaves, a white British one that regards government as illegitimate and “captured” by elites, and the increasingly beleaguered vestiges of the state.Betz, a softly spoken Canadian,speculates that as many as 23,000 deathsa year can be expected. He admits to feeling uneasy about suddenly becoming a public figure, and struggling to keep up with what he describes as the “torrent of interest” from the public, thinktanks and journalists at home and abroad.“What was once whispered on the margins is now increasingly discussed,” he wrote with Prof MLR Smith inone of two articles for Military Strategy Magazine, a peer-reviewed journal.He also draws on the writings of an anonymous online writer known asEl Inglés, who has sketched out a UK civil war scenario involving the “crescent, crown and pitchfork” on the Gates of Vienna blog,a far-right website described as a training manualfor anti-Muslim paramilitaries. Such works are dismissed as tainted by association with the “far right” and ignored by academia, argue Betz and Smith, “rather than treated as they should be in scholarly terms as gateways” into the thinking of a plurality of western Europeans.Ethnic cleansing would become a reality in Britain’s coming war, Betz claims. He describes himself as a “civic nationalist” who believes in shared identities based on values, but he says that it is not safe to assume those values would withstand the stress of a conflict. “It’s not going to be durable once people get to the situation where they are kidnapping each others’ children and drilling their kneecaps out,” he said.Wildly fantastical as this scenario may seen, there is a meaningful minority in the UK that relates to it. As many as 33% of British adults polled byYouGov last yearbelieved a civil war would occur in the next decade.Others weighing in include Boris Johnson’s former chief aide, Dominic Cummings, who has claimed intelligence services are already discussing the risk for “racial/ethnic/mob/gang violence”.The issue is now on the edge of the mainstream political agenda, to the extent that Keir Starmer felt compelled in September to reject those who he accused of prompting ideas of “a coming struggle, a defining struggle for the nation”. It was part of a strategy to force a choice between “globalists and nationalists” by portraying places like London as a “wasteland”.Suggestions that a war is coming get short shrift from experts such as Prof Dominic Abrams, an adviser on social cohesion for government and public bodies, who argues UK is well set up to absorb conflicts, citing the NHS, universities, trade unions and other entities.“It’s not a stretch to state that there will be increasing levels of conflicts over different issues among different people,” he said. “But I think it’s stretch that we would be moving towards a civil war, because it it fails to recognise the constant adaptation operating both at national level and among local communities.”Jitters beyond rightwing silos are evident, but usually stop short of the idea of a sectarian conflict killing thousands. Betz’s arguments have attracted interest in “Blue Labour” – the party’s socially conservative wing – and eyebrows were raised in May when the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said she was so worried about public disaffection that she believed the north of England“could go up in flames”.A thinktank report published in Julydescribed the UK as a “powder keg”of social tensions, with a third of people rarely meeting anyone from different backgrounds. The research by British Future and the social cohesion group Belong Network found that a year on from last summer’s riots, there was a risk of unrest being reignited without urgent action to address polarisation.Explore more on these topicsSocial trendsSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Nothing – not even this will defeat you my friend.”At the time of the accident,Lilly shared photos of her bloodied face post-injuryand described what had happened on Substack. “I pull my face from the sand and take a breath. My mouth and nose are full of blood,” she wrote. “My partner says that when I black out, I look like I die. He gets very afraid. My eyes roll back in my head and all life leaves my body.”She explained how she had experienced fainting spells since she was a child, with doctors initially believing it was due to hypoglycemia, which was later ruled out.“I have come to believe that this ‘checking out’ is a result of my little soul reaching her limit of what she feels she can cope with in this life, and she ‘leaves the building,’ so to speak,” she wrote.But she also shared her gratitude, writing: “It might seem crazy looking at my face and my busted tooth, but I feel so grateful that I blacked out. I needed the reset.”Lilly has been on hiatus from acting for three years, with her last role being superhero Hope van Dyne, or the Wasp, in the 2023 Marvel film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania. She told Varietyin a statement in Junethat she was “not actively pursuing any work in the industry” and was now “devoting my time to my humanitarian work and my writing.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMarvelCanadaLostAmericasTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

She added: “We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something, and that we’re following the law.”Four months ago, Noem terminated the 2021 Biden-era designation of TPS for Venezuela, affecting over 250,000 Venezuelans living in the US, after determining it is “contrary to the US national interest”. Those covered joined around350,000Venezuelans stripped of temporary protected status under a previous order.Protests erupt in US cities over Trump’s military intervention in VenezuelaRead moreFlorida is home to over half of Venezuelan TPS holders in the US who have seen their legal status and work permits revoked under theTrump administration, with many there now in legal battles to remain in the US.On Saturday, Elaine Higgins, the Democratic mayor of Miami, called on theTrump administrationto restore TPS status to Venezuelan immigrants in the US saying the revocation “was reckless, dangerous, and wrong”.“The instability unfolding in Venezuela today makes it even clearer that the country remains unsafe for people to return. No one should be forced back into chaos and uncertainty,” Higgins added.Under the order stripping Venezuela of TPS status, aDHS spokesperson has saidthat Venezuela’s “substantial role in driving irregular migration” to the US had “directly” undermined the Trump administration’s immigration policies.Noem said that Donald Trump’s message to Venezuela’sDelcy Rodriguez, named interim president by authorities followingNicolás Maduro’scaptureby the US on Saturday, were “very matter-of-fact and very clear: you can lead or you can get out of the way, because we’re not going to allow you to continue to subvert American influence and our need to have a free country like Venezuela to work with rather than to have dictators in place who perpetuate crimes and drug trafficking.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVenezuelaKristi NoemUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Whenever the United States attacks another country like this, it’s the peoples of those countries who suffer the most,” Andy Thayer of theChicagoCommittee Against War and Racism said to a local ABC affiliate at a protest that drew several hundred.Others argued that Donald Trump did not have authority to launch such a strike on Venezuela, at least without approval from Congress. Senior Democrats on Sundaydecried theUS president’s bypassing his constitutional obligation to involve the congressional branch of government, as international leaders said the UShad breachedthe United Nations charter.At a protest in Seattle organized by a group called Answer (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), crowds held signs with statements such as “No Blood for Oil” and “Stop BombingVenezuelaNow!”View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs demanding the release of the Venezuelan leader outside the MDC Brooklyn federal prison, where Nicolás Maduro is being held, on Sunday.Photograph: Deccio Serrano/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“We’re out here to show solidarity with a country whose sovereignty and self determination has been violated by our government using our tax dollars,” Taylor Young, an organizer with Answer, which staged protests in several other cities, too, told a Fox News affiliate.“So the very least we can do is come out in Seattle and across the country to say we won’t allow you to do this while we just stand by,” Young added.Republican lawmakers broadly continued to support Trump and praised his actions even as senior figureswalked backthe president’s assertions on Saturday that the US “will run” Venezuela during a transition to a new regime.Congressman Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota, said Sunday morning on Fox News: “God bless this president of peace, Donald J Trump.”View image in fullscreenProtesters in Chicago gathered at the Dirksen Federal Building Plaza on Saturday to condemn US military airstrikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBut protesters also spoke out against the deportations of Venezuelans living in the country. “We’re creating wars, we’re creating chaos and then simultaneously abducting our neighbors and sending them back to the very countries that we’re destabilizing,” Olivia DiNucci, an anti-war organizer with activist group Code Pink, told WHYY, a public radio station inPhiladelphia.Despite bipartisan condemnation of Maduro as a dictator, some activists also called for his release.Protesters gathered outside the detention center in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, where the captured president is being held and chanted: “Free Maduro right now.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasUS politicsNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday he warned Rodríguezto heed US wishes. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” hetold the Atlantic.Rodríguez, 56, had on Saturday pledged fealty to Maduro and condemned his capture as an “atrocity” but the New York Times reported that Trump officials several weeks ago identified the technocrat as a potential successor and business partner partly on the basis of her relationship with Wall Street and oil companies.View image in fullscreenA TV and telephone tower destroyed in the US raid on Caracas on Saturday.Photograph: Maxwell Briceno/ReutersThe US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, spoke to Rodríguez, who told him “‘we’ll do whatever you need’”, Trump told reporters. “She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn’t have a choice.”Months in planning, over in two and a half hours: how the US snatched MaduroRead moreIn the capital, Caracas, senior government and military figures demanded the return of Maduro but pledged support for Rodríguezas a stand-in leader and called for a return to normality.“I call on the people ofVenezuelato resume their activities of all kinds, economic, work and education, in the coming days,” Vladimir Padrino López, the defence minister, said in a televised address.Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, said his father’s supporters are more resolved than ever to support the ousted president, according to an audio shared on social media.“They will not see us weak,” Maduro Guerra said. “The president, Nicolás Maduro, will return. He will return. It’s been a day of shock, of course, we’re all in shock.“But we will take to the streets, we will convene the people, we will unite, we will form a nucleus around our highest political-military command with maximum unity.”Venezuelan opposition figure Edmundo González Urrutia said Maduro’s ousting was “an important step, but not enough” to return the crisis-hit nation to normal.“This moment represents an important step, but it is not enough,” he said in a post on Instagram from exile in Spain.Trump said the US may intervene in other countries. “We do need Greenland, absolutely.” Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, posted a social media picture of Greenland painted in the colours of the US flag, and the word “soon”, prompting a protest from Greenland’s prime minister.In around of TV interviewsRubio downplayed the possibility of invasion or occupation of Venezuela. “There’s not a war. I mean, we are at war against drug trafficking organisations, not a war against Venezuela. We don’t have US forces on the ground,” he told NBC.Troops were in Caracas for two hours in a “law enforcement function” that did not require congressional approval, he said. “This was not an invasion. This was not an extended military operation.”The US will keep a “quarantine” around Venezuela to block the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions to sustain “leverage” over Maduro’s successor, said Rubio. “We are going to make our assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly.”The US had “multiple levers of influence” to respond if Venezuela’s leaders did not make the “right” decisions, said Rubio. He said the Cuban government – Venezuela’s main ally – was a “huge problem” and in a “lot of trouble” but declined to elaborate.Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, also rowed back on Trump’s vow to run Venezuela, saying there were “still a lot of questions to be answered” about what happens next.Trump’s attack on Venezuela without alerting Congress tests limits of executive powerRead moreThe governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay said in a joint statement that US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”. Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the attack but refused to condemn it.AllEU countries except Hungary issued a statementcalling for restraint by “all actors” and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in order to “restore democracy”.In Caracas some shops and cafes reopened in a semblance of normality while authorities counted the cost of Saturday’s raid.Large queues formed outside stores in Venezuela’s capital as anxious residents stocked up on basic supplies, apprehensive about what the future might bring and the possibility – suggested by Trump – that there could be a “second wave” of attacks.“It’s the same everywhere, there are queues in the supermarkets, there are queues in the bakeries, queues at the pharmacy,” said one 71-year-old pensioner who was one of 20 people lined up outside a small family grocery market in north-east Caracas on Sunday morning.“There’s so much uncertainty because people don’t know what might happen in the coming days and nobody wants to see another situation like the early hours of Saturday or to be caught with their pants down and an empty fridge,” added the man, who asked not to be named.His 68-year-old wife, who also declined to give her name, fought back tears as she pondered Venezuela’s latest crisis. “I just hope things return to normal. That there can be dialogue. That we can have peaceful lives. That there is no big disaster and that nobody dies,” she said.Outside one of Venezuela’s largest supermarket chains in Petare, on the east side of Caracas, a young couple waited in a 100-person-long line outside a supermarket in order to stock up on milk, butter and flour. So many people had flocked there that supermarket workers were letting in shoppers in groups.“[I feel] angry,” said the 23-year-old woman, who gave only her first name, Sauriany. “They don’t have the right to meddle like this in another country and to do whatever they like,” she said of the US raid.Her 24-year-old partner, a lineworker called Leandro, said the streets near their house were deserted as parents kept their children at home for fear of what might happen over the coming days. “There are so many rumours – that they [the Americans] might return … It was terrible on Saturday. All those explosions. The planes,” he said.In neighbouring Colombia there was deep unease too, with its president, Gustavo Petro, ordering 30,000 troops to its eastern border with Venezuela in case there was violence or a sudden influx of refugees.Padrino López said “a large part” of Maduro’s security team, as well as soldiers and civilians, died. One unverified report estimated the number killed at 40. The minister said the armed forces will resist “imperial aggression” and ensure independence and sovereignty despite the “cowardly kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.The White House shared footage of the deposed dictator handcuffed and doing a “perp walk” to Drug Enforcement Administration offices in New York before being taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro at the offices of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York on Saturday.Photograph: @RapidResponse47/ReutersAuthorities unsealed a four-count indictment that charges Maduro with narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. It also charges Flores, their son and two Venezuelan officials and an alleged leader of Tren de Aragua, a gang the Trump administration has designed a terrorist organisation. Maduro is due to appear in a Manhattan federal court on Monday for arraignment.The prosecution will deepen the humiliation felt by Maduro loyalists and complicate the balancing act faced by his successor.Rodríguez, who served as vice-president and oil minister until her boss’s removal, must juggle Washington’s demands for oil and security guarantees with a regime that retains vestiges of the socialism and anti-imperialism of its late founder, Hugo Chávez.The powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, pledged loyalty to Maduro but tacitly backed the interim president. “Here, the unity of the revolutionary force is more than guaranteed,” he said in an audio clip released by the ruling PSUV party.The Trump administration’s apparent satisfaction with regime tweak, rather than regime change, has dismayed those Venezuelans who hoped Maduro’s downfall would usher in democracy.‘It’s an opportunity’: joy and wariness among US Venezuelans after Maduro toppledRead moreTrump was dismissive about the opposition leaderMaria Corina Machado, the Nobel peace prize winner who mobilisedEdmundo González’s winning presidential campaign last year, and said she lacked “support” in Venezuela.

They said the missiles flew about 560 miles (900km) and that South Korea and US authorities were analysing details of the launches.The joint chiefs of staff said South Korea maintained a readiness to repel any provocations by North Korea and was closely exchanging information with the US and Japan on the North’s missile launches.Kim Jong-un hails North Korea’s ‘invincible alliance’ with Russia in New Year’s messageRead moreThe missiles “flew approximately 900 kilometres”, the military said, adding that South Korea and the US were “closely analysing the specifications” while “maintaining a full readiness posture”.The national security council in Seoul convened an emergency meeting after the launch, which a presidential office statement said “constitutes a provocative act in violation of UN security council resolutions”.Japan’s defence ministry also said it had detected a possible ballistic missile, noting that two missiles reached an altitude of 50,000 metres and flew distances of 560 miles and 590 miles respectively.“North Korea’s nuclear and missile development threatens the peace and stability of our country and the international society, and is absolutely intolerable,” Japan’s defence minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, told reporters.View image in fullscreenNews of the missile launch on a screen at station in Seoul in South Korea on Sunday.Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPAIt is Pyongyang’s first ballistic missile launch since November, when it staged a test after the US president, Donald Trump, approved South Korea’s plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.One analyst saidTrump’s military operation against Venezuelaon Saturday probably played a role in the decision to launch.Pyongyang has for decades argued it needs its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against alleged regime change efforts by Washington. The US has offered Pyongyang repeated assurances that it has no such plans.Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said: “They likely fear that if the United States so chooses, it could launch a precision strike at any moment, threatening the regime’s survival.”The test came just hours before the South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, was due to depart for Beijing for talks with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, whose government is a key economic backer of North Korea.Lee hopes to harness China’s clout over North Korea to support his attempt to improve ties with Pyongyang.Pyongyang is to hold a landmark congress of its ruling party in the coming weeks, its first in five years.Economic policy, as well as defence and military planning, are likely to be high on the agenda.Before that meeting, the country’s leader Kim Jong-un ordered the “expansion” and modernisation of the country’s missile production and the construction of more factories to meet growing demand.State media reported on Sunday that Kim had visited a facility involved in making tactical guided weapons.He ordered them to expand current production capacity by 250%, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It can prevent protests and marches from being “authorised” by police or the courts, which can result in prosecution for protesters who obstruct people or traffic in a public place if their protest has not been formally authorised.Donald Trump warns of ‘big price to pay’ if Caracas fails to toe lineRead moreSunday’s protest was one of many in Australian cities to condemn US actions in Venezuela, after news that US forces hadforcibly removedVenezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, and claims made by US president Donald Trump that the US would seize direct control of the country and itsoil reserves.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailInSydney, protesters waved placards that read “Hands off Venezuela” and “Down with imperialism”.There was also a small group of supporters of Venezuela’s opposition who celebrated the US intervention draped in red, blue and yellow, and brandished photos of Maduro released by the US administration with the word “captured” superimposed across his image.NSW police said they attended an “unauthorised protest” at around 6pm on Sunday evening in George Street, Sydney, where 250 people were protesting, alongside about 40 counter-protesters.A 53-year-old woman was arrested for wearing a shirt “displaying offensive messaging”, police alleged.Two men, one aged 26 and one aged 34, were arrested for alleged breach of the peace.All three were taken to Day Street police station and released at the conclusion of the protest, police said. No charges have been laid.Rightwing agitator Drew Pavlou claimed on social media he was one of the men arrested, circulating footage that showed him chanting pro-US slogans amid the protesters before being frogmarched away by a large group of police.InMelbourne, about 200 people packed the steps of Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, yelling “shame” when speakers said the Venezuelan president had been “kidnapped”.They brandished banners that read “Release Maduro now! No regime change!” and “No war for oil! Solidarity with the people of Venezuela”.One speaker said Maduro had been “demonised” and rubbished claims he rigged elections and was connected to drug trafficking.“It is the clearest-cut case of outright propaganda, and its main role is to soften ordinary people to the idea of regime change in Venezuela,” he told the crowd.The anti-US protesters said they supported Venezuelans who stood for their sovereignty, and demanded the Australian government cut ties and sanction the US administration.Victoria police said there were no reported incidents at the event.Australia is home to more than 6,600 Venezuelan-born residents, with about 10,000 people of Venezuelan ancestry, according to the 2021 census.The Venezuelan Association of Australia said there would be complex emotions within the diaspora, given many had experienced forced separation from loved ones, exile and the long-term impacts of authoritarian rule.“In moments like this, our shared hope remains for a free, democratic and united Venezuela where people can live with dignity, safety and opportunity,” the association said.Prime minister Anthony Albanese has urged all parties tosupport dialogue and diplomacyto prevent escalation as his government monitors the situation.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingProtestVenezuelaSydneyMelbournenewsShareReuse this content"

There is still some treatment and monitoring to go but it’s looking positive,” Gilchrist said.“His wife Amanda just really wants to say to everyone she is convinced that the love, goodwill and sense of care that they felt from everybody, via messages and via the coverage in the press really helped him,” he said. “They just feel blessed so many people have wanted to support him in his time [of] need.“He will remain in hospital and continue to receive treatment but the turnaround has been miraculous.’’Born in Darwin, Martyn earned a Test debut at 21, replacing Dean Jones in the 1992/93 home series against West Indies and was Western Australia’s captain at 23.He played 208 ODIs, averaging 40.8 and scoring an unbeaten 88 runs as Australia defeated India in the final of the 2003 World Cup.Martyn retired from Test cricket midway through the 2006/07 Ashes series, playing his final match at the Adelaide Oval that summer. He dabbled in commentary during retirement but has mostly kept out of the limelight in recent years.Explore more on these topicsSportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom.”The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, has renewed fears of an American takeover of Greenland, as members of Trump’s Maga movement gleefully set their sights on the Danish territory after the attack in South America.Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday hours after Frederiksen’s remarks, Trump doubled down on his claim that Greenland should become part of the United States.“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, andDenmarkis not going to be able to do it,” Trump told reporters said when asked about the issue.Hours after theUS military operation in Venezuela, the rightwing podcasterKatie Miller– the wife of Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s powerful deputy chief of staff for policy –posted on Xa map of Greenland draped in the stars and stripes with the caption: “SOON.”Miller’s threat to annex the mineral-rich territory, which is part of the Nato alliance, drew outrage from Denmark and Greenland.Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called the post “disrespectful”. “Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights,” he wrote on X.But he also said: “There is neither reason for panic nor for concern. Our country is not for sale, and our future is not decided by social media posts.”Copenhagen’s ambassador to the US, Jesper Møller Sørensen, reposted Miller’s provocation with a “friendly reminder” of the longstanding defence ties between the two countries.“We are close allies and should continue to work together as such. US security is also Greenland’s and Denmark’s security,” he said. “The Kingdom of Denmark and the United States work together to ensure security in the Arctic.”He said Denmark had increased defence spending in 2025, committing $13.7bn (£10.2bn) “that can be used in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Because we take our joint security seriously.”He added: “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”Trump recently named Jeff Landry, the governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland. Landry, a former state attorney general, thanked Trump for his appointment in December, saying it was “an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US”.On Saturday, Landry welcomed Trump’s toppling of Maduro by force. “Having served as a sheriff’s deputy and AG, I have seen the devastating effects of illegal drugs on American families. With over 100k opioid-related deaths annually, I am grateful to see a President finally take real action in the war on drugs,” he posted on X.“Thank you @realDonaldTrump for holding individuals like Maduro accountable.”Since taking office a year ago, Trump has rattled European allies with his stated designs on Greenland, which is seen as strategically important for defence and as a future source of mineral wealth. It is home to the US’smost northerly military base, at Pituffik, which Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance,visited in March.The US president hasrefused to rule out military actionto gain control of the territory at a time when the US, China and Russia are jockeying for power in the Arctic, a prospect that has triggered widespread condemnation and disquiet on the island itself.“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly,” Trump told the US broadcaster NBC in May when asked about a potential takeover by force.“Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”You cannot annex other countries, Danish and Greenlandic leaders tell TrumpRead moreIn response to a constant drumbeat of threats against the territory, the Danish defence intelligence service last monthlabelled the US a security riskin a dramatic change in transatlantic relations.The prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Mette Frederiksen and Nielsen,said at the time: “We have said it very clearly before. Now we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law … You cannot annex other countries.”The vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US,according to a poll in January. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.Jennifer Kavanagh, the director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a thinktank that advocates restraint inUS foreign policy, said she had long dismissed Trump’s sabre-rattling toward Greenland.“Now I’m not so sure,” she said. “It wouldn’t be that hard for the US to put a couple hundred or a couple thousand troops inside of Greenland, and it’s not clear to me who could do anything about it.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkUS foreign policyTrump administrationRepublicansEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She was initially reported as missing.Her family said in a social media post on Sunday: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.”The post said her funeral is expected to take place in Paris later this week.According to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.The last 16 victims included two Swiss girls aged 15, a Swiss woman aged 22, a Swiss and French woman aged 24, two Italian girls aged 16 and 15, an Italian boy aged 16, a 22-year-old Portuguese woman, a 17-year-old Belgian girl, two French women aged 33 and 26, two French men aged 23 and 20, two French teenage boys aged 17 and 14, and a 15-year-old girl with French, British, and Israeli nationalities, police said.Those previously identified were 10 Swiss nationals, two Italians, one person with Italian-Emirati citizenship, one Romanian, one person from France and one from Turkey, Valais police said.The mother of Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss boy, confirmed that he was among those killed. “Our Arthur has departed to party in heaven,” Laetitia Brodard-Sitre said on her Facebook page. “Now we can start our mourning, knowing he is in peace.”Hundreds of people joined a silent procession through the upmarket resort town on Sunday to honour the victims of the catastrophe.After a service at the Chapelle St-Christophe, the sombre crowd filed silently out of the chapel to organ music. Some exchanged hugs and others applauded before joining the silent march up the hill to Le Constellation bar.View image in fullscreenMourners marched in silence from the chapel to the makeshift memorial.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAPeople in the dense procession walked in bright sunshine past shuttered stores. A stream of mourners and well-wishers deposited bouquets at a makeshift memorial piled with flowers, cuddly toys and other tributes.Applause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police and emergency services workers came up through the middle of the procession to be celebrated as heroes.“Through this tragic event, I believe we must all remember that we are all brothers and sisters in humanity,” said Véronique Barras, a local resident who knows grieving families. “It’s important to support each other, to hug each other and to move forward towards light.”In the crowd, Paola Ponti Greppi, an 80-year-old Italian who has a home in Crans-Montana, called for better safety checks in bars. “We need more safety in these places because it’s not the only place like this. Why didn’t the town do the proper checks? For me that’s terrible,” she said.During the hour-long mass, the bishop Jean-Marie Lovey said condolences had poured in from around the world, including from the pope.“Countless people join us – people whose hearts are broken,” Lovey told the congregation. “Many expressions of sympathy and solidarity reach us.“Pope Leo XIV joins in our sorrow. In a moving message, he expresses his compassion and his care for the victims’ families and strengthens the courage of all who are suffering.”View image in fullscreenPeople attend a memorial mass at the Chapelle St-Christophe.Photograph: Baz Ratner/APThe Rev Gilles Cavin spoke of the “terrible uncertainty” for families unsure if their loved ones were among the dead or still alive among the injured.“There are no words strong enough to express the dismay, anguish and anger of those who are affected in their lives today. And yet we are here, gathered, because silence alone is not enough,” he said.‘It has hit us very hard’: grief grips Crans-Montana as police identify more victimsRead moreSwitzerland will hold a national day of mourning on Friday, with church bells ringing across the country and a minute’s silence planned.“In this moment of reflection, everyone in Switzerland can personally remember the victims of the disaster,” the Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, told the Sonntagsblick newspaper.Investigators believe the fire started when sparkling candles wereheld too close to the ceilingof the venue’s basement level, the region’s chief prosecutor has said.Two people who ran the bar areunder criminal investigationon suspicion of offences including homicide by negligence, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, prosecutors said on Saturday. The announcement did not name the managers.Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.There were 119 people injured, including many with disfiguring wounds, and several were transferred toburns units in hospitals across Europeto assist Switzerland’s overwhelmed clinics.Authorities said the severity of the victims’ burns had required the use of DNA samples and dental records to help identify the bodies.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The tech corporations are in the hands of men with power which we give them,” the group said. “One day we will simply sit before bright screens or dead machines while dying ourselves of thirst and hunger.”View image in fullscreenCars and pedestrians pass a square where lighting has been set up using a power generator in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf district of Berlin.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersThe group said it wished to apologise to the less well-off who had been affected by the power cut, but said its sympathy was limited “for the many villa owners” now in the dark.The area affected by the power cut includes many elderly care homes and hospitals as well as high-rise buildings with residents who are reliant on elevators that are now out of order. Berlin received moderate snowfall at the weekend and night-time temperatures plunged well below freezing.Berlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, said he was convinced the mass blackout had a political motive, while security experts said it bore thehallmarks of previous far-left attacks.“It is unacceptable that leftwing extremists are once again openly attacking our electricity grid and thereby endangering human lives,” Wegner told reporters during a visit to an emergency shelter for those without heat and hot water.With mobile networks down, police used loudspeakers attached to their vehicles to inform the public as they assisted people in need of care. Several regional commuter lines were interrupted and many pupils who were to return to school on Monday may see their holiday extended well into the week.A previous arson attack attributed to the far left in September knocked out electricity for 60 hours in the south-east of the city in what was reportedly Berlin’slongest power cut since the second world war.Preliminary theories for the weekend power outage had included possible Russian sabotage, asGermanyhas been on high alert for attacks on its infrastructure from foreign actors.In March 2024, Vulkangruppeclaimed an arson attack against a pylon at the Tesla gigafactoryoutside Berlin that cut off electricity to the plant and temporarily halted production.In its 2024 annual security report, Germany’s domestic intelligence watchdog cited repeated attacks on the regional power grid by Vulkangruppe, which it classes as a leftwing extremist organisation.It said the group, believed to be about 14 years old, chose targets for their “palpable effects on the population”, intending to cause destruction requiring painstaking and lengthy repairs with little concern for collateral damage.Stromnetz Berlin said that initially 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses in the districts of Nikolassee, Zehlendorf, Wannsee and Lichterfelde had been affected by the power cut that began at about 6am on Saturday.By midday on Sunday, the company said on its crisis page on its website that about 10,000 households and 300 businesses in Lichterfelde had had their electricity restored.But cold weather was hindering efforts to lay new underground cables, meaning the remaining households may have to wait until Thursday afternoon to get their light and heat back on.“Our teams are on the ground and we are working flat out to restore supplies,” Stromnetz Berlin said.Experts said attacks on energy infrastructure required little specialist knowledge to have a dramatic impact, with maps featuring key components of the power grid widely available online and few contingency plans ready to be enacted in case of sabotage.Explore more on these topicsGermanyProtestEnvironmental activismAI (artificial intelligence)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Negotiations over the new food and drink (SPS) agreement announced in May, as well as a youth mobility programme, are continuing but with several significant points of dispute.Any further alignment with the EU is likely to come with a further Brussels demand for relaxation of migration restrictions. Starmer said there would be no return to full freedom of movement rights as part of any future negotiations, but defended the deal for ayouth mobility scheme.“We are looking at a youth mobility scheme which will be for young people to travel, to work, to enjoy themselves in different European countries, to have that experience.”The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, called the remarks a “Brexit betrayal” and said Starmer was “surrendering our freedom to cut regulation and strike our own trade deals”.The leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, said Starmer’s comments were “a breach of good faith with Labour voters” and criticised the co-operation with the EU on energy markets that is being explored, saying it would tie the UK to “crazy EU net zero policies and carbon taxes”.The battle over closer ties with Europe is likely to be a key dividing line that Labour seeks to draw with Reform. A Labour source said: “Nigel Farage’s biggest weakness is his militant opposition to any relationship with Europe. Couple that with anything to do with clean energy and you can see how he has wound himself up today.“But it comes from something much more sinister, too. He doesn’t want British businesses to find things easier. He doesn’t want bills to come down. If Britain struggles, that fuels his politics of division.”Starmer has given hints in recent months he would like to revisit strengthening ties with the EU. In November, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister in charge of EU negotiations, was promoted to full cabinet rank.Minouche Shafik, the prime minister’s economic adviser, is among those close to Starmer who have suggested internally that returning to the customs union could be one of the most effective ways of generating growth.But Starmer himself has been more reticent, having signed numerous international trade deals while in office including with India and an economic agreement with the US, which he has been able to tout as some of his successes.Backbench pressure has been growing within the Labour party, with 13 of its MPs backing a Liberal Democrat proposal to join a customs union in a Commons vote last month.The intervention from Streeting in anObserver interviewlate last year that a customs union would bring “enormous economic benefits” was widely seen as a challenge to Starmer amid speculation over the prime minister’s future.In hisinterviewwith the BBC, Starmer warned his internal rivals they would be opening the door to a government led by Nigel Farage if they recreated the “chaos” of the Tory leadership battles.“What I don’t think will help us is if a Labour government turns back to the chaos of the last Tory government. That would gift Nigel Farage,” he said.He said he believed Labour could still win the next election – and said he would be judged at that moment: “I was elected on a five-year mandate to change this country. I intend to deliver on that mandate. I will be judged at the next general election on whether we have brought about the change that people voted for.”Starmer said the next election would be “unlike any election we’ve seen in this country for a very, very long time”.“Because my strong view is it’ll be a Labour government up against a very rightwing proposition in Reform,” he said. “And that Reform proposition will be a proposition of toxic divide of this country. The next election is going to be about a question of, what is it to be British? And I believe to be British is to be compassionate, reasonable, live and let live, and diverse.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyKeir StarmerBrexitEuropean UnionForeign policyLabourEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now another prime ministerial pet is proving a social media hit in Belgium.Maximus Textoris Pulcher wasannounced in Augustas an official resident at the Belgian prime minister’s office, Rue de la Loi 16 in central Brussels.The grey rescue cat is now thought to have the second most popular political account on Belgian social media, with more than142,000 followers on Instagram– second only to his master, Bart De Wever, whobecame Belgium’s prime ministerin February.The cat’s full name is a mock-grandiose title rooted in the prime minister’s love of Latin and Roman history, conveying the meaning “De Wever’s beautiful Maximus” (textorisbeing “of the weaver”, or De Wever).De Wever adopted the cat, an abandonedScottish fold, from a refuge. “I have a cat in my office, it is grey and it does not catch … mice, but I love it anyway,” he told journalists during a recent press conference.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

In another post when De Wever’s eclectic five-party coalition was locked in budget talks, a grumpy-looking Maximus lies on the floor with a thought bubble reading: “Even on Sunday, these nuisances [cabinet ministers] are here.”A source close to De Wever – described as “a cat person all his life” – said the account was a low-effort part of his team’s work and offered the public a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Rue de la Loi 16.View image in fullscreen‘Even on Sunday, these nuisances [cabinet ministers] are here.’Photograph: InstagramProf Dave Sinardet, a political scientist at the Free University of Brussels, said the account fell in the long tradition of politicians being portrayed with animals to show an appealing side.This was especially true, he said, for De Wever, “who is perceived as quite competent, as a strong debater, as someone with clear ideas, but maybe as a less warm person … It can help to reinforce his warmer side.”The Maximus account had “a subliminal political message”, Sinardet said, citing the frequent posts of the prime minister reading papers at night next to his cat. “Very often you see Bart De Wever as a hard worker, he is doing his best, he is working on Saturday night.”De Wever, the first Flemish nationalist prime minister of Belgium, is known for his dry humour and has long used social media to share curated images of a seemingly unpretentious everyday life. Hisown Instagram accountshows him taking a tram and ironing a shirt in a Copenhagen hotelbefore an EU summit.The account “also creates a positive vibe” for people who find politics boring or conflictual, although Maximus played into that, said Sinardet. In one picture, showing Maximus outside the window of a cabinet meeting, the speech bubble reads: “And they complain about my mewling.”And while the running gag is that Maximus is the real boss, the cat may ventriloquise De Wever’s own thoughts. “Congratulations, you are a hero,” Maximus tells De Wever, the day aftera hard-fought EU summit. While the joke is that the cat is buttering up his master for more attention, it also suggests De Wever saved the day.View image in fullscreen‘Congratulations, you are a hero!’ Maximus tells De Wever.Photograph: InstagramBut politicians who complained about Maximus’s posts did not usually win public sympathy, Sinardet suggested. “That only reinforces De Wever because they come over as sour people … when, this is, supposedly just a funny, positive cute cat account.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaBelgiumCatsInstagramEuropePetsnewsShareReuse this content"

Many of the new arrivals are vulnerable and arrive in the UK traumatised.Under new powers, officers will be entitled to make arrivals remove an outer coat, jacket or gloves at UK ports to search for devices. They will also be able to conduct searches inside someone’s mouth for a hidden sim card or small electronic device.Home Office sources have previously told the Guardian that, if deemed clearly necessary and proportionate, children could also be subjected to these searches.Officials say the mobile phone searches will enable them to collect intelligence on asylum seekers’ journeys and to arrest people-smugglers. The powers come after the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.Alex Norris, the borders minister, said: “We are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.”On Sunday, the prime minister said that the UK will start to see “evidence” of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.Starmer told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”The Guardian has disclosed that the Home Office plans to send the first group of asylum seekers toa military site in East Sussexwithin weeks.A total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK in 2025 after crossing the Channel – the second highest annual figure on record.The yearly total was 13% higher than the figure for 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023’s total of 29,437. It was 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.Opinion polls put Reform significantly ahead of Labour, with a More in Common poll suggesting the party would win 381 seats.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

May her memory be a blessing to us all.“Charles R.”Schloss grew up under the name Eva Geiringer in Vienna with her parents and brother.She later lived at Merwedeplein Square in Amsterdam where she met fellow teenager Anne Frank.As the situation in the Netherlands worsened, Schloss and her family moved from house to house for two years to evade capture but they were eventually betrayed by a Nazi sympathiser, who took them in then gave them away.On her 15th birthday they were arrested, brutally interrogated and, in May 1944, forced on to trains to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.Schloss and her mother were subsequently separated from her father and brother.During their three-day journey to Auschwitz, her brother Heinz told her that he and their father, Erich, had hidden 30 of his paintings under the floorboards of the attic.The sibling’s story was thesubject of an exhibitionput together at the Jewish Museum in London in 2017.Schloss later moved to England and lived in London for more than 70 years.The Auschwitz survivor got married in 1952 to Zvi Schloss and the couple had three daughters: Jacky, Caroline and Sylvia.When her mother, Elfriede, married Anne Frank’s father, Otto, in 1953, Schloss became Anne Frank’s stepsister.In 2017, Schloss told the Guardian: “Anne was much more mature and grown-up than me. She attended the Montessori school and was an academic year ahead of me. I went to an ordinary local school.”In 2021, aged 92, Schloss once again became a citizen of Austria, the country of her birth.In their tribute, her family said: “We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind.“We are incredibly proud of all that Eva stood for and accomplished, but right now, we are grieving.”Dan Green, chief executive of the Anne Frank Trust, described Schloss as “a beacon of hope and resilience”, adding: “Her unwavering commitment to challenging prejudice through Holocaust education has left an indelible mark on countless lives.“Her legacy will continue to guide and empower young people to build a world free from hatred and discrimination.“We at the Anne Frank Trust mourn her loss deeply and extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends during this difficult time.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustSecond world warKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Our advice is to plan ahead and consider if your journey is really necessary during the weather warnings.”The Scottish transport secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said: “We’ve already seen challenging conditions and freezing temperatures, with more snow and ice on the way for the same areas. Of course for many Monday marks a return to work from the festive break. If you have to travel then please ensure your vehicle is winter ready and have a winter kit in your car.”She thanked the gritter drivers, chainsaw gangs, police and others who had been out in force over the weekend.Matthew Lehnert, a Met Office chief meteorologist, said that elsewhere in the UK there would be snow showers, ice and frost but “milder air will make attempts to spread eastward” from Tuesday.He added: “This will mean rain becomes more likely in the south, but there is also the possibility of more organised snow along the boundary of the mild and cold air masses. Strong winds could also be a feature later in the week.”The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued amber cold health alerts acrossEnglanduntil Tuesday.Agostinho Sousa, the head of extreme events and health protection at the agency, said it was vital to check in with family, friends and neighbours who were most vulnerable.He said: “The forecast temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you.”Jones, 34, was found unresponsive at the FairmontSan Franciscoon 1 January after police officers were called to respond to a medical emergency at the hotel around 3am.Jones was pronounced dead at the scene. In a dispatch audio,obtained by TMZ, a call for the incident came in as a “code 3 for the overdose, color change”. Officials have not released a cause of death and police have said they do not suspect foul play.Jones was the daughter of the Academy award-winning actor and his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley.

But in a year marked by three category 5 hurricanes, record summer humidity and heat, and deadly fires and floods, the cracks have already begun to show.Fema, bereft of strong leadership and sinking under low morale and large gaps in its workforce,went into hurricane season without a plan in place. Gutted weather-balloon networks in Alaska failed toadequately warn residentsin advance of what would become one of the most destructive storms in state history. It took administration officials more than 72 hours to authorise the deployment of federal search-and-rescue teams after the Guadalupe river in Texas surged into a summer camp and through nearby communities in July, a flood that left more than 135 people dead.Even as Trump sought to slash federal funding, the cost of disasters continued to climb.View image in fullscreenA truck drives through a flooded road as category 3 Hurricane Erin leaves the region, in Naguabo, Puerto Rico, on 16 August.Photograph: Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the first half of 2025 alone, damage from weather and climate disasters across the nation totaled more than $101bn, according to Dr Adam Smith, who tracked the data for Noaa until the federal database that cataloged these costs was discontinued in May. “That cost is by far the most costly first half of any year on record dating back to 1980,” he said. Smith now works as the senior climate impacts scientist for the non-profit Climate Central, where he is continuing to build the database.“We are in the perfect storm,” said Monica Medina, who served as the principal deputy administrator of Noaa during the Obama administration. Ever-escalating threats are being met with a crumbling safety net, she added, as mismanagement and cuts in funding corrode an emergency response system already close to the brink.“We need to have a whole new attitude about preparedness for the types of weather events we are seeing,” she said. “People will suffer. It is just that simple.‘This is what it looks like when things fall apart’Emergency management has long been messy. Vaguely defined areas of responsibility for preparation and recovery sprawl across multiple levels of government and a chaotic matrix of non-profits, businesses and individuals.Investments made under Joe Biden took aim at some of these problems and initiated a broader focus on environmental justice and building resilience in vulnerable, disadvantaged communities where it was needed most. Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law injected billions of dollars into climate-resilience projects, including improving threatened waterways, supporting underpaid federal wildland firefighters, and protections against extreme heat.“We needed to go a lot further, but we had a good start,” said Shana Udvardy, senior climate resilience policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Fema, however, was already facing a catastrophe of its own.View image in fullscreenWildfire victims seek disaster relief services from Fema at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California, on 14 January.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesGrappling with staffing constraints, funding shortfalls and an ever-expanding mission caused by the increasing frequency, severity and cost of extreme weather events, a federal analysis created for Congress recommended more money for the beleaguered agency, and investing in the federal disaster workforce to ensure shorter deployments, more support and better training that would curb widespread burnout.Trump went in a decidedly different direction.“We want to wean off of Fema, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” the president said at a briefing on hurricane and wildfire preparedness in June, claiming the agency was too expensive and “doesn’t get the job done”. “The Fema thing has not been a very successful experiment,” the president concluded.A taskforce created by the president was due to publish recommendations in December that would greatly determine Fema’s fate, but the vote on a draft report was pulled afterdetails revealing the dramatic reductionsbeing considered was leaked to the press.“The council report recommendations as reported would gut Fema, leaving states to shoulder the burden of disasters and putting disaster victims at risk of serious harm, especially those with the least resources,” Udvardy said. “Council members should release their original report,” she added, urging more congressional oversight of what’s proposed.With the agency’s future hanging in limbo, capacity was systemically slimmed throughout the year.Hundreds of millions of dollars in national preparedness funding was cut in 2025, and Fema lostroughly a third of its full-time staff– experienced leaders among them – to firings, retirements and resignations.Congressionally appointed advisory councils that provide science-based recommendations were disbanded, and Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, put Fema on a much tighter rein, requiring personal approval for spending over $100,000 – an amount easily surpassed by often-costly disaster contracts and grants – gumming up the agency’s ability to rapidly respond when disasters struck.More than a dozen Fema workerswere investigated and put on forced leaveafter they signed an open letter to Congress warning of the dangerous outcomes that could come from the administration’s changes.Now on its third acting administrator in less than a year – none of whom were approved by Congress or had substantial emergency experience – leadership is frail and staff have reported exceedingly low morale, with confusion about core mission and fears of reprisal for speaking out.States are not yet equipped to pick up the slack. “There are budget cycles, there’s legislation. It could take years to make these changes,” said Bill Turner, the emergency management director at the Connecticut department of emergency services and public protection, who also serves as the resilience committee chair for the National Emergency Management Association, a non-profit professional association for US state and territory directors. “We need time to adjust.”View image in fullscreenA destroyed home in Hunt, Texas, on 6 July.Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty ImagesThe problem is especially concerning for smaller towns and rural communities. Many don’t even have dedicated emergency management departments.Local work to prepare has also been limited by the administration’s crackdown on climate-resilience policies that interfere with Trump’s energy-extraction priorities. Grant programs, including Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (Bric), Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) and Next Generation Warning System (NGWS) – which support states and communities in completing risk-reduction projects – were also suspended or blocked by theTrump administration.“A lot of the states are just trying to figure out what the future looks like,” Turner said.But the problems go beyond Fema. Holes in preparedness have grown even in areas Trump has said he prioritizes, including preventing catastrophic wildfire.Trump championed firefighters and called for bolstering preparedness for a year-round fire season, using the devastating Los Angeles wildfires as a call to action. In June, Trump signed an executive order that claimed to strengthen mitigation and improve land management practices. He also oversaw efforts to create a new federal firefighting force, housed in the Department of the Interior, long called for by firefighters and experts.View image in fullscreenThe Pickett fire in Calistoga, California, on 21 August.Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesBut after slashing thousands of jobs from already understaffed land management agencies, including the US Forest Service, lots of essential work was left undone. Chaos reigned as fire risks began to mount over the summer, and firefighting crews reported being left without power for weeks due to cut maintenance workers, paychecks being late or halved because administrative roles were left empty, or having to mow lawns outside their offices, manage campsites and do plumbing work at their barracks in addition to their other duties.Hazardous fuels reduction work – which includes prescribed burning, brush clearing and other techniques to cull highly flammable vegetation from high-risk areas –was down roughly 38% in 2025, according to a new analysis by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an organization made up of current and former federal wildland firefighters.“This is what it looks like when things fall apart,” said Udvardy, “and it’s going to take years to build it all back up.”A profound impactOnce considered a global leader in climate science and weather forecasting, the US has sharply changed direction under Trump, starting with Noaa, the agency tasked with the nation’s weather forecasting and climate monitoring.Thousands of staff left, including hurricane hunters, researchers, meteorologists and operations staff, and the holes left behind hobbled the agency’s ability to perform essential functions right as severe storms began to brew.In the spring, roughly a quarter of the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices werelacking chief meteorologists. Several offices across the US also had to cease overnight monitoring due to staff shortages, and weather balloon launches that collect data for forecasting had to be vastly reduced, undermining accuracy. By September, hundreds of jobs were unfilled after one in seven NWS workers left through resignations, retirements or firings.View image in fullscreenA meteorologist prepares to release a weather balloon in Gaylor, Michigan, on 28 April.Photograph: Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe NWS was given permission to begin refilling its ranks in late July, reopening 450 of the roughly 550 jobs cut, after policymakers and the public raised grave concerns over impacts on public safety. But progress has been sluggish. In December, only80 final job offers had been accepted, CNN reported.Even if those jobs are restaffed, experts have lamented the enormous amount of experience lost –roughly 27,000 years of collective experiencetallied from Noaa job losses alone.The White House canceled the contracts that produced legally mandated nationalclimate assessments, websites that were relied on by local governments, states, businesses and residents to prepare for climate events, and pulledclimate.gov, a widely used portal chock-full of resources, from public view.Nine Noaa stationstracking tsunami-causing earthquakes went offlineat the end of November, after the administration pulled funding from a lab that’s spent decades monitoring seismic activity; satellite instruments that track carbon dioxide levels and provide intel on water and air pollution are also on the chopping block.While these losses are expected to have a profound impact on the American public, they will be felt globally, too. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites, studies and intelligence, including data-sharing that tracks severe weather across Europe, coordination of disaster response in the Caribbean, and the monitoring of deforestation and the effects of the climate crisis in the Amazon rainforest.View image in fullscreenTropical analysis meteorologist Aidan Mahoney at his station at the Noaa National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, on 30 May.Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images“This is an essential part of the social safety net we depend on the government to provide – that is why we pay taxes – and this administration is dismantling it,” Medina said, pointing to US research that she said has long provided a public good at extremely low cost. The gaps in data and research and the loss of scientists from the federal workforce will be challenging to build back, even if the government changes course.“You can’t just buy the data you never collected,” she added. Even corporations hoping to meet the demand rely on federal forecasts and infrastructure. “The private sector sits on top of a foundation of government science that is falling apart,” she said.No longer relying on the federal governmentThe disasters of today are already packing a punch. But during the next decade, Earth is expected to blow past the critical 1.5C threshold, officials with the United Nations Environment Programme said in November, and extreme events will get exponentially worse.“Each year above 1.5 degrees will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage,” the UN secretary general António Guterres said in November in Belém, Brazil, speaking at the global Cop climate summit, where a US delegation was notably absent for the first time.Trump has repeatedly sown doubt in the climate crisis and in policies to protect against it, and has consistently worked to undermine scientific warnings, shifts to renewables by other governments, domestic and international, and rolled back regulations in the US. In 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency made cuts to climate and resilience programs, limited clean air and water investigations and enforcement, and moved to rescind the endangerment finding under the Clean Air Act, which links greenhouse gas emissions to poor public health outcomes.View image in fullscreenA man comforts his daughter on the charred ruins of their family home after the Eaton fire in Altadena, California, on 9 January.Photograph: Zoe Meyers/AFP/Getty ImagesFacing a future with less federal support as extremes intensify, emergency managers have encouraged the public to stay vigilant.“Everyone has a role in preparedness,” Turner said. “We’re not going to let the noise change the core of what we do every day.”But big gaps remain – and they might grow.“We are trying to break down that misconception that after a major disaster, the state or federal government will be able to come in and make you whole,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNatural disastersClimate crisisTrump administrationExtreme weatherUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

When Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds force waskilled in a targeted strikeduring Trump’s first presidency in January 2020, the gang was punctiliously consulted, people involved in that operation have said.In one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.The 1973 act – passed in the wake of the Vietnam war amid widespread anxieties about an incipient “imperial presidency” – requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops into hostilities and withdraw them after 60 days, unless Congress authorizes the action or declares war.It was a reaction to Lyndon Johnson’s perceived abuse of the notorious Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964, an ostensibly narrow measure that Johnson ultimately exploited to pursue unlimited war in Vietnam.Yet long before the operation to seize Maduro, Trump had in effect communicated that he considered such congressional limits null and void by offering up a raft of alternative legal justifications – including executive orders declaring the Venezuelan leader and his henchmen “narco-terrorists” and thus potentially subject to similar precepts that governed the post-2001 “war on terror”.Its effectiveness in constraining presidents from acts of war has long been shown to be limited, as the prolonged wars inIraqandAfghanistanattest – although George W Bush received congressional authorization in both cases.The 1989 invasion of Panama – carried out under the administration of George HW Bush to unseat the central American country’s dictatorial ruler, Manuel Noriega – was conducted without a former declaration of war or specific congressional approval. Bush, however, had taken care to garner bipartisan support on Capitol Hill beforehand.Nor did Barack Obama seek specific prior congressional approval before the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but instead acted under the authority of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress after the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida terror attacks on New York and Washington.Under Trump 2.0, no approval was sought for the mass military build-up off Venezuela’s shores or the estimated 35lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boatsthat have killed at least 115 people since last September. Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.The disdain implicit in the explanations from Trump and Marco Rubio as to why information on the Maduro raid was withheld even from senior congressional figures – that they cannot be trusted because they might leak – is unmistakable.“It’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say: ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,’” Rubio told reporters.Map of US airstrikes in VenezuelaStung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.“President Trump has made no secret of his intentions to effectively abolish the Congress, and that pattern continues today with his flagrant disregard for the Article 1 war powers of Congress, which is essential to our constitutional system of checks and balances,” said Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.Mark Warner, the Democrat’s ranking member on the Senate’s intelligence select committee and a member of the gang of eight, said: “Our constitution places the gravest decisions about the use of military force in the hands of Congress for a reason. Using military force to enact regime change demands the closest scrutiny, precisely because the consequences do not end with the initial strike.”And, Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who last month tabled a war powers resolution seeking to rein in the administration’s actions in Venezuela, said: “It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade.”He added: “Where will this go next? Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?”Yet it is hard not to detect an air of impotent futility in the Democrats’ chorus of indignation.With the exception of a few known Republican rebel figures such as Thomas Massie, a representative from Kentucky, Republican criticism was muted, whatever private misgivings some might have about Trump’s extravagant assumption of presidential powers at their expense.Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator, cited Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, as an example of how far the party’s members in Congress have ceded ground to the president.Having initially voiced reservations about the lack of authorization from Congress,Lee sharply changed tack– apparently after speaking to Rubio - saying that Maduro’s arrest was within “the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack”.Duss contrasted Lee’s supine stance with his previous actions, when he jointed Sanders to support a war powers resolution aimed at restricting US support forSaudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemenduring Trump’s first term.“Senator Lee spoke very eloquently about the constitutional principles at stake, and that was just when the United States was only supporting the Saudi emirati war in Yemen,” said Duss. “So for him to come out now and say the president has inherent authority to invade a country and kidnap a foreign leader without any authorization from Congress, is just wild.“It’s been clear for a while that he, along with many other Republicans, have decided that their political careers depend on staying in the good graces ofDonald Trumpand there’s really no past principle that they won’t abandon.”Duss said the instruments available to Congress under the War Powers Resolution were no longer fit for purpose. He suggested that the legislation needed to be rewritten, in the manner of the national security powers reform bill, which Sanders introduced – ironically, along with Lee – during Trump’s first presidency.The legislation was never enacted and even if reintroduced and passed would likely be vetoed by Trump – even if the Democrats were to recapture one or both chambers of Congress in November’s midterm elections.Short of a foreign policy disaster in Venezuela that could produce a groundswell of Republican opinion that might then yield a Senate supermajority to override a presidential veto, such legislation’s only hope, Duss conceded, is the future election of a sympathetic Democratic president.“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said. “Given that so many of the kind of separation of powers and the checks and balances presume that you’re going to have leaders who care about the law and who care about these processes.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS CongressUS constitution and civil libertiesVenezuelaUS militaryNicolás MaduroUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Los Angeles fire department issued anevacuation warningin a burn-scarred area because of potential debris flow due to the rainfall, and the National Weather Service issued aflood watchand stated that areas near burn scars are prone to flash flooding.Such extreme weather events are expected to increase because of climate change and the people most affected by such disasters are often those experiencing homelessness, according torecentresearch.“Not a great start to the new year,” Bob McElroy, the CEO of Alpha Project, the non-profit that runs the shelter, told the Union-Tribune.Hundreds staying at the shelter also had to evacuatein 2018and2024.“We’re definitely seeing more homelessness, more housing disruption, as a result of these disasters,” Steve Berg, of the Washington-based National Alliance to End Homelessness, told NBC News in 2023.Such events often reduce the housing supply and make it more difficult for people who lose their homes to findaffordable housing. In 2024, 11 million people in the United States were displaced from their homes by natural disasters, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, an international nongovernmental organization,reported.After wildfires broke out in 2023 in Maui, Hawaii, the state saw an 83% increase in homelessness, according to a US Department of Housing and Urban Developmentreport.“Disasters like wildfires and hurricanes cause the displacement of housed and unhoused people alike,” a Georgetown Environmental Law Review reportstated. “In short-term events, like evacuations, stop-gap measures like temporary housing and camping may be sufficient to meet needs. But when disasters damage or destroy housing, survivors may seek permanent solutions, like new housing, only to find such additional housing unavailable because it was also destroyed and other scarcity at play in the real estate market broadly.”In 2024, flooding forced Bridge shelter residents to flee through waist-deep water, the Union-Tribune reported. About five years earlier, a flash flood hit the same shelter.“It takes a lot to scare me, and that scared me,” one person staying at the shelter told theUnion-Tribune.This week’s storm again ravaged the property, at a time when the city already did not haveenough bedsfor people needing shelter.Michael Coats, 68, who had been staying under the tent with his wife, remained optimistic despite being homeless and having to flee the shelter.“I call him God,” Coats told alocal NBC affiliate. “It gives me my inspiration to keep trudging through this, from being on the street to where I am today and where I will end up one day” with “my wife and I back into another apartment”.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSan DiegoUS weatherUS politicsWest CoastExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

After attacking Caracas andtaking the country’s leader captive, Trump promised totake controlof Venezuela’s oil industry with the help of America’s biggest oil companies.Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry could “make a lot of money” with the might of the US behind it, Trump told the press, claiming that the new regime would invest billions to revive its fortunes.How much oil does Venezuela have?Venezuela is believed to have the largest oil reserves of any country in the world. The exact reserves remain uncertain but the state claims they could be as large as 300bn barrels, easily surpassing those of Saudi Arabia. Other estimates suggest Venezuela’s reserves of crude oil could represent about 17% of the world’s total.But the South American country has only ever pumped a fraction of its potential production. When Hugo Chávez, the populist former president, rose to power in 1999, the country produced about 3.5m barrels of oil a day, making it one of the top 10 crude producers in the world at the time.A quarter of a century later, neglect, poor infrastructure, under-investment and corruption have eroded the country’s oil industry and its economy. Venezuela’s output is roughly 1m barrels a day – compared with the more than 13m barrels of crude produced daily in the US.What role could US oil companies play?Trump has promised that “very large” US oil companies will spend billions of dollars to fix the “badly broken infrastructure”.The oil companies potentially in line to invest include Exxon Mobil, the largest US oil company, and the Texas-headquartered Conocophillips, both of which were active in Venezeula’s oil industry before it was nationalised by Chávez. Only Chevron, the US’s second largest oil company, has continued to operate in the country.So far these companies haveremained non-committal, with statements from ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips stopping short of confirming the US president’s investment plans.Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy, said: “My hunch is that if President Trump said this publicly, probably there was already an agreement with the US companies.”Under the new regime, US oil companies could follow the playbook used in many developing nations by partnering with the state oil company, PDVSA, to develop and produce crude in exchange for a share of the profits. The parlous financial state of PDVSA means US companies are likely to be able to negotiate a good return on their investments.But even with a united effort of the US president and some of the world’s biggest oil companies, success is not guaranteed. “History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” Leon added.What does this mean for Venezuela’s current oil customers?The vast majority of crude produced by Venezuela, about 80%, is exported via supertankers to China. The world’s biggest oil importer takes the shipments as repayment for loans it extended to the country under Chávez.China is Venezuela’s biggest lender and, while the total financial support is not known, some estimate that it could include $105bn in loans and other financial commitments to the South American nation between 2007 and 2016.By wresting control of Venezuela’s oil industry, the US has in effect gained control of billions in expected repayments, and a key source of cut-price energy for China’s developing economy.The Chinese foreign ministry has condemned the US actions. In a social media post it said it was “deeply shocked” by the “blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president”.Market observers have speculated that Venezuelan crude could now be redirected to US refineries in Louisiana. This would allow more US crude to be exported on the international market and boost Trump’s mission to establish the US as a world-leading energy superpower.It is possible that any future oil shipments to China, produced by US oil companies, would be charged at prices closer to the market rate – a blow to Beijing’s efforts to secure energy at the lowest possible cost.Trump told Fox News on Saturday that China would continue to receive crude shipments from Venezuela, but did not provide details.What does this mean for the oil market?The events of this weekend are unlikely to have an immediate lasting impact on the price of crude oil or the cost motorists will pay at the pumps, according to experts at Third Bridge Energy, a US research company.Volatility is likely when oil trading resumes this week as traders weigh up the impact that a lifting of US sanctions against Venezuelan crude might have on the market against the instability caused by the regime change.It will take longer for any meaningful increase in the barrels produced by Venezuela to dampen market prices. A return to the country’s crude production heyday at the turn of the century could take years, according to Peter McNally, the global lead analyst at Third Bridge.“Can Venezuela’s oil output recover?” McNally asked. “Our experts tell us the answer is yes but it will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of western oil majors committing to the country.”Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryCommoditiesVenezuelaAmericasUS foreign policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Total FTSE 100 dividend payments are expected to set a new record of £85.6bn in 2026, Mould reported, finally eclipsing the peak of £85.2bn set in 2018.A poll by the trading company eToro found that UK retail investors are optimistic about the year ahead, with 53% confident the current bull market will continue throughout 2026.UK bonds could do wellRobert Timper, the chief global fixed income strategist at BCA Research, said it could be a strong year for UK government bonds, known as gilts, if the Bank of England cuts interest rates more rapidly than other central banks.He predicted: “UK gilts will go from second to the best-performing bond market [in 2026], backed by a dovish BoE and reduced fiscal concerns.”Global markets forecast to riseUBS has predicted that “supportive economic conditions should underpin global equities, which are expected to rise by about 15% by the end of 2026”, with gains likely in the US, China, Japan and Europe.Double-digit gains are expected on Wall Street. Under UBS’s base case scenario, the US S&P 500 index would end 2026 at 7,700 points – a gain of 12.5%.Deutsche Bank has a year-end S&P 500 target of 8,000 points (+17%), while Oppenheimer Asset Management is even more bullish, forecasting an 8,100-point year end.According to the consultancy OxfordEconomics, above-consensus growth and below-consensus headline inflation in the US next year will lift US stocks.UBS also recommends Chinese stocks. “China’s tech sector stands out as a top global opportunity,” it said. “Strong liquidity, retail flows and earnings – expected to rise to 37% in 2026 – should sustain momentum for Chinese equities.”Ostrum Asset Management predicts European equity markets will perform positively in 2026, driven by a return to earnings growth. However, it cautioned that this is dependent on companies’ ability to deliver against high expectations.But the investor Michael Burry, featured in the film The Big Short, doesn’t share the optimism, sayinghe sees several “bad years ahead”.Artificial intelligence impactAfter a year in which hyperscalers invested hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure, the technology sector is likely to shape long-term macroeconomic outcomes in 2026.Investors will be watching to see whether big AI companies justify their huge valuations – after strong stock market gains in 2025 – and deliver the productivity growth that policymakers are hoping for. If not, valuations could suffer.Though many argue AI investment remains at the early-adoption stage, there areconcerns that some players are entwined with their own suppliers and partners. That circularity blurs the true financial picture, creating fragilities that could splinter if AI optimism fades.While much of the AI focus in 2025 was on chatbots, the UBS chief investment officer, Mark Haefele, said capital expenditure in the sector could focus on agentic AI (systems or “agents” that can carry out knowledge work with little or no human prompting), physical AI (such as robots and self-driving vehicles) and AI video.UBS predicts about $4.7tn will be spent on AI capital expenditure globally by 2030 – roughly double the $2.4tn already planned, based on more than 40 announcements this year.The economic outlookThe world economy is expected to avoid a downturn in 2026, despite the rise in trade barriers in 2025. Kathleen Brooks, the UK research director at the broker XTB, predicts it will remain resilient, with little chance of a global recession.Goldman Sachs analysts have told clients that the main risks to global growth in 2026 are that a fragile job market sparks recession fears, or the equity market questions the value of AI-related revenues.Goldman anticipates “sturdy global growth of 2.8% in 2026”, with theUS economyforecast to “outperform substantially” thanks to reduced drag from tariffs, tax cuts and easier financial conditions. It also expects China to hold up well, as strong exports outweigh sluggish domestic demand.Goldman Themes for 2026$GSpic.twitter.com/pdorVukKDE— Special Situations 🌐 Research Newsletter (Jay) (@SpecialSitsNews)December 10, 2025UBS believes the global economy is poised to accelerate in 2026, helped by improved business and consumer confidence and extra fiscal stimulus in some advanced economies.The Dutch bank ING said it is “still relatively upbeat” about the US economy, expecting looser financial conditions to support growth in 2026.Deutsche Bank suggestedthe US midterm elections, due in November, could influence policy earlier in the year as Republicans try to avoid losing seats.CommoditiesThe price of oil will be highly sensitive to geopolitical developments during 2026, such as progress towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East.Forecasts of a supply glutcould also push prices down.The advisory company Oxford Economics predicts Brent crude oil will end 2026 at $58 a barrel, down from $60 last month, and drop further to $55 in 2027.MeCopper prices could be pushed up by shortages. Deutsche Bank predicts a “clear deficit” for the copper market in 2026, leading to peak prices in the second half of the year.Central banks and ratesThe money markets are pricing in two US interest rate cuts by December 2026, though this forecast is dependent on the outlook for the US economy and Trump’s choice for the next Fed chair.Richard Carter, the head of fixed interest research at the wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, said markets would be “on high alert for any erosion of Fed independence”.In the UK, one rate cut in 2026 is fully priced in, but several economists predict the Bank of England will ease rates at least twice.What could go wrong?Experienced City voices know that the market consensus will inevitably be wrong – the question is in which direction.Dario Perkins, an economist at the forecasters TS Lombard, suggested the picture could be stronger than expected.“The consensus: 2026 will be just like 2025,” he told clients. “Steady global growth, a bit of disinflation, and monetary policy returning to neutral, where it stays indefinitely. Zzzzz.”He continued: “Where could the consensus be wrong? Our bet is on a stronger rebound in activity, which stokes inflation and starts a debate [in the second half of the year] about monetary tightening.”But William Davies, the global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said “the risks of a misstep are accumulating”.He warned: “Growth has proven surprisingly durable, inflation has moderated (albeit unevenly), and markets have continued to climb. But beneath the surface imbalances are building. We believe the coming year will be defined by how successfully policymakers and investors can navigate the narrowing path.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpFederal ReserveUS economyStock marketsOilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you should. This year, there will be a significant amount of tax refunds. Why? Well, it’s nottariffcash. It’s because many people overpaid their taxes this year.For example, service workers who receive tips will be getting refunds. Thanks toDonald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a new provision allows them to deduct up to $25,000 per individual for any tipped income they received during the year. But I bet even when the bill passed, few changed their withholdings to reflect this deduction. If you’re part of that group, then it’s very likely you had too much withheld … and paid too much tax. When you file your 2025 return between now and 15 April – and take advantage of this deduction – you’ll find out you owed less taxes than you estimated. Hence the refund.AI is coming for young people’s office jobs. That’s good news for the construction industry | Gene MarksRead moreThe same goes for workers receiving overtime pay. There’s a new deduction that will allow individuals to deduct up to $12,500 of their overtime pay received in 2025 (it’s $25,000 for joint filers). Similarly for service workers, it’s a deduction you take when you file your 2025 returns. I’m betting if you received overtime during the year, your withholdings didn’t reflect that either. So you’ll probably be getting money back on the taxes you overpaid.There are caveats. State and local taxes may both still apply. Employment taxes – social security and Medicare – aren’t affected. Both deductions start to phase out if you make more than $150,000. Not all tipped workers are eligible (here’sa listto check). Thanks to the shutdown, the IRS didn’t have time to update W-2 wage reporting forms to reflect these changes. And employers weren’t given much guidance as to how to calculate these amounts.It’s not just people who received tips and overtime that have new tax benefitsFor example, did you know that your overtime wage eligible for the deduction would only be the differential between your normal hourly rate and your overtime rate? So if you got paid time and a half for overtime and your normal rate is $20 an hour, you would receive $30 an hour – but your deduction is on the $10 difference. I’m not sure all employers will do these calculations correctly, so be careful – any mistakes are the taxpayer’s responsibility.I’m as capitalist as they get but Medicare for all is the best hope for US healthcare | Gene MarksRead moreIt’s not just people who received tips and overtime that have new tax benefits.Older adults – subject to some limitations – will get an additional $6,000 deduction this year over and above their standard deduction. If you run a small business, you’ll receive higher deductions for first-year depreciation and research and development costs. If you haven’t taken advantage already, you can contribute more to a flexible savings account (which reduces your taxable income) and contribute up to $5,000 to a “Trump savings account” this year and annually, which, while not reducing your income, will allow your newborn to accrue earnings tax-free through the age of 18 and then withdraw the funds without penalty.These deductions aren’t one-offs. Which is why it’s important that if you get a refund this year, make sure to adjust your withholdings for 2026 to reflect your updated taxable income for the current year. This way, you can increase your net pay and put more money in your pocket during the year instead of waiting until you file your 2026 returns in 2027.There are many critics of the OBBBA and they legitimately argue that the bill has many downsides – increasing deficits, taking away critical benefits and reducing spending in needed areas are among the biggest. Those issues aside, the bill does include significant tax benefits for many, benefits that may hopefully make a difference to both consumers and the economy at large.The OBBBA is law. However you feel about it, take advantage. File your 2025 tax returns as soon as possible. Get your refund. It’s your money.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS personal financeTrump administrationTax and spendingUS work & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

The company is Ukraine’s largest spirits export brand.Photograph: NemiroffUkraine‘This is business as usual’: boss of bombed Ukrainian vodka maker seeks to expand exportsNemiroff says products still reaching UK chains such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco despite production difficultiesSarah ButlerSun 4 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 04.16 ESTShareBusinesses inUkraineare “not sitting and waiting for the war to end” and are working to expand despite bombs hitting shipments out of the country, according to a leading vodka exporter to the UK.Yuriy Sorochynskyi, the chief executive of Ukraine’s largest spirits export brand, Nemiroff vodka, has said its products have continued to flow to big chains includingTescoand Sainsbury’s as it copes with the harsh realities of almost four years of war.Late last year one of the brand’s shipping containers, holding 17,000 bottles, was hit by bombing at the Ukrainian port of Odesa. A supplier’s shipment was also recently hit.“We had one or two containers destroyed in port by missile attacks,” he said. “This is now business as usual.”Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, keeping production of major exports going, from vodka to grain and sunflower seeds, has been an important part of the country’s ability to fight back.With Russian vodkas pulled from most supermarket shelves acrossEuropein support of Ukraine, the brand has grown rapidly. In the UK sales rose 24% last year to £6.25m, and it is now one of the fastest-growing premium vodka brands.Nemiroff has sponsored Ukraine’s heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk and partnered with the Premier League football clubs Aston Villa, Fulham, West Ham and Everton. The brand is now listed in Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and the Co-op, and in October it returned to the duty free market with products at Heathrow and Gatwick.More than 40% of the brand’s sales are now in the west, after sales dived from about 10m cases globally in 2010 to 2.4m cases in 2022 following its exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets. Global sales have partly recovered, to 4.4m cases this year, as Ukrainian demand has held up and exports to the west expanded.Sorochynskyi said the company ceased sales in Russia, one of its biggest markets where its products were produced under licence, which was terminated immediately after the invasion of Ukraine.View image in fullscreenBomb damage to supplies at Nemiroff, a Ukrainian vodka maker.Photograph: NemiroffSince the start of the war, keeping production going has involved measures such as buying a gas generator, so that the factory can keep going as Ukraine’s power stations have come under attack, and finding spare space to rehouse its bottle top supplier, an Italian company that had a subsidiary in Sumi in the north-east of Ukraine, close to the Russian border, which took a direct missile hit in August last year.Nemiroff was also providing bottling facilities for some competitors with the aim of “supporting business in Ukraine”, said Sorochynskyi. “There are a huge number of examples of competitors helping each other out in order to survive.”Another potential move on the horizon is the provision of bathing facilities for workers who are struggling to wash at home amid power cuts and shortages because of attacks on power infrastructure.Sorochynskyi said that life is particularly tough for those living in flats in cities as they are less likely to be able to set up their own energy sources such as wood-burning stoves or solar panels. As a result, he said, it is not uncommon to see queues of cars heading for shopping centres, as much for the electrical supply or wifi as for shopping.Nemiroff, whose distillery and bottling plants are located in its namesake city of Nemyriv, in Vinnytsia oblast in the east of the country, where there has been a distillery since 1752, is owned by the siblings Yakov and Bella Finkelstein, along with Anatoliy Kipish. The three have controlled the company since it was privatised by the state in the 1990s. Another shareholder, the Glus family, was ousted after an internal battle for control in 2013.As ports have come under attack, Sorochynskyi said Nemiroff has been forced to reroute shipments more than once.“Now we are mostly shipping out by truck. Before 2022 we used a lot of sea containers but we stopped that when the Black Sea was blocked. It took us four months to find an alternative.”The Ukrainian government, helped by the EU, is also building up railway infrastructure to help provide other freight routes. New railway lines with the European standard gauge of track will allow easier exports via train.A track to the borders with Hungary and Slovakia opened in September and one to Poland is set to open in 2027. Facilities to help take goods to Romania’s Black Sea ports have also been ramped up.Production halted for about a month in the early days of the war and exports were also held up as the borders were overloaded with refugees and the movement of military equipment.Explore more on these topicsUkraineFood & drink industryRetail industryEuropeRussiaAlcoholTesconewsShareReuse this content"

The Panthers won the tiebreaker with the best record within the division.The Falcons completed a season sweep of the Saints (6-11), who had their four-game winning streak end.Trailing 16-10, the Saints drove from their 25 to the Atlanta 20 before Alford returned his interception of Tyler Shough’s pass intended for Dante Pettis 59 yards to the Saints 27 with 3:14 remaining. The play set up Zane Gonzalez’s fourth field goal, a 38-yarder, to extend Atlanta’s lead to nine points.Shough answered with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ronnie Bell with 1:11 remaining, but Atlanta’s Kyle Pitts recovered an onside kick.Cleveland Browns 20-18 Cincinnati BengalsMyles Garrett set the NFL’s single-season record with his 23rd sack and Shedeur Sanders led a late scoring drive that was capped by Andre Szmyt’s 49-yard field goal as time expired to help the Cleveland Browns rally for a 20-18 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in the season finale Sunday.Garrett sacked Joe Burrow with 4:09 remaining in the fourth quarter for the record-setting sack, surpassing the 22 and a half by Michael Strahan and TJ Watt. Burrow was in the shotgun formation on first-and-10 at the Browns 45-yard line.After Ja’Marr Chase’s four-yard touchdown catch gave the Bengals (6-11) an 18-17 advantage with 1:29 remaining, Sanders directed a 10-play, 40-yard drive to give the Browns (5-12) two straight victories for the first time in two years.Sanders was 3 of 6 passing for 33 yards on the final drive, including an 11-yard completion to Jerry Jeudy with 31 seconds left to get the Browns in Szmyt’s range. Dylan Sampson had two carries for seven yards to get it closer for Szmyt.Sanders finished 11 of 22 for 111 yards. He also had a fumble in the first quarter that led to Cincinnati’s first touchdown.Dallas Cowboys 17-34 New York GiantsJaxson Dart threw the 14th and 15th touchdown passes of his rookie year and the New York Giants ended their lost season on a two-game winning streak by beating the Dallas Cowboys 34-17 on Sunday.That and other results around the NFL took the Giants (4-13) out of the running for a top-two pick and clinched No 1 for Las Vegas. New York routed the Raiders last week to end a nine-game skid.Dart has said he cares more about winning than draft position and played like it in his 12th professional start. He was 22 of 32 for 231 yards with TD passes to Daniel Bellinger – on a shovel pass-and-run – and Tyrone Tracy.While the Giants were shorthanded because of injuries and illnesses, they treated this like any other game with their starters going the distance. Dallas (7-9-1) took it more like an exhibition game, including Dak Prescott exiting after halftime.Prescott completed seven of 11 passes for 70 yards and lost a fumble off a botched snap before being replaced at quarterback by Joe Milton to begin the third quarter. Prescott finished the season with 4,552 yards passing, the second most of his decade-long career behind only 4,902 in 2019.View image in fullscreenCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett celebrates after setting the NFL single-season sacks record.Photograph: Jeff Dean/APGreen Bay Packers 3-16 Minnesota VikingsJJ McCarthy had a productive first half before he was injured again, fullback CJ Ham rushed for a short touchdown, and the Minnesota Vikings finished a frustrating season by beating the resting Green Bay Packers 16-3 on Sunday.Green Bay (9-7-1) were locked into the No 7 seed in the NFC playoffs and had nothing to play for.McCarthy, who went 14 for 23 for 182 yards passing, pulled himself out after his first throw of the third quarter so the athletic training staff could examine his right hand and did not return. Backup Max Brosmer took it from there, helping Justin Jefferson reach the 100-yard mark for the first time in 12 games as the Vikings (9-8) coasted to their fifth consecutive victory.Jefferson had already secured his sixth straight 1,000-yard season, only the third receiver in NFL history to accomplish that feat.With Jordan Love safely watching on the sideline and Malik Willis recovering from injuries, the Packers gave Clayton Tune his second career start at quarterback and netted minus-7 passing yards. Dallas Turner had two of Minnesota’s four sacks that racked up 41 lost yards for Green Bay.Tennessee Titans 7-41 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes, breaking the franchise’s single-season record for total scores, and the Jacksonville Jaguars won the AFC South and earned a home playoff game with a 41-10 drubbing of Tennessee on Sunday.It was most lopsided outcome in series history.The Jaguars (13-4) clinched their third division title in nine years, swept the Titans (3-14) for the third time in four seasons and topped a dozen wins for just the second time in the team’s 31-year history.Jacksonville, though, will have to wait several hours to learn its postseason seeding and opponent. The Jaguars could land the AFC’s No 1 seed but more likely will end up as the third and host Buffalo, Houston or the Los Angeles Chargers next week.No one should want to play the Jaguars, who have won eight in a row and nine of 10 since their bye. And Lawrence has been the hottest quarterback in the league during the streak.Indianapolis Colts 30-38 Houston TexasCJ Stroud accounted for two touchdowns and Ka’imi Fairbairn made a go-ahead field goal with 12 seconds left to lift the Houston Texans to a 38-30 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday that extended their winning streak to nine games.The victory gives the Texans (12-5) the No 5 seed in the AFC playoffs.Defensive tackle Tommy Togiai scooped up a fumble on the final play and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to pad the lead.The Texans clinched a third straight postseason berth last week and they had a chance to win the AFC South with a victory and a Jacksonville loss. But with the Jaguars up big over the Titans at halftime, coach DeMeco Ryans opted to rest quarterback Stroud, defensive stars Will Anderson Jr, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley and several other starters after the break.The Colts led 30-29 after a field goal with about two and a half minutes to go before Fairbairn’s 43-yard kick put the Texans on top 32-30 and gave him a career-high six field goals in the game.Kansas City Chiefs 12-14 Las Vegas RaidersDaniel Carlson made a career-long 60-yard field goal with eight seconds left to give Las Vegas a 14-12 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday and end the Raiders’ 10-game losing streak.Carlson and Kansas City’s Harrison Butker each made four field goals, with Butker hitting a 41-yarder with 1:01 left to give the Chiefs a short-lived 12-11 lead.This was the first victory for the Raiders (3-14) over the Chiefs (6-11) at Allegiant Stadium. The Chiefs, who had won all five previous meetings in Las Vegas, lost their sixth straight game and eighth in 10.Las Vegas’ Ashton Jeanty rushed for 87 yards, giving him 975 for the season that is second among Raiders rookies to the 1,150 yards Josh Jacobs gained in 2019. Jeanty’s 1,321 yards from scrimmage broke the club rookie record set by Jacobs (1,316).Much of the intrigue about the outcome was eliminated before kickoff when the New York Giants defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-17, guaranteeing the Raiders the top pick in this year’s NFL draft. A Giants loss would have meant that Las Vegas would get that selection only with a loss to the Chiefs.View image in fullscreenNew England Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson, left, stiff-arms a Miami Dolphins cornerback while running for a touchdown on Sunday.Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/APNew York Jets 8-35 Buffalo BillsAfter taking the first snap, Josh Allen headed to the sideline and joined the 70,000-plus fans to watch backup Mitch Trubisky throw four touchdown passes as the Buffalo Bills bid a likely farewell to their long-time home with a 35-8 rout of the New York Jets on Sunday.Gabe Davis caught two touchdown passes and Ty Johnson had a TD run and a scoring catch in an outing during which the playoff-bound Bills (12-5) rested a majority of their starters.Buffalo’s defense, meantime, manhandled an injury-depleted and backup-filled Jets offense that was blanked through three and a half quarters and finished with 122 yards offense and nine first downs.The win, coupled with the Los Angeles Chargers’ loss at Denver, led to Buffalo moving up one spot in clinching the No 6 seed. The Bills will travel to play the AFC South champion Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round next weekend.It’ll be the third playoff meeting between the teams, with Jacksonville winning both. The Jaguars defeated Buffalo 30-27 in what stood as Bills Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly’s final game in 1996. More recently, the Jaguars beat Buffalo 10-3 in 2017 in the Bills first playoff appearance after ending a 17-year postseason drought.Arizona Cardinals 20-37 LA RamsMatthew Stafford passed for 259 yards and threw two of his four touchdown passes to Colby Parkinson, and the Los Angeles Rams secured the No 5 seed in the NFC playoffs with a 37-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.Tyler Higbee returned from injury with five receptions for 91 yards and a key fourth-quarter TD for the Rams (12-5), who will visit the NFC South champion Carolina Panthers (8-9) in the wild-card round.Puka Nacua made a one-handed TD grab among his 10 catches for 76 yards for the Rams, who snapped their first two-game skid of the season. Stafford passed Dan Marino for seventh place on the NFL’s career TD passes list while finishing his MVP-caliber season leading the NFL with 4,707 yards passing and 46 TDs – the second most in league history by a quarterback at least 37 years old.Sean McVay’s team clinched its third straight playoff berth last month, but the Rams blew the No 1 overall seed with road losses to Seattle and Atlanta in their past two games. Now they’ll have to win in Charlotte, where they lost 31-28 on 30 November.McVay went against his usual policy and didn’t rest his starters for the relatively meaningless regular-season finale because he wanted his team to snap out of its costly two-game slump.LA Chargers 3-19 Denver BroncosThe Denver Broncos secured the AFC’s top playoff seed with a 19-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers’ bevy of backups Sunday, a victory fueled by Ja’Quan McMillian’s 45-yard interception return for a touchdown.Wil Lutz was 4-for-4 on field goals as the Broncos (14-3) tied their franchise record for most victories in a season and earned their first No 1 playoff seed since 2015, which they parlayed into a third Super Bowl title.They’ll get a week off before hosting their first playoff game in a decade, which could be against these same Chargers (11-6) if L.A. beats the Patriots (14-3) at New England in the wild-card round next weekend.Broncos quarterback Bo Nix had one of his worst games of the season, throwing for just 38 yards in the first half and 141 overall, but he tied Russell Wilson’s record of 24 wins in his first two NFL seasons.With no chance to win the division, the Chargers treated this game much like a bye week as they prepare to hit the road for the playoffs in the wild-card round. Coach Jim Harbaugh sat several of his starters, most notably quarterback Justin Herbert, safety Derwin James and OLB Tuli Tuipulotu.Miami Dolphins 10-38 New England PatriotsRhamondre Stevenson ran for two touchdowns and caught another from MVP contender Drake Maye, and the New England Patriots completed their remarkable turnaround season with a 38-10 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.Stevenson rushed seven times for 131 yards as New England posted its first sweep of the Dolphins since the 2016 season. TreVeyon Henderson added touchdown runs of 2 and 5 yards.The Patriots finished 14-3, their most victories since they won the Super Bowl to cap the 2016 season. The AFC East champions will be No. 2 seed in the playoffs and host the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round next weekend. Denver prevented New England from earning the AFC’s top seed by beating the Chargers 19-3 on Sunday.Miami (7-10) finished with its second straight sub-.500 season under coach Mike McDaniel following back-to-back playoff appearances in his first two seasons.Maye completed 14 of 18 passes for 191 yards and a touchdown before taking a seat early in the fourth quarter. Henderson’s five-yard TD run was set up by a 56-yard run by Stevenson on the second play of the Patriots’ game-opening drive.Detroit Lions 19-16 Chicago BearsJared Goff led five scoring drives, Jake Bates kicked a 42-yard field goal as time expired and the Detroit Lions regrouped to beat the NFC North champion Chicago Bears 19-16 on Sunday after blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter.The Bears (11-6) stumbled into the playoffs with back-to-back losses, though they secured the No 2 seed in the NFC with Washington beating Philadelphia. Chicago will host Green Bay in a wild-card game next week and would have home-field advantage in the divisional round if it beats the Packers.Caleb Williams set the franchise’s single-season passing record and threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes as the Bears wiped out a 16-0 deficit.The Lions (9-8) ended a disappointing season on a winning note when Bates nailed a 42-yarder. A 26-yard pass from Goff to Amon-Ra St Brown helped set up the field goal, and Detroit came out on top after losing three in a row.Washington Commanders 24-17 Philadelphia EaglesThe Eagles’ backup plan backfired, and the Super Bowl champions will start their postseason defense of the title as the No 3 seed in the NFC.With Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and most key Eagles starters sitting out even with playoff seeding at stake, the Washington Commanders got fourth-quarter passing and rushing touchdowns from Josh Johnson to beat Philadelphia 24-17 on Sunday.The NFC East champion Eagles (11-6) will open the playoffs at home next weekend against San Francisco.The Eagles needed help to earn the No 2 seed. They had to beat the Commanders and Detroit needed to win at Chicago. Sure enough, the Lions beat the Bears 19-16 to add some sting to the Eagles’ loss.With Jayden Daniels shut down and Marcus Mariota dealing with a leg injury, the Commanders (5-12) started Johnson, their 39-year-old third-stringer. Johnson rallied the Commanders from a 17-10 hole with a two-yard touchdown pass to John Bates and then scored on a one-yard run with 2:32 left.Explore more on these topicsNFLCarolina PanthersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The competition tests skiers across sprint and distance races, classic and freestyle techniques, and concludes with the sport’s most notorious challenge: a steep, lung-burning climb up Alpe Cermis.Entering Sunday’s final 10km stage with a 79-second lead, Diggins skied conservatively and finished second on the day, just under nine seconds behind Norway’s Karoline Simpson-Larsen. That was more than enough to secure the overall title with a cumulative time of 2 hours, 11 minutes and 26.1 seconds in Val di Fiemme, the venue that will host Olympic cross-country skiing next month at the Milan Cortina Winter Games.Diggins finished 2min 17.7sec ahead of Austria’s Teresa Stadlober in the overall standings, with Norway’s Heidi Weng third, 2:31.6 back.View image in fullscreenJessie Diggins of the United States reacts following her third Tour de Ski win.Photograph: Maxim Thore/BILDBYRÅN/ShutterstockThe victory marked Diggins’ third Tour de Ski title, adding to her wins in 2021 and 2023. In the 20-year history of the event, she remains the only American – male or female – to stand atop the overall podium. Her additional third-place finishes in 2019 and last year further underscore her dominance in one of the sport’s most grueling competitions.USA’s Summer Britcher boosts Olympic luge bid with another World Cup goldRead moreThe Tour de Ski is widely regarded as a definitive measure of all-around excellence in cross-country skiing, rewarding athletes who can endure repeated high-level racing with little recovery while adapting to changing courses and techniques. Diggins’ performance across the week highlighted her consistency, tactical discipline and endurance, qualities that have defined her career.In November, Diggins announced that the 2025–26 season would be her last on the World Cup circuit, setting the stage for a farewell campaign that now includes one of the strongest results of her career. With three stage wins this season and multiple podium finishes, she enters the Olympic period in peak form.On the men’s side, Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won the Tour de Ski for a record fifth time. Klæbo finished 12th in the final stage but comfortably defended his overall lead, finishing ahead of compatriots Mattis Stenshagen and Harald Østberg Amundsen in an all-Norwegian podium.Explore more on these topicsJessie DigginsSkiingUS sportsUSA Olympic teamShareReuse this content"

The London club had crashed in December, their Premier League form awful and the rising tensions between Enzo Maresca and the board would explode on New Year’s Eve.There have not beenmany managerial changeson the very first day of a year and this one left Calum McFarlane, the club’s under-21 coach, thrust in as the interim manager. Never before had he taken charge of a single senior game.Pep Guardiola rues Manchester City injury crisis after Gvardiol and Dias blowRead moreMcFarlane might not get another if Chelsea can, as they hope, appoint a permanent successor to Maresca before Wednesday’s derby at Fulham. Strasbourg’s Liam Rosenior,their No 1 target, flew to London on Sunday for final talks. But McFarlane can look back with pride and maybe a touch of amazement on his moment in the spotlight as Chelsea held their own with City before stunning them with a stoppage-time Enzo Fernández equaliser.The first thing to say is that the goal to rock City’s title aspirations and have Guardiola screaming at the heavens was not a bolt from the blue. McFarlane made smart substitutions, the introduction of the former City striker Liam Delap being one, andChelseawere pushing. Another former City player, Cole Palmer, might have done better with an 89th-minute side-foot; he did not get the contact he wanted and there were nerves among the City support when the board went up to show six additional minutes.Then it happened. Malo Gusto’s cross from the right took a slight deflection and after Delap could not get there in the middle, Fernández did at the far post. His first shot was a mis-kicked swipe, the second drew a save out of Gianluigi Donnarumma at close quarters and he could not miss with the third.View image in fullscreenTijjani Reijnders scores a first-half goal for Manchester City.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersCity will be kicking themselves. Nobody knows better than Guardiola how fine the margins can be in a title race and he was desperate for his team to respond to their draw at Sunderland and, as importantly,Arsenal’s win at Bournemouthon Saturday. The failure to do so left them six points adrift. It is not insurmountable. But it is certainly a problem.The principal subplot was impossible to ignore because it was the ultimate fiery baptism for McFarlane, the one-time City youth coach. He had tried to downplay the significance of it being him against Guardiola; it was broader than that, he said, a big six showpiece, one of the fixtures of the season. But it was there – master versus rookie. When McFarlane joined Chelsea from Southampton last summer, he could never have envisaged this.Guardiola started with Tijjani Reijnders on the left of a four-man midfield but he asked him to tuck inside. It was Nico O’Reilly who pushed up the flank from left-back to provide the width. It added up to Guardiola overloading the middle of the pitch. McFarlane’s starting system had Palmer to the right of a central midfield three, although he was invariably the furthest forward of them.Chelsea dug in at the outset, bringing the hustle, looking to lay down a few physical markers, especially the captain, Reece James, who played in the deep midfield role. He seemed determined to ensure his team did not miss the snarl of the suspended Moisés Caicedo. There was even a chance for Estêvão Willian in the 19th minute after a low pull-back from the left by Pedro Neto. The shot was blocked by Josko Gvardiol.City moved up through the gears as the interval approached and it was a period that coincided with Rodri flexing his muscles, driving the team forward. Phil Foden had gone close on 20 minutes but it was when Rodri – on his first league start for three months – played forward and Foden flicked on to Erling Haaland that it felt as though City were no longer in the mood to tolerate Chelsea’s resistance.View image in fullscreenCalum McFarlane receives the acclaim of his coaching team after Chelsea’s unexpected point.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersHaaland’s shot deflected off Trevoh Chalobah and forced Filip Jörgensen, who played in place of the injured Robert Sánchez, into a fine one-handed save. Back came City shortly afterwards. It was Rodri out right to Haaland and when the striker darted inside, his curling shot came back off the inside of the far post.Chelsea could not get to half-time at 0-0. The pressure from City was too much. Rodri allowed Rayan Cherki to take over the ball in midfield and when he passed forward, the clearance from Benoît Badiashile was unconvincing. Reijnders nipped in, teasing Badiashile, rolling his studs over the ball to go on the outside before lashing high inside the near post. Jörgensen knows that such concessions are never a good look for a goalkeeper. The power brooked no argument.McFarlane made changes. He got Andrey Santos on in midfield which freed up Fernández a little. Palmer pushed up to right wing, from where he continued to roam. Gusto swapped from left-back to right-back with orders to get forward. Chelsea created another big chance, Fernández pirouetting after a Palmer pass before teeing up Neto, who lifted wastefully over the crossbar. It was wonderful skill from Fernández.City pushed for a second. Haaland was denied by a Badiashile block; Bernardo Silva likewise by Jorrel Hato, who had also come off the bench. But Chelsea were never out of it. Delap spun Abdukodir Khusanov, who had replaced the injured Gvardiol, before working Donnarumma from a tight angle and it was not a surprise when his team got their reward. Fernández would disappear into the arms of the Chelsea fans on the front row of the away enclosure. The goal resonated just as loudly in north London.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Britcher’s two-run time was 1 minute, 23.840 seconds, while Schulte finished in 1:23.877 and Taubitz in 1:23.931.It was Britcher’s seventh career singles win, extending her all-time record for USA Luge sliders.“Very, very happy,” Britcher said after her third medal – two golds and a bronze – in three singles races this season. “I’ve had a lot of ups and downs here in Sigulda, but a long time ago it was like my favorite track and I really loved it. ... It was a lot of fun to feel that joy again on the track here.”Britcher has a chance to become the first American to win a World Cup overall singles crown. USA Luge has had four World Cup season-long champions – all in men’s doubles. Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer were the first and then Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin did it three times, the last of those coming in 2002-03.And – somewhat remarkably – Britcher leads the points standings despite missing a race. USA Luge skipped the season-opening World Cup competition in Winterberg, Germany, because it wasn’t factoring into the Olympic qualifying formula.View image in fullscreenSummer Britcher, center, celebrates with second place finisher Lisa Schulte of Austria, left, and third place finisher Julia Taubitz of Germany after Sunday’s event.Photograph: Toms Kalniņš/EPABritcher was third going into Sunday’s second heat; the singles races at Sigulda this weekend used the two-runs-over-two-days format, a bit of preparation for the two-day, four-run event at the Olympics.Schulte and Taubitz were the only sliders who had a chance to catch Britcher at the end. They came up short, which evidently caught Britcher by a bit of surprise.“I really did not think it was going to happen,” Britcher said. “I tried really hard to not think about the results. With the one run each day, you have so much time to think about possibilities, so I really was just thinking about, ‘OK, what do I need to do on the track?’ So, I think maybe I had a little anticlimactic smile at the end. I was so shocked.”Ashley Farquharson was fifth for the US in the women’s singles race. Emily Fischnaller, who was fourth entering the second heat, lost control toward the bottom of the track and came off her sled. She did not finish – but walked off appearing to have avoided injury.Britcher and Farquharson seem well on their way to formal nominations to the Olympic team by USA Luge. There are still multiple paths for Fischnaller to return to the Olympics as well; next weekend’s World Cup stop in Winterberg, Germany, likely will decide the fates for several sliders from many countries, including Fischnaller and US men’s singles veteran Tucker West.The Winterberg races are the last Olympic qualifying races of the season.The women’s singles win was one of two medals on the day for Britcher, who also helped USA Luge capture the bronze in the team relay.Schulte and Austria won the team relay, with host Latvia second and the American team of Britcher, Jonny Gustafson in men’s singles, Zach DiGregorio and Sean Hollander on the men’s doubles sled and Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby on the women’s doubles sled finishing third.In the men’s singles race, two-time Olympic singles champion Felix Loch of Germany got his 55th career win – two away from the all-time record of 57 held by retired Italian great Armin Zöggeler. Jonas Müller of Austria was second and Max Langenhan of Germany was third.USA Luge plans to announce its Olympic team around 12 January, and the US bobsled and skeleton teams for the Milan Cortina Games are expected to be unveiled on 19 January.At Winterberg, the host Germans swept a women’s bobsled race Sunday while Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of the US narrowly missed a medal spot.View image in fullscreenKaillie Humphries was narrowly denied the podium on Sunday at Winterberg.Photograph: Christopher Neundorf/EPALaura Nolte drove to the win for Germany, holding off teammates Lisa Buckwitz and Kim Kalicki.

Elana Meyers Taylor drove to eighth place for the US, and Kaysha Love crossed the line 10th.And in the four-man race later Sunday, the season of absolute dominance for Germany continued.Francesco Friedrich drove to the win, Johannes Lochner was second and Adam Ammour rallied in the second heat to finish third, giving Germany its eighth sweep in 10 World Cup two- and four-man races this season.Those three sleds were separated by a mere 0.06 seconds.The Germans now have 28 World Cup medals this season in men’s bobsled.

But Fury, who said he was bowing out of the sport afterbeating Dillian Whytein April 2022 only to return later in the year, posted on Instagram on Sunday: “2026 is that year. Return of the mac.“ Been away for a while but I’m back now, 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face and get paid for it.”Anthony Joshua issues first public update after fatal car crash in NigeriaRead moreFury’s history of retirement followed by a U-turn meant there was scepticism that he has permanently finished a career that had brought 34 wins in 37 fights and two stints as a world champion. He was incensed at the judges’ decisions in his twin defeats by Usyk, the only boxer to beat Fury, who said in last year’s retirement message: “I’m going to end with this: Dick Turpin wore a mask.”But the British boxer fuelled speculation of another comeback over the festive period by posting several clips on social media of himself in training. Despite insisting he had bowed out of the sport, Fury has been repeatedly linked with a long-awaited bout against Anthony Joshua, another former two-time world heavyweight champion.The pair agreed to a fight in August 2021 when they held all the major world titles between them, but that was scuppered when Fury was ordered to take on Deontay Wilder for a third time by an arbitration hearing.Plans were in the pipeline for Joshua and Fury to have tune-ups in the early part of this year before finally facing off against each other, either in late summer or towards the back end of 2026. However,the car crash in Nigerialast Monday, which left Joshua injured and led to the deaths of two close friends and team members, means the 36-year-old’s next move in the sport is unclear.If Joshua is unavailable, Fury could seek a trilogy fight against the WBC, WBA and IBF titlist Usyk or an all-British contest withthe WBO champion Fabio Wardley. A win over either would see Fury become a three-time world heavyweight champion.Explore more on these topicsTyson FuryBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

And today, how I saw her ski the first run, ah, I had to go 120% in order to have a shot. So, it was a big, big, amazing day for her.”Shiffrin was still satisfied with her own skiing and celebrated by pumping her fist after finishing her final run, when Rast was yet to start.“I had a really specific goal for my skiing for the second (run), a little bit technical thing, and I felt like I really accomplished that,” Shiffrin said.“This was the hardest I could push. I pushed so hard, it was like a small mistake here and a small mistake there and I don’t think that cost time. That was just how hard I was trying. I could feel these turns that I wanted to feel.”Sunday’s victory came one day after Rast earned her maiden giant slalom win on the same hill and dedicated that victory to the victims of the fire at a bar in Crans-Montana near her home town of Vétroz.“I gave everything I had this weekend. Double on the same weekend is quite amazing. I’m so happy,” Rast said, adding that “a lot of energy” was key to her triumph.“It was a little bit a battle, but I had a lot of fun. And the slope, wow, was amazing, The preparation was top.”‘Ghost resorts’: as hundreds of ski slopes lie abandoned, will nature reclaim the Alps?Read moreThe duo were far ahead of the rest of the field, with Rast’s teammate Wendy Holdener trailing by a massive 1.83 seconds in third for her first podium result in nearly a year.Shiffrin’s teammate Paula Moltzan in fourth was the only other racer finishing less than two seconds off the pace.Shiffrin, who took slalom gold at the 2014 Olympics and holds four world titles in the discipline, won the final race of last season before taking the first five slaloms in the current campaign and raise her career tally to 69 wins in slalom and 106 overall, both World Cup records.Defending slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutić of Croatia didn’t finish for the fourth time in six races this season.Italian prodigy Lara Colturi, competing for Albania, lost her balance and fell on the first run on a course set by her father and coach, Alessandro Colturi.

But given the fact Ruben Amorim selected a starting lineup with nine defensive-minded players and the visitors were facing a Leeds side nowon their longest unbeaten runin the Premier League since 2001, they will view this as a point gained.Angry Amorim tells Manchester United: ‘I’m here to be the manager, not the coach’Read moreThis latest instalment of this rivalry may have felt every inch as vitriolic and hostile as historical encounters in the stands – you only had to witness the reaction to the visitors’ team bus arriving at Elland Road – but it didn’t quite feel that way on it; there wasn’t quite the bite of those infamous matches of previous decades.That was ­evident at full time, as the  players from both sides embraced and debriefed each other after a fairly low-key and often low-quality contest.To that end, there was perhaps no ­surprise both goals came ­predominantly from mistakes with Brenden Aaronson opening the ­scoring just after the hour mark before Matheus Cunha levelled just three minutes later.Aaronson’s strike, a fine ­finish after Ayden Heaven misread a ­routine long ball over the top, had briefly given Leeds fans hope of a first league ­victory against their ­fiercest rivals since 2002. But Cunha’s ­finish, in which he caught the Leeds­goalkeeper, Lucas Perri, in no man’s land, gave the visitors a point they probably deserved.View image in fullscreenLeeds’ Dominic Calvert-Lewin falls over Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro behind him.Photograph: Chris Radburn/Action Images/ReutersAnd for both teams? It was likely to feel like one point gained rather than two dropped. For Amorim and ­Manchester United, it keeps them in touch with the Champions League scramble while for Leeds, they are now seven unbeaten and eight clear of the relegation zone afterWest Ham’s implosion at Wolveson Saturday.“I think we did well,” Amorim said. “We improved a lot of things ­compared to the last game. We ­controlled the hostility of the offence from Leeds.”Questions remain over what is happening at United off the field, with the flames fanned further by some remarkable post-match claims over a possible internal clash on transfer policy once again.But on an afternoon when there was little spark or drama on the field, he will likely view this as a decent enough point.As for Daniel Farke, his ­decision to switch to a 3-5-2 has been a ­masterstroke. But Leeds continue to look a side capable of pulling away from trouble, especially when you consider they were without the likes of Joe Rodon, Ethan Ampadu and Jayden Bogle, who have all been influential in their resurgence.View image in fullscreenBrenden Aaronson shoots to put Leeds ahead in the second half.Photograph: Alex Dodd/EPABut with similar shapes and Amorim starting so many defensive-minded players, there was perhaps no surprise the two sides cancelled each other out throughout a routine opening 45 minutes. Cunha thought he had opened the scoring before Benjamin Sesko was flagged offside in the buildup, and United’s only other chance was when Leny Yoro forced a save from Perri.At the other end, Dominic ­Calvert-Lewin’s glancing header struck the post but neither side had done enough to stir their ­supporters into life, or threaten to take control of proceedings. But after the break, things came to life – ignited fully by Aaronson’s ­wonderful finish after Heaven’s ­mishap allowed the American to break through on goal.Suddenly, Elland Road had come alive – but it had been stunned into silence once again three minutes later.Amorim called for Joshua ­Zirkzee immediately after that Leeds goal, and his threaded ball allowed Cunha to finish well and level the scores. Sesko, whose own travails in front of goal continued here, then struck a Zirkzee cross wide to continue his own barren spell.He is still struggling in ­adjusting to thePremier Leagueand while Amorim offered a firm defence of the Slovenian afterwards, two goals in 17 games is ­anything but a healthy return.Leeds’ best chance of a ­winner came when the substitute Joël Piroe curled an effort just over Senne ­Lammens’s crossbar but in truth, a goal for either side would have likely been harsh given the balance of play was so even.“I’m proud of my lads,” Farke reflected. “To face a side of the calibre of Man United, it’s difficult and ­everyone tells you it’s the most important game for Leeds.“So there’s lots of expectation and I’m very proud of the mentality of my players.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu was replaced by Katie Swan, who performed well against a much higher-ranked opponent before losing 7-6 (4), 6-1 to Osaka. In the decisive rubber, Neal Skupski and Olivia Nicholls used their doubles expertise to seal the tie with a 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 win over Nao Hibino and Yasutaka Uchiyama.The first week of the tennis season has done little to change public opinion of Britain’s top players, Draper and Raducanu, whose young careers have been filled with numerous physical problems.The duo were two of the earliest commitments for the United Cup, an exciting team that immediately established Britain as one of the tournament favourites, but once again Draper and Raducanu have instead had to manage their frail bodies.Draper wasforced to withdrawfrom the Australian swing as he continues to recover from bone bruising to his left arm, extending his absence to six months. Raducanu’s problems are less severe, but this foot injury has affected her for more than two months after she prematurely ended her 2025 season because of injury and illness in October.

She’s been practising in London, really only doing static drills, to be out on the practice court and moving and playing games. She is very close.“In terms of [Monday], it’s still a little bit up in the air. We’re kind of forced to put Emma on the list because if we didn’t do that, then that only gives us one option. When we get back tonight, we’ll discuss it as a team.”The 23-year-old was present all day inside the RAC Arena, loudly cheering and offering her colleagues advice on the Great Britain team from her bench alongside her coach, Francisco Roig.Before Swan took to the court, Raducanu struck a hopeful tone. “At the end of the day, it’s a team event and Katie’s playing great so it gives me an extra day, so looking forward to this match,” she said.The absence of the top British men’s and women’s players represented an opportunity for the remainder of the GB team, and they took it admirably. Harris, the men’s No 128, only learned that he would be taking Draper’s place in this event on Christmas Eve, less than a week before most players began to travel to Perth. Last year, he also replaced an injured Draper at the United Cup, performing well against higher-ranked opponents but losing all three matches.Tom Jenkins’s best sport photographs of 2025Read moreThis time, Harris took advantage of a winnable matchup to secure his first victory in the competition, overpowering the world No 99, Mochizuki, with his superior serve and forehand. Swan, ranked 260 ranking spots below Osaka at No 276, played a strong first set and led 5-3 before the four-time grand slam champion found her form and took control to level the match.In the decisive rubber, Nicholls and Skupski held their nerve in the final stages of a tense final-set tie-break to seal the victory. “We tried to stay positive, stay together, keep the communication high,” said Skupski. “We had great support from the bench. That’s kind of what I think got us over the line.”Great Britain will face Greece next for a guaranteed spot in the quarter-finals. The Greek team, which easily defeated Japan on Friday, is led by the former top-three players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The 40-year-old is believed to have been informed of this on the authority of Wilcox, who reports to Omar Berrada, the chief executive.Amorim took over United in November 2024. While Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who leads United’s football policy, previously stated Amorim should be given three years to prove his worth, it is understood there are now reservations within the hierarchy regarding the Portuguese.Matheus Cunha earns Manchester United point as Leeds keep up unbeaten runRead moreThese concerns were in place before his public outburst on Sunday after the1-1 draw against Leeds, when he insisted he is United’s manager, not just the coach, and said that he may “move on” when his contract runs out in 18 months.These earlier misgivings were underlined by the Guardian reporting in mid-December areluctance to sell Kobbie Mainoo, who is out of favour under Amorim. The 20-year-old midfielder, who is currently injured, is yet to start in the Premier League this season but the hierarchy believe Mainoo could convince Amorim – or a future United head coach – he is worth a regular place.On Friday Amorim refused to clarify previous comments he made on Christmas Eve. Then he said: “I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen.”Asked if this was because he had been informed of a change in budget or if Wilcox had spoken to him, Amorim said: “I don’t want to talk about that … You are very smart.”Amorim is considered at United to be temperamental, making his position unclear. Although the head coach stated after the Leeds match he would not resign, whether Amorim remains in place is yet to be decided. As Berrada’s appointment, Wilcox is thought to have the greater support from the chief executive.Amorim further inflamed the situation on Sunday with his impassioned press conference at Elland Road, in which the Portuguese also pointedly told the scouting department and sporting director “to do their job”.“I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,” he said after Matheus Cunha’s goal cancelled out Brenden Aaronson’s opener, keeping United sixth in the table. “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United – not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear. I know my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, [José] Mourinho or [Antonio] Conte but I’m the manager.“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit, I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”When asked about transfer policy, he said: “Every department, the scouting department, the sporting director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.” He added: “If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club”, before abruptly ending the press conference.The 40-year-old’s official job title is, in fact, head coach. It has also been reported that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, has questioned his tactics.Additional reporting by Aaron BowerExplore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimLeeds UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The former Hull City manager was accompanied by ­Strasbourg’s president, Marc Keller, and sporting director, David Weir.Chelsea’s board and sporting directors are big fans of Rosenior. It remains to be seen if he is installed in time for the Premier League side’s trip to Fulham on Wednesday.

The Brazilian also played for the club.BlueCo are keen to find a quality replacement for Rosenior at Strasbourg. Filipe Coelho and Jean-Marc Kuentz are expected to take interim charge.

Certainly there was little reaction when the ball came back to the Fulham substitute with 97 ­minutes gone.Liverpool­simply stood off, almost daring Reed to shoot, and they rued their lack of urgency when one of Fulham’s more unfashionable ­players rescued a point for Marco ­Silva’s ­stubborn side by ­ripping a stunning shot into ­Alisson’s top corner.It was a jawdropping moment – after all, it was only the scurrying 30-year-old midfielder’s fourth goal in six years in west London – and it spoke to some of Liverpool’s issues this season. The champions were vague in attack despite scoring twice and, where once there was the determination to force themselves over the line, here there was only defensive inertia when the task was to hold on after going 2-1 up through Cody Gakpo in the fourth minute of ­stoppage time.Manchester City v Chelsea: Premier League – liveRead moreThe problem is this was no one-off. Liverpool, who missed a chance to tighten their grip on fourth place after a second consecutive draw, were similarly chaotic when leading against Tottenham’s 10 men last month and it is not lost on Arne Slot that his side’s inability to manage games has become a trend.“If you are not part of Liverpool then you think you have won it [at 2-1],” the head coach said. “But I am used to it.” Slot felt that his side ­controlled the game. Dwelling on the equaliser, he argued that Liverpool had only dropped so deep because they anticipatedFulhamhurling a long throw into the area. Still, though, he acknowledged that there had to be a reaction when Fulham went short. Instead, Reed was left in acres of space and when the goal was played back it was hard not to linger on the image of Virgil van Dijk failing to get out in time to block the shot.It had been another jittery performance from Van Dijk at the heart of a defence where Ibrahima Konaté also toiled. Raúl Jiménez troubled Liverpool’s centre-backs and was the brains behind Fulham’s opener. The striker sent Harry Wilson through and the former Liverpool academy player collected his sixth goal of the season.Liverpool were poor during the first half. They lacked inspiration with Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitiké missing and benefited from a curious video assistant referee decision ruling Florian Wirtz’s equaliser onside when it seemed the £116m German had strayed just beyond Issa Diop before making it 1-1 early in the second half. “I was sure it was offside,” Wirtz said of his second goal in three games. “I didn’t even celebrate.”Gakpo certainly did when he ­fastened on to a cross from the ­substitute Jeremie Frimpong to nudge ­Liverpool ahead in the dying stages. Yet this was not a flowing performance. Ekitiké’s absence with a hamstring injury forced Liverpool to contend without £194m of forward talent, leaving Slot to field a team with only 12 league goals between them at the start of play.View image in fullscreenHarrison Reed (right) watches as his long-range shot flies past Alisson.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSlot adjusted by using Gakpo as a central striker, with Curtis Jones, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wirtz offering support, but the ploy proved ­ineffective for much of a tepid first half. Shorn of natural width with Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Liverpool were predictable.“The first half was good,” Silva said of Fulham’s efforts. “We blocked almost everything.” Fulham switched to a back five, gave up possession and made the most of very little in the 17th minute. Jiménez provided the spark by catching Liverpool out with a beautiful flick. Conor Bradley and Konaté were dozing on the right and Wilson, who was played onside by Van Dijk and Milos Kerkez, ran through to score with a brilliant low shot.Liverpool’s best moments before half-time came from Gakpo. He scuffed badly wide at 0-0 and later headed against a post but more urgency was required. Liverpool pushed after the break and Alexis Mac Allister headed against the bar.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo puts Liverpool ahead in stoppage time.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersLiverpool’s mentality had transformed. There was more urgency to the press and Bradley stepped in to win possession. Fulham backtracked and allowed the right-back to poke the ball through to Wirtz, who curled past Bernd Leno.Controversy followed. The flag went up but there was surprise when a lengthy review ended with the goal being awarded. The official explanation? Thicker lines are being used to assess offsides this season and more benefit of the doubt is being given to attackers. Liverpool were grateful for the help. It became more open. Gakpo shot wide before a mix-up led to Wilson hitting the bar. Tension grew; Gakpo made it 2-1.But Fulham have scored crucial late goals in each of their past three games. They have lost key players to Afcon but they keep going. When Reed came on he was making only his seventh appearance of the season. It was the most memorable of cameos.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Having taken the lead in the first half through Ben Davies, Spurs had chances to go further ahead before being pegged back by Brian Brobbey’s 80th-minute equaliser when the visitors looked the more likely to go on to win it.An injury to Mohammed Kudus, who was forced off before the 20th minute with a muscle problem, comes after Frank’s forward options were weakened by the sale of Johnson to Crystal Palace for £35m. Without the suspended Xavi Simons, serving the last of his three-match ban, they lacked, in Frank’s words, “a cutting edge”.“The big headline is: we didn’t score the 2-0 goal,” Frank said. “The first half was very good, I think we were totally dominant. Second half, not as dominant but we still had some good counterattack situations where we need to get more out of it. You can’t rely on, in thePremier League, just to win 1-0.”Fulham v Liverpool, Newcastle v Crystal Palace, Afcon last 16 and more: clockwatch – liveRead moreThe 21-year-old Dane Scarlett, who came on in the 88th minute, was the only forward Frank could call upon from his bench when his team needed a boost in the second half. “We lacked a little extra freshness,” Frank said. “I look at some teams last night that just put three players on like-for-like and then they run away with the win – a club we can’t speak about [Arsenal]. That would have helped us.”With Tottenham’s bluntness up front and the albeit unforeseen injury to Kudus, the sale of Johnson to Palace looks especially ill-timed. “Sometimes the decisions make more sense further down the line,” Frank said. “Now there was an opportunity to sell a player, which the club hasn’t been that good at in the past, and sometimes that window can be small if you want to do that.”As for Sunderland, they were still missing six players at the Africa Cup of Nations and named the same team that started the draw – one of four in a row now –against Manchester Cityon Thursday. Régis Le Bris, the manager, continues to prove himself as a shrewd tactician and Enzo Le Fée was a key factor in their second-half revival.Up until Kudus went off, Spurs had looked bright. Mathys Tel went close when his bending shot went just wide of the far post, while Richarlison could not connect with an acrobatic effort.Sunderlandaccepted their role as frustraters and Granit Xhaka relished his casting as the pantomime villain. The former Arsenal captain could only see the funny side when he slipped on his way to taking a corner, much to the delight of the home crowd.Spurs found the breakthrough at a corner of their own. Wilson Odobert’s delivery was taken down by Cristian Romero at the back post and, with Sunderland standing stock still, he had time to lift his head and cut the ball back to his defensive partner, Micky van de Ven, whose shot was prodded in by Davies. It was the Welshman’s first club goal in over two years.View image in fullscreenBen Davies scrambles home the opening goal of the game for Spurs.Photograph: Anthony Hanc/ShutterstockSunderland came out re-energised after the break and Spurs looked nervy under the first bit of pressure. “Just 1-0 down, it was possible to switch on,” Le Bris said. Romero scuffed a back pass well short and Brobbey played a one-two with Eliezer Mayenda before hitting the side netting with a powerful strike that took a nick on the way.The visitors’ new sense of adventure left them vulnerable at the back. When Spurs found themselves three-on-two on a breakaway, Richarlison’s pass was cut out before it reached a target in the middle. Members of the Spurs coaching team were then up in arms when Randal Kolo Muani’s loose touch squandered a dangerous counterattack after Pedro Porro had driven forward.Le Bris agreed with Frank’s estimation that Spurs should have been out of sight: “Probably we are a bit lucky because in a Premier League game, when you don’t play at your best, you should be punished and it wasn’t the case … They were not clinical, which was a good thing for us.” Playing in a more advanced position, Le Fée grew in influence, hitting the foot of a post with a header from Nordi Mukiele’s cross with 10 minutes to go. Moments later, he created the equaliser. The Sunderland move was slick, Le Fée and Brobbey combining on the edge of the box before the latter rifled his first-time shot past Guglielmo Vicario into the far corner.Now on 30 points, Le Bris reiterated that Sunderland’s first target is 40 and survival, despite their lofty position of eighth in the table. Frank and Spurs will see it was two more points dropped as they remain in the bottom half.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The same will be true ofBrentfordthemselves should this emphatic victory herald the end of their troubled away form.Fulham v Liverpool, Spurs 1-1 Sunderland, Afcon last 16 and more: clockwatch – liveRead moreOnly Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé and Harry Kane have scored more goals than the Brazilian across Europe’s top five leagues after he reached 14 for the season at Hill Dickinson Stadium.Only Wolves and Burnley have lost more away games in thePremier Leaguethis campaign than Andrews’s team but Brentford’s previous results on the road defied comprehension on this evidence. The visitors were commanding and fully deserving of only their third away win of the season. Everton were dreadful, the perfect tonic for a visiting team in search of confidence, and repeatedly punished by the unstoppable Thiago.“His finishes were outstanding,” Andrews said. “Really clinical, calm and confident. The names you’ve just mentioned [Haaland, Mbappé and Kane], he’s obviously in some pretty esteemed company there but he’s earned it. He was injured for a lot of last season. He is such a popular player among our group and a special person who deserves everything he gets because he works so hard and is so unselfish. He leaves everything out there.”The atmosphere in the stadium was flat before kick-off and David Moyes’s side mirrored the mood. The hosts started brightly, in fairness. Dwight McNeil forced the former Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher into a good save from a Jack Grealish layoff and, from the resulting corner, James Tarkowski’s goalbound header was cleared on the line by Thiago.That was in the fourth minute.Evertondid not threaten again until the fifth minute of time added on in the first half for a head injury to Kristoffer Ajer. Absences undoubtedly played a part in the lack of creativity from the home team, although did not stop Everton from winning at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, but the contributions from Tyler Dibling and McNeil were nonexistent. The defensive resilience on show at the City Ground vanished too.Brentford, by contrast, were composed, well structured and threatened repeatedly. With more precision in the final ball the visitors could have been out of sight before half-time. That security came six minutes into the second half.View image in fullscreenBeto (left) scored his first goal since August, but it did not inspire an Everton comeback.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersEverton could not handle the strength and movement of Thiago but he did not have to work hard for his opening goal. The hosts switched off after the Brentford forward Kevin Schade went down looking for a foul and Tarkowski played a careless ball straight to Vitaly Janelt. The midfielder swept a first-time cross behind Michael Keane for the unmarked Thiago to guide into the bottom corner.Schade should have doubled Brentford’s lead from a similar chance when Grealish squandered possession on the right, but placed his shot from Mikkel Damsgaard’s cross straight at Jordan Pickford. The Everton goalkeeper denied Thiago a second with a fine save after the striker had been slipped in by Mathias Jensen.Igor Thiago: from bricklaying to Brugge, Brentford … and maybe BrazilRead moreMoyes’s side briefly flickered again when Grealish beat Michael Kayode and crossed for Thierno Barry, who steered a diving header – or shoulder – at Kelleher’s legs. The Everton manager had seen enough and replaced Dibling and McNeil at half-time with Beto and Merlin Röhl. Dibling was Everton’s most expensive summer signing at £35m and his continued struggles must be a concern to Moyes. Brentford gave him more problems.Everton’s hopes of second-half improvement were quickly extinguished with two goals in the space of 95 seconds. After 95 corners without a goal this season, Brentford broke their duck at the 96th attempt when their captain, Nathan Collins, ghosted across the six-yard area and headed Janelt’s delivery beyond Pickford. Shortly after the restart Tim Iroegbunam lost possession and Jensen, having nutmegged Keane, carved open the Everton defence with a delightful ball into Schade. The German forward held the ball up inside the box for Thiago to clip a cool finish past Pickford, a trick he would repeat for the hat-trick.Everton improved at 3-0 down – they could hardly get any worse – and Beto glanced home a fine header from Grealish’s left-wing cross. In pushing for an unlikely comeback Moyes’s side left themselves exposed to the counterattack repeatedly and were finally punished when Röhl scuffed an attempted cross straight to Collins. The defender sent Thiago running clear from inside his own half and, with the certainty of a striker at the top of his game, the Brazilian flicked another nonchalant finish beyond Pickford.Barry’s stoppage-time consolation from Grealish’s inviting cross ensured the final scoreline flattered Everton. “We don’t concede four goals too often and we conceded them in a really shabby manner,” Moyes said. “If you compare how we defended in midweek to today it just doesn’t stack up.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With the exception of Thiaw, Guimarães and Lewis Miley, a 19-year-old midfielder once again outstanding out of position at right back, not too many home players were at their best.If Miley suggested it will not be that long before this Newcastle team is built around his elegant vision and stellar passing range, Anthony ­Gordon once again disappointed on the left. It was no coincidence that Howe’s side improved considerably once the England winger was replaced by the catalytic Harvey Barnes in the 63rd minute.“It was a tough game, a bit bitty at times,” said Newcastle’s manager whose team rose to ninth, only five points behind fourth-placed Liverpool. “It was very, very difficult for us to control, there were nerves in the stadium and we had to be patient. But today was a big step forward for us.” It was also rather untidy. Admittedly, there were minor early highlights; Henderson acrobatically tipped Fabian Schär’s header over the crossbar and Yoane Wissa selflessly slid a square pass for Gordon to tap home before a VAR review detected Wissa had been fractionally offside.Generally though, Palace proved reasonably resistant to the attacking pace of Gordon and Wissa, and might even have opened the scoring had Thiaw’s tremendous interception not prevented Yeremy Pino from making the most of Adam Wharton’s excellent, potentially goal-creating pass.Shortly after an offside Joelinton had swept a shot into Henderson’s net in the wake of one of Schär’s trademark long, lofted passes, Jean-Philippe Mateta curved a shot ­narrowly wide.That chance had arrived when, with the atmosphere inside the stadium strangely flat, ­­­­Brennan ­Johnson, newly arrived at Palace from Tottenhamin a club-record £35m deal, dodged past Lewis Hall.View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson was thrown straight into Palace’s starting lineup after his move to the club from Tottenham.Photograph: Craig Cowan/ProSports/ShutterstockAlthough Nick Pope was not required to make a single first-half save, Howe’s players rode their luck a little.A disbelieving Glasner screamed “Oh no; oh my goodness” after Will Hughes and Pino played a slick ­one-two only for the former to ­somehow drag an extremely presentable chance wide. Small wonder a crestfallen Hughes walked towards the tunnel at the interval muttering to himself and shaking his head. “We missed a big chance there,” reflected Palace’s manager.Matheus Cunha earns Manchester United point as Leeds keep up unbeaten runRead moreA big part of Newcastle’s failure to assert any sort of real control had stemmed from a midfield ­department where an ultimately withdrawn Sandro Tonali was left limping in the wake of a wince-inducing early challenge from Maxence Lacroix. As a streetwise Palace slowed the play at every opportunity, even Guimarães took a little time to properly get going.Nonetheless, as the second half unfolded and the game became increasingly open, only some fine defending from Marc Guéhi – once a defender on the very top of Howe’s shopping list – helped keep the score goalless as growing frustration ­rippled down from the stands.Palace were succeeding in fraying the bond between Howe’s players and their increasingly disgruntled fans, who seemed unimpressed as ­Wharton’s fine pass left Pope to repel Johnson’s shot. Things felt fragile but the mood became instantly more upbeat when Guimarães headed Newcastle into the lead from close range after Jacob Murphy’s free kick, Barnes’s cross and Miley’s cushioned cutback.Shortly afterwards, Thiaw secured the three points that left ­Palace’s manager ruing his team’s dead-ball inadequacies.“It was a disappointing defeat,” said Glasner. “It was a good ­performance but we can’t afford to give away so many goals from set plays. It’s not acceptable. I have to find ­solutions. Set pieces are the ­reason we lost today. They’ve cost us in five of our last six defeats. We have to get it sorted.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Thibaut Courtois produced saves to deny Rodrigo Riquelme and blocked a shot from Antony to preserve Madrid’s two-goal cushion.García completed his hat-trick in the 82nd minute with a superb backheel finish from Arda Guler’s pass, before Fran García rounded off the rout in stoppage time by converting Valverde’s cross. The win was Madrid’s third in a row in the league and keeps the pressure on their title rivals.“It’s a great way to start the year … my first hat-trick at the Bernabéu,” García said. “Mbappé is currently the best player in the world, he gives us a lot with his goals. I have the best players in the world in front of me. I think about myself, I work hard every day and I make the most of every minute the manager gives me.”Atlético Madridwere held to an entertaining 1-1 draw atReal Sociedad, with Gonçalo Guedes cancelling out Alexander Sørloth’s opener for the visitors in a five-minute spell after the break at Anoeta Stadium.Sevillaslipped to a 3-0 home defeat against strugglingLevante.

The east London club are at increasing risk of relegation from the Premier League after their3-0 defeat by Wolveson Saturday and it is understood that the mood at the London Stadium is rapidly deteriorating.Nuno has struggled badly since replacing Graham Potter in September, winning only two of his 15 games in charge, and is under growing pressure before Tuesday’s crunch game against his former side Nottingham Forest. The indications are that West Ham, who are in 18th place and lie four points below Forest, will stick with their manager but his methods are coming under increased scrutiny.Nuno Espírito Santo apologises to West Ham fans for ‘embarrassing’ Wolves defeatRead moreMultiple sources with knowledge of the situation have described Nuno as distant and uncommunicative on a day-to-day basis, while it is understood that there is frustration over confusing training methods and team selections. Morale is slipping and what is perceived as a lack of clear communication has left some players feeling that they have no way of forcing their way into the Portuguese’s plans.Some members of the squad feel alienated and it is understood that some key individuals believe they have been played out of position in certain games.There was confusion when Nuno played full-backs on the wrong side and started without a recognised forward in damaging defeats by Leeds and Brentford in October. Eyebrows have been raised at how West Ham have faded after making defensive substitutions in subsequent games. Alarm at how the team’s performance metrics have been going down has been rising for some time. It meant the wretched performance against Wolves, who had not won a league game all season, came as little surprise. Sources claim that Nuno, who cut a dispirited figure on the touchline, said little to rouse his players when they found themselves 3-0 down at half-time.Multiple sources have said that Nuno, who was sacked by Forest in September, has barely spoken to some players since joining the club. Another bone of contention is the experienced midfielder James Ward-Prowse being sidelined by Nuno. The 31-year-old has not been involved in any matchday squads since the former Wolves manager’s appointment. The midfielder had a loan spell cut short when he was with Nuno at Forest last season.View image in fullscreenWest Ham struggled in a 3-0 defeat by the league’s bottom club Wolves.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockWest Ham’s board remain reluctant to make their second sacking of a disastrous season. They have tried to back Nuno in the transfer market and have agreed to his decisions on signings. They have boosted their attack bysigning Pablo from Gil Vicentefor £18.3m plus £2.6m in add-ons and are set to buy Taty Castellanos from Lazio for £26.1m. Adama Traoré, who played for Nuno at Wolves, is expected to join from Fulham for £7m. The wider context to Nuno’s struggles is that he has inherited a deeply flawed squad and has joined a club whose owners have faced multiple protests from unhappy supporters.Pablo is represented by Jorge Mendes, Nuno’s agent. The 22-year-old is seen as a bright prospect. However, he had a hamstring injury in December and was an unused substitute against Wolves, even though West Ham were in desperate need of attacking inspiration. It remains to be seen if Pablo is physically ready to make an immediate impact in English football.Yet the fact that West Ham’s recruitment is being led by Nuno’s requests is seen as a sign that the club are not about to make an imminent change.Slaven Bilic, a former West Ham manager, has been linked with a possible return should Nuno depart before the end of the season. West Ham were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The MKM Stadium clash was one of three second-tier fixtures to fall by the wayside due to frozen pitches, while 14 games across Leagues One and Two were also postponed.Championship roundup: leaders Coventry slip up again in thriller at BirminghamRead moreHull said in a statement that the postponement was “agreed by all parties”, butWatfordinsisted they had been prepared to play the game and that the decision was made without their consent.“We reiterate we were ready and willing to play after the pitch was passed fit by the referee,” Watford said in a statement. “We remain disappointed by the decision to postpone and by how the decision was reached. We did not agree to the postponement.”In an earlier post on X, the club said: “While player safety is paramount, we are really disappointed the game has been postponed as we were ready to play. The decision to postpone the fixture so close to kick-off is regrettable and we fully share the frustration of our supporters.”Hull’s statement said: “While the pitch was playable and had been passed by the referee, areas immediately surrounding the playing surface were deemed unsafe and the decision to postpone the game was agreed by all parties.“We fully understand the frustration of supporters regarding the timing of the decision,” the statement continued. “Every effort was made to fulfil the fixture, and we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment caused.”Quick GuideEFL games hit by freezing weatherShowChampionshipHull City v WatfordPortsmouth v IpswichSheffield United v OxfordLeague OneDoncaster v LutonPort Vale v BarnsleyRotherham v MansfieldStevenage v Leyton OrientLeague TwoBarnet v CreweBarrow v Bristol RoversBromley v OldhamCambridge v GrimsbyColchester v AccringtonHarrogate v SwindonNewport v TranmereNotts County v GillinghamSalford v ShrewsburyWalsall v FleetwoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sheffield United’s Championship meeting with Oxford United and Portsmouth’s clash with Ipswich at Fratton Park were also called off.

Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead more“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.Describing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”This month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead moreLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.The institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.However, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.Dalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit moreslowly than manufacturers had expected.However, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.The UK went through a“dash for diesel”cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.However, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking offthe “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers wereresponsible for thousands of deathsand cases of asthma.Sales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.Battery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.Graph showing that electric cars will overtake diesel ones on roads in Great Britain by 2030Nevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.London is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because ofthe ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.View image in fullscreenThe ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) applies charges to more polluting non-compliant cars.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”However, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.The report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.Matt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAir pollutionPollutionGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingTravel and transportShareReuse this content"

The choice underlined the fact that while AI is being widely embraced, not least by corporate bosses keen to cut payroll costs, its downsides are also becoming obvious. In 2026, a reckoning with reality for AI represents a growing economic risk.Ed Zitron, the foul-mouthed figurehead of AI scepticism, argues pretty convincingly that, as things stand, the “unit economics” of the entire industry – the cost of servicing the requests of a single customer against the price companies are able to charge them –just don’t add up. In typically colourful language, he calls them “dogshit”.Revenues from AI are rising rapidly as more paying clients sign up but so far not by enough to cover the wild levels of investment under way: $400bn (£297bn) in 2025, with much more forecast in the next 12 months.Another vehement sceptic, Cory Doctorow, argues: “These companies are not profitable. They can’t be profitable. They keep the lights on by soaking up hundreds of billions of dollars in other people’s money and then lighting it on fire.”It’s not new for frontier businesses to be loss-making, sometimes for years. But moving into profitability tends to happen as costs fall. Each iteration of large language models (LLMs) has so far tended to be more expensive, burning up more data, energy and highly paid tech experts’ time.The vast datacentres required to train and run the models are so expensive to build and kit out that in many cases they are financed by debt, secured against future revenue.Recent analysis by Bloombergsuggested there had been $178.5bn of these datacentre credit deals in 2025 alone, with inexperienced new operators joining Wall Street firms in a “gold rush”.Yet the precious Nvidia chips with which the datacentres are equipped have a limited shelf life, potentially shorter than that of the loan agreements.As well as leverage – borrowing – the boom increasingly involves another bubble indicator: financial engineering, including the kinds ofcomplex, circular funding arrangementsthat carry ominous echoes of past corporate crashes.Believing generative AI will eventually produce enough revenue to match the colossal sums invested, relies – as in all bubbles – on telling big, dramatic stories about the scale of the transformation under way.So LLMs are not just brilliant tools for analysing and synthesising large amounts of information. They’re fast approaching “superintelligence”, as OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has it; or about toreplace human friendships, according to Mark Zuckerberg.They certainly do seem to be replacing some unfortunate human employees in specific sectors. Brian Merchant, the author of Blood in the Machine, which compares the backlash against big tech to the Luddite rebellion of the 19th century,has assembled scores of first-hand testimoniesfrom writers, coders and marketers laid off in favour of AI-generated outputs.Yet many of them highlight the bland quality of the work being produced by their digital replacements, or worse, the risks at play when sensitive tasks are shifted outside human control.Indeed, the dangers of charging headlong into replacing human workers wholesale have become increasingly apparent in recent months.In the UK, the high courtissued a warning about lawyers’ use of AIafter two cases in which examples of completely fictitious case law were cited.Police officers in Heber City, Utah, learned tomanually check the work of a transcription toolthey were using to draft write-ups from bodycam footage after it mistakenly claimed an officer had turned into a frog. Disney’s The Princess and the Frog was playing in the background.Specific examples such as these fail to take into account the costs of what Merchant calls the “slop layer” of AI-generated content coursing through every online space, making it harder to identify what is real or true.Doctorow argues: “AI isn’t the bow-wave of ‘impending superintelligence’. Nor is it going to deliver ‘humanlike intelligence’. It’s a grab-bag of useful (sometimes very useful) tools that can sometimes make workers’ lives better, when workers get to decide how and when they’re used.”From the AI bubble to Fed fears: the global economic outlook for 2026Read moreThought of in this way, these technologies may still have significant productivity benefits, but perhaps not quite significant enough to justify today’s toppy valuations and the tsunami of investment under way.Any rethink would cause chaos on financial markets. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)recently pointed out, the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks now account for 35% of the S&P500, up from 20% three years ago.A share price correction would have real-world consequences far beyond Silicon Valley, rippling out to hit retail investors on both sides of the Atlantic, Asian tech exporters and the lenders, including loosely regulated private equity firms, that bankrolled the sector’s expansion.In the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimatedin its budget forecasts, that a “global correction” scenario, in which UK and world stock prices fell 35% in the coming year, would knock 0.6% off the country’s GDP and cause a £16bn deterioration in the public finances.That would be relatively manageable compared with the 2008 global financial crisis, in which UK institutions were leading players. But it would still be keenly felt in an economy struggling to find its feet.So while it is perhaps understandable to anticipate a frisson of schadenfreude at the thought of big tech’s super-rich boss class being humbled, we’re all living in their world, and we would not escape the consequences.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Economics viewpointEconomicsGlobal economyComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a place where someone I know, who finds speaking nearly impossible due to physical challenges, can be fluent, authoritative and, most importantly, properly listened to at last. And that’s just one example. It’s not for me or anyone else to take that away. I actually hate web 2.0 with a passion and for any number of reasons, but I can’t refute this point, nor would I seek to.AsureaHonestly, without the internet I would be isolated and alone. I have a conservative family and am in the closet and queer and trans. With the internet my world finally expanded and I finally became free. I learned about myself and became happy and at peace. I met my most important person after a lifetime of difficulty connecting to people and I found things I loved that changed me. The internet has done a lot of harm, yes, but it’s not black and white and has been a lifeline for queer and disabled folk such as myself. I am so grateful for the connection and friendship I found thanks to the internet.Kati777The internet itself is a magnificent technological achievement, not a moral failure. It has democratised access to knowledge, lowered barriers to publishing, connected marginal voices and transformed education, science and culture in ways that are hard to overstate.The problem is not “the internet” so much as the concentration of power in a handful of social media platforms that algorithmically amplify outrage, misinformation and fringe belief while disclaiming responsibility for the consequences.Most of the damage could be addressed by treating these companies as accountable intermediaries rather than neutral pipes: enforcing transparency around amplification, meaningful liability for harm, and standards closer to those long applied to publishers and broadcasters.Rolling back to landlines and letters would mean losing real, hard-won freedoms. The challenge is not to abandon the online world, but to civilise it.littlewasterPlease God yes. However nice and convenient it is to book a train ticket or transfer money from my bank account, none of it compensates for the breakdown in society which is occurring because of what is now a malignant online world.Kirsty McNally, by emailI don’t know anybody who thinks society has improved in the last 30 years. I miss how fun and open-minded we used to be, and I miss being engaged with the real world, in all my time awake on this planet. Is there any chance of this actually happening? I hope so.Peter Rizzo, by emailShould we turn radio off? Should we turn newspapers off? Should we turn the printing press off? And books? Should we turn off writing on paper and drawing on cave walls? These questions were probably all raised by someone, not very long after those respective inventions escaped the control of their inventors. Each time, the previous elite lost control to the masses over information and discourse, history keeps repeating.Randomusername222No. We would miss that which is a deeply embedded and nearly indispensable need of humanity – connection. The internet allows us to quickly engage with other humans (around the planet!), which could be a lifesaver for those of us who cannot find community and acceptance in our immediate surroundings.In being able to share our experiences we can galvanise opinion to push for change (I’m thinking of the murder of George Floyd and following outrage, and also that in an era before the internet, it was through the sharing of images of brutalised peaceful protesters for racial equality in the American south that the country was shamed into reform).The internet enables sharing in a way unprecedented in human existence; it is this ability to join minds and hearts, sometimes across all known and artificial divisions that helps us find ourselves as individuals and communities, nations, and maybe one day as a planet.Henry Thorpe, by emailView image in fullscreenHappier days or a time of limited contact?Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockThe internet is a communication medium, it is not the communication itself.

There was no long-lost golden age.DopFnordMy job in IT heavily depends on it. Outside my job, I’ve deleted all social media apps from my phone. It’s been quite a liberating experience. That whole realm has been hijacked and I find it worrying how many people use it as their primary source of news and information. Thankfully this paper seems to be one of the few places of resistance.AyJayEmObviously it’s far too late to put the genie back in the lamp (perhaps a more accurate metaphor would be to unwet the mogwai), but I often find myself wishing we could roll things back to just before the invention of the smartphone. That way, we’d still have most of the benefits of the internet, but it would be contained within a bulky device that lived in the corner of a room in our homes and on our desks at work. We’d be able to turn our backs on it whenever we left the house or office, and we wouldn’t be obliged to carry it with us all the time (I know in most cases we’re not “obliged” to carry smartphones with us, but it takes tremendous strength of will to swim against the tide all the time, not to mention how difficult many organisations make it to do things offline).To me, that seems like a pretty good balance between enjoying the advantages of the internet while preserving those priceless and eminently human aspects of our lives that the internet has done a great deal to damage, if not outright destroyed.SignedUpToWriteThisThe best option is to use the internet in moderation and never to switch off your brain.willemijnheidemanThere is nothing on the internet that does not leave a digital footprint. Governments could so simply make “social media” responsible for the accuracy of what they publish, in the same way that a newspaper is responsible. If they can be sued, they will control the crazy people spouting lies. Make them responsible. Sanction their owners. China and Russia control the internet. It can be done.CynicalGeorgeIf anything, this article and comments has shown me that a huge amount of Guardian readers don’t know what the internet is or what aspects of modern life would be affected by “turning it off” (nearly everything, most likely from the power grid on up).unhelpfulThe question poses “the internet” as both the root cause of that which ails modern society and as the antithesis of liberalism and human freedom. This is, of course, leading the witness. The internet is not designed to respect geographical borders. Its technology is not free of political bias, though having been devised in the US that bias is towards the modern western conceptions of freedom that the writer holds in such high regard.The former GDR (East Germany) managed breathtaking levels of landline tapping and turning family members against one another. Conversations were frequently recorded. I do not see how a return to exclusively in-person contact, cassette tapes and landlines would intrinsically benefit those of us who value freedom.The internet is designed to be flexible, scalable and open at distance. The openness that doesn’t respect traditional notions of borders is the same openness that allows states to use marvellous technologies against their own populations, because here’s what governments understand: people want to feel connected to one another, those connections can threaten thestatus quo,ergothose connections need to be coralled and controlled.People and organisations campaigning for freedom have long gathered and communicated using the internet, predating by many years the modern “walled gardens” of social media. Those voices are still here and there and everywhere. Perhaps, if you step away from the noise of everyone shouting into the void, you’ll be able to discern them talking about running the world in a different way.DorkaliciousI have mobility issues, yet I’ve managed to do all my Christmas present shopping without leaving the house.

Not everything is a social media swamp, something we can choose to engage with, or not.The internet is still in its infancy, so we’re at the proverbial wild west stage of its development with a host of crazies, carpetbaggers, extremists and entrepreneurs allowed pretty free rein, so it can be grim. Governments and political campaigners have both tried to exploit this “freedom” and also failed to manage it, partly because they don’t understand it, so it’s a bit of a cesspool.Add the likes of all the tech bros, and it gets even worse.Not all bad though. Enshittification is now well recognised and people are getting pissed off with it. The days when everyone believed what they read are going fast, too, ironically hastened by the growth of AI slop and the likes of Trump and Musk. There’s more open criticism of such slop, and a lot more questioning of what’s the truth and what propaganda. The platforms are run by wealthy rightwingers but even now, much of the discussion is about obvious propaganda, fake AI-generated shopfronts and content. I believe social media has started to lose its attraction for many people, with people posting and engaging less.Almost half of young people would prefer a world without internet, UK study findsRead moreThe internet doesn’t need to be turned off, it just needs to be better managed and, on a personal level, used more carefully and responsibly. It needs to grow up.DJT1MillionWe’re in the corporate capture stage of the internet, which is why the user interface for most people now consists of checking the same four apps over and over again, and posting the same content from one of them on to one or more of the other three.Being online is no longer really enjoyable, it’s merely compulsive behaviour orcompulsoryfor participating in society – and is frequently actively annoying and frustrating in proportion to what you get out of it.In its first decade the possibilities of the internet seemed democratic and limitless. Now it’s just another plaything and control mechanism of the Oligarchy.Frank_LynnFor many people in the world, the internet provides one of the few opportunities for girls to study. I imagine that would be missed.GUsername1Technology destroys people and places. I’m rejecting it | Mark BoyleRead moreI was about 32 when the internet became widely used, and I often struggle to recall how on earth I found things out. I read more actual books from cover to cover and my attention span was longer. I now struggle to focus for longer than a few minutes. I once used the phone a lot to book things, which meant having to speak to actual people more. Friends reunited was fairly innocent fun, but then Facebook was born, Snapchat, TikTok … .ChrisPookThere are conceptually simple enough solutions to the stink of the internet sewer. One is to forbid anonymity. All uploads to incorporate a source address.The other would be an even greater boon – to tax ads.nosuchzoneNo. But democracies will need to learn how to address misinformation to challenge the mobocracy. Besides, it still has so many positive and benign uses. As a musician, I would miss the ease with which new skills can be learned and ideas shared. I’m sure others will find reasons of their own for not wanting to turn the clock back.fender64Maybe a world internet-free day might be doable as a way of reflection on being too dependent on it. I will never forget that day in April in Spain when all the electricity went off and one couldn’t access the internet. People were much nicer to each other and helped one another out. You couldn’t access the news without a transistor radio and that wasn’t a bad thing.DaveTrollI’m sure I’ve read about surgeons who have to do something rare being able to get live expert guidance by video call. That’s potentially life-saving.HummusexualMeta just suspended my Facebook account, probably for reporting too many hate groups. So I guess that means less internet for me.TatrabantQuality of life was much better before the internet. People had time for each other, it was possible to understand and fix machines, and convenience was not dependent on accepting endless nastiness, fraud, and fascist adventuring as a fact of life.Digital processes are useful for research but have proved a disaster for human communication and now fuel criminality faster than the ability of law enforcement to contain them. Pull the plug and let us learn to live again.ElephantmothIt was different, but whether it was better depended on circumstances. Those people around the world who now have access to some form of education thanks to internet access might disagree with [turning it off].middle24Without the internet, I’d not have my job (engineer), my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, would’ve found it much harder to find my apartment and roommate, and couldn’t do most of my shopping online so would need to take longer and more frequent trips just to shop since I’ve chosen a car-free lifestyle.But I’m also only on one social network: Reddit, which allows me to read and interact with others about just the topics I select. I only enable notifications for things that actually matter on my phone. I’m also among the minority not staring down at my phone on a bus or train, partly because it gives me motion sickness. I also rarely wear headphones while out, due to preferring to tune into my environment or let my mind wander.So I think the problem is not the internet itself but how we use it. Many fall into the trap of semi-passive consumption of media, allowing those on the other side of that content to disproportionally influence their ideas and behaviors. Were more people wise and kind in their usage of the internet, that’s what would make it better.fr33_th1nk3rAviation is so integrated with the internet that there would be chaos at airports. If you consider that shutting down aviation at the same time would be a good thing, just consider how much food comes in to the UK by air freight, and how much gets exported the same way (Scottish whisky and salmon). There’d be chaos.SocialismnowMake everyone use their real names online. You get a single email address and a single “internet-wide” user account. That will solve most of your problems right there.allanbabb(Replied to byBristolBoy: “Unless you are a dissident in, say, Russia or China, of course”, and byDauGiHyfryd:“I wonder if some of us will, in a year or two, be taken to task for our currently legal posts in the UK.”)My answer is a resounding no. Although there are some areas of the internet which have become walled gardens of algorithms, AI slop and advertising, there are so many other areas where the spirit of the early internet lives on. One example is the “indieweb” where people amateurishly code their own websites, making public whatever content they want rather than staying within the bounds of media companies.The rise of the ‘indieweb’ also includes the resurgence of the email newsletter (or RSS feed if you like). Instead of scrolling on infinite social media feeds, I get my brain going with some thoughtfully written blog posts in my inbox, introducing me to perspectives I would never have come across in the offline world. Long live the indieweb!accidentalusernameYeah go on – let’s see what happens. More shops on the high street, more money spent locally.

No, that’s enabled by “the internet”, but it’s not what the internet “is”, or anywhere near everything networking is capable of.leadballoonA major issue with the internet in its current form is accountability. Anonymity and pseudonimity predominate and are exploited. You can’t tell the difference between a malign foreign actor and someone with a genuine grievance. Clickbait content is picked and amplified by the media giving it false weight. Frustratingly, the tools that ensure accountability and prevent anonymity have been around for over 20 years but technology companies have not implemented them. We are paying the price for the liberal and paranoid – albeit well-intentioned – philosophies on which the internet was founded which allow identity to be obfuscated. The ironic situation we now find ourselves means that criminals can communicate securely -using the said technologies- while keeping their identities secret. This wasn’t part of the plan but it could still be corrected. The question is, who is prepared to pick up the bill?ChrisGilbertI spend all Sunday alone in my flat.

That doesn’t happen any more. Now if you want to talk to someone you have to have the inside scoop on their number and then send them a text to tell them that at such and such time you will be giving them a call and then, just maybe, they will actually answer.

You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.The caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.Unfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.Banks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using theelaborate digital wallet fraudand have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.Danai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”Santander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.UK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.What the scam looks likeThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.After a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.They may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.View image in fullscreenThe scammers use text messages to secure victims’ personal and bank details.Photograph: DCPhoto/Alamy“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay orGooglePay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.From there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.What to doBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.Nationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.HSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.UK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”Apple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.Google did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsBanks and building societiesScam watchScamsConsumer affairsBankingAppleGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its repercussions will be felt far beyond the regionSun 4 Jan 2026 13.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 15.16 ESTShareAmid the immense confusion surrounding the USstrikeson Venezuela, the seizure of the president, Nicolás Maduro, and Donald Trump’s announcement that the US will “run” the country and“take back the oil”, one thing is clear – they set a truly chilling precedent. The US has agrim historyof interference, invasion and occupation in the region, but the early hours of Saturday saw its first major military attack on South American land. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Mr Trump declared. The decision to unilaterally attack another country and abduct its leader – days after hepublicly sought an off-ramp– has still wider repercussions. It should alarm us all.Venezuelans have endured a repressive, kleptocratic and incompetent regime under Mr Maduro, widely believed to have stolen the last election. They now face profound uncertainty at best. Mr Trump has suggested thatMr Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, would follow US instructions, and dismissed the rightwing opposition leader and Nobel prize-winner María Corina Machado as a plausible replacement. But Ms Rodríguez, now interim president, has so farstruck a defiant tone– and other parts of the decapitated regime are more hardline.A man who won power promising to abandon foreign wars now says he is “not afraid of boots on the ground”. Rebranding the Department of Defense as the Department of War was more than posturing. He does not see the world’s superpower as policeman; he is turning it into a rogue state. He believes the US’s might allows it to do as it wishes with minimal cost: witness the strikes on Nigeria, on Iran’s nuclear facilities and elsewhere. He promises that Venezuelan oil means this latest episode “won’t cost us a penny”.George W Bush invaded Iraq on a lie. But thisillegal attackcame withoutUN resolutions of any kindor congressional approval; Democrats were not even informed and say they were actively misled in briefings. Mr Trump doesn’t seek to bend international norms, but to destroy them. Put aside the message this sends to Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and others, and ask where the US itself is heading. While the raid reportedly killed 40 Venezuelans, including civilians, no US personnel died. Mr Trump’s growing sense of invincibility will surely embolden further adventurism. He has not ruled out military action overGreenlandandtold Fox News: “Something is going to have to be done with Mexico.”No one buys the pretext that this is about drugs. Venezuela is only a minor conduit for cocaine; Mr Trump recentlypardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernándezfor drugs and weapons crimes. And Mr Trump himself made it clear that he is driven by the lure of oil as well as machismo, the ideology of some in his administration, and the desire for glory as domestic popularity wanes.The global reaction, especially in Europe, has – with honourable exceptions – been shockingly muted. That’s not due to Mr Maduro’s sins, but fear of Mr Trump’s wrath. The strong reaction from the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, was welcome, but this episode underscores the institution’s growing irrelevance. Mr Trump’s anti-interventionist domestic base could yet press him to turn attention back home – but soaring healthcare premiums, economic unhappiness and the Epstein files increase his appetite for distraction.We are not yet 12 months in to his four-year term. Sir Keir Starmer and others may regret it if they stay silent now, given what – and who – could be next.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But his affordability agenda speaks to the timesSun 4 Jan 2026 13.11 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe multiplefirstsachieved by New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, have been well chronicled: he is the first Muslim to occupy that role, the first south Asian and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the youngest mayor of the largest city in the United States for over a century, havingreceivedmore votes in November’s election than any candidate since the 1960s. And politically, he is probably the most leftwing incumbent of the office sinceFiorello La Guardiain the 1930s and 40s.Hardly surprising then, that Mr Mamdani’s extraordinary rise to prominence should be accompanied by high expectations and tense anticipation. At last Thursday’s inauguration ceremony, he promised to “govern expansively and audaciously”. Whether he succeeds in doing so will have considerable ramifications for progressive politics more widely.Pledgingto make New York “a city we can afford”, Mr Mamdani campaigned on plans to introduce free universal childcare, hugely increase the availability of cheaper housing, and generally reduce everyday costs of living for residents. In order to finance this programme, he has restated his intention to raise tax rates on the very wealthy, and on corporations. Linking the vision of a livable metropolis to a politics of redistribution, this approach has assembled a coalition of voters ranging from young renters to union members, migrants and the professional middle classes.Progressive parties around the world have taken note. The political dynamics of New York, the home of Wall Street and a global centre for the arts, are not straightforwardly generalisable. But the affordability agenda that delivered Mr Mamdani’s flagship success has also fuelled a political revival for Democrats instatessuch as New Jersey and Virginia. In Europe too, the centre-left has fared best when focusing relentlessly on improving everyday life for the less well-off. The surprisevictoryof the D66 party in the recent Dutch election, for example, was largely attributed to its apparent seriousness about addressing the Netherlands’ chronic housing shortage.Mr Mamdani thus finds himself a youthful trailblazer for a radical politics of civic renewal and inclusion that, if it works, could counter more generally the rise of the populist far right. Donald Trumppromiseda “blue-collar boom” when he was re-elected. He has insteadpresidedover a widening equality gap, in which the wealthy have disproportionately benefited from tax cuts and a soaring stock market. There is space here for a new working-class politics of the left. In that spirit, Mr Mamdani’s head of budget, Sherif Soliman, hasstatedthat New York needs to be a livable home not just for Wall Street bankers, but for “low-wage workers, be it in retail or healthcare”.Formidable headwinds await, not least federal funding negotiations with a hostile Mr Trump, and opposition to what – inhistoricalterms – would be modest tax rises for high-income earners. There will also need to be some skilful coalition-building, not least with the Democratic governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, who haspreviouslyspoken out against the hikes. Nevertheless, the political courage shown by New York’s charismatic new mayor during his ascent to power suggests that, in the heartland of global capital, he has the ability to make a difference. In an era in which swathes of blue-collar voters continue to drift rightwards, the stakes are high indeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But you should. This year, there will be a significant amount of tax refunds. Why? Well, it’s nottariffcash. It’s because many people overpaid their taxes this year.For example, service workers who receive tips will be getting refunds. Thanks toDonald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a new provision allows them to deduct up to $25,000 per individual for any tipped income they received during the year. But I bet even when the bill passed, few changed their withholdings to reflect this deduction. If you’re part of that group, then it’s very likely you had too much withheld … and paid too much tax. When you file your 2025 return between now and 15 April – and take advantage of this deduction – you’ll find out you owed less taxes than you estimated. Hence the refund.AI is coming for young people’s office jobs. That’s good news for the construction industry | Gene MarksRead moreThe same goes for workers receiving overtime pay. There’s a new deduction that will allow individuals to deduct up to $12,500 of their overtime pay received in 2025 (it’s $25,000 for joint filers). Similarly for service workers, it’s a deduction you take when you file your 2025 returns. I’m betting if you received overtime during the year, your withholdings didn’t reflect that either. So you’ll probably be getting money back on the taxes you overpaid.There are caveats. State and local taxes may both still apply. Employment taxes – social security and Medicare – aren’t affected. Both deductions start to phase out if you make more than $150,000. Not all tipped workers are eligible (here’sa listto check). Thanks to the shutdown, the IRS didn’t have time to update W-2 wage reporting forms to reflect these changes. And employers weren’t given much guidance as to how to calculate these amounts.It’s not just people who received tips and overtime that have new tax benefitsFor example, did you know that your overtime wage eligible for the deduction would only be the differential between your normal hourly rate and your overtime rate? So if you got paid time and a half for overtime and your normal rate is $20 an hour, you would receive $30 an hour – but your deduction is on the $10 difference. I’m not sure all employers will do these calculations correctly, so be careful – any mistakes are the taxpayer’s responsibility.I’m as capitalist as they get but Medicare for all is the best hope for US healthcare | Gene MarksRead moreIt’s not just people who received tips and overtime that have new tax benefits.Older adults – subject to some limitations – will get an additional $6,000 deduction this year over and above their standard deduction. If you run a small business, you’ll receive higher deductions for first-year depreciation and research and development costs. If you haven’t taken advantage already, you can contribute more to a flexible savings account (which reduces your taxable income) and contribute up to $5,000 to a “Trump savings account” this year and annually, which, while not reducing your income, will allow your newborn to accrue earnings tax-free through the age of 18 and then withdraw the funds without penalty.These deductions aren’t one-offs. Which is why it’s important that if you get a refund this year, make sure to adjust your withholdings for 2026 to reflect your updated taxable income for the current year. This way, you can increase your net pay and put more money in your pocket during the year instead of waiting until you file your 2026 returns in 2027.There are many critics of the OBBBA and they legitimately argue that the bill has many downsides – increasing deficits, taking away critical benefits and reducing spending in needed areas are among the biggest. Those issues aside, the bill does include significant tax benefits for many, benefits that may hopefully make a difference to both consumers and the economy at large.The OBBBA is law. However you feel about it, take advantage. File your 2025 tax returns as soon as possible. Get your refund. It’s your money.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS personal financeTrump administrationTax and spendingUS work & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

He may also overstep now as regards IranSun 4 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 10.21 ESTShareDuring his presidential campaigns,Donald Trumppledged to end “forever wars”, abandon “nation-building” interventions and focus instead on reviving a US economy that, in his telling, had been deindustrialised by a floodtide of imports. Though Trump’s electoral victories cannot be attributed to any one thing, his “America first” narrative certainly struck a chord.But Trump’s use of force toseize the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, his full-bore support for Israel’s demolition of Gaza and hisbombing of Iran’s nuclear enrichment installationsshow that he’s no less willing than his predecessors to resort to military interventions.Trump already had Maduro in his sights. He offered a$50m bountyfor information leading to his capture,blockaded Venezuelan portsto stop sanctioned oil tankers and accused Maduro of involvement in drug trafficking. Still, it’s a safe bet that few outside the administration expected Trump to swoop into a country, grab its president and haul him to the US.Maduro will be tried for drug trafficking and “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, a fuzzy formulation suitably ominous to justify a move of dubious necessity and legality. The Trump administration hasn’t provided evidence tying Maduro to narcotics trafficking, nor has it proven thatVenezuelaposed a clear and present danger necessitating an armed attack.Venezuela has many problems, including drug gangs and authoritarian rule, but they hardly justify what Trump has done. If bad governance and repression by foreign leaders justify abducting them, Trump has a long list of offenders to choose from, including some backed by US economic and military support.Trump’s move can’t be justified by self-defence provisions in international law. Venezuela never threatened to attack the US (it lacks the capacity to do so), let alone attacked it. It’s the other way around: the US has attacked Venezuela and taken steps, such as the naval blockade, generally used in wartime.Trump says that the US constitution permits his intervention – that as commander in chief, he is duty bound to protect American personnel in danger. But Venezuela hadn’t put any US personnel at risk, let alone harmed them. Plus, Trump was building a case for tightening the screws on Maduro, and the Venezuelan leader would have been a fool to provide him with acasus belli.Trump’s most prominent charge against Venezuela’s government is that its drug traffickers have, with Maduro’s complicity, deluged the US with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, which is also used to alleviate severe pain. Even a2 milligramdose can prove fatal.The illegal use of fentanyl and other opioids in the US has certainly been rampant and deadly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)reports thatdeaths tied to synthetic drug overdoses, mainly fentanyl, soared from 782 in 2000 to 72,776 in 2023. However, they are estimated to have plummeted to 47,735 in 2024. Even so, the Trump White Housereckons thatthe costs attributable to “illicit opioids, primarily fentanyl” (including death, treatment, crime and lost labour productivity) totalled $2.7tn in 2023.The question, however, is what Venezuela has to do with any of this. Virtually all of the fentanyl smuggled into the US comes fromMexico, by way of China, which supplies the precursors, something theTrump administration itself concedes. The president neverthelesstold an audienceof top military officers in September that the US was attacking boats off Venezuela’s coast because they “were stacked up with bags of white powder that’s mostly fentanyl”.And Trump contends that Maduro is directly linked to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua criminal gang, adding that it’s “threatening an invasion” of the US – but, again, without providing proof and ignoring the fact that the gang has no army. Besides, Maduro’s government hasbeen on the offensiveagainst the group in recent years. The presidentalso insiststhat Venezuela “previously stole” oil and land that belonged to the US and that he would get these “assets” back. Like his other allegation, this one is fact-free.Venezuela began nationalising itsoil industry in 1976. Hugo Chávez, who served as president from 1999 till his death in 2013, expanded that policy. He mandatedin 2007that PDVSA, the state oil company, take a majority stake in projects in the oil-rich Orinoco region, including those of the US petroleum behemoths ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, both of whom wound up their operations rather than comply, unlike Chevron, BP, Norway’s Statoil and France’s Total. But there are no grounds for claiming that either the US government or any US petroleum company literally owned Venezuela’s oil or land and was robbed.The possible consequences of Trump’s intervention are worrisome for at least two reasons.First, we can’t know what will follow Maduro’s abduction. Venezuela’s state institutions, including the security services, remain intact and an interim president is in place –Delcy Rodríguez, who has been vice-president since 2018. But if street protests segue into clashes between the people and the state, things could quickly spiral out of control, just as they could if Trump’s interventionist agenda expands and encounters resistance.Venezuela’s main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel peace prize,welcomed US pressureto topple Maduro well before he was captured. Now she has hailed Venezuela’s “hour of freedom”. That could provide Trump cover to go further, though, as for Machado herself,he says she“doesn’t have the support within or the respect” to govern. Already, hehas announcedthat the US will “run” Venezuela temporarily, suggesting that he plans to do more than simply put Maduro in the dock. The same can be said for his arrogating the right to open up Venezuela’s oil sector to investments from US corporations.Second, Iran’s government is facing a nationwide uprising, andTrump warnedthat “we are locked and loaded and ready to go” if the regime starts killing protesters. Some havealready been killed.It’s hardly a given that Trump’s Venezuelan gambit will tempt him to try regime change in Iran. But if he does wade into Iran’s upheaval, the consequences – for Iran, the US and Iran’s neighbours – will be much more dangerous than anything that might happen in Venezuela. And Trump is nothing if not unpredictable.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAmericasIrancommentShareReuse this content"

What tomorrow?Stephen WertheimHe took office promising to annex Greenland and take back the Panama Canal. Now that he has ousted Maduro, other countries could be nextSun 4 Jan 2026 01.27 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 08.16 ESTShare“This is genius,” Donald Trump enthused. It was 22 February 2022. Vladimir Putin had just declared parts of eastern Ukraine to be independent and sent in Russian troops to serve as so-called peacekeepers. The once and future American president was impressed, even inspired. “We could use that on our southern border,” Trump mused.Trump didn’t know then that he was speaking at the start of a full-scale invasion that has lasted nearly four years and inflicted upwards of 1.5 million casualties and counting. And Trump doesn’t know now what he has unleashed in Venezuela. The South American country is not Ukraine, nor, for that matter, is it Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. But by ordering military strikes to seize dictator Nicolás Maduro, Trump has thrown a country of around 28 million people into uncertainty and tossed aside the most obvious, hard-won lesson of decades ofUS foreign policyfailures: regime-change wars are easy to start and hard to win, much less to turn into anything resembling genuine success.So far, Trump has taken step one, if that. He has yet to bring down Venezuela’s regime, only to decapitate it, scooping up the man at the top. In his speech announcing the war, however, Trump played the conquering hero. The president boasted at length about the “overwhelming military power” he had exhibited, as though the United States did not possess a long record of smashing operational triumphs — recall “shock and awe” in Baghdad – that gave way to strategic disaster.To hear Trump tell it, the hard part is probably over. Now the peace, prosperity and freedom will begin. “We are going to run the country,” he declared, and to do so, Trump said he was willing to put boots on the ground and eager to get oil gushing out of it. Plan A for post-Maduro governance, Trump suggested, was to leave Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, in power, because she would help the United States do what it wanted. Within two hours, Rodríguez insisted that Maduro remained Venezuela’s rightful leader and denounced the United States as an illegal, imperialist invader seeking to plunder the country.On to Plan B, then.Whatever happens next in Venezuela, the consequences will not be confined there. Trump plainly intended his attack to assert US ownership of the entire region. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he intoned. In the national security strategy released last month, the administration declared a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, claiming a mandate to use any means necessary to excise almost any kind of external influence from theAmericas. The administration has barely begun to apply its ballyhooed corollary. Trump prefers to cast entities closer to home – migrants, gangs and cartels – as existential threats to the United States, invading the country from without, subverting it from within.Trump’s attack on Venezuela confirms what his semester of speedboat strikes in the Caribbean suggested: the United States is transmuting the now-exhausted war on terror into a war on so-called narco-terror. Enmity once directed at terrorists in the Middle East is turning toward a kaleidoscope of border-crossing threats in the western hemisphere. Trump’s definition of these threats is almost infinitely porous, extending to what he has repeatedly called “the enemy from within”. Not for nothing did Trump pause from his address on Venezuela to ad lib about the troops he has sent to patrol American cities.Today, the target was Caracas. What tomorrow? Trump has already drawn up a menu. He took office promising to annex Greenland and take back the Panama Canal. Now that he has ousted Maduro, he could apply much the same rationale to attack any number of countries. Trump claimed yesterday that “the cartels are running Mexico”, an assertion that contains all the justification Trump would need to invade it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, warned the government of Cuba to be concerned.Even if the best-case scenario transpires in Venezuela – if a stable, oil-gushing, pro-American democracy suddenly springs to life — success may embolden the administration to find out just how far it can go to remake the region to its liking.But best cases rarely come to pass. More likely, Donald Trump’s luck with hit-and-run military strikes is about to run out. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he said in his first term. Then what kind of nation is Trump’s America?Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law SchoolExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUS foreign policyAmericasUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

She was a young woman in her early 30s who said she had always found it difficult to find a man she felt connected to. She’d had one long-term relationship in her early 20s but had otherwise been single despite trying online dating and many dating events. Many of her friends were partnered up, and her best friend had just become engaged, resulting in a cascade of anxiety for Caroline, a fear that she was defective in some way and would miss out on milestones in life.“I can’t stop thinking about the things that might be wrong with me. I’m even thinking of taking Ozempic and getting a boob job,” she said, anxiously prodding at a stomach that appeared to be a perfectly normal size to me.If you’re feeling anxious, take a moment to pause before pouring that glass of wine | Diane YoungRead moreShe felt so overwhelmed by her lack of success in dating that she was slowly withdrawing from the activities that usually brought her joy, in favour of spending most of her time swiping on dating apps. However, she said that in the past this usually alternated with periods of intense apathy about dating because of the poor behaviour she had encountered, and difficulties finding partners who matched her vocational success and emotional intelligence.This was a story many women have repeated to me – usually accompanied by similar tales of feeling frustrated, distressed, isolated and defective, especially as the main socially sanctioned celebrations for women still involve marriage and procreation.My work with Caroline was multi-staged.She did not present with a diagnosable clinical disorder, although I was concerned that if she remained preoccupied with dating and her body size and withdrew from people and her hobbies, she may start to experience a depressive disorder or body dysmorphic disorder. As Caroline was highly intelligent and insightful and told me that she valued frankness, I shared this concern with her directly, and we were able to work on a range of cognitive strategies to reduce her concerns about her body (for example, reducing body-checking behaviours, looking at the diversity of body types among her friends who were partnered) and planned some behavioural strategies to renew her engagement with the world (such as planning some travel and joining a pub football team).Caroline said she was very concerned she was an “avoidant”, as TikTok had been blasting videos at her about this attachment style, and that this might doom her to dating failure. It seemed she had some self-protectiveness that had built after repeated poor dating experiences, but that she could draw close to people, connect with them and maintain relationships. We identified ways her self-protectiveness might be a barrier at times.The largest component of our work involved reducing her sense of defectiveness and tackling her self-esteem. We explored the ideas she held about dating (“if I try hard enough I can make it work”, “if I’m not picked, there must be something wrong with me”, “I’m going to die alone”) and worked on acknowledging the distress and sadness she felt. It was important to simply make space to sit with this and hold it instead of rushing to fill the gap with trying to “fix” this or to promise success if she just tried a new way of approaching it.As she sat with her sadness, Caroline noticed a yearning for connection and found this easier to understand than the anxiety she felt. The defectiveness she felt was a cover for loss, and a compensatory response.Fewer one night stands, more AI lovers: the data behind generation Z’s sex livesRead moreWe spoke about ways she could approach dating while having boundaries and that refusing to tolerate poor behaviour was OK – she should not put up with emotional immaturity or sexual inappropriateness to find a partner. We reflected on the societal changes in the world that have made relationship-finding more complex, and also noted the positive changes, such as Caroline’s ability to hold a job and have a mortgage independent of a partner.Working on ideas about dying alone or being lonely were important. We utilised an approach derived from acceptance and commitment therapy to name Caroline’s key values. This was to help her build a life aligned with the value of community, with or without a partner, while accepting that every life will hold a measure of emotional distress, including loneliness.While none of these approaches miraculously solved Caroline’s dating difficulties, she was able to approach this aspect of life with a greater measure of equanimity, equilibrium and a sense that her worth was bigger than simply her success in dating.*All clients are fictional amalgamsDr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

The year was 2019, and I was test-driving a Tesla; while I was ambling off the forecourt, the PR told me jauntily that the windscreen was made of a material that would protect the driver from biohazards. I hit the brakes. “Youwhat? What kind of biohazard? Like, a war?” She misconstrued me, thinking I intended to go and find some toxic waste site to see if it worked, and said: “I’m not sure it’s operational in the press fleet.”That wasn’t my question: rather, what kind of a world wasTeslapreparing for? One so unstable that an average (though affluent) private citizen would do well to prepare for a chemical weapons attack? What model of consumption was this, that the rich used their wealth to prepare for the mayhem their resource-capture would unleash, while the less-rich prepared slightly less well? Was Musk trying to bring to market the apocalypse planning that elites had already embarked on? Because if he was, then it was possible that he was not a great guy. And that turned out to be correct.Tesla’s market share in Europedropped precipitously in the EUin November, from 2.1% to 1.4% of new cars sold, which is likely to be consumers turning away from what Tesla represents, even the ones that agree with Musk. At an anti-Tesla protest at the side of a dual carriageway earlier this year, we got honks of support from actual Tesla drivers. Nobody buying one of these cars pre-2024 would have signed up to look as though they were supporting the owner’s agenda, which gets more and more strident. Meanwhile, the Chinese carmaker BYD recorded the fastest sales growth in November, and China’s state-backed SAIC, which owns MG, recorded sales growth of 26%. Hybrids accounted for nearly half of all sales. People haven’t fallen out of love with electric cars.View image in fullscreenChina’s BYD has opened an EV factory in Rayong, Thailand.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersThe arguments for and against EVs and hybrids are a neat distillation of a conversation we should be having constantly about all steps towards net zero. From a purist’s perspective, EVs are a red herring; we should be moving away from individual vehicles altogether, making lifestyle and infrastructure and 15-minute city adaptations so that we don’t need cars – making an emotional leap to the car as a purely practical item that a whole street could share, rather than something that conveys status or self-reliance and as such has to be held privately. We will not get to where we need to be by staying this dumb. There’s also an unavoidable practical dimension: the batteries needrare metals, which means that making EVs creates yet more emissions.On the other hand, EVs offer clear proof that nobody is wedded to a fossil fuel lifestyle if something better comes along. And once something marginally better comes along, it constantly improves. No amount of corporate lobbying or teething trouble will stop people swapping out a worse thing for a better thing.And electric vehicles are an incredible story of improvement. When Ifirst reviewed a Nissan Leaf, it had to be delivered on a flatbed lorry, because the range was so tiny they couldn’t trust it would have enough charge after going 50 miles. Now the most basic model will go almost 300 miles. Solid-state batteries are going into trial next year with the promise of 500 miles on a 10-minute charge. I have severe misgivings about technological utopianism around climate breakdown: the hand-wavy insistence that human ingenuity will solve everything is often just a way to gate off collective energy and activism. But the advances in EVs outpace expectations by such a distance that it would be churlish not to notice.Tesla’s EU sales slump continues as Chinese rivals thriveRead moreComically, the measure the petrolheads used to love, the macho bit of driving – nought to 60 – is better on electric vehicles, because they have fewer moving parts, less energy loss and deliver instant maximum torque. Theinfrastructure is better; public charging is getting more ubiquitous and private charging cheaper.Maybe if we could be nuanced enough to acknowledge that we all need to change, but we can also take the win when it’s right there; that we all need to move past the market, but that market forces sometimes still work – that would have ramifications beyond cars. But the most important take-home is: don’t letElon Musktaint the EV revolution, and don’t let him turn it into something other than what it is. It is not the story of imperilled individuals, hiding behind their top-dollar reinforced windscreens. Collective ingenuity has advanced what’s realistic, and realists do the rest.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsOpinionElon MuskTeslaMotoringEthical and green livingTravel and transportcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t swallow the right’s liesJohn HarrisPopulists rewrite the history of this nation because they were complicit in much of its ugliness. The progressive fightback must start nowSun 4 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 14.08 ESTShareAcouple of the more disruptive boys in the class put red laces in their Dr Martens, because someone had told them that was how youshowed your support for the National Front. “Jew” was an everyday insult and the N-word was in regular circulation. There were no more than four or five non-white kids in the whole school: I can recall one Asian girl finding her art folder had been covered in racist abuse, and some adolescent desperado singling out a black boy for a spoken version of the same treatment, before insisting that his victim was in on the joke. He wasn’t: he looked at the ground and rushed away, full of the hurt he must have felt every day.This was what it was like in a Cheshire comprehensive school in the early-to-mid-1980s. Teenage racism was there in plain sight, and there was a scattering of people who seemed to take their prejudices – presumably passed down from parents and elder siblings – very seriously indeed. In what is now known as year 7, for example, each class was given a group of “sixth-form counsellors”, meant to show up once or twice a week and encourage ambition and hard work. One of ours was a tense, soft-spoken young man who liberally used racist epithets, backed the National Front and said he wanted to be a policeman. His view of the world, as far as I could tell, was summed up in a chant that a certain sort of playground thug knew by heart: “There ain’t no black in the union jack/Get back, get back, get back.”As all those allegations about Nigel Farage’s behaviour at Dulwich college have mounted up, the Reform UK leader hasfollowed his lawyers’ insistencethat they are “wholly untrue, defamatory, and malicious” with the claim that he “never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody”. And amid the resulting noise, thousands – possibly millions – of people must have instantly recalled experiences like these.They will also have heard echoes of their schooldays in what the accusations have inevitably triggered: yet another argument about the UK’s past, split between some voices whoput any alleged racismdown to different times and harmless high jinks, and others who understand that they came of age amid dire social attitudes that it took years to overturn. That second point of view, moreover, is now combined with a rising sense of alarm, because ideas and beliefs we thought had been defeated are rapidly eating into politics and the public mood.View image in fullscreenRightwing protesters hold a rally at the Port of Dover, as they clash with anti-fascist protesters over immigration, 30 January 2016.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyOn 30 December, the Institute For Public Policy Researchpublished a much-publicisedreport about how what it calls “ethnonationalist narratives” are winning over voters. Some of its findings suggested reasons for hope: a mere 3% of us, for example, think that being a good British citizen involves having white skin. But just over one-third of people nowthink true Britishnessis something people have to be born with, up from about one in five in 2023. This, the authors say, symbolises something that demands urgent action: “No longer consigned to the fringes of British politics, a view of the national community defined in ethnic terms and society as a hierarchy is stirring fear, anxiety and anger in people of all backgrounds.”Look at how fast all this is suddenly moving. Most provocations about the supposedly ethnic foundations of national identity used to be centred on Englishness; now, what is generating the most noise are claims about what it is to be British. Mainstream media outletsgive a platformto people who think that those “without native British ancestry”should be barred from being MPs. The Reform MP Sarah Pochinhas complainedthat: “It drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people.”The right’s obsession with immigration is starting to tip into an insistence on “remigration”, the polite term for the old idea of “sending ‘em back”. Beyond the arguments about new arrivals pulling down wages or eating up public services, we now hear claims about “cultural coherence” – yet another example of 21st-century rhetoric updating a familiar insistence: that what the union jack has always supposedly symbolised leaves no room for anything that isn’t stereotypically white.Which takes us back to the politics of history. Much of the political manoeuvring of the new right boils down to people who grew up in the same horrible cultural atmosphere that I did, basing a huge amount of what they say on the belief that the UK was simply a better place back then. They want, in other words, to live in a much more monocultural country, where Farage wouldn’tfeel his infamous uneaseabout the ubiquity in modern London of foreign languages, and white Britons could be more authentically themselves, free of liberal disapproval. Theirs is a retro utopia of camaraderie and freedom: if red bootlaces and everyday racism were once part of the same picture, they were mere trifles.Farage plays these games comparatively cleverly, mostly via rhetorical nods and winks. A much more clunky practitioner, by contrast, is the free-ranging shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, who followed last October’s reports ofhis claimsthat he had not seen “another white face” on a trip to an area of Birmingham withhis thoughts on the modern historyof English football. His focus was a period when he was just starting primary school, and the game was still indeliblyassociated not just with racism, but disorder so extreme that English clubs werebanned from European competition between 1985 and 1990, while Margaret Thatcher set upa “war cabinet”to somehow deal with the issue. In Jenrickworld, none of this happened. Despite “language, chants, and antics [that] were – at times – less than well-mannered”, he says the culture surrounding football in the 1980s “was largely all good-natured fun … where there was violence, the police put a quick but firm end to it. Such was the rhythm of British life.”View image in fullscreenJenrick has described 1980s football culture, when racism was endemic, as “largely all good-natured fun”.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesThat picture is hilariously wrong, but it stands as another example of a very modern trick: rightwing politicians shutting down their obvious links to the horrors of the UK’s past by denying that there were any such horrors in the first place. And so far, we have not heard nearly enough of the most effective response: that the Britain of yesteryear may have offered some of its people order and “fun”, but it was also a country of deep racism, petty violence, bitter industrial strife, riots, appalling police brutality, corruption in plain sight, awful attitudes to disability and more. You would have to be mad – or downright evil – to want to go back there: in every conceivable respect, modern Britain is better.Labour, it seems, has resolved to start the new year by launching renewed attacks on Farage and his party, based on Keir Starmer’s insistence that he isinvolved in“a fight for the soul of the country”. But whether a prime minister so wooden and mistrusted can successfully lead that battle seems doubtful. Besides, the pushback would surely be better helmed by musicians, film-makers, sportspeople, authors,YouTube influencersand whoever else might usefully contribute – the kind of people who could campaign with wit and optimism, reach broad audiences and take things out of the toxic, yah-boo atmosphere of Westminster politics.What they ought to be focused on is obvious: whether, from the perspective of the 21st century, the hatreds and delusions that once coursed around playgrounds, pubs and football grounds are going to look like pointers to the future or reminders of what we have to once again defeat. At some point over the next 12 months, we may well know the answer – which is why 2026’s stakes are so unbelievably high.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionNigel FarageRaceRobert JenrickcommentShareReuse this content"

Do read onSun 4 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 15.22 ESTShareIlove spoiling the plot for myself. It’s something I do fairly regularly. Before watching a film, I tend to open Wikipedia and read the entire plot synopsis. If every episode of a series has been uploaded to a streamer, I often open the last episode, watch the final five minutes, close it and then start from the beginning. I did as such when the final season of Top Boy dropped in the autumn of 2023. When I tweeted about it from my now-deleted X account, I drew a range of bewildered and outraged responses, including from the officialTop Boy Netflix account.I’m sure you also probably think I’m a sociopath, a philistine or stubbornly impatient (the last has some truth). But the fact is, sometimes spoilers relieve a sense of burden – that you might have to stick out some film or TV show with this uncertainty hanging over you, this itch to just know who gets snuffed out or who did the snuffing. Isn’t that the point of watching something, I hear you say. Well, yes. But frankly, I’m not willing to put that effort into every bit of media I consume – particularly in the streaming age where there is such a constant abundance of things to watch, all of it varying in quality, and the pay-off is not always guaranteed.I find that knowing what happens brings a different kind of pleasure to the viewing experience, too. You feel like you’re one step ahead of the characters, and you point out the bits of foreshadowing and feel pleased with yourself. The ancient Greeks often knew how tragedies were going to end from the onset; early on in Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex, it is prophesied that Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother, and the entertainment comes from watching him unknowingly hurtle towards his destiny.Sometimes, plot points have been spoiled simply because the text is so old that everyone publicly discusses it anyway. I watched Cruel Intentions for the first time the other weekend, to my mind an unfairly maligned teen film, having already seen the thrilling conclusion with Kathryn Merteuil’s character, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, exposed at the funeral of her stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont. Knowing what happened at the end didn’t make the downfall any less exquisite; if anything, Kathryn’s repeated cruelty made me even more excited for it. And I think old art is the best case for why spoilers are sometimes good – if you’ve repeatedly watched something and your enjoyment hasn’t diminished, then surely it’s about the writing and entertainment rather than the big reveals?Now don’t get me wrong – I don’t believe in spoiling things for other people, and would never casually post plot twists or key scenes on my social media. I think that’s a bizarrely selfish practice. And I won’t read spoilers for everything – whenever I watch a new film in the cinema, I don’t bring out my phone to Google the plot, because I think there’s a sanctity to the theatrical experience. Perhaps this all speaks to how streaming has cheapened our consumption habits; if you’re watching a series on your phone, why not read up on it at the same time on the same screen? Who knows, but anyway, I’m about to go Google whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio survives at the end of Titanic.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsExplore more on these topicsFilmThe hill I will die onTV streamingSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Better news: cinemas are fighting back against AI with films anxious about the new tech, including Gore Verbinski’sGood Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die(13 February), in which a man apparently from the future (Sam Rockwell) wants to warn people about an incoming AI hellscape, followed byThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist(title says it all really), from the film-makers behind Everything Everywhere All at Once, in March. Then, later in the year, Luca Guadagnino unveilsArtificial, his biopic of Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.Catherine BrayBritpop“If it was all up to me then you know we’d be touring till the day we die … but UNFORTUNATELY it’s not,” musedLiam Gallagher recently on Xafter fielding questions aboutOasis’s plans for 2026, hinting perhaps that it was up to the boss (Noel). Still, rumours persist that the band are planning huge summer shows, likely at Knebworth, the apex point of their Britpop dominance back in 1996. A 30-year anniversary would make (financial) sense. Another fan of the Hertfordshire country estate – he played three shows there in 2003 – is Liam’s old foeRobbie Williams, who will attempt to tap into the fumes of reheated Britpop fever with February’s guitar-heavy album called – you guessed it! – Britpop. Featuring a picture on the cover of a noticeably refreshed Williams after he’d gatecrashed the Oasis camp at Glastonbury in 1995, complete with red Adidas tracksuit, bleached hair and missing tooth, it’s apparently the album he always wanted to make after being booted out of Take That. “It was the peak of Britpop,” he said recently of that time, “and a golden age for British music.” While Britpop (the movement) was marked by fierce chart rivalries, Williams delayed Britpop (the album) from its original October 2025 release date to avoid being bested by Taylor Swift.Michael CraggConfessionsMore than 20 years afterMadonna’s last truly great front-to-back album, 2005’s Confessions on a Dance Floor, the Instagram addict will release its sequel at some point this year. Having reunited with that album’s producer Stuart Price for 2023’s rejuvenating, hit-focused Celebration tour, the pair have been holed up in the studio seemingly ever since. (There was also a tease of Madonna in the studio with pop supremo Max Martin.) Fingers crossed for a conversation-changing killer first single – equal parts bonkers and undeniable – lashings of glittery, disco-adjacent electropop and the rightful return of Madonna: The Icon. Elsewhere, the confessional brand of pop Madonna helped pioneer in decades past is at its zenith, with revealing releases forthcoming from the likes ofLana Del Rey,Sky Ferreiraand ex-Little MixerLeigh-Annefollowing in the footsteps of Lily Allen and Rosalía’s very different, but equally brutal, breakup epics.MCDraculaProving its immortality, Bram Stoker’s classic has been adapted yet again, for both stage and screen. French film director Luc Besson brings usDracula(in cinemas now) as a gothic romance, starring body-horror connoisseur Caleb Landry Jones as the undead lover searching for 400 years for the reincarnation of his wife (Zoë Bleu). Christoph Waltz plays the stake-wielding priest chasing him across the globe. On stage, Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo will play all 23 roles in Kip Williams’sDracula(Noël Coward theatre, London, 4 February to 30 May). Williams’s screen-heavy stagings have had wild success, including the recent adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, with Sarah Snook playing all 26 roles. Now it’s the Wicked star’s turn to do the same, and leave her bloody mark on Stoker’s tale.Kate WyverEat the RichIn her celebrated Edinburgh show, Jade Franks turned the brutal culture shock and myriad humiliations she experienced as a working-class scouser at Cambridge into a merciless satire of privilege in the UK:Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates x)which transfers to London this month (Soho theatre, London, 12 to 31 January). If seeing wealthy elites brought down a peg or two is your cup of tea then Glen Powell inheritance caper movieHowto Makea Killingand Lee Sung Jin’s returning TV dramedy anthologyBeef(which this time revolves around a Korean billionaire) should both be something to savour. Talking of TV treats, money still correlates closely with misery in the fourth series of peerless finance dramaIndustry,airing on BBC later this month.Rachel AroestiView image in fullscreenSetting a president … Mason Alexander Park as Mary Todd Lincoln in Oh, Mary!Photograph: Manuel HarlanFirst LadiesHeading to a show about Mary Todd Lincoln? Make sure to double check your ticket. Cole Escola’s riotous Broadway hitOh, Mary!(Trafalgar theatre, London, to 25 April), has arrived in the West End with Mason Alexander Park in this fervently embellished story about the life of Abraham Lincoln’s wife. A five-minute walk away at Charing Cross theatre, Bronagh Lagan directs John Ransom Phillips’sMrs President(23 January to 8 March), a straighter look at Mary’s life and her encounter with the first celebrity photographer. If you’d rather spend an evening seething in rage at the state of the world, try the $40m Mrs Trump documentaryMelania(in cinemas 30 January, then on Prime Video), made by disgraced director Brett Ratner, who denies multiple claims of sexual misconduct. Melania is on board as a producer, so it’s sure to be a clear-eyed, honest take.KWGlastonbury-shaped holeFor the first time since its post-Covid return in 2022, Worthy Farm is having a fallow year. With no Glastonbury in sight, there are a plethora of festival options still on sale and available to fill the music-shaped chasm in your summer. For fans of Glasto’s eclectic programming, Dorset’sWe Out Here(20 to 23 August) is a very capable substitute with headline sets from Stereolab, Ethio-jazz great Mulatu Astatke and Brazilian composer Arthur Verocai. When it comes to late-night partying, Lincolnshire’sLost Village(27 to 30 August) always promises a genre-spanning range of DJs in its labyrinthine wooded site, and further afield, Barcelona’sPrimavera Sound(3 to 6 June) has huge headliners to compete with the Pyramid Stage, including the Cure, Massive Attack and the xx.Ammar KaliaHeathcliffFresh from his turn as a disconcertingly hunky humanoid in Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein, Jacob Elordi will spend 2026 cementing his position as one of Hollywood’s few bona fide gen Z leading men. In the spring, he’ll front Ridley Scott’s post-apocalyptic thrillerThe Dog Stars(in cinemas 27 March), but first he reunites with Saltburn writer-director Emerald Fennell for her gleefully irreverent, erotic take onWuthering Heights(13 February). Starring opposite fellow Aussie Margot Robbie, all eyes will be on Elordi’s Heathcliff, whose transformation from rural waif to gentleman brute will be soundtracked by Charli xcx and bestowed upon the world just in time for Valentine’s Day.RAView image in fullscreenJust deserts … Zendaya in Dune.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyImaxTell me, O Muse, of the hero who wandered far and wide, searching for the best film format, before deciding Imax was the one. Yes, Christopher Nolan has filmed Homer’sOdyssey(17 July) Imax-style, with Matt Damon as Odysseus. Cinephiles will want to watch as the gods intended, on an Imax screen in an Imax cinema. Giant screens will also play host to Marvel’sAvengers: Doomsday(18 December) – though the more interesting battle for box office nerds will be the current sand v spandex booking conflict between the comic-book behemoth andDune: Part 3, slated for the same release date.CBJack ThorneThe prolific screenwriter has been at the vanguard of British television for more than a decade (his CV includes Skins, This Is England and The Virtues), but 2025 really was Thorne’s year thanks to a trio of big social-justice dramas: The Hack; Toxic Town; and, of course, the juggernaut that was Adolescence. That show made a star out of 16-year-old Owen Cooper; expect the unknown child cast of Thorne’s upcoming BBC adaptation ofLord of the Fliesto get similar career boosts. Yet he’s also made time to pen a romantic drama for two of our best actors: Channel 4’sFallingfeatures Keeley Hawes as a nun who becomes infatuated with Paapa Essiedu’s priest.RAK-popLast year was the year animated film KPop Demon Hunters dominated Netflix and with its wildly popular soundtrack, nominated for five Grammys; in 2026 there is plenty more K-pop to come. Genre-defining stalwartsBTSare slated to return this spring with a new album and reportedly their biggest world tour yet, following a 2022 hiatus where members of the boyband were enlisted for mandatory military service, while girl groupBlackpinkare also releasing a new single in January after the completion of their Deadline world tour. Ascendent K-pop groupNewJeans,meanwhile, were embroiled in a legal battle with their record label in 2025, but pending an imminent resolution their comeback is slated for later in the new year.AKLegacy sequelsTime was, a sequel meant part two of a self-contained film which did so exceptionally well at the box office that another story involving the same characters was unexpectedly in order. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, along came Jaws 2. Sequels are so normalised these days that we’re into Hollywood’s legacy sequel era: films that pick up the story years or even decades down the line. This year, examples are set to include28 Years Later: The Bone Temple(16 January),The Devil Wears Prada 2(1 May),Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man(cinemas 6 March, Netflix 20 March),Scream 7(27 February),Toy Story 5(19 June) andThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping(20 November) – OK, so technically a legacy prequel, that last one.CBMillerArthur Miller is hot property. Ivo Van Hove’s West End production ofAll My Sons(Wyndham’s theatre, London, to 7 March)has already been showered with five-star reviews. At London’s Young Vic, Jordan Fein (Fiddler on the Roof) brings us Miller’s lesser-knownBroken Glass(21 February to 18 April). A devastating portrait of antisemitism in 1930s America, it’s a story of dislocation and defiance, as a woman’s body stops working in response to reading about Kristallnacht. The Crucible, which premiered at London’s Royal Court 70 years ago, continues to fuel new stories, and now in the same space, Danya Taymor directs Kimberly Belflower’s seven-time Tony-nominated take on Miller’s best-loved play,John ProctorIs the Villain(20 March to 25 April) as a class discuss The Crucible in the context of their own knotty lives. Perhaps Miller’s most famous play,Death of a Salesman, receives a new staging at Liverpool’s Everyman theatre this autumn (19 September to 10 October). And looking further ahead, Millermania is set to reach fever pitch in 2027, with Paul Mescal set to star as Biff Loman in the same play at London’s NationalTheatre.KWView image in fullscreen(Clockwise from top left) Hamnet; Limp Bizkit; Rihanna; Michael; Dear England.Composite: FilmMagic; Helen Murray; Lionsgate; BBC/Studio Lambert/Cody Burridge/Matt Burlem; Marc Brenner; RedfernsNu-metalPerhaps it makes sense that late-90s nu-metal – all rock choruses, rap verses and nostalgic frat party energy – is continuing its comeback in 2026. Who doesn’t have some rage that needs exorcising? Besides, those baggy, oversized clothes and backwards snapbacks are a forgiving look for the OG fans hoping to cover expanding waistlines and male pattern baldness. Nu-metal’s influence was seen in the aesthetic of recent album campaigns by the likes of Fontaines DC and 5 Seconds of Summer, while this year sees the return of the genre’s heavyweights in arenas, stadiums and fields across the country. At the start of the summer, Rollin’ hitmakersLimp Bizkitheadline the UK’s premiere rock festival, Download (10 to 14 June), despite their last album, 2021’s Still Sucks, missing the UK Top 75.

New players entering the arena soon include Hugh Jackman singing his heart out inSong Sung Blue(out now), Chloé Zhao’s Shakespeare weepieHamnet(9 January), emotional documentaryThe Voiceof Hind Rajab(16 January) and Kristen Stewart’s directorial debutThe Chronologyof Water(6 February). It’s also possible that the big winners have already completed their tour of the multiplexes: Ryan Coogler’s Sinners was well liked by critics, while Wicked: For Good made the kind of money Oscar finds difficult to completely ignore, while the muscular heft of One Battle After Another seems locked on for Academy approval.CBView image in fullscreenArt attack … Catherine Zeta Jones in Kill Jackie.Photograph: Unai MateoPrestige TrashHow do you like your TV thrillers?

With television’s golden age now a distant memory, streamers have turned their attention to pumping out total nonsense that looks absolutely fantastic. Last year saw countless stars go through hell in the lap of luxury (see The Girlfriend, Malice, The White Lotus) and this year will follow suit, thanks to Prime Video’sKill Jackie(Catherine Zeta-Jones is an art dealer targeted by hitmen), Netflix’sThe Undertow(Jamie Dornan plays a man who assumes the identity of his rich twin), MGM+’sVanished(a romantic Paris getaway becomes a missing person’s case) and surely many, many more.RAQueueingThe return of Oasis shone a light not only on overpriced tickets (cheers, dynamic pricing!) but also the frustration of virtual queues, with millions of disgruntled fans in bucket hats stuck watching a screen for hours as their souls slid away. While ticket pricing is finally being overhauled, expect a slew of big cultural moments in 2026 to mean long queues. Semi-retired superstarRihannawas rumoured to have been returning to UK stadiums last year before getting pregnant, so if that anticipated comeback has been pushed to 2027 then tickets will be like gold dust this year.

Long before playing Max in Stranger Things, Sink was performing on Broadway, and she recently impressed there in John Proctor Is the Villain. Juliet will be her West End debut. Jupe plays her Romeo in this anticipated production by Robert Icke, on at Harold Pinter theatre, 16 March to 6 June.KWSNL UKThere are many reasons why the British version of Saturday Night Live may flounder: we won’t get the endless stream of uber-famous hosts; we don’t have the improv tradition; we as a nation simply will not tolerate the bloated, brash and sweatily unfunny skits that make up the bulk of the US original. Yet there is cause for cautious optimism. Firstly, we have actually successfully recreated the iconic sketch show on British soil before (see: late-1980s star-maker Saturday Live, ft. everyone from Harry Enfield to Hugh Laurie). Secondly, the head writer’s job has been given to Daran Johnson, one-third of transcendentally funny and criminally underrated sketch troupe Sheeps.RAView image in fullscreenFringe concern … Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Cody Burridge/Matt BurlemTraitorsBy now, two episodes in, you’re probably already immersed in the latest series ofThe Traitors, or regular-person Traitors as we may now have to call it after the success of the Celebrity variant last year.

Over in the US, the fourth season of their celebrity-fronted Traitors franchise returns on 8 January, with a UK broadcast following soon after. Contestants include Donna Kelce, mother of Taylor Swift’s fiance Travis, Love Island UK’s Maura Higgins, actor Michael Rapaport and Real Housewife stalwart Lisa Rinna.AKUndeadIn showbiz, death is no hindrance when it comes to new content, or copious amounts of money-making and, on occasion, reputation white-washing. While an Abba-style hologram Queen show featuring Freddie Mercury may be in its early stages – “I’m very taken with the idea that we can be the original Queen again,” mused the band’s Brian May last November – the band’s one-time collaborator Michael Jackson will have (a section of) his life immortalised via delayed Antoine Fuqua biopic,Michael(24 April). Chef, author and the so-called rock star of the culinary world Anthony Bourdain, who died in 2018, will also be given the biopic treatment in 2026 via A24’sTony. Bourdain will be played by breakout star of The Holdovers Dominic Sessa, with Antonio Banderas and Emilia Jones co-starring in a film set during the life-changing summer of 1976.MCVideo PodsWhen television was in its infancy, it was the cheap cousin of cinema, often consisting of some blokes in a room having a chat – no fancy sets, minimal editing and modest production values. These days a certain level of polish is expected. But what if you could make talk TV without so much fuss? Just some blokes – or maybe even some women! – in a room, having a chat. And lo, the video podcast was born, giving the likes ofJoe Roganthe chance to grow massive followings on a budget and without all that boring factchecking a broadcaster might require. Now even the TV guys are pivoting to pods, with the likes of Netflix embracing the fact that if people are looking at their phones half the time that they’re consuming streamer content, there’s no need to spend all that money making TV look super-flash: 2026 will see the fruits of a deal with Spotify to bring the most popular of its video podcasts, includingThe Rewatchables,The Big Picture,Recipe ClubandSerial Killersto Netflix.Televisionis dead, long live television.CBWorld CupLet’s face it, it probably won’t be coming home – but football definitely will be all over our screens this summer. The year’s glut of footie-themed telly includesTwenty Twenty Six– in which bumbling bureaucrat Ian Fletcher of Twenty Twelve and W1A fame is promoted to director of integrity at a global football tournament – and the Joseph Fiennes-led TV adaptation ofDear England, James Graham’s hit play about Gareth Southgate’s managerial magic (the stage version continues to tour the UK to 14 March). Another inspirational boss returns in the long-awaited fourth season ofTed Lasso, while garlanded director Molly Manning Walker makes her TV debut with Channel 4’sMajor Players, about two teenage girls who start a football team.KWeX-pop starsWhat do pop starsAriana Grande,AdeleandCharli xcxhave in common? None of them actually seem super keen on being pop stars any more. Yes Grande has a tour booked for this year – her first since 2019, including 10 dates at London’s O2 (15 Aug to 1 September) – but she’s already suggested it will be her final one, with her acting stint in the Wicked duology swiftly followed this year by a starring role in Meet the Parents sequelFockerin-Law(25 November). Adele, who announced an “incredibly long break” from music in 2024, looks to be making good on her statement and will make her acting debut in Tom Ford’sCry to Heaven. Having achieved top-tier status in the pop pantheon with Brat, it’s Charli xcx who seems most keen on relocating to Hollywood, however. She has six films in various states of production for this year, while three others,100 Nights of Hero(6 February),ErupcjaandSacrifice,arrived at festivals in late 2025. She will briefly resume her pop-star form inThe Moment, a mockumentary about a very xcx-ish figure’s headlining tour, directed by her longtime collaborator Aidan Zamiri and based on an original idea by Charli herself.MCYBAsThree decades on from their emergence as the unruly group of artists seeking to disrupt the stuffy British art world, the YBAs are back and indulging in 90s nostalgia in 2026. The Tate Modern in London is set to host the largest retrospective of YBATracey Emin’s work (27 February to 31 August), including hits such as The Bed and Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, alongside her moving recent paintings and never-before-seen early works.Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Showat V&A Dundee (3 April to 7 January 2027) is set to provide an innovative look at the development of modern fashion with landmark pieces including Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and Maison Margielas. At London’s Tate Britain, meanwhile, the entire decade of the 90s is under examination (1 October to 14 February 2027) with a new mixed-media show. Photographs fromJuergen Tellerexpose the celebrity fascination around the YBAs and their partying cohort, while works fromDamien Hirstshowcase the trajectory of their artistry.AKZendayaThe bankable star can currently claim an incredible sum total of $3.9bn box office returns on her films to date, including the Dune movies, The Greatest Showman and three Spider-Men. This should be the year she tops $5bn, with credits including Christopher Nolan’s Odyssey, a third Dune and romanceThe Drama(3 April) opposite Robert Pattinson. This year also sees the Euphoria star her potentially tie the knot with long-term squeeze Tom Holland, though only a fool would claim to know exactly what’s happening there. At the time of going to press, the rumour mill is running with everything from “they’re already married” to “they’ve already split” to “the reception will be at the Nag’s Head in Walthamstow on 12 March”.CBExplore more on these topics2026 culture previewTheatreTelevisionGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The news that he had become the first British artist in history to be nominated that many times in the awards’ rock categories came as a suitably striking finale to what, by any metric, was an extraordinary year for the 28-year-old singer-songwriter.In June, his fourth studio album, Idols, entered the UK charts at No 1, outselling its nearest competitor by 50%. The same month, the annual festival he curates and headlines, Bludfest, drew an audience of 30,000 to The National Bowl in Milton Keynes. In July, he played atBack to the Beginning, the farewell performance by Black Sabbath, whose frontman Ozzy Osbourne died 17 days after the gig. On a bill almost comically overstuffed with heavy metal superstars paying tribute – Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Anthrax, Slayer – his rendition of Black Sabbath’s 1972 ballad Changes unexpectedly stole the show, appearing to win him an entirely new audience in the process: the crowd at the gig skewed considerably older than the gen Z fans Harrison traditionally attracts.The ensuing performance is worth watching on YouTube. You can see Harrison winning the crowd over as the song progresses: by the end, there are audience members singing along in tears. “I wasn’t surprised in the least,” says Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, who also performed that day. “And I say this without reservation, and as a fan of heavy metal for 50 years. Because Dom has one of the greatest voices in the history of music, and as grand as that may sound there is no hype in what I’m saying.”He has one of the greatest voices in the history of music – and there is no hype in what I’m sayingBilly CorganIt won him the respect of other august rock figures: Metallica’s Kirk Hammett approached him and told him he loved what he did, and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler not only called Harrison his “brother from another mother”, he enlisted him as a collaborator. Released in November, Aerosmith and Yungblud’s EP One More Time topped the UK charts and became Harrison’s first US Top 10 hit. “I’m sitting here at the end of the year talking to you, trying to comprehend it,” Harrison says. “What the fuck is going on?”On a video call from Los Angeles, where he’s working on a new album, he is clearly delighted about his sudden ascent, partly because it seems so unlikely.View image in fullscreenPerforming with Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and Joe Perry in September at the MTV Video Music awards.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesHarrison is no one’s idea of a critical cause celebre. Since the release of his eponymous 2018 debut EP, his work has consistently attracted reviews that range from middling to hostile. He has never had a solo hit single: his most successful, 2019’s 11 Minutes, stalled outside the Top 50. As he points out, beyond his famously rabid fanbase, who call themselves the Black Hearts Club, people may know the name Yungblud, but would struggle to name one of his songs. He says he only started Bludfest because no festivals would book him, confused as to where an artist whose oeuvre leaps around stylistically from rap to punk to pop to hard rock to indie would sit. “I wasn’t poppy enough for some of them, I wasn’t heavy enough for the rock festivals, so I had to start my own thing. And the festivals that weren’t giving me the slots I wanted cost so much, 200 to 500 quid a ticket, so we started selling tickets at 45 quid.”He bullishly suggests that this year, Bludfest could attract a crowd of “50 to 60,000 people” – an example of how “disaster always turns into opportunity for me”. His lack of “a billion streaming song that Joe Bloggs in the pub knows” is a bonus, because “I’m never beholden to one song, I’m not defined by it the way some other artists are”. If the press look askance at his earnest pronouncements about politics, mental health, toxic masculinity and trans rights, his sartorial experiments with androgyny and his cartoonish punk image – all held to be evidence of someone trying a bit too hard – then that’s what he thinks his fans like about him: “I think it’s an innate sense of honesty, and a fearlessness to being laid bare. I’ve always been a lot for some people, but I’ve utterly told the truth in real-time through my music even if I’ve been lost doing it.”He says his career has always played out in an improbable way, from the minute he left his home town of Doncaster for London (he briefly shared a flat with another would-be pop star, Lewis Capaldi). “No record label in the UK would touch me. I remember someone saying: ‘This music will never get played on Radio 1.’ I thought: ‘OK, I can’t rely on putting out music the old way, I can’t rely on good publicity and the press.’ I had to make videos on my phone instead and post them on social media: right, this is a song I’ve written called King Charles, it’s about Brexit.”The online views started stacking up. “People started sending me direct messages and I started hitting them back: no one gave a shit in England, it was kids in the Netherlands. I put a gig on there and we sold out 150 tickets in 10 minutes. I remember turning up in a van and there were kids outside the venue when we pulled up. I loved the Clash and I’d seen pictures of Joe Strummer smoking outside gigs with his fans, so that’s what I did: I stood outside with them all day, bringing them cups of tea. That’s how it all started – all I focused on was the fans, meeting them. I didn’t think I was building a brand or a community or anything like that.”But he clearly was: serendipitously, Harrison had embarked on his career at precisely the point where the influence of rock and pop’s traditional gatekeepers – the music press and radio – had begun to dramatically wane, and the kind of social media fuelled grassroots approach he’d been forced into had become all important. A US label, Geffen, took the bait, and by 2020, Harrison’s grassroots fanbase had grown to the point where his second album, Weird!, topped the UK charts. So did its eponymous successor, despite the fact that Harrison was so dissatisfied with it, he sank into depression after its release.‘I want to ride out on a unicorn every night’: swords’n’sorcery heavy metal band Castle RatRead moreAlong the way, he picked up some celebrity supporters, among them his “hero” Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, who appeared in the video for his single The Funeral. Nevertheless, Harrison says, he was “extremely nervous” when he was asked to perform at the Back to the Beginning show. For one thing, he’d assumed he would be playing an uptempo Black Sabbath track, not a ballad. For another, grizzled heavy metal fans are not known for their tolerance of pretty, young male pop stars, pal of the star attraction or not. “About 50,000 people were there,” he says. “Twenty-five thousand haven’t got a clue who I am, 15,000 think I’m a poser, and maybe 10,000, one of their kids has mentioned me to them.“But the minute I got on stage, everything went calm. I grew up in a guitar shop [his father owned one], I’ve always been around older rock-heads – my dad, my uncles, the people who worked there and played in bands around Doncaster. It’s what I grew up with. I thought: ‘This is where I come from, this is going to bring me home.’”Since then, the plaudits have continued to roll in. “I truly believe when all is said done, he will stand up there with the greats,” Corgan says. “And it’s worth noting that Ozzy believed this, too.” On Friday, Yungblud released a new version of his hit Zombie featuring the Smashing Pumpkins – the US band’s first ever collaborative release with another artist.Harrison says he recently received an “amazing” letter from Robbie Williams, and his recent US tour attracted a much broader audience – “from kids to 70-year-olds”.“It’s been such a beautiful year,” he says of 2025, understandably enthused about the future. “It’s limitless, and exciting.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The singer Chappell Roan, responding toBardot’s passingat 91, posted a photo of the actor in her beehived prime on Instagram, saying she had inspired her song Red Wine Supernova and writing\": “Rest in peace Ms Bardot.”The following day, the post was hastily deleted. “Holy shit,”Roan wroteon her Instagram Stories, “I did not know all that insane shit Ms. Bardot stood for obvs I do not condone this. very disappointing to learn.”Which insane shit, Roan didn’t specify, but in truth there is plenty to choose from. The iconic mid-century image of the actor may have remained frozen in time for some, but in the real world, the persona of Bardot had long since curdled into something much uglier.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in A Very Private Affair, 1962.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLater-life Bardot was a passionate defender of animal rights, true, but she was also a committed, enthusiastic racist, who wrote of Muslims: “They slaughter women and children, our monks, our civil servants, our tourists and our sheep, one day they’ll slaughter us, and we’ll have deserved it.” Elsewhere, she wrote: “Illegal immigrants … desecrate and storm our churches, transforming them into human pigsties, defecating behind the altar, urinating against the columns, spreading their nauseating stench beneath the sacred vaults of the choir.”These views didn’t just get Bardot “cancelled”, in the modern parlance – they saw her convicted of incitement to racial hatred, five times. She also referred to gay people as “fairground freaks” and denounced#MeToo victimsas “hypocritical, ridiculous, and pointless”. And yet, after her death, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, called her the “legend of the century”, writing that “Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom”. It’s one way of looking at it.In a censorious climate in which even the manner of Roan’s deletion and retraction won hervitriol from some fans, contemporary cancel culture seems ill-equipped to respond to a woman who described the Tamil community on the island of Réunion as “natives” with “savage genes” who carried “reminiscences of cannibalism”. How can history square the contradiction of Bardot, who in her long life was both a symbol of sexual emancipation and a mouthpiece for toxicity and hate?View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot supporting the French animal protection society in Gennevilliers, Paris, in 1982.Photograph: Duclos/APCertainly, in France, no one can claim to have been shocked by Bardot’s politics, and many of her obituaries there have been clear-eyed about what she represented. Bardot “embodied racial hatred”, wrote Clément Guillou inLe Monde, and was “an exception in French culture – the only celebrity to openly defend the far right”. For more than three decades until her death, Bardot was married to Bernard d’Ormale, a senior adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front party. (Le Pen would write approvingly that Bardot was “nostalgic for a clean France”.)Brigitte Bardot, French screen legend, dies aged 91Read moreThe French dailyLibération, too, noted that the actor’s love for animals – which won her for a time, in the anglophone world at least, an enduring image as a dotty cat lady – had “gradually shifted towards an identity-based discourse where animal rights became intertwined with a racist view of France”. As a mouthpiece for the radical right in recent decades, “Brigitte Bardot no longer bothered with nuance” but lived as a recluse in her Saint-Tropez estate, “surrounded by animals and her temper”.“It is true that in France, because she was very vocal about a number of issues, she’s been much more present in her contemporary [political] incarnation than she was in the UK, where she was still mostly seen as a film star and global celebrity,” saysGinette Vincendeau, a professor emeritus of film studies at King’s College London, who has written widely on Bardot and French cinema.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot with her husband, Bernard d’Ormale, a senior adviser to Jean-Marie Le Pen, on a carriage tour through Vienna in May 2002.Photograph: Herbert P Oczeret/EPAVincendeau experienced the tension over the actor’s image this week, when she was asked to revisit her appreciation of Bardot’s contribution to French cinema and culture,publishedby the British Film Institute, to add more detail of her race-hate convictions. She had not intended to minimise Bardot’s views, says Vincendeau, “but for me, we would not be talking about Brigitte Bardot’s [politics], if she hadn’t been the film star and, to me, a very interesting pioneer figure in the representation of women – and I think that still needs to be celebrated”.Bardot never considered herself a feminist – “she came from a very privileged background and there’s a kind of entitlement to her attitude” – but she was nonetheless a hugely significant figure in the history of female sexual liberation in France, says Vincendeau. French women did not get the right to vote until 1944, she points out, and it remained a deeply conservative country even afterSimone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex was published five years later.In this context, the impact in 1956 of And God Created Woman, starring a 22-year-old Bardot as a voluptuous orphan who initiates and enjoys sex, was explosive, says Vincendeau. “The originality and the modernity of her figure was that she was not just a sex bomb. As a feminist, of course I’m absolutely aware that [this film] and all her subsequent films portrayed her body as an erotic fantasy for the male gaze. But the unique aspect of Bardot, and why she’s such an interesting figure for feminists, is that she was also a woman who expressed her own desire. She was not just reacting.”View image in fullscreenBardot, centre, is led into a court in Paris in December 2008 to face accusations of inciting racial hatred.Photograph: ReutersThe character of Juliette was created by a man – Bardot’s husband and the film’s writer-director, Roger Vadim – but when she left him forher co-star in the film, Jean-Louis Trintignant, she became associated with the same sexual wantonness, just as she was becoming a huge star. A figure of lust for men, she was also a fantasy for women, argues Vincendeau, “because there was no legal contraception or abortion so she represented a dream of emancipation for women, and a very powerful one”.“Brigitte Bardot was a prodigious catalyst: with her, we went from a withered society, riddled with moralism … to [thestudent revolutions of] May ’68,” Émilie Giaime, a lecturer in contemporary history and media studies at the Catholic Institute of Paris,said this week. “She was the fuel for this metamorphosis of French society and the new aspirations of young people.” The unconventionality that Bardot represented in the 1950s may be a long way from the inclusive sex positivity of a contemporary queer artist such as Roan, but there’s an argument that one helped create the conditions for the other.View image in fullscreenBardot in And God Created Woman, 1956.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/VestronBardot may have embraced the outspoken liberty that her stardom offered, but the crazed “Bardomania” that resulted also came at an enormous cost. She was the first target of the emerging paparazzi culture, and endured constant, wild harassment, including being forced to give birth at home in 1960 (after a pregnancy she had been clear she did not want but was unable to terminate) while her house was besieged by photographers.France’s strict, present-day privacy laws emerged in part in response to Bardot’s awful experience; Giaime argues that the trauma of this period may have helped drive her to a reclusive misanthropy after she quit acting altogether in 1973.Bardot enjoyed pushing people’s buttons, says Dr Sarah Leahy, a reader in French and film at Newcastle University – “She was a provocateur, and she enjoyed controversy” – nonetheless, her Islamophobia was unquestionably sincere. “She didn’t censor herself; she said what she thought, whether we agree with it or not, whether we consider it to be abhorrent.”Leahy has taught courses on the impact of And God Created Woman for years; recently, she says, “I’d say that there’s been a real change in students’ responses to that film. It’s really interesting. I guess it’s more difficult for them to access what that image would have been in the 50s, knowing what they know now about her.”Bardot, she adds, was “a figure from a different time”. Her contemporaries included actors like Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, women who died young and are frozen in another lifetime. Unlike them, she lived long and grew angrier.“When you start to interrogate a myth, you expose the fact that it’s impossible to have a single coherent meaning from somebody’s life, especially somebody like her, who’s done so many different things,” says Leahy. The sex object, the role model, the compassionate campaigner, the racist. Bardot was all of them."

Littler similarly adapted his production ofShe Stoops to Conquerto the interwar years, but now there are PG Wodehouse elements, most subtle but one blatant reference to Jeeves and Wooster – Jack Absolute’s manservant, Fag (Pete Ashmore) is renamed Gieves.View image in fullscreenPatricia Hodge as Mrs Malaprop and Zoe Brough as Lydia Languish.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe drama’s romances bring the comic shenanigans with Jack Absolute (Kit Young) parading as the lowly Sergeant Beverley in order to woo Lydia Languish (Zoe Brough), a bright young thing who romanticises the impoverished life while “Faulty” Faulkland (James Sheldon) emanates neurosis in his wobbly amours with Julia (Boadicea Ricketts). Patricia Hodge provides the malapropisms as Lydia’s imperious aunt who has a dubious grasp on vocabulary. Rebellion ensues and duelling male bravado is sent up, all before Jack’s father, Sir Anthony Absolute (Robert Bathurst), reinstates old-school order.It is all giddiness and froth, with an able cast, and Young a particular joy to watch for his physicality and speed. There are some sparkly eyed meta theatrical moments and a few contemporary references that slip into the period setting (one involving the TV series Traitors). Leah Harris’s movement direction is coordinated immaculately with a fast-changing set designed by Anett Black and Neil Irish.View image in fullscreen‘Faulty’ Faulkland (James Sheldon) emanates neurosis in his wobbly amours with Julia (Boadicea Ricketts).Photograph: Ellie KurttzIt is bubbly but not quite champagne, lacking the hard, sharp kick of Sheridan’s satire on power, class and poverty. The humour remains playful, unserrated around the edges, as if nothing more than a game. Hodge, in a pink froufrou hat, plays Mrs Malaprop with comic breeziness and plenty of hauteur but her version of the character lacks distinctive elements, and her romantic misfire with Lucius O’Trigger (Colm Gormley) does not land in its pathos. This is a long play, and it slackens occasionally.

In January, he will start shooting Elsinore, starring Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman, about the late Scottish actor Ian Charleson’s battle with playing Hamlet on stage. In July, he’ll premiere an adaptation of Chekhov’s Ivanov starring Chris Pine.Amid this starry schedule, he’ll return to Australia in February to direct his adaptation of Chekhov’sThe Cherry Orchard– staged entirely in Korean, with subtitles – at the Adelaide festival.View image in fullscreenStone, who describes himself as ‘obsessed with Korean culture’, will stage his adaptation of Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard entirely in Korean.Photograph: LG Arts CenterOf his homeland, which he last visited last year with his production of Kaija Saariaho’s operaInnocence, Stone muses, “Australia is so recreationally well-appointed that spending time in a dark theatre or cinema [there] is somewhat of an afterthought.”Europe has proved more simpatico. “Australians bend over backwards to get along with each other, [but] theatre is a zone of social confrontation,” says Stone. “The dip-in, dip-out attitude of Aussies to theatre, opera and film – which I very much don’t blame anyone for – isn’t enough for me. I like to serve the communities that are hungriest for my wares: culture obsessives.”View image in fullscreenStone’s production of Kaija Saariaho’s opera Innocence premiered at the prestigious Festival D’Aix-en-Provence in 2021 and came to Adelaide festival in 2025.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Jean-Louis FernandezStone’s life could have taken a very different path. At age 12, he wanted to become a marine biologist, influenced in part by his late father, Stuart, who was a biochemist and molecular biologist, and his mother, Eleanor Mackie, a veterinary scientist turned teacher.The same year, 1996, Stone witnessed the death of his father at age 45, from a heart attack while swimming. The loss spurred Stone’s great hunger for art, film and literature, through which he learned all cultures fear death and wish to leave something behind. It perhaps also fuelled his evident ambition to create and direct a huge body of work as early as possible, knowing life is finite.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAfter our interview, I send him a dedication to his father published the year after his death by a science colleague: “A reason for Stuart’s success was his approach to science. The alternative styles of research can be compared to that of artists, some fill their canvas with broad strokes and later add detail, others start with fine detail in one corner and work out from that to cover the canvas. The latter was Stuart’s style.”“Wow,” Stone replies. “I think I would definitely also be the latter! I infuriate my collaborators sometimes when they ask me what’s going to happen in another part of the play or film, and I say, ‘I have no idea yet! Let’s figure this out first!’”View image in fullscreenOscar-winner Alicia Vikander and Brendan Cowell in The Lady from the Sea at the Bridge theatre, London.Photograph: Johan PerssonBorn in Basel, Switzerland, where his father had been posted, Stone grew up bilingual in German and English and spent part of his youth in Cambridge. He always writes his plays in English, usually radically reworking classic texts.As a director, he’s developed a reputation for caging actors in transparent boxes on stage, as in his radical reworking of Ibsen’s cruel tragedyThe Wild Duck, where the actors performed behind glass walls, with radio microphones. Premiering at Sydney’s Belvoir St theatre in 2011, it became his international calling card, staged in Norway, Austria andLondon, and forming the basis for his 2015 feature directorial debut,The Daughter.The following year, he used a glass case in his adaptation of Lorca’sYermaat the Young Vic theatre, winning Olivier awards for best revival and best actress for Billie Piper. More recently, Innocence featured a two-storey revolving transparent box designed by regular collaborator Chloe Lamford, with windows into several rooms providing a voyeuristic view into a school shooting and simultaneous events.I suggest to Stone that, like a scientist, he is forensically examining human behaviour and psychology in a petri dish. “I think that’s a legitimate analysis,” he says before explaining his more practical rationale – taming actors’ exhibitionist instincts: “There’s an inherent obsession with realism on stage [but] I’m literally building the fourth wall instead of removing it.”Stone, himself an actor on stage and screen in his teens and 20s, explains: “When an actor walks down stage and looks at the audience when there’s no glass wall there, it looks like the audience is being looked at. It always looks like the actor wants to be seen … But when you put a glass wall there, the actor doesn’t see the audience, but a reflection of the house they’re in. So the actor is being less vain, because they’re not really aware of the audience. It really helps with comedy, too, because the actors say: ‘I couldn’t tell if the audience was laughing or not’. I go, ‘That’s great, because you just keep telling your story.’”Stone’s adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, which premiered in Seoul in 2024, takes place inside a house with wall-to-ceiling windows (designed by architect Saul Kim) through which we see a contemporary family eating and drinking and – like Chekhov’s aristocrat Russian family of a century earlier – contending with brutal societal changes.View image in fullscreenStaging The Cherry Orchard in Korean is ‘one of the proudest moments in my career’, says Stone.Photograph: LG Arts CenterCannes best actress winner Jeon Do-yeon (Secret Sunshine) and Emmy-nominated Park Hae-soo (Squid Game) take the main roles. “I made the approach [to the theatre company],” says Stone, who describes himself as “obsessed with Korean culture” and its “embrace of peculiarity and weirdness and extroversion suddenly flipping to introversion”.“They were like, ‘Really? You want to come to Korea and get paid a lot less to do a show here?’ and I was like, ‘Yes please’,” he says. “My instincts paid off. It’s one of the proudest moments in my career.”At home in London, German is the main language Stone speaks with his wife of eight years, the Austrian dramaturg Stefanie Hackl, while their three-year-old daughter is “very much growing up bilingual”.Although Stone doesn’t know Korean grammar, he can now recognise words easily, and because he wrote the English-language script for The Cherry Orchard (translated by Danybi Yi), he knows where emphases in sentences should fall. “No matter what language you’re speaking, the noun is important to you,” he says.Yet what of sensibilities: would he think twice about writing a joke that would be appreciated in one culture that might not fly in another, particularly one that uses another tongue?“Yes,” he says, “but interestingly a lot of my gags in English worked in Korean. There is something particularly satisfying about hearing 1,000 people in Seoul laugh at a joke you wrote in English in a kitchen in Vienna.”The Cherry Orchardruns 27 February – 1 March at the Festival Theatre as part of the Adelaide festivalExplore more on these topicsSimon StoneTheatreAdelaide festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On that day in the fall of 2025, Waymon, an 81-year-old award-winning composer, said that memories flooded back of him playing organ in the house and cooking on the potbelly stove with his mother as a child in Tryon,North Carolina. He was overjoyed to see the large tree from his youth still standing in the yard. Simone, born Eunice Waymon, lived in the 650 sq ft, three-room home with her family from 1933 to 1937.After sitting vacant and severely decayed for more than two decades, the recently restored home is now painted white, with elements of its former self sprinkled throughout the interior. On the freshly painted mint-blue wall hangs a shadow box that encases the rust brown varnish of the original home. A small piece of the Great Depression-era linoleum sits on the restored wooden floor like an island of the past in a sea of the present.“It does conjure up wonderful tears of joy in my heart and in my eyes when I stand in that house, on the porch, going into the rooms where the stove is, and I’m saying, ‘Wow, this is actually real. The house is restored,’” Waymon said. “It’s like time travel.”Sounds like activism: musicians who fight for change – in picturesRead moreThe home was bought for $95,000 in 2017 by four Black artists behind the collective Daydream Therapy LLC – the contemporary artist Adam Pendleton, the painter and sculptor Rashid Johnson, the abstract artist Julie Mehretu, and the collagist and film-maker Ellen Gallagher. For them, the structure is a assertion that Black history is worthy of investing in. The restoration comes at a time when historians and researchers say that the federal government is attempting to diminish thecontributions of Black Americans. A presidential executive order has directed the vice-president, JD Vance, to discontinue spending on programs or exhibits based on race at the Smithsonian Institution and its museums and research centers. The restoration of Simone’s childhood home could serve as an example of how privately funded projects can preserve Black history during a time when federally funded programs are under threat.On 1 September, the total rehabilitation of the home was completed after several years of planning and fundraising of nearly $850,000 in materials, construction and engineering costs for the renovation, which began in June 2024. The project has been overseen by the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund (AACHAF), which is now working with a consulting team and the Tryon community to create a long-term management and programming plan for the site. They hope to create a cultural district around the home, which is projected to open to the public for tourism in 2027.View image in fullscreenNina Simone in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1959.Photograph: Herb Snitzer/Getty Images“What I love is the fact that they didn’t destroy the basic structure of the house; they improved and restored it. So I think when the public or anyone goes into the house, they can feel the spirit and the energy that existed in that house,” Waymon said. “If one believes in spirits, one would have a sense of that when they walk in that house [that]Nina Simone, Eunice Waymon, was there. And that’s the joy I get from that. It’s very strong.”It is pivotal for cultural sites within the Black community to be given as much weight as other populations, said Tiffany Tolbert, the AACHAF’s senior director for preservation. “Being able to preserve the birth or childhood home of these icons, activists and leaders in the African American community is really important so that future generations will understand where we came from, how these individuals came to be, the icons that we know them to be and also just understanding the African American experience more broadly in this country,” she said. “Having this home still extant, having it where people can visit, where they can learn, is significant because they greatly enhance the understanding of the African American experience in the middle 20th century in itself.”‘We are the ones we have been waiting for’The Simone home first came under Pendleton’s radar in the winter of 2016, when he received a message from a museum curator who alerted him that it was for sale. At first, Pendleton considered other people who might be able to preserve and protect the home, but then he pondered the final line from poet June Jordan’sPoem for South African Women: “We are the ones we have been waiting for.”“I eventually realized that the person was not someone else. The person was me,” Pendleton said. “It was a gesture, an act that I thought could have more impact if it was a group of people joining forces to protect and preserve Nina Simone’s childhood home.””View image in fullscreenSamuel Waymon sits in front of his and Nina Simone’s recently restored childhood home in Tryon, North Carolina.Photograph: Carri Bass PhotographyWith the help of another curator friend, Pendleton brainstormed a list of fellow artists who might be interested in joining him, and Johnson, Mehretu and Gallagher quickly came onboard.When the collective bought the home the following year, Pendleton was contemplating what constituted American culture and how it was represented. The home signified Simone’s contributions to American history. “So much of how we understand our culture as a country and understand our place within it is through memory. And memory is, of course, embodied in individuals. It’s also embodied in different art forms, from painting and sculpture, and of course, in the case of Nina Simone, her music,” Pendleton said. “Her music is powerful from a formal standpoint, but also from a political and cultural one as well, as she was such a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement during her time.”Walking through the home shortly after its purchase, Pendleton was struck by how much he felt the spirit of the home. “‘This is where it all started for Nina, in this humble home,’” he recalled thinking. “And it occurred to me, in that moment, that everything starts somewhere.”The artists then worked with the AACHAF, which developed a preservation strategy for the home. In 2020, the AACHAF created a preservation easement, a legal agreement that restricts any future changes to the property and prevents demolition, which will be overseen by the historic protection non-profit Preservation North Carolina. Architectural consultants and the AACHAF created a blueprint of what the home looked like when it was first constructed by researching typical African American homes in North Carolina during the early 20th century and using an old family photograph from when the Waymons lived there. They also took clues from the materials used for the foundation and the roof to reconstruct the building and prevent further deterioration. The architects created a restoration plan that involved repairing the entryways and walls, evening out the floors, and creating an accessible ramp.View image in fullscreenAACHAF executive director Brent Leggs at the Nina Simone Childhood Home Auction Exhibition at the Pace Gallery in New York on 19 May 2023.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe AACHAF has also been involved in preserving the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane’s homes in Long Island, New York, and Philadelphia. It has also offered direct grants to the preservation of the jazz trumpeter and vocalist Louis Armstrong’s home in New York and blues singer Muddy Waters’ home in Chicago.With the Simone home, Tolbert said, “a model is being built that blends both preservation of the building and program and interpretation of these spaces with an eye of having a greater understanding of the legacy and experience of these individuals, and how the communities where they lived or shaped who they became to be, both artistically as well as in their own right as leaders in the African American community”.Pendleton and the rest of the collective have continued to act as representatives on the project. In 2023, he partnered with the AACHAF and tennis player Venus Williams to create an auction and fundraiser at the Pace Gallery in New York. The project also received funding from the Mellon and Tejemos foundations.Now that the home is restored, the AACHAF and a consulting team are working with St Luke’s CME church, where Simone’s mother, Kate Waymon, preached, to incorporate the surrounding East Side neighborhood into future programming. Pendleton sees the future of the home as being a site for reflection, he said, and to “become a place where artists go with intention to write music, for example, or to perform in the town. In other words, if it can be a mechanism that propels history.”If Simone were to visit the house today, Waymon said that his sister would be amazed and grateful that it has been restored. Along with being a representative of the building’s legacy as Simone’s last surviving sibling, Waymon is also keeping her memory alive by releasing a new duet with his sister of the song Love Me or Leave Me in mid-January 2026. His sister’s voice was recorded in 1967 and Waymon added in his own several months ago to weave the present with the past. The project is a flashback in time, similar to how he felt as he stood on the porch of his recently restored family home.Explore more on these topicsNina SimoneCivil rights movementRaceJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The visions he experienced during his recovery set him on the path to a new careerPatrick CharnleySun 4 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTShareOn the evening of Monday 1 February 2021, during the third Covid lockdown, my wife Alexa and I sat down on the sofa to have sausages and chips in front of the TV. The children were tetchy, and we were worn out from trying to home-school them while working from home, me as a lawyer in the music industry and Alexa as a charity fundraiser. But at least, Alexa said to me, we had made it through January.Then I started making strange noises. “Are you joking?” she asked. Then, “are you choking?”She knew it was my heart. Days before, my cardiologist had told me I would need surgery within the next six months to repair a leaking valve that had been getting progressively worse for years.“What if you don’t have the surgery?” Alexa had asked. I replied: “I’ll just drop down dead.” I was joking – my heart problem wasn’t thought to be  that serious – but as it turned out, I was right. By the time my dinner tray started slipping from my lap to the floor, I was already clinically dead. My heart had stopped beating and I wasn’t breathing. I was having a cardiac arrest.I am alive now only because of my wife and son who got help, my friend and neighbour Peter who gave me cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the paramedics who eventually got my heart started again – 40 minutes after I had stopped breathing.I was taken to hospital in a state of deep unconsciousness, leaving Alexa standing in our living room, where the furniture had been pushed aside and there was mud on the floor and debris from the paramedics’ equipment strewn everywhere.It would be two months before I’d return home, visually impaired and with a brain injury, my perspective on life altered completely.Part of my brain had been turned off; I only experienced sensations not thoughts – it was like the silence after a crashThe days after my cardiac arrest were a time of total contrast: Alexa was living a nightmare, not knowing whether I would live or die, while I was in a coma, oblivious to what was happening.Then, on Friday, I woke up. The hospital set up a video call for me to talk to Alexa, but I was making no sense. The following day, it became clear that I was blind. That’s when the doctors started talking to Alexa about a brain injury caused by the lack of oxygen, and her relief at me having survived turned into a sense of dread about what this might mean.A few days later, Alexa was allowed to visit me in the hospital as an exception to the lockdown rules; the doctors thought it could help me as I was so confused and disoriented. I was also hallucinating. When she arrived, I had just had a brain scan, and when she asked me about it, I told her I had been to a premiere of a film about bees.Over the coming days, when Alexa wasn’t visiting, we would video call a lot. She says I was laughing and joking as if I was hosting a dinner party, completely unaware of what had happened. She, the doctors and the nurses would tell me time and again that I’d had a cardiac arrest and that I had a brain injury, but I would immediately forget anything that I’d been told.Weeks later in neurological rehab, I underwent extensive testing which found my memory and other cognitive functions were in the bottom 2% of the population. One day in hospital I asked why my mother hadn’t been to visit, and Alexa had to tell me that she had died three years before.During the second week, my sight began to return, but only partially and I had trouble processing what I was seeing. I remember sitting by the hospital window one day, feeling cold air seeping through the window frames, craving a breath of it. It had snowed overnight, and I was looking out at Hampstead Heath, unable to understand why it was white.Throughout this time, the hallucinations – caused by the brain trying to compensate for my loss of vision – continued. One had a significant impact on me, and really my novel,This, My Second Life,came from it.In it, I was in a cottage hospital in Dublin, some time in the past. I was alone in bed in a small dark room. The door was ajar and outside a group of young nurses with lilting Irish accents were sitting round a table in the soft glow of an oil lamp, talking very quietly. Murmuring, really. I felt so looked after, like nothing could possibly hurt me, and it had a profound effect on me.I believe I had that hallucination because I was being looked after like that in real life. I still remember and am grateful for the extreme kindness of the doctors and nurses and other people working at the hospitals I stayed in, and those who have cared for me since.Around that time, I felt as a baby with a belly full of milk must feel: content and untouched by the world. Before, I’d been trying to balance a stressful job with lockdown and home schooling. Now I just sat or lay for hours without thinking about anything, floating through time. The busy part of my brain had been turned off, and all I experienced were sensations, not thoughts. It was like the silence after a monumental crash.When I returned home from hospital, I wanted to hold on to this feeling, to record it, and I began to write. I can see now that with my writing I was creating a world that reflected the tranquillity that I was experiencing. I was building a sanctuary that I could go to for that sensation of total peace.I remember a hot day, lying outdoors and writing in my notebook. I carried on like this, writing small amounts by hand, once every few days, often forgetting what I had written before, and hampered also by dyslexia and extreme fatigue from the brain injury.I see the world differently now – although I am more limited in what I can do, my life feels freerAs I wrote slowly over the next three years, I came to realise how fundamentally my experience had changed me. I see the world differently now, and although I am very limited in what I can do compared with before, my life feels freer and more open.It was important to me to have a connection to the work of my late mother, the writer Helen Dunmore. My main character is called Jago, the name of the young boy in a picture book my mother and I worked on together years ago. I also reincarnated the character of Granny Carne from my mother’s Cornish Ingo books, a wise woman as old as the hills who helps Jago adjust to his life after suffering the same health crisis as me. So, although I can’t tell my mother about my book, I am happy that there is a thread through time connecting her work to mine.When I finished writing the novel, I put it away and didn’t do anything with it. Trying to publish it would have been a step too far back into the world.But I also knew that I needed more from life than just drifting through, that I had a second chance, so I sent my novel out. When I was offered a publishing deal for it, I felt as if I was being given a new start, and I understood that writing is what I will do.In a way, This, My Second Life is not only about Jago’s second life, but about mine too. I have a lot of problems, but I am alive, I can see, I have my family and friends, and I can write. My greatest hope for my novel is that it leaves readers feeling uplifted and with the sense of peace, contentment and possibility that it has given to me.This, My Second Life by Patrick Charnley is published by Hutchinson Heinemann.

The longest swim is the 6km leg from St Agnes to Bryher; the shortest is 600 metres from Bryher to Tresco; and the island walks in between are no longer than 45 minutes. Swimmers can opt to complete the challenge in one tough day, or space it out over two – there is a party after both events.Entry is £299 for the one-day challenge on 20 September or £379 for two days (17and 18 September), no minimum fundraising,scillyswimchallenge.co.ukUltra Challenge, across the UKView image in fullscreenThose who take part in Ultra Challenge treks can tackle walks, runs or cycles of various lengths in a wide range of locations across the UKWith 18 annual events, Ultra Challenge is one of the UK’s biggest series of treks and trail runs. Fundraising is optional but popular – there are 600-plus charities to choose from and the events raise more than £12m a year for good causes. Despite the name, it doesn’t have to be ultra-challenging; beginners can try a 10km taster trek, and build up to 25km, 50km or even 100km, and participants walk or run at their own pace. There’s lots of support, too, from a training app to shuttle buses to the events, plus a medal, massage and meal at the end. Locations include coastlines and countryside in England and Wales; new this year is Scarborough to Whitby.Registration and recommended fundraising varies; next events areLondon Winter Walk, 24 and 25 January and theBath 50, 28 March,ultrachallenge.comRide the Route, London loopRailway Children is a charity that helps young people living on the street, or at risk of it, in the UK, India and Tanzania. Its annual Ride the Route event is a three-day group cycle ride covering more than 200 miles, requiring a “moderate to good” level of fitness and enough training to withstand six to eight hours a day in the saddle. The route changes every year and always follows a railway line. This year it is a circular route following the High Speed 1 line from London to Folkestone, continuing along the coast to Brighton, then back to London.£50 for one day’s cycling with £150 fundraising pledge, or £75 for all three days, with a £350 fundraising pledge, 3-6 September,railwaychildren.org.ukRace the Sun, EnglandView image in fullscreenRace the Sun challenges combine cycling with kayaking and hiking.Photograph: James VincentThis is a team challenge for two to four people across three disciplines: cycling, hiking and canoeing/ kayaking.

But just what goes in, and what should be left out?Felicity CloakeSun 4 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 4 Jan 2026 08.03 ESTShareBreakfast tacos should not be confused with tacos eaten for breakfast. Of course, they oftenareeaten for breakfast, but the stuffed flour tortillas eaten on both sides of the southern US border are quite different from thetacos mañanerosof central and southern Mexico, the rich, corn-basedtacos de canasta(“tacos in a basket”) or thesmoky beef barbacoathat Monterrey-born Lily Ramirez-Foran recalls being her dad’s favourite Sunday breakfast. Instead,Texas Monthly explains, breakfast tacos “marry the key elements of an American morning – scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes – with the Mexican staples of salsa, cheese, refried beans … genius.”Although they’re originally a Mexican creation, according to José R Ralat, the magazine’s taco editor (what a job title!), these $3 treats are now so popular north of the border that they’re the subject of regular taco wars, mostly between those who claim Austin as their spiritual home (often blow-ins, according to their fiercest critics), and those who know that no single city can take the credit. The fillings may vary, from pork chops to chilaquiles and beans to cheese, but Ralat maintains that all should be salty, soft and, above all, comforting,and told the Washington Post a few years agothat “the greatest breakfast taco is the one made at home”. Which, if you live 5,000 miles from the Mexican border, is good news indeed.The tortillasBreakfast tacos are almost always housed in flour tortillas, rather than corn ones, as befits a product of wheat-growing northern Mexico. Though corn tortillas are far older, dismissing the flour kind as inauthentic is, as Ralat explains inhis book American Tacos, the product of the collective historical amnesia that occurred when Texas separated from Mexico; flour tortillas arrived there long before Washington did. Yes, you can use corn ones, if you prefer(J Kenji López-Alt’s recipefor Serious Eats gives that option), but, for me, the pillowy pliancy of flour tortillas makes them the better choice here.View image in fullscreenLisa Fain makes her own tortillas for her breakfast tacos. All inset photos by Felicity Cloake.I can’t recommend the highly processed, palm oil-laced, long-life “wraps” that have proliferated in British supermarkets in recent years, though – they’re too big and tough, and taste weirdly sweet, too. There are some decent tortillas for sale online, but, given how important they are to this dish, you might consider making your own. Happily, they’re much easier than the corn version, thanks to a little thing called gluten. Lisa Fain, better known online asthe Homesick Texan, hasa good-looking recipe.The eggsYou don’t need to have eggs in a breakfast taco – potato and chorizo,carne guisada(beef stew) and beans and cheese are also all popular choices – but the speed-to-reward ratio of the protein-rich egg can hardly be bettered (though plant-based alternatives such as tofu will give it a run for its money). Fain fills her tacos withplain scrambled eggs, made fluffy by the addition of milk, while bothHope Rodriguez,for 34 years the art coordinator at Texas Monthly, and Reyna and Maritza Vazquez of Austin’s much fetedVeracruz All Naturalchain, add tomato and onion. Add jalapeño (Rodriguez) or coriander (the Vazquezes) to turn the eggs intohuevos a la Mexicana, named after its patriotic colours. I prefer to keep the eggs simple and add the vegetables separately, but feel free to season them as you wish.View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt opts for fried rather than scrambled egg in his breakfast tacos.American scrambled eggs, in my experience, tend to be cooked hard and fast for a dry and fluffy result, rather than a loose and creamy one – indeed, López-Alt, who confesses that he has not historically been a breakfast taco fan, blames the eggs for that. “Rubbery and sulfurous,”he writes on Serious Eats, “they become too dense to absorb any salsa and too dry to add moisture, much needed no matter how great your fresh flour or corn tortilla is.”His solution is to swap the traditional scrambled egg for a fried one, “figuring the liquid yolk would make the perfect sauce”. I can’t argue that a runny egg is always delicious, but I feel strongly that, just as an ice-cream is much more enjoyable licked from a cornet than off a little plastic spoon, tacos, like pizza slices, are best consumed without the mediation of knife or fork, which makes López-Alt’s creation a very messy affair. It does, however, look great, so if that’s your primary focus, by all means fry them instead. At the same time, you might like to take a good, hard look at your priorities.The restI’m a big fan of beans for breakfast, and therefried onesdeployed by Fain are delicious and easy to spread over a tortilla – you could use cooked black or pinto beans, but I’d recommend mashing them with a fork first or they’ll all fall out when you pick up the taco, which you absolutely must. (Alternatively, you could mash a ripe avocado and use it in much the same way.)Potatoes are another popular choice for carb-on-carb lovers. López-Alt, for instance, dices and par-boils his, then sautées them in chorizo oil until deliciously crisp, while Carol Barclay of Portland, TX, whose recipe features in a Texas Cookbook I picked up in the gift shop of the Mission San José in San Antonio, calls for frozen hash browns. Unfortunately, I fail to realise until it’s too late that Carol probably doesn’t mean the aggressively crunchy triangles beloved of a certain fast food chain, but sauteed potatoes much like López-Alt’s. Both, of course, work, but my great lumps of fried potato do make the dish rather heavier than I suspect Carol intended.View image in fullscreenReyna and Maritza Vazquez’s breakfast tacos make thrifty use of stale tortilla chips.Alternatively, you might prefer the migas taco, an Austin peculiarity that turns stale tortillas into gold – though, to my relief,the Vazquezes recipeincluded in the book The Tacos of Texas calls for ready-fried tortilla chips, which bring a very satisfying crunch to proceedings. Definitely the best thing to do with that bag that’s been open since New Year’s Eve, assuming there’s not quite enough left to make nachos.I’ve gone for beans, so I’ve skipped both chips or potatoes, not least because, as Fain wisely observes, the genius of the breakfast taco is in how easy it is to eat: unlike, say, the breakfast burrito, they’re “nimble and efficient. They easily fit in your hand and your mouth, with all your breakfast needs self-contained in one neat, little package. While I don’t advocate eating and driving (or eating and walking), these are up to the task, though they are equally as delicious in a more proper, sit-down forum.” For this reason, breakfast tacos tend to contain only a handful of fillings – because they’re small, you can always order two or three different examples to cover all bases.Fain likes hers with bacon or sausage patties, López-Alt with chorizo, Barclay with “hot sausage”, which is easy enough to recreate with sausage meat and spices (I use what purports to be a“copycat Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage” recipecontaining cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sage, black pepper and coriander), while Rodriguez offers a selection of “refried beans, bacon, chunky hash brown potatoes, and fried chorizo”. I like the salty, savoury heat of chorizo (the soft Spanish kind we get here isn’t quite the same as the looser, raw Mexican variety, but it makes a fine substitute), and the way its fat perfumes the rest of the dish, but you may prefer to use another sort of sausage or cured meat, a vegetarian alternative, or indeed leave it out together. As Fain cautions, “Whether you choose to add breakfast meat or vegetables isn’t that big of a deal, just don’t add them all at once or your breakfast taco will be unwieldy and hard to handle”.The salsaAnyone still traumatised by the sweet, gloopy jarred salsas of the past, with their aggressive notes of dried onion, will be reassured to know there are some good pre-made salsas available these days, but the best kind will always be freshly made. I try theSerious Eats versionusing charred plum tomatoes, chilli, garlic and onion, andFain’s uncle Richard’s recipe, using raw onion and garlic, plus pickled jalapeños and tinned tomatoes, which isn’t dissimilar to Rodriguez’s slightly simpler version using blackened fresh chillies. Ready-cooked fruit is quicker and gives a richer flavour, especially in midwinter, but the smoky flavour of the grilled pepper and onion proves irresistible (I’ve left the garlic raw to give the salsa a bit of an edge).View image in fullscreenHope Rodriguez’s breakfast tacos are stuffed with refried beans, bacon, chunky hash brown potatoes and fried chorizo.The extrasLópez-Alt suggests soured cream (or Mexicancrema) and coriander, Fain grated cheddar, and the Vazquezes monterey jack and avocado – top it as you wish, but know that any taco is improved by a spritz of lime juice. Also, note that if you’re making breakfast tacos for a crowd, Barclay’s recipe mixes fried sausage meat, hash browns, chopped pepper, onion, celery and beaten eggs before baking it for 45 minutes, then allowing everyone to scoop their own spoonful of warm, potatoey filling into a freshly heated tortilla. Much easier, if perhaps slightly less fun.Perfect breakfast tacosPrep15 minCook30 minMakes2, to serve 1-2For the salsa (makes about 300g; or use a ready-made one)½ small white or yellow onion, cut into chunks1-2 mild green chillies(eg, jalapeño)1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed250g whole tinned plum tomatoesSalt and black pepperFor the tacos45g chorizo cooking sausage, diced, or 1 tsp neutral oil¼ red pepper, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely sliced½ mild green chilli(eg, jalapeño), cut into rings¼ small white or yellow onion, finely sliced4 tbsp refried beans2 eggs2 medium tortillas, preferably flour10g grated cheddar, or similar (optional)1 small handful fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to serve2 lime wedges, to serveFirst make the salsa.

Second, please also note that the Chinese restaurantPoon’s, byAmy Poon, scion of the Poon’s restaurant dynasty, recently rooted itself in the New Wing.Ice-skating itself I have nothing against, but we can all agree that these slippery yuletide stampedes on temporary rinks are the polar opposite of festive, so surely it would be far better to be hiding indoors in the warmth with a round of prawn wontons, a bowl of nourishing “magic soup”, or some wind-dried meat claypot rice. Plus, when the weather outside is frightful, the decor in Poon’s is utterly delightful. So gorgeous, in fact, that within two minutes of entering this dusky, muted salmon-pink, twinkly peach, womb-like space, I found myself asking for the name and brand of the paint shade, because it felt instinctively one that, if applied to my own walls at home, would solve many existential problems.View image in fullscreenPoon’s house pickles are ‘outstanding in their sharp, measured acidity’.Unsurprisingly, I later learned that Amy Poon had hired a feng shui master to advise on the whole delightful shebang. Does feng shui really work? Who knows. But do wild rose tones, tasteful, stencilled murals, embroidered benches and heroically pretty crockery make my heart soar? Hell, yes. On one mantelpiece at the end of the room stands a large, framed photograph of Amy’s father Bill, keeping a watchful eye over proceedings. Back in the 1980s, Bill Poon, a Hong Kong migrant, was the UK’sfirstChinese chef/restaurateur to nab himself a Michelin star. Somehow, his daughter managed to escape the greasy clutches of hospitality for decades – working in, among other professions, marketing, PR and the arts – until she set up firsta short-term pop-upin Clerkenwell in 2018, followed bya wontoneriaat Carousel in central London. There’s also a thriving shop and mail-order business that sells Poon’s signature sauces, oils and wind-dried meats. Casa Dentalwayshas Poon’s Extraordinary Chilli Oil and its chilli vinegar in the fridge, because it enlivens any old leftover.View image in fullscreenPoon’s vegetarian potsticker dumplings: ‘A sumptuously brown sear and a mushy, well-seasoned filling’.Notably, Poon’s at Somerset House stands starkly apart from the rest of the business. This is far from a gift shop for Poon’s products with a few tables, but rather it’s a romantic, elegant little nook that has about it the feel of a sublime afternoon tea spot, albeit one that serves bowls of zha jiang aubergines and thick, lardo-based prawn toast that is named, somewhat cryptically, “The Hill That Amy Didn’t Die On”.The cooking here is refreshingly light, delicate and, you might even say, wholesome. Crunchy house pickles are outstanding in their sharp, measured acidity, and a further bowl of crudites with a pungent, funky, fermented tofu dip really packs a punch – that dip alone is worth booking a table for. Vegetarian potsticker dumplings have a sumptuously brown sear and a mushy, well-seasoned filling, while a bowl of silken tofu with avocado and small chunks of century egg is subtle and balm-like, rather than punchy.View image in fullscreenPoon’s beef claypot rice: ‘gloriously stodgy’.A large plate of white-cut poussin is poached perfectly, carved and served skin on and on the bone, and comes with a separate pale green spring onion, ginger and chilli relish to add as you see fit. Next up, a heavy claypot arrives filled with gloriously stodgy rice topped with minced beef and a raw, orange-yolked egg that’s mixed in tableside. Even so, there’s a sense with many of the dishes that they’ve been pared back a little, to avoid huge thrusts of umami, heat or anything cloying. Poon’s also does a £28 pre-theatre menu, and you could definitely eat your fill here without worrying about snoozing through Jersey Boys. That said, if you drink enough of the Hong Kong milk punch with lemon vodka, Lillet rosé, black tea, guava, passion fruit and condensed milk, well, you might well be due a little nap.The one dish at Poon’s that really didn’t set me on fire with happiness, however, was the duck salad, which, in comparison with its companions on the menu, felt oddly drab; there wasn’t a lot of duck or soy dressing, either, and it was a bit heavy on the cabbage. But I regained my equilibrium during a delicate trio of desserts entitled “Three Bites ofHelen Goh”, which included a very good goji berry financier, a memorable chocolate truffle with ginger, and a slice of Asian pear.Poon’s is sweet, confident, feminine, ballsy and glamorous – a lot like Amy Poon herself, in fact. This family has had restaurants in its bones for many generations, so why stop now?Poon’s at Somerset HouseNew Wing, Somerset House, Lancaster Place, London WC2, 020-7759 1888. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-4pm, dinner 5-10.30pm.
