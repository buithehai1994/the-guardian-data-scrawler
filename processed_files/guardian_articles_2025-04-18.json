Teachers also raised concerns about parents who refuse to accept school rules or take responsibility for their children’s behaviour.One teacher told the union: “A lot of the students are influenced by Tate and Trump, they spout racist, homophobic, transphobic and sexist comments in every conversation and don’t believe there will be consequences.”The NASUWT’s general secretary, Patrick Roach, told the union’s annual conference on Friday: “Two in three teachers tell us that social media is now a critical factor contributing to bullying and poor pupil behaviour.Ministers raise concern over NASUWT move for ‘combative’ ex-FBU chiefRead more“Pupils who believe it is their inalienable right to access their mobile phones throughout the school day – and use them to interrupt lessons, bully others, act out, or to garner respect from their peers.”One primary teacher said: “I have had boys refuse to speak to me, and speak to a male teaching assistant instead, because I am a woman and they follow Andrew Tate and think he is amazing with all his cars and women and how women should be treated. These were 10-year-olds.”Others reported instances of boys “barking at female staff and blocking doorways … as a direct result of Andrew Tate videos”. Another teacher said: “Pupils watch violent and extreme pornographic material. Their attention spans have dropped. They read lots of fake news and sensationalised stories that make them feel empowered and that they know better than the teacher.”Roach said the union had “positive discussions” with ministers about tackling the problem but warned that restricting access to mobile phones during the school day did not go far enough. “We now need a plan to tackle what has become a national emergency,” he said.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know the rise of dangerous influencers is having a damaging impact on our children, which is why we are supporting the sector in their crucial role building young people’s resilience to extremism as part of our plan for change.“That’s why we provide a range of resources to support teachers to navigate these challenging issues, and why our curriculum review will look at the skills children need to thrive in a fast-changing online world.“This is on top of wider protections being brought in for children with the Online Safety Act, to ensure children have an age-appropriate experience online.”The Liberal Democrats, however, said the union’s findings showed that more needed to be done. “Toxic algorithms are pushing many children into dark corners of the internet, where sinister attitudes that cause terrible harm in the real world, including in our schools, are free to develop,” the party’s education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said.Delegates to the NASUWT conference in Liverpool heard that parents had become increasingly hostile, and even violent, when called in to discuss their child’s behaviour.Lindsay Hanger, a delegate from Norwich, said unacceptable behaviour was being tolerated in many schools in England because of a need to meet attendance targets “at any cost” and avoid suspensions or exclusions.“I think the government needs to go further, with a strategy to ensure that all parents of school-aged children are expected to uphold behaviour strategies or risk their child being denied their place in the classroom,” Hanger said.The conference passed a motion instructing the union to oppose “no exclusion” policies being legitimised across the education sector – a reference to campaigns seeking to end or curtail the use of exclusions.Roach also told the conference that the union wanted “a real-terms pay award for teachers this autumn that is funded fully”, warning that anything less “will be met with the response from our members it deserves”.Roach told Schools Week newspaper that the NASUWT wouldhold a formal strike ballotin England if the government ignored recommendations for above-inflation pay increases by the independent pay review body.The conference also passed a motion ordering NASUWT leaders to rule out a merger with the National Education Union (NEU) or other unions. Some members are concerned that Matt Wrack, the former leader of the Fire Brigades Union and theleading candidate to replace Roachas general secretary, supports a merger with the more leftwing NEU.Explore more on these topicsPupil behaviourSocial mediaSchoolsTeachingTrade unionsShareReuse this content"

At the heart of her visit, though, will be talks with the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, whom British officials regard as one of their most likely allies in negotiating a deal.With Donald Trumptalking aboutcoming to the UK for a state visit in September, officials are increasingly hopeful they can agree tariff reductions in the coming months or even weeks.The US president and Keir Starmer spoke to each other by phone on Friday afternoon, with trade top of the agenda. It was the first time the two leaders had spoken since Trump made his tariff announcement.Downing Street said they discussed “the ongoing and productive discussions between the UK and US on trade”. A spokesperson said: “The prime minister reiterated his commitment to free and open trade and the importance of protecting the national interest.” One source said the call lasted 35 minutes.A senior government source had said earlier that Reeves would “make the argument for a trade relationship that is deeper and more open that the one on the table at the moment”.The chancellor said earlier this week that “active negotiations” were ongoing. “Any deal that’s able to be secured will always have front and centre British national interest,” she said.Ministers have put a trade deal at the top of their list of priorities for US-UK relations. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said a full-blown global trade warcould wipe 1%off gross domestic product in 2026-27.UK officials are pessimistic about their chances of persuading Trump to give them an exemption from his 10% global tariff, but they hope to be able to agree reductions to the 25% rates being promised on certain items.British officials have presented a draft deal to their US counterparts that includes reductions to tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Sources say it does not cover pharmaceuticals, however. Trump has said he will announce tariffs for the sector “very shortly” that could cost British drug companies billions of pounds in revenue.Pharmaceuticals are the UK’s second-biggest export to the US at about £7bn, after cars which account for about £8bn.In return, the UK has offered to reduce the headline rate of its digital services tax, which is currently paid by a small number of US technology companies.1:51Starmer says he will act in UK's national interest over Trump's tariffs – videoSources said the proposed agreement was relatively narrow in nature but that a broader trade deal could be still be worked on afterwards. A more wide-ranging trade agreement would face political difficulties, however, such as UK resistance to importing chlorinated chicken and other meat, and the US desire to sell goods and services to the NHS.Trump and his key officials have given positive signals in recent days about the chance of getting a deal signed soon. Some reportssuggest US officials hope to have it completed in as soon as three weeks’ time.Trump’s press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, said on Wednesday that the US would be announcing its first deals “very soon”, and the vice-president, JD Vance, saidon Thursday: “There’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”Trump said on Thursday night that he was expecting to travel to the UK in September for a second state visit, calling the prospect “beautiful”.One British official said: “They have the outline agreement, we presented it to them before the tariff announcement. The ball is in their court. The only question is: do they want to do a deal or not?”Reeves’ meeting with Bessent, who is not one of the tariff hardliners in theTrump administration, will cover the trade deal as well as wider questions about the global economy.The Guardian view on a UK-US trade deal: MPs must get a vote on any agreement with Trump | EditorialRead moreA government source said Reeves would not be negotiating directly with Bessent but would present an argument “making clear our overarching view on free trade”, underlining the UK’s key priorities of steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.Bessent has prioritised the UK along with countries such as Japan, Australia, South Korea and India in the 90-day pause on higher tariffs, but ge told Yahoo Finance this week that not all trade deals were likely to be completed within the window.During her US trip, Reeves will also take part in a panel hosted by the IMF in which she will argue for more free and open trade and reform of international financial institutions to take account of the new global economic realities.The source said Reeves would say that countries and institutions must recognise that change has happened, and that bodies such as the IMF, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank need to adapt.The chancellor will also meet business leaders as she hopes to drum up investment opportunities for the UK, pitching it as a safe haven in a tumultuous economic world. She will have discussions with finance leaders from Europe and India as Britain tries to improve its trading relationships with partners outside the US.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyRachel ReevesEconomic policyTrump tariffsUS foreign policyTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “But hopefully we won’t have to do that.”Trump declined to give a “specific number of days” for when the US would stop trying to negotiate a truce. “But quickly. We want to get it done.”Asked whether he was being “played” by Putin, Trump said: “Nobody’s playing me, I’m trying to help.”Trump’s comments came after the US secretary of state,Marco Rubiosaid the US was ready to abandon its efforts “within days.Speaking in Paris on Friday after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said Trump was still interested in a deal. But he added that the US president had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress.“It is not our war. We didn’t start it,” Rubio said, adding that if a deal were not possible – with both sides still far apart – the US president was “probably at a point where he’s going to say, well, we’re done”. Trump felt “very strongly” about this, he said.Rubio’s comments were the clearest signal yet that the White House is ready to walk away from its diplomatic attempts to negotiate an end to the war. It was unclear if this would also mean an end to US military assistance to Kyiv. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that deliveries had already “practically stopped”.0:40Trump says US will ‘take a pass’ on Ukraine peace deal ‘if parties make it difficult’ – videoLast month Zelenskyy agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin, however, has rejected the plan. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that ending the war was “not a simple topic”. Moscow was seeking a settlement that “ensured its own interests”, he added.In recent weeks Russia has launched a fresh military push across the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and stepped up its air attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. On Sunday itbombed the city of Sumy, killing 35 people and injuring 117.Since Trump returned to the White House in January he haspiled pressure on Ukraine, stopping most US military assistance and temporarily cutting off intelligence sharing. This week he falsely blamed Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.In contrast, Trump has refused to criticise the Russian president or to impose sanctions on or punish Moscow. Senior US officials – including thespecial envoy Steve Witkoff, who held talks last week with Putin in St Petersburg – have instead parroted Kremlin talking points.According to Bloomberg, the latest US peace plan presented on Thursday to European leaders would in effect freeze the war along the existing frontline.Russiawould keep the territory it occupies, while Kyiv would not be allowed to join Nato.Talks are due to continue in London next week. US officials conceded that the proposal would be irrelevant if the Kremlin did not agree to stop the fighting, and said security guarantees were essential for Ukraine if the deal were to work, Bloomberg reported.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio (right) with Steve Witkoff at the Paris talks.Photograph: Tschaen Eric/Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockThe US vice-president, JD Vance, speaking in Rome after a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said he was optimistic “the very brutal war” could be stopped. “Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on,” he said.Meanwhile, significant details of the minerals deal remain unclear, including whether Kyiv has agreed to a White House demand that it “pays back” the cost of earlier military assistance.Zelenskyy was poised in February to sign a framework agreement over a wide-ranging economic partnership. It was derailed after his disastrous encounter with Trump and Vance in the Oval Office.Since then negotiations have continued. Overnight, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, said a memorandum had been finalised. It paved the way for the setting up of an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, she indicated.“We are happy to announce the signing with our American partners,” she said. Speaking to reporters in the White House, Trump said a deal could be signed next Thursday.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, added: “We’re still working on the details.” He said the latest version ran to 80 pages and was “substantially what we’d agree on previously”. “That’s what we will be signing,” he said.According to the latest draft, seen by the Guardian, Ukraine acknowledges the “significant material and financial support” Kyiv has received from the US since Russia’s 2022 invasion and the desire from both countries for a “lasting peace”.It says Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, will visit Washington next week to hold final “technical talks” with Bessent. They are expected to complete discussions on a “reconstruction investment fund”, the memo adds.The deal would need to be ratified by Ukraine’s parliament, Ukraine’s deputy minister of economy said on Friday.Ukraine war briefing: China arming Russia and building weapons on its soil, says ZelenskyyRead moreZelenskyy is keen to improve relations with the Trump administration. At the same time, he hasso far rejected the White House’s demandthat revenue from the new joint fund is used to cover the cost of weapons deliveries provided by the Biden administration.Trump has previously said Ukraine “owes” the US $300bn (£226bn). Zelenskyy has pointed out this assistance was given as a grant, not as a loan, with Republicans and Democrats approving it in Congress. Any future partnership has to be based on “parity”, and should benefit both countries, he says.The deal may help US weapons manufacturers, who are facinga critical shortfall of key rare-earth mineralsimported from China. Beijing has restricted its export in response to Trump’s escalating trade war.Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy thinktank in Kyiv, said the deal had gone through “multiple iterations”. He added: “It’s hard to say what’s inside.”Landa said he did not expect Kyiv to accept that previous “non-refundable military aid” was now “debt”. “That’s not only unfair and unrealistic, but may also negatively affect the full global financial system,” he said.He continued: “If it suddenly turns out that countries and organisations can demand payments for aid given unconditionally in previous years, it will make recipients more cautious, and could reopen difficult issues from previous decades around the world.”The latest negotiations came as Russia killedone person and injured about 70 in a ballistic missile strike on a residential area of the city of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine. Five of the injured were children. There were also strikes on Dnipro, Kyiv and Mykolaiv, as well as the Donetsk region.“This is how Russia began this Good Friday – with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shaheds – maiming our people and cities,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the Russians used ballistic missiles equipped with cluster munitions. “That is why the affected areas are so extensive,” he said. At least 20 blocks of flats, 30 houses and an educational institution were damaged.On Palm Sunday Russiadropped two Iskander missiles in the city centre of Sumy. One of them hit a congress centre. The other exploded between two university buildings and next to a crowded bus and cars.Explore more on these topicsUkraineMarco RubioRussiaUS foreign policyUS politicsTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As she spent the past 18 months of war documenting airstrikes, the demolition of her home, the endless displacement and the killing of 11 family members, all she demanded was that she not be allowed to go quietly.“If I die, I want a loud death,” Hassouna wrote on social media. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time, and a timeless image that cannot be buried by time or place.”On Wednesday, just days before her wedding, 25-year-old Hassouna was killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit her home in northern Gaza. Ten members of her family, including her pregnant sister, were also killed.The Israeli military said it had been a targeted strike on a Hamas member involved in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.‘In Gaza, a press vest makes you a target’: the journalists who have paid a price for reporting on the warRead moreTwenty-four hours before she was killed, it was announced that a documentary focusing on Hassouna’s life in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began would be debuted at a French independent film festival that runs parallel to Cannes.Made by the Iranian director Sepideh Farsi, the film, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, tells the story of Gaza’s ordeal and the daily life of Palestinians through filmed video conversations between Hassouna and Farsi. As Farsi described it, Hassouna became “my eyes in Gaza … fiery and full of life. I filmed her laughs, her tears, her hopes and her depression”.“She was such a light, so talented. When you see the film you’ll understand,” Farsi told Deadline. “I had talked to her a few hours before to tell her that the film was in Cannes and to invite her.”She said she had lived in fear for Hassouna’s life but added: “I told myself I had no right to fear for her, if she herself was not afraid. I clung to her strength, to her unwavering faith.”Farsi, who lives in exile in France, said she feared that Hassouna had been targeted for her much-followed work as a photojournalist and recently publicised participation in the documentary. Gaza has been the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history, with more than 170 killed since 2023, though some estimates put it as high as 206.Since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza, after the attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, more than 51,000 people have been killed, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Since the ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March, Israel has resumed its deadly airstrikes with vigour, and at least 30 people were killed in strikes on Friday.Fellow journalists in Gaza reacted with grief and anger at the news that an Israeli airstrike had taken Hassouna from them, just as she had feared it would. “She documented massacres through her lens, amid bombardment and gunfire, capturing the people’s pain and screams in her photographs,” said Anas al-Shareef, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Gaza.Miqdad Jameel, another Gaza-based journalist, called on people to “see her photos, read her words – witness Gaza’s life, the struggle of its children in war, through her images and her lens”.Her death prompted a statement from the Cannes Acid film festival, where Farsi’s documentary will be screened in May. “We had watched and programmed a film in which this young woman’s life force seemed like a miracle,” they said. “Her smile was as magical as her tenacity. Bearing witness, photographing Gaza, distributing food despite the bombs, mourning and hunger. We heard her story, rejoiced at each of her appearances to see her alive, we feared for her.”Haidar al-Ghazali, a Palestinian poet in Gaza, saidin a post on Instagramthat before she was killed, Hassouna had asked him to write a poem for her when she died.Speaking of her arrival into a kinder afterlife, it read: “Today’s sun won’t bring harm. The plants in the pots will arrange themselves for a gentle visitor. It will be bright enough to help mothers to dry their laundry quickly, and cool enough for the children to play all day. Today’s sun will not be harsh on anyone.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesJournalist safetyIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes a month after unredacted files related to the 1963 assassination of president John F Kennedy were disclosed. The earlier documents gave curious readers more details about cold- war era covert US operations in other nations but did not initially lend credence to long-circulating conspiracy theories about who killed JFK, RFK’s brother.Robert Kennedy was fatally shot on 5 June 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, moments after giving a speech celebrating his victory in California’s presidential primary. His assassin,Sirhan Sirhan, was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving life in prison.The files included pictures of handwritten notes by Sirhan.“RFK must be disposed of like his brother was,” read the writing on the outside of an empty envelope with the return address from the district director of the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles.Sirhan also filled a page of a Pasadena City College notebook with variations of “RFK must die” and “RFK must be killed.” In a note dated 18 May 1968, he wrote: “My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more of an unshakable obsession.”In another of the newly released documents, the assassin said he advocated for “the overthrow of the current president”. The Democrat Lyndon Johnson was in the White House at the time of RFK’s death.“I have no absolute plans yet, but soon will compose them,” wrote Sirhan, who pledged support for communist Russia and China.The newly released files also included notes from interviews with people who knew Sirhan from a wide variety of contexts, such as classmates, neighbors and coworkers. While some described him as “a friendly, kind and generous person”, others depicted a brooding and “impressionable” young man who felt strongly about his political convictions and briefly believed in mysticism.According to the files, Sirhan told his garbage collector that he planned to kill Kennedy shortly after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated on 4 April 1968. The co-worker, a Black man, said he planned to vote for Kennedy because he would help Black people.“Well, I don’t agree,” Sirhan replied, the man told investigators. “I am planning on shooting the son of a bitch”.FBIdocuments describe interviews with a group of tourists who had heard rumors about Kennedy being shot weeks before his death. Several people who visited Israel in May 1968 said a tour guide told them Kennedy had been shot. One person said he heard that an attempt on Kennedy’s life had been made in Milwaukee. Another heard that he was shot in Nebraska.The National Archives and Records Administration posted 229 files containing the pages to its public website. Many files related to the assassination had been previously released – but others had not been digitized and sat for decades in federal government storage facilities.Trump, a Republican, has championed in the name of transparency the release of documents related to high-profile assassinations and investigations. But he’s also been deeply suspicious for years of the government’s intelligence agencies. His administration’s release of once-hidden files opens the door for additional public scrutiny and questions about the operations and conclusions of institutions such as the CIA and the FBI.Trump signed an executive order in January calling for the release of government documents related to the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and King after their killings within two months of each other.Lawyers for Kennedy’s killer have said for decades that he is unlikely to reoffend or pose a danger to society. And in 2021, a parole board deemed Sirhan suitable for release. But California governor Gavin Newson rejected the decision in 2022, keeping him in state prison. In 2023 , a different panel denied him release, saying he still lacks insight into what caused him to shoot Kennedy.The late senator’s sonRobert F Kennedy Jr, who now serves as Trump’s health and human services secretary, commended the president and his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, for what he called their “courage” and “dogged efforts” to release the files.“Lifting the veil on the RFK papers is a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government,” Kennedy Jr said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsRobert KennedyUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Scientists claim to have found colour no one has seen beforeContested discovery achieved by experiment firing laser pulses into eyes, stimulating retina cellsIan SampleScience editorFri 18 Apr 2025 14.00 EDTShareAfter walking the Earth for a few hundred thousand years, humans might think they have seen it all. But not according to a team of scientists who claim to have experienced a colour no one has seen before.The bold – and contested – assertion follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. By stimulating individual cells in the retina, the laser pushed their perception beyond its natural limits, they say.Their description of the colour is not too arresting – the five people who have seen it call it blue-green – but that, they say, does not fully capture the richness of the experience.“We predicted from the beginning that it would look like an unprecedented colour signal but we didn’t know what the brain would do with it,” said Ren Ng, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley. “It was jaw-dropping. It’s incredibly saturated.”The researchers claimed this square was the closest colour match they had to olo.Photograph: SuppliedThe researchers shared an image of a turquoise square to give a sense of the colour, which they named olo, but stressed that the hue could only be experienced through laser manipulation of the retina.“There is no way to convey that colour in an article or on a monitor,” said Austin Roorda, a vision scientist on the team. “The whole point is that this is not the colour we see, it’s just not. The colour we see is a version of it, but it absolutely pales by comparison with the experience of olo.”Humans perceive the colours of the world when light falls on colour-sensitive cells called cones in the retina. There are three types of cones that are sensitive to long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths of light.Natural light is a blend of multiple wavelengths that stimulate L, M and S cones to different extents. The variations are perceived as different colours. Red light primarily stimulates L cones, while blue light chiefly activates S cones. But M cones sit in the middle and there is no natural light that excites these alone.The Berkeley team set out to overcome the limitation. They began by mapping a small part of a person’s retina to pinpoint the positions of their M cones. A laser is then used to scan the retina. When it comes to an M cone, after adjusting for movement of the eye, it fires a tiny pulse of light to stimulate the cell, before moving on to the next cone.The result, published inScience Advances, is a patch of colour in the field of vision about twice the size of a full moon. The colour is beyond the natural range of the naked eye because the M cones are stimulated almost exclusively, a state natural light cannot achieve. The name olo comes from the binary 010, indicating that of the L, M and S cones, only the M cones are switched on.The claim left one expert bemused. “It is not a new colour,” said John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George’s, University of London. “It’s a more saturated green that can only be produced in a subject with normal red-green chromatic mechanism when the only input comes from M cones.” The work, he said, had “limited value”.The researchers believe the tool, named Oz vision after the Emerald City in the L Frank Baum books, will help them probe basic science questions about how the brain creates visual perceptions of the world. But it may have other applications. Through bespoke stimulation of cells in the retina, researchers might learn more about colour blindness or diseases that affect vision such asretinitis pigmentosa.Will the rest of the world get the chance to experience olo for themselves? “This is basic science,” said Ng. “We’re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology.”Explore more on these topicsScienceBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

They did not say whether the product would be discontinued outside the UK.The announcement comes as the UK enters the Easter bank holiday weekend, when chocolate sales usually soar.By Friday afternoon, the bar was out of stock on the Waitrose website as social media users urged people to stock up.The bar is believed to be a portmanteau of the surname of the bar’s inventor, Theodor Tobler, andtorrone, a toasted-almond nougat confection typical of Christmas traditions in south-western Europe.This is not the first time it has grabbed the headlines. In 2023 Mondelēz said the image ofthe Matterhorn mountain peak would be removed from Toblerone packagingafter some production was moved outside Switzerland. In 2016it increased the gaps between the triangular chocolate chunks.This is by no means the first time that chocolate connoisseurs have seen their favourite bars removed from supermarket shelves.Last year, Nestlé confirmed that it was “taking away” Breakaway bars from food production lines. The Swiss food firm said it discontinued the bar because of dwindling sales of the one-time lunch-box staple.Milky Way Crispy Rolls were discontinued in 2022 to the dismay of many but, earlier this year, Mars reintroduced the product and new variations of the chocolate-wafer bar including Bounty and Twix versions.The end of the dark chocolate Toblerone comes as consumers have found a taste for “Dubai chocolate”, a chocolate bar containing a filling of pistachio cream and toasted knafeh, a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made from shredded filo.Lindor recently released its own version of the viral treat, priced at £10 a bar. Lidl has also launched a more affordable take on the nutty chocolate at £4.99 each.Shoppers queued outside Lidl stores around the country to buy one of the supermarket’s bars and they reportedly sold out within hours.The news also comes amidrising cocoa prices, which reached a record high in December. The price of chocolate rose by 13.6% in the year to March, according to Office for National Statistics figures.Some consumers have complained about soaring Easter egg prices, with some having risen by as much as 50% compared to last year according to a Which? investigation.Many products have not only gone up in price, but have also shrunk in size. The Which? investigation found that the price of a white chocolate Twix Easter egg from Tesco had increased from £5 to £6 year-on-year. It also shrank from 316g to 258g. In terms of price per 100g, this constitutes a rise of 47%.The consumer group also found that a five-pack of mixed 200g Cadbury Creme Eggs bought at Morrisons had increased from £2.62 last year to £4 this year.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryChocolateConsumer affairsSupermarketsRetail industryMondelēznewsShareReuse this content"

After leading on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, she became executive director of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), staying there until October 2023.The supreme court’s 88-page judgment hasupended two decades of policymakingon trans rights, with police forces, hospitals and other public agencies rapidly rewriting their approaches to trans inclusion.Its ruling said that while the word “biological” did not appear in the Equality Act’s definition of man or woman, “the ordinary meaning of those plain and unambiguous words corresponds with the biological characteristics that make an individual a man or a woman”.The former supreme court justice, Lord Sumption, questioned the way Wednesday’s judgment had been interpreted.Sumption said: “I think it’s quite important to note that you are allowed to exclude trans women from these [single-sex] facilities. But you are not obliged to do it.“So, for example, the authorities of a sport such as women’s boxing, women’s football, are allowed to limit it to biological women. They were not in breach of the discrimination rules of the Equalities Act.“But the judgment does not mean that the sporting authorities have got to limit women’s boxing or women’s football to biological women.”Kishwer Falkner, the EHRC chair, said on Thursday the commission wasrapidly drafting new statutory guidanceon how the court’s “enormously consequential” ruling affected single-sex toilets, sports and health services, and the rights of trans people to access those services.The court emphasised, however, that trans people still had clear legal protection against harassment and discrimination, and to rights under equal-pay legislation.If Britain is now resetting the clock on trans rights, where will that leave us? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreLady Falkner said the “new legal reasoning” was “a victory for common sense”, but “only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense”.The court’s judgment followed a legal challenge by the gender-critical group ForWomenScotland against the Scottish government over its decision to allow trans women to take places set aside on public boards for women.The Scottish government, which argues it was closely following UK law and the EHRC’s guidance, said it was meeting the commission next week and was seeking an “urgent” meeting with the UK government to discuss the next steps.A senior Scottish minister is expected to update Holyrood next week on its response to the ruling.The supreme court’s decision to state definitively that the Equality Act could only refer to biological women or men was based heavily on the act’s mention of women in the sections on pregnancy and maternity provision.Field claims those clauses were changed on the instruction of ministers for political reasons to emphasise womanhood, despite the risks that could undermine the rights of a trans man who became pregnant. That “undermines the coherence of the drafting and I fear that this anomaly played a significant role in the approach taken by the court,” she said.Field told the Guardian she was not trying to pick a fight with the court. “Their role is interpreting parliament’s intention and, in so far as they’ve sought to interpret parliament’s intention, I’m pointing out what I know about what parliament’s intention was, which was not the conclusions they have come to,” she said.“It’s not for me to say that the supreme court has got it wrong, but what I’m saying is that the basis on which the act was drafted was not to give sex the meaning that they have concluded it has.”Trans rights groups, trade unions and community organisations said they would hold an emergency demonstration in central London on Saturday to demand justice for trans people.The rally will be held at 1pm in Parliament Square in Westminster.A spokesperson for Trans Kids Deserve Better, one of the organisations supporting the protest, said: “Though this ruling has brought another wave of fear to the trans community, we will continue to fight for our rights and freedoms.“We will stand strong against hate and fearmongering and continue to support our friends and siblings no matter how hard it gets.”Explore more on these topicsGenderWomenTransgenderUK supreme courtShareReuse this content"

Instead, dolphin-watching tourists inWaleswere confronted with the shocking and grisly sight of four adult bottlenose dolphins pursuing and killing a common dolphin calf.The trip, in Cardigan Bay, was operated by Dolphin Spotting Boat Trips and the Sea Watch Foundation (SWF), a charity that monitors the dolphins in the bay to inform and advise on their conservation status and protection.Dylan Coundley-Hughes, an intern with the SWF, was on the trip, on which tourists go dolphin-watching alongside experts who are photographing and collecting data on the cetacean population.He said: “While conducting a boat survey on behalf of the Sea Watch Foundation aboard a dolphin-spotting wildlife tour, we observed intense splashing and dolphin activity. At first, we saw something flung into the air and suspected a porpoise, but to our disbelief it was a common dolphin calf, making this encounter an interspecific infanticide.“I was filming for a personal documentary at the time and couldn’t believe I had captured such a rare behaviour between different dolphin species. It was both remarkable and heartbreaking to witness.”The attack could have been prompted by competition for resources such as prey, experts from the SWF said.A postmortem of the calf will be conducted by the UK cetacean strandings investigation programme, which may provide more information.Katrin Lohrengel, who runs the SWF’s Cardigan Bay monitoring project, said: “Bottlenose dolphins have a very wholesome reputation, but many people are not aware that male dolphins have been known to commit infanticide; they kill bottlenose dolphin calves. They have also been documented killing harbour porpoises and often show aggression to other cetacean species.“Both infanticide and ‘porpicide’ are known to occur in Cardigan Bay, but we have never witnessed interspecific aggression towards common dolphins before. While it’s not surprising that this behaviour is taking place, it’s very rare to witness it and even rarer to catch it on film.”Bottlenose dolphins are common around the UK and are also often seen in the Moray Firth and off the coast of Cornwall. Common dolphins, sometimes referred to as short-nosed common dolphins, are usually smaller. They are highly social animals and are normally found in groups.Explore more on these topicsDolphinsCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifeAnimal behaviourWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

But it isn’t clear whether theTrump administrationhasthreatened to give up on a Russia-Ukraine peace dealas a negotiating tactic or simply because it lacks the concentration for a complicated negotiation – a shortcoming that has dogged the administration’sforeign policythrough its first three months in office.Standing on a tarmac in Paris, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, issued a threat that the US could simply“move on”from mediating the biggest military conflict in Europe since the second world war. That would be the latest about-face for an administration that has already taken a back seat on negotiating a peace in Gaza and retreated on implementing worldwide tariffs that shook financial markets around the globe earlier this month.Diplomacy, it turns out, is hard.The 24 hours that Donald Trump promised he would need to halt the fighting in Ukrainehave long since passed. And the administration has done little of the hard diplomatic work that was required to secure landmark deals like the Dayton agreement or the Camp David accords in the past.US ready to abandon Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress, says Marco RubioRead moreThere have been plenty of meetings: Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has spoken three times with Vladimir Putin, during which he has listened to the Kremlin leader’s thoughts onUkrainefor hours, and Rubio was on the phone with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and met with Ukrainian officials and European leaders in Paris on Thursday.But there are few indications that new ground has been struck, that the US has exerted any pressure on the Kremlin or that the negotiations have identified what kinds of security guarantees would exist to ensure thatRussiawouldn’t simply continue the war when it sees fit. One element of a “Trump deal” appears to be this: that it doesn’t take very long or involve very much effort to achieve.“We’re not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,” Rubio said, noting that the US wanted to stop “thousands” of people from dying in the next year. “So if they’re serious about peace – either side, or both – we want to help. If it’s not going to happen, then we’re just going to move on. We’re going to move on to other topics that are equally if not more important in some ways to the United States.”Rubio clearly wished to vent frustration on Friday, a day after Trump had said in the White House that he was waiting for Russia’s response to the proposed framework for a peace deal and expected to have it this week. The White House appears to be increasingly frustrated with Moscow, something that both European and Ukrainian officials had hoped would take place.But if Trump walks away from a deal and the war altogether, the decision will still play into Putin’s hands – relieving Ukraine of a key ally and financial backer in its fight against Russia. Moscow appears to see the situation as a win-win: either taking a favourable deal with the White House or waiting for Trump to lose patience. Which he is now threatening to do.There are more hopeful voices in the administration. JD Vance, the Ukraine-sceptic vice-president, told Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday that he felt “optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close”. There had been “some things … even in the past 24 hours” that he said could indicate a chance to secure a ceasefire.But to listen to Rubio or Witkoff, the various sides have barely moved from their opening positions. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the United States had offered Russia some sanctions relief in exchange for a deal – something that Rubio had offered as far back as his confirmation hearings in January. And Witkoff appeared surprised on Fox News that Russia wanted “so much more” than just a ceasefire. “I mean, it’s just a lot of detail attached to it,” he said. “It’s a complicated situation from, you know – rooted in some real problematic things happening between the two countries.”There was always an expertise gap in the difficult negotiations over a ceasefire to the Russian war in Ukraine. Now the administration appears to have a patience gap and has signaled it is ready to walk away. Ukraine does not have that option.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMarco RubioEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Even if it decided to identify as a blunt for the purposes of this celebration, it would remain objectively, provably and demonstratively a cigar.”It was a typical response from the 59-year-old multimillionaire creator of the Harry Potter franchise, who has over recent years regularly utilised social media in her support of women-only spaces, and who has been a vocal and financial supporter of For Women Scotland,having donated £70,000 to the group’s crowdfundingfor the legal challenge that culminated inWednesday’s ruling.The writer has evolved from celebrated laureate of children’s literature to a fearless figurehead for gender-critical campaigners: someone willing to have battles on X in particular, where she is something of a lightning rod, who fights fire with fire, and seemingly cannot be cowed.View image in fullscreenPeople including Susan Smith and  Marion Calder, the directors of For Women Scotland, celebrate outside the supreme court in London on Wednesday.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockSupporters will say Rowling’s financial contribution has been important, though point out the lesser sums donated by hundreds of other women to the crowdfunding were equally so. Her vocal support, however, has been of even greater consequence. They admire her doggedness, her clear-sightedness as an uncompromising feminist. She is, they believe, strategic.Detractors are highly vocal in accusing her of transphobia, of using provocative language. They question her claims about transitioning, and detransitioning. She has been labelled a Terf (trans–exclusionary radical feminist).She denies she is transphobic, having said she respects “every trans person’s right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them”.Rowling’s first public foray into this space came in December 2019 when she tweeted support forMaya Forstater,a tax specialist who lost her job at a thinktank after tweeting that transgender women could not change their biological sex.Then, in June 2020, Rowling posted a link to an article headlined “Creating a more equal post-Covid-19 world for people who menstruate”, to whichshe commented: “‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?”She said: “If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of so many to meaningfully discuss their lives.”The furore that followed led her topost an essay on her websiteoutlining her concerns over “the new trans activism”. She described herself as a “domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor” who had been “triggered” by learning the Scottish government was “proceeding with its controversial gender recognition plans”.She had spoken up about the importance of sex, she added, “and have been paying the price ever since.

In Charles Crichton’s A Fish Called Wanda (1988), John Cleese’s character is called Archie Leach. Leach is, of course, the real name ofCary Grant– a very goofy and unglamorous sounding name compared with the sonorous “Cary Grant” – and a rare example of Hollywood alluding to the open secret of rebranding its stars and effacing the bland ordinariness of their origins.Peter BradshawUn oeuf is enough: have we had our fill of movie Easter eggs?Read moreA tribute to TechnobladeMy children dragged me toA Minecraft Movierecently. Packed screening. Loads of kids. A little way into the film, a pig crossed the screen wearing a crown, and a collective “Awww” rose from the audience. For the life of me I couldn’t understand why, and then my 10-year-old leaned over and explained it. The pig was the profile picture of Technoblade, a wildly influential Minecraft YouTuber who died in 2022. It was a sweet touch, both acknowledging Technoblade and the importance of the wider YouTube community to the game’s success. Didn’t like the film, but it was a nice touch.Stuart HeritageArnie does the BardI’m a sucker for a fake trailer – the most delectable of ways the movie industry can disappear up its own fundament. So while the ones for the ecclesiastical Brokeback Mountain, AKASatan’s Alley, from Tropic Thunder and Edgar Wright’s faux Britsploitation horrorDon’t, from Grindhouse, occasionally pop up in my head, it’sArnold Schwarzenegger’s Hamletfrom 1993’s Last Action Hero that lives there rent-free. As 90s Hollywood was getting hip to postmodernism, this is a perfectly executed mashup of high and low culture, with the meathead as an Uzi-toting sweet prince, his payoff lines burning as bright as his stogie tip: “Not to be!” And now surely the time is right for Arnie’s Lear: “As flies to wanton badasses are we to the gods / They kill us for their sport!”Phil HoadArnie does KurosawaLast Action Hero is a parody of the action genre so crammed with indiscriminate references to other films it’s virtually one Easter egg after another. Mainstream audiences would have recognised nods to Basic Instinct, Amadeus, The Seventh Seal (already parodied in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey) et al, but are less likely to have clocked the screenwriters’ homage to Akira Kurosawa’s High and Low (1963). Alas,Arnold Schwarzeneggerspotting the telltale pink smoke produced by incinerated banknotes somehow lacks the impact of Kurosawa’s burning briefcases sending pink smoke into a grey sky, the only touch of colour in an otherwise black and white film.Anne BillsonA history lesson from PixarMy childhood spanned the golden Pixar era: I was six when Toy Story came out and 20 by Up. I knew their films were different from other kids’ fare because my grownup relatives loved them (Toy Story was my grandpa’s favourite film). An ITV documentary on the making of 2001’s Monsters, Inc. taught me why. It introduced me to the concept of Easter eggs: how the studio loved to reference itself and, moreover, cinema history. The rotund green monster Mike Wazowski and his snake-haired girlfriend Celia Mae go on a date to the restaurant Harryhausen’s, which the doc revealed was named after Jason and the Argonauts animatorRay Harryhausen– something I knew nothing about aged 12. When you’re young, films feel like closed worlds designed just for you. The realisation that they were actually part of a vast history, and that they contained layers below the surface, made me gawp, and I’m certain it stoked the interest in learning how things are made that I now get to pursue for a living.Laura SnapesView image in fullscreenA giant in the field … Ray Harryhausen’s special effects in Jason and the Argonauts.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyIdina Menzel channels Broadway in WickedI adored last year’s film adaptation ofWicked– to the bafflement of a number of my friends and colleagues, who had found the film long, confusing and generally “a bit much”. Which I get. Because if you weren’t a musicals-obsessed seven-year-old when the original production became the latest Broadway sensation, I appreciate that the film might not have hit in quite the same way. But Wicked was unapologetically a film for the fans, and the breathless excitement of my seven-year-old self was awakened when Broadway’s original Elphaba, every 00s theatre kid’s icon Idina Menzel, sings the famous “ah-ah-ah-ah” run of notes from Defying Gravity in her cameo appearance. It’s testament to Cynthia Erivo’s talent that when at the end of the film she sings them again, in their proper place, they’re just as arresting.Lucy KnightAlien meets Predator – for the first timePredator 2 – Stephen Hopkins’ urban sequel to John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s arboreal shoot-em-up – is a far more interesting film than it’s often given credit for. It isn’t a patch on the peerless original, of course, and only the maniacal would claim otherwise. But Danny Glover’s haggard and really quite terrified detective is a far more interesting protagonist than an invincible bodybuilder brandishing a gun the size of his own leg, and the film is content, for better and worse, to do its own thing, critics be damned. One of its finest diversions from the first movie comes at the climax, when Glover’s Lieutenant Harrigan finds himself aboard the extraterrestrial game hunter’s spaceship. There, he discovers a wall festooned with trophies from the beast’s previous hunts, and given centre stage is the ossified, banana-like skull of a xenomorph, the acid-blooded chief biters of the Alien franchise. This brief nod implied a vast, shared cinematic universe before such things were drearily commonplace, and suggested that one day we would see these two enthusiasts of gory space violence face off. Sadly, that dream was infinitely preferable to the reality of the two Alien vs. Predator films that resulted, which are only slightly less unpleasant than slamming your fingers in a door. But let’s just forget about those.Luke HollandView image in fullscreenCritics be damned … Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator and Danny Glover as Lieutenant Mike Harrigan in Predator 2.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarObjects may be closer than they appearMy favourite Spielberg Easter egg is in virtually every summer film of his, from Duel through Jurassic Park: his monster-in-the-rearview-mirror shot. You may remember it best from Close Encounters: Richard Dreyfuss waves on the lights he sees in his rearview mirror only for them to go up and over his truck. Dreyfuss said he could hear the audience react when he read that in the script. But ideally the two bodies, pursuer and pushed, are in motion: Indy using his rvm to spy a Nazi climbing along the side of his truck in Raiders, Dennis Weaver doing the same for the monster truck in Duel, or Bob Peck spying a T rex catching up with his 4x4 in Jurassic Park. Spielberg even includes the warning “objects may be closer than they appear”. The visceral intent of every chase scene of his in just seven words.Tom ShoneDarcy resurrectedAdmittedly, “what a clever nod to Colin Firth/Mark Darcy” wasn’t my first reaction when Leo Woodall emerged from the pool in a soaking wet white shirt inBridget Jones 4. But I did appreciate the nostalgia for fans who have loved Bridge for 25 years. It wasn’t the only thing that brought back the best memories with our favourite spinster: blue string soup cocktails, awful dinner parties with smug marrieds, Bridget’s newfound knowledge of Chechnya, the massive knickers and a snowy end-of-film snog. The most special, though, was Darcy’s son wearing his dad’s reindeer jumper.Hollie RichardsonThe boy in Death in Venice ages into a human sacrificeOne moment you are youthful beauty personified. The next, you are white-bearded and crinkled, and your once-worshipped visage is being staved in with a mallet. Björn Andrésen was 15 when he played the sailor-suited twink in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 adaptation of Death in Venice, and 63 when he stepped off a cliff as a human sacrifice in Ari Aster’s sunlit horrorMidsommar. (The jump didn’t finish him off: hence the mallet.) His cameo represents a highpoint in the tradition of the casting Easter egg. Andrésen, whose life was ruined by Death in Venice and the ensuing adoration, must have relished destroying the face that started it all.Ryan GilbeyZombie bike messenger delivers the goodsView image in fullscreenBlink and you’ll miss it … Michael Smiley as a zombified Tyres (yellow cap) in Shaun of the Dead.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarMy favourite series as a slightly nerdy teen was Spaced, Channel 4’s homage-heavy flatshare sitcom, so I felt bereft when it was announced that the show would end after just two series. But there was a mega consolation prize on offer: a big-screen outing for Spaced’s creator and cast, in the form of Shaun of the Dead. In the main, while I enjoyed Shaun, it didn’t quite live up to its predecessor – marauding zombies weren’t as funny as bickering Robot Wars contestants or a man dressed as a vacuum doing performance art – but I did appreciate a blink-and-you’ll-miss it Spaced Easter egg at the film’s climax: there, among a horde of the undead, was a zombified version of Tyres, the sitcom’s wild-eyed bike messenger raver, still wearing his little yellow cycling cap and listening to thumping techno through his wraparound headphones.Gwilym MumfordLego Alfred gives a Bat-biographySome Easter eggs are sly nods, others lazy studio cross-promotion, but The Lego Batman Movie (2017) dropped one so audacious it deserves its own Bat-signal. In a gloriously meta montage,Alfred dryly recalls his master’s “weird phases”, including 1966’s dance-happy caper and the infamous Bat-nipple debacle, effectively canonising every previous cinematic dark knight as just chaotic footnotes in this Lego loner’s emotional scrapbook. Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney – all downgraded to painful fashion faux pas in the life of one emotionally constipated minifig. Which means Batman & Robin wasn’t a cinematic travesty - it was Lego Batman’s rebellious club-kid phase, complete with rubber codpiece and lashes of neon regret.Ben ChildExplore more on these topicsFilmSteven SpielbergArnold SchwarzeneggerCary GrantPixarIdina MenzelBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this process is triggered by the brain (notably the amygdala and the hypothalamus) and the way our brains react to stress is often set in early childhood, even in the womb. Pregnant women who experience extreme stress can give birth to infants who react more strongly to stress hormones – with increasing evidence suggesting that this causes modifications to the baby’s DNA. Self-actualising your way out of stress is difficult – not least because the causes might be serious and inescapable – but not always impossible.Some studies have shownthat if you tell people they are the sort of person who doesn’t feel stress, they experience fewer symptoms.One US studyfound that teenagers growing up with worries about violent crime in a deprived part of Chicago tended to fare better if they simply tried to not think about it.It is always bad for youFalseStress is central to the human existence, and its most obvious and visceral manifestation – our fight-or-flight response to immediate threat – has evolved to protect us from danger. There is also evidence that it can help us concentrate. A study ofvideo game players taking part in a tournamentfound that those who showed barely any rise in cortisol levels fared the worst, and those with the highest increase performed moderately. Winners tended to have some extra cortisol, but not too much. This hormonal and psychological balancing act is different for everyone, so gauging the “right” amount of stress is difficult. But as a broad guide, stress is less likely to be harmful if it is predictable, and particularly if it is voluntary. Studies have shown that conducting an orchestra makes the body show multiple signs of apparent stress. But this is the stress of exhilaration, which is less likely to cause ill effects.It’s the preserve ofmale business executivesFalseFor decades the study of stress was based entirely around men, and often centred on the better-off. The breakthrough came with apioneering Swedish studywhich found that people who had high demands on their time but little control over their lives tended to be the most stressed. Subsequent research has shown how unavoidable demands, whether through caring responsibilities or having multiple jobs, are especially stressful. These findings are central to much of the understanding about modern stress, particularly that connected to work. Sir Michael Marmot, the pioneering researcher into health inequalities, has argued that jobs like those in an Amazon-type warehouse, where the pace is relentless and every movement is tracked, are “as if we took everything we knew about psychosocial work hazards, put it in a syringe and injected people with it”.It’s a new worryFalseMuch of our modern understanding of stress is based on experiments with laboratory rats carried out in the 1930s by Hans Selye, an Austrian–Hungarian doctor and researcher who discovered that repeated and chronic triggering of the body’s hormonal alarm system can harm health. But even the Victorians worried that innovations like rail travel and the telegraph were too much for humans to deal with. George Miller Beard, the highly creative populariser of the disorder he called neurasthenia, used his evocatively titled 1881 book, American Nervousness, to blame stress on everything from science to civil liberties and “the phenomenal beauty of the American girl of the highest type”. Is modern stress any worse? It is certainly different. Compared to a Victorian, a 21st-century Briton has a state-provided safety net, decades’ more life expectancy and a child mortality rate about 60 times lower. There is, however, much focus on whether information overload from things like phones is a new type of stress. It is a reasonable concern, particularly for children – but it’s far from new. The term “information overload” was coined by Alvin Toffler, a US author whose bestselling book Future Shock argued that the pace of change in society caused by things like modern technology was simply too much for people’s brains – in 1970.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: NoSystemImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoIt’s mainly caused by big worriesMainly falseIn his 1972 poem The Shoelace, Charles Bukowski noted that while humans can generally cope with major upheavals, what eventually proves too much is the “continuing series of small tragedies” – everything from the “shoelace that snaps with no time left” to an unexpected bill. He was right; repeated studies have shown that stress tends to affect people most when it is chronic. But it’s also important to note that the scale of a worry is relative. What qualifies as a “minor” stress is entirely personal and subjective, and dependent on everything from personal circumstances and background to income – a single larger-than-expected bill can be catastrophic if you’re poor. There are some ways that stress, or at least its effects, can be mitigated. But don’t let anyone tell you that a particular cause of stress is minor. That is entirely a matter for you and your body.Exercise always helpsFalseThere are endless studies showing that physical activity can alleviate stress symptoms. But other research has shown that very high-intensity exercise can worsen matters.One studyput volunteers through either a gruelling mock job interview process or a physical test using a stationary bike. While post-test questionnaires showed those in the latter group perceived themselves to be less stressed, their cortisol levels were higher, and stayed so for hours after. Cortisol itself is not a problem for the body. It plays a central role in maintaining things like blood glucose levels, and also acts as a hormonal alarm clock, rising gradually during the night to a morning peak to help get us out of bed. The problem comes with the chronic triggering of the body’s stress response. So, how to avoid this with exercise? One tip is to make sure it doesn’t feel like a chore – research has shown this can be particularly stressful. Another is to see if less intensive exercise, perhaps even something like yoga, helps. But as ever, there are no firm rules. Everyone is different.You lose weight when stressedTrue and falseSome people lose weight under chronic stress. But around two-thirds of people are more likely to put it on. There are two different factors at work, and one is hormonal. Studies have linked consistently high levels of hormones like cortisol with a propensity tostore fat around the stomach. Also, research has consistently shown that stress tends to push people towards less healthy eating choices. There is an entire sub-genre of studies in which volunteers are placed under artificial stress, presented with a table of various foods, and told to snack as they please. Each time, those exposed to stress gravitate towards fatty, sweet or salty choices, and eat more overall than the control group who were not stressed.Animals also feel stressTrueThe same fight-or-flight hormonal alarm system exists in mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles. And this is not just about existential threats. Studies of baboons have shown that lower‑ranked animals in a troop display higher levels of stress hormones. But what is unique about humans is the idea of chronic anticipatory stress. As Robert Sapolsky, a US biologist who spent two decades studying Kenyan baboons,once joked: “It is startling to realise that a vast length of time ago, while evading a predator or pursuing a prey, a dinosaur secreted glucocorticoids … [But] no dinosaur ever worried itself sick from perseverating on the absurd idea that an asteroid might strike Earth.” For humans, anticipatory stress serves a purpose. For example, if you were blithely unworried about taking an exam, your study regime might be a bit relaxed. Simply telling people not to worry about future events is pointless, and you should never feel guilty about worrying.It’s your fault you’re stressedVery, very falseThere are two immediate and very obvious reasons why this is wrong. Stress is often imposed by inescapable external factors, and people’s bodily response to it can often be exacerbated by their backgrounds, notably their childhood and infancy. But there is more to it: stress acts in such a way as to make it even harder to escape the circumstances which cause it, like poverty.One US studyfound that when poorer people were asked to think about an entirely hypothetical car repair bill, they performed less well in a subsequent cognitive test. Other studies have quantified this effect variously as being about the same as losing an entire night of sleep or shedding close to 15 IQ points. This is not a minor impact.There’s nothing you can do about itTrue (and yet not)This is correct in the sense that stress can often be imposed by your life circumstances and the preset way your body reacts. But the physical manifestations of stress are more possible to address. For example, while chronic stress can make you more likely to develop metabolic ailments such as type 2 diabetes, being more physically active can reduce this risk again. Some diets can have a similar effect, with studies showing that ones including a lot of green vegetables and foods rich in polyphenols, known for their anti-inflammatory properties,can reduce cortisol levels. Psychotherapy can also help with our in-built responses to stress. And research has shown the stress-reducing benefits of everything from more sleep and better-quality social relations to certain music, aromas and, at least in the short term, simple human touch. What works for one person might not for another, but one of the curiosities of stress is that its very slipperiness, the way it presents such a broad front in its impact on humans, also gives lots of ingress points when fighting back.Stress Tested: How the New Science of Stress Hormones Can Transform Your Health by DrRichard MackenzieandPeter Walkeris published on 24April (Bluebird, £22).

Now a new exhibition at Ditchling, where he lived, is giving survivors a sayJoanna MoorheadFri 18 Apr 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 16.12 EDTShareAyoung girl kneels on her bedroom floor, hands pressed together, as another figure towers over her, one arm raised. This watercolour, made byEric Gill, is titled Annunciation – but for the abuse survivors currently working on a show of his work that will open in the town where he lived, this scene is far from holy. For them, it is loaded with disturbing overtones.“What I see isn’t the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel. It’s a scared little girl in a room where she ought to feel safe, with a terrifying figure looming over her, blocking the exit,” says Vivien Almond, one of the survivors involved in the project. “There’s no way out – even the window behind her is tiny.” The image, says Almond, is “all about power – the power that figure has over that young girl invading her space, threatening her. And that’s what Eric Gill was all about.”Eric Gill: can we separate the artist from the abuser?Read moreAlmond knows what she’s talking about: as a child, she was sexually abused by her own father over many years, just as Gill’s two elder daughters Betty and Petra were – a fact that didn’t come to light until a biography by Fiona MacCarthy was published in 1989, the author having found evidence of the crimes in Gill’s own previously unseen diaries.Since then the world has grappled with how to treat the artist’s work. Some galleries have quietly removed it from view. Last week, one of his most famous pieces, a sculpture of Prospero and Ariel from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, was returned to public view at BBC Broadcasting House in London, albeitbehind a protective screen, following an incident in whichit was damaged. A QR code nearby now links to details of Gill’s crimes.View image in fullscreenBack on display … Gill’s Prospero and Ariel at BBC Broadcasting House.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe BBC said it had taken “expert advice”, although it isn’t clear if that was from survivors. This new show is believed to be the first time survivors of abuse have been directly involved in deciding whether and what to show of Gill’s work and how to interpret it. It is being put together atDitchling Museum of Art + Craft, the institution most strongly associated with his story. The museum is in the Sussex village that was home for six years to Gill and the artistic community he founded, which continued to be based there after he and his family moved to Wales in the 1920s.Since Gill’s crimes became known, the museum, says its director Steph Fuller, has never sought to hide from the reprehensible elements of his story. Astatement on its websitecondemns his abuse, but adds that his “importance to art and design history in the UK and across the world is impossible to ignore”.The voices missing are those of the daughters who were subjected to the abuseYet Fuller thinks more needs to be said. “I’ve felt for a while,” she says, “that the voices missing in our interpretation are the voices of the daughters who were subjected to the abuse.” Those daughters are now dead, but one day two years ago, Fuller found herself talking to Ann Sumner, chair of theMethodist Modern Art Collection(MMAC) in London. Sumner was wondering what to do with a Gill painting owned by the MMAC. From that conversation grew the idea of a new exhibition, which will lead in time to a re-imagining of the Ditchling collection overall, curated with four abuse survivors, members of the Methodist Survivors Advisory Group.One thing the survivors were clear about, says Fuller, was the importance of showing Gill’s work and not sweeping it under the carpet. “They said hiding things and not talking about them is the culture in which abuse flourishes. There are lots of very difficult and emotive issues to discuss here. But if the survivors can do it, then the rest of us certainly can.”Almond adds: “If you don’t show his work, you’re not telling the story of this man. My view is it needs to be seen, but included alongside it needs to be the story of what this man did, how he abused his daughters. It’s been said what he did didn’t affect these women much. But that’s rubbish. If you suffer abuse, it stays with you, it’s a pain you never get rid of, and it changes everything else that happens to you.”View image in fullscreen‘He wanted the world to see how clever he’d been, hiding it all from everyone’ … Gill, third from right, with his family in the mid-1920s.Photograph: FMC photo archiveThe new display will be part of an exhibition at Ditchling entitled It Takes a Village, to open in early July. It will include both Annunciation, the work that so struck Almond, and other pieces including Gill drawings of Betty and Petra, among them a nude of Betty when she was 16. “That was drawn at the point when the abuse was happening,” says Fuller.Fiona, another survivor involved in the Ditchling project, says she’s been surprised by how little museums and art galleries have consulted survivors when making decisions around Gill’s work. “Art has a tendency to be self-congratulatory and pretentious.Arthistorians think they know things, but actually all they know about is art. They don’t know what it’s like to survive abuse.”One issue for her is monetary value. “When someone is a name, their work is worth more. It’s to do with someone’s reputation, but it shouldn’t be only their artistic reputation – because with Gill you’ve got someone who was much revered, but we now know he was a very unpleasant character: sleazy, a paedophile. So his value should reflect that reputation as well.”View image in fullscreenAlso on show … Divine Lovers (Icon), 1922, by Eric Gill.Photograph: Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft collectionFiona testified against her abuser, a man who lodged in her family home when she was a child, decades after his crimes took place, and he was convicted and imprisoned. “I wanted to hold him to account, and I want to hold Gill to account. He was a smug and arrogant man and in writing about his abuse in his diaries, I think perhaps he wanted it all to come out eventually – he wanted the world to see how clever he’d been, hiding it all from everyone, making people think he was so saintly.”Now in her 70s, Fiona says the attitude to abuse has changed for survivors over the years. “It used to be hushed up, and people would say it doesn’t do any real harm. But now it’s being more talked about that view has changed – so getting more people to speak about it is the way forward.”Childhood books made by the Gill daughters and the 1922 sculpture Divine Lovers (Icon) – showing Christ embracing a figure representing the church – will also be included in the display, which will be in a separate room at the museum. “We’re very mindful of visitors who might have been victims of abuse,” says Fuller. “There will be a notice explaining the content before people go into the room.”Survivors’ sensitivities have tended to be more around works that home in on intimate situations in the home, rather than with pieces that are sexually explicit, says Fuller. “We’ve been talking a lot about abuse holistically, how it happens and the family dynamics around it. Also, because the survivors are from a Christian group, and Gill was a Catholic, they’ve been interested in how he depicted spiritual and divine subjects in a sexualised way.”It Takes a Village is atDitchling Museum of Art + Craft, East Sussex, in July.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

How can I help?The first priority must be the safety of the most vulnerable – your mother and your sister’s childrenEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 18 Apr 2025 09.30 EDTShareI’m a 40-year-old manand worried about my family. Since my sister (in her late30s) became pregnant with her first child four years ago, there hasn’t been a period longer than a week without her and my mother getting into toxic fights.A couple of days ago,after my sister had resorted (yetagain) tocalling our mother names, she also ended up grabbing her by the throat.My father, who passed away a year ago, had been involved inthis huge tension, but his longstanding health issues had“shielded” him from being the target ofher more severe outbursts.I’mworried for my sister’s wellbeing, since she’s fundamentally loving but becomes an entirely different and hatefully aggressive person when she’s outraged (her relationship with her partner is more or less the same, minus the physical violence). She has been going to therapy, but I doubt the extent to which this has worked.I’m alsoworried for my mother, who has to go through simultaneously being cancelled in her mainrole in life (as a mother),while functioningas a 24/7 nanny to her grandchildren. AndI’m worried about myself: I know it’s “not my problem”, but I find it hard to see how my mother being grabbed by the throat is something I could “put into perspective”.I think I’ve tried my best in reasoningwith my sister, but talking to her is like walking through a minefield, and she ends up attacking me as well.I went to BACP accredited psychotherapist Armele Philpotts, and we both asked the same initial question: was your sister like this before or did pregnancy trigger something in her?“Is this behaviour that she might have witnessed or demonstrated in other ways before her first pregnancy?” Philpotts asked. “If not, she may benefit from some specialised perinatal mental health support, which is available through the NHS in the UK.” (We’re not sure where you live.) If your sister was not like this before, there might be a medical reason behind her behaviour, even if it has been four years since she had her first child.The is clearly not acceptable. Your mum is grieving your dad and is experiencing something I would describe as child-to-parent abuseBut, as Philpotts said: “The behaviour is clearly not acceptable whatever the reason behind it. Your mum is grieving your dad (as are you and, presumably, your sister, too) and you said that she provides 24/7 childcare and is experiencing something I would describe aschild-to-parent abuse(CPA).“I’m so sorry she’s experiencing this, which from what you wrote sounds verbally, emotionally and now physically abusive. If she lives in the UK, she may be able to seek support through her GP, and there is also an organisation (pegsupport.co.uk) that offers support specifically aimed at people experiencing this kind of behaviour from their child.“This is an area that is being examined by our government at present, with an open consultation on CPA in progress.”Your mum could report this to the police – trying to strangle someone is a criminal offence, but I appreciate she may not want to do this where her daughter is concerned. Still, it may focus her and your sister as to the gravity of the situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Does she live with your sister or have her own domestic space where she can rest and recuperate? Could some space be created for your mum away from your sister?”She was also concerned about the children. “Could your sister become ‘outraged’ by them at some point? Are they currently witnessing her behaviour towards her partner? If so, who will protect them?” Nothing in your letter signified concern for the children, but this is an area of real worry given the levels of abuse and physical violence you have mentioned. Are you able to talk to her partner (presumably their dad?) and establish how safe they are? I wonder if this is why your mother is a “24/7” nanny and so present, because she is worried about the children?This is a very worrying situation, for all of you. Especially given that there seems to be no time at all when you feel able to talk to your sister and tell her your concerns or get her help. At times like this I always advise making sure the safety of the most vulnerable is attended to first: here, your mum and your sister’s children.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Herbert Hound died in our arms at home at 4.11pm on Sunday, 6 April, bathed in love and sunshine. We had hoped he would live longer. Maybe to the end of the summer. But his prostate cancer had spread to his bladder and urethra and he faded very fast. By his final weekend, he could barely pee or poo and would only nibble on a slice of ham. All he really wanted to do was lie down and sleep next to where we were sitting. We took him for one last walk – more of a slow dawdle, as his movement was limited – to his favourite part of the woods on Tooting Bec Common, where he got to sniff the smells for one last time. For the rest of the time, we just held and stroked him and told him how much he was loved. The vet came at 4pm to administer the injections and we sat with him for an hour before his body was collected by the cremation team.It was one of the most painful things I have ever done. It’s also a very different kind of grief to that I feel for my mother. The death of a parent – especially one with Alzheimer’s – is the final separation in a life full of separations from infancy onwards. With Herbie, there had never been much separation. It was an uncomplicated relationship. He liked doing what we did and we liked doing what he did. There were never any regrets, no expectations that went unmet. He taught us every bit as much as we taught him. He was the embodiment of unconditional love, bringing out the best in everyone he met. Even those who weren’t that keen on dogs. I miss him terribly. The house feels less than a house without him. Sometimes, I think I catch sight of him out of the corner of my eye, sitting in his favourite spot at the bottom of the stairs. I do a double take only to see the outline he wore away on the carpet. I still call his name when I come in the front door. It feels wrong not to. The other day, I discovered his towel at the bottom of the laundry basket and burst into tears. There have been so many tears. Next Thursday is my event at the Bloomsbury theatre in London – still a handful of tickets available, so please do come. Though it may be hard for me to get through without crying.TuesdayIt looked to me a bit like doughnutting off the back of a billionaire’s superyacht. An 11-minute adrenaline ride on the world’s most expensive boy’s toy. But for Jeff Bezos’s fiancee Lauren Sánchez, the singer Katy Perry, TV host Gayle King and three other women, the blink-and-you-miss-ittrip to the edge of spacein the Amazon boss’s Blue Origin rocket was somehow the ultimate expression of the feminist ideal. A triumph for women everywhere. Let’s try to think this one through. None of the six “astronauts” – AKA the backseat passengers on a fully automated spacecraft – had been through any rigorous selection procedure. The only criteria was that they were all close friends of Jeff. Nor was there any point to the trip. No new scientific ground was being broken. This was just a pleasure ride. They might as well have taken over Thorpe Park for the day.Katy Perry’s blast-off was a waste of space | LettersRead moreAs the rocket reached its highest point of 66 miles above the Earth’s surface, one woman could be heard saying over the radio, “I love you, Jeff Bezos”. I’m not sure this is what my mother would have called feminism. But each to their own. King reported back that her highlight of the trip had been to hear Perry sing What a Wonderful World. You wonder why she bothered. She could have done that on the ground. Sánchez said she was so proud of all the crew. For doing what, exactly? Sitting down and looking out of the window? She also said that the Earth looked quiet but alive. Mystic Lauren. But pride of place went to Perry for saying she had prepared for the trip by reading up on string theory. I hope she had more luck in understanding it than I did when I read Stephen Hawking. Then again, Perry also felt she had a connection with the stars because she was interested in astrology. Perhaps Scorpios make the best astronauts? “What you’re doing is really finding the love for yourself,” she concluded. “I’m really feeling that divine feminine right now.” Bezos will be laughing all the way to the bank.View image in fullscreen‘I kiss the ground Jeff walks on.’Photograph: Blue Origin/AFP/Getty ImagesWednesdayThe government announcement last Friday thatparliament was being recalled from recesson a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war in 1982 caught me on the hop. I had to hastily revise my weekend plans to make sure I was in the press gallery to sketch the proceedings as emergency legislation was pushed through parliament inside a day. The Labour benches were packed. The opposition benches, not so much. Only about 20 Conservative MPs had broken off their holidays to head back to London. I guess they thought this was Labour’s problem.This week, it was also announced that the government had found and paid for the fuel to keep the Scunthorpe furnaces open so, for the time being at least, the future ofBritish Steelis secure. Now I know the government has had lots of other things to do, but even after all this, it still isn’t immediately clear to me why the government needed to take emergency action with a recall of parliament. After all, it wasn’t as if it had had no warning that British Steel was reaching crisis point. In the past few weeks leading up to the Easter break, there had been two urgent questions on the Scunthorpe steelworks in the Commons along with backbench questions at PMQs. On every occasion, the government had said everything was in hand and that they had made a generous offer which they believed it would be irrational for the Chinese owners, Jingye, to refuse. And each time, several MPs had suggested the government was being naive. That Jingye was a proxy for the Chinese state and might well see a strategic advantage in forcing the closure of virgin steelmaking in a G7 trading rival. It was only after parliament stopped for Easter that the penny dropped for the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. The Chinese sceptics had a point.ThursdayForgive me for feeling somewhat underwhelmed. At the weekend,JD Vance told an interviewer there was a good chance of a US-UK trade deal. “The president really loves the United Kingdom,” he said. “He loved the queen. He admires and loves the king. It is a very important relationship.” Mmm. Not sure King Charles feels the same way but he’s well enough behaved to do whatever is necessary. Kissing the orange ring. Charles must be dreading the state visit – or “fest” as Donald Trump is calling it – in September, every bit as much as most of the country is. Today, several media outlets are reporting the deal could be done within three weeks. But, before we get too excited about any special treatment, it should be pointed out we will be in the second wave of deals after Japan, India and South Korea. There are also limits to what we have been told we can expect. Trump isn’t about to waive the 10% tariff on all goods we export to the US: if we’re very lucky, the president may cut us a little slack on steel tariffs. Truly, he spoils us. Then again, he could throw a wobbly if we do any kind of deal with our biggest trading partner, the EU. Just as Keir Starmer is seeking to align with Brussels over carbon levies. Nor would British farmers thank the government if allowing imported food produced to a lower quality was a precondition for any deal with the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not least because there’s every chance Agent Orange could change his mind within days of signing an agreement. Only a few weeks ago, the Brexiters were congratulating themselves on the UK being hit with 10% tariffs – the same as the penguins of Heard Island – while the EU faced a 20% levy. Not long after, the president reduced EU tariffs to 10%. The Donald is not a reliable trading partner. He does not operate in good faith. The only deals in which he is interested are ones where he is the clear winner. We should be careful.View image in fullscreen‘I said, Bring Me Sunshine.’Photograph: Victoria Jones/Rex/ShutterstockFridayUp until last night, the best entertainment Spurs had served up this season had been off the pitch. In the last month or so, Tottenham chat groups had been buzzing over claims from the manager, Ange Postecoglou, that details of team meetings had been leaked to the media. The biggest mystery was what Ange thought should have remained secret. It can’t have been tactics as they don’t really have any, other than to trot around aimlessly, as anyone who has had the misfortune to be a season-ticket holder this year will testify. Unless the plan has been to lose as many Premier League games as possible. Only Spurs have managed to lose at home to both Ipswich and Leicester. And, if the manager has been trying to persuade the players to try a bit harder, then it clearly hasn’t worked. Now that they can’t be relegated, the Tottenham players seem to have already given up on the Premier League. All of which has been obvious to any observer. So I’m excited to learn what wisdom from Ange has reached the media.Last night, though,Spurs showed they can playwhen they can be bothered by beating Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League. It was a performance completely out of character with their league form. One that offered hope Spurs could actually win something for the first time in more than 15 years. A cup would be very welcome, but wouldn’t cover up the cracks at the club. I’ve been coming to White Hart Lane for decades and this has been the most joyless season I can remember. Getting relegated back in the 1970s was more fun than this.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekJeff BezosKaty PerryBlue OriginBritish SteelDogsTrump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

This trend ispropelledby decreased stigma and increased legalization, with 24 states and the District of Columbia allowingrecreational use(in the UK,recreational useis stillillegal).But there’s something else too. Getting older comes with its challenges, physically and emotionally. Somepeoplearebetting on cannabisas a way to navigate these hurdles. Researchindicatesolder adults primarily use cannabis for health-related issues, like poor sleep, pain and mental health concerns such as anxiety.DrAlison Moore, a geriatrician and University of California San Diego professor, can see a future in which cannabis plays a part in older patient healthcare. The issue is that current science can’t prove most of the reasons why this group wants to use it.Despite the lack of evidence, “we do know people find it useful”, she says. “Older adults are the fastest-growing market, and there’s a reason for that.”We spoke to experts about the benefits and risks of using cannabis as an older adult.What is cannabis?View image in fullscreenCannabis comes in a variety of forms.Photograph: Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesCannabis is a group ofplant varieties, or strains – notablyCannabis sativaandCannabis indica. Its main chemicals, called cannabinoids, are THC and CBD. THC has a psychoactive effect. CBD does not, but can create a feeling of relaxation.State laws typically require legal dispensaries to disclose the amounts of THC and CBD in products, explainsAngela Bryan, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use among older adults. These amounts are typically shown as a ratio.“Regardless of whether someone wants to use cannabis recreationally or medicinally, the recommendation is to start low, go slow,” says Bryan.Does cannabis affect older people differently?Cannabinoids such as THCbindto receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, leading to the drug’s effects. This system maintains homeostasis and regulates metabolism, but becomes less efficient with age, Bryan explains. As a result, cannabis is metabolized more slowly. That said, because peopledon’t age the same, there will be differences.If people experience relief, if they find a way to [use cannabis] that fits into their life and is safe, that is fantasticAngela Bryan, University of Colorado Boulder professorAdditionally, THC can accumulate in fat. Because older adults tend to experience an increase in fat mass and adecrease in muscle mass, THC effects are more pronounced, explains Moore.Older adults often take multiple medications, so they should consult a healthcare provider before using cannabis, says Moore. Some data suggests people may not adjust prescription doses when adding cannabis,increasing the riskof harmful side effects like impaired cognition or increased anxiety.Cannabis has becomemore potentover the years. Bryan advises starting with low THC before trying stronger options. Low THC may also reduce reactions like paranoia and anxiety, she says.What are the risks of cannabis use for older adults?Before using cannabis, discuss it with your doctor, says Moore. You can go over your medical history, including current and past medications, and why you want to try the drug.There is little clarity on which cannabis products are most effective for specific medical needs, saysChristopher Kaufmann, an assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He emphasizes the need for more research on cannabis use, specifically in older adults, who may face greater risks due to conditions like tachycardia and poor blood pressure.While there’s insufficient evidence for recommending cannabis, doctors can advise on potential benefits and risks. In older adults, commonside effectslike dizziness, drowsiness and confusion may increasefall risk, and cannabis could worsen cognitive impairment in those already affected, explains Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.If patients already use cannabis, Moore asks them to bring it to their next appointment to review whether the dosage and method of administration are appropriate. Because products can be mislabeled, she emphasizes the importance of purchasing from licensed dispensaries, where accuracy is more likely.Certain forms may suit specific needs better, says Bryan. For instance, smoked products offer faster relief than edibles, making them preferable for immediate pain. But if you have a history of lung disease, avoid vaping and smoking.A downside of edibles is that you can’t undo overconsumption. “People tend not to oversmoke,” Bryan says. “They feel the effect they want and stop.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhat are the potential benefits?Moore, Kaufmann and colleagues co-authored a 2020studyof 568 adults surveyed at a geriatric clinic, where most used cannabis for health issues like sleeping troubles, aches and anxiety. Three-quarters of participants found it “somewhat” or “extremely” helpful. While such use is common, scientific evidence supporting these health benefits is limited. Research is stronger on cannabis’seffectivenessfor neuropathic pain, spasticity and nausea.Falling can be risky. Here’s how to avoid it and what to do if it happensRead moreThe gap between self-reported benefits and scientific evidence is partly due to missing data and a reliance on observational studies, which are prone to biases. Bryan calls for more double-blind randomized controlled trials using legal cannabis products, though these are challenging to conduct because of the tightly regulated schedule I status of cannabis.Self-reported benefits still matter, Bryan says, even if there’s a placebo effect. “If people experience relief, if they find a way to do it that fits into their life and is safe for them, then that is fantastic,” she says.Moore thinks cannabis has “the potential to address some of the common issues we see with ageing”, but the barriers to studying it have impeded progress. Because short-term use of cannabismay improvepositive mood, this might explain why people find it helpful, regardless of whether cause and effect can be validated, she explains.Aaron Greenstein, a board-certified geriatric psychiatrist, says patients inquire about cannabis for sleep, pain and general wellbeing. But whether it’s helpful, and how much, can be very subjective, he says, and he’s observed that most of his patients who have hoped cannabis could help with wellbeing end up not sticking with it.“Part of the fascination with marijuana is that it is advertised as a quick fix,” he says. “But there’s a limit to how effective it can be.”Can cannabis help older adults sleep better?In a 2020studyon people aged 21 to 70, Bryan and colleagues found that frequent use of edibles for sleep was linked to poorer sleep over time. She notes this pattern mirrors findings on other sleep aids: they work initially but lose effectiveness eventually. Sparing, as-needed use is generally more helpful.The study also found participants, especially older adults, slept better with higher CBD intake. While products with more THC may offer short-term relief, those with high-dose CBD and low-dose THC were better for sleep.“A combination of occasional CBD use along with some behavioral changes is probably the best recommendation” for people experiencing persistent, disruptive sleep problems, says Bryan.Moore has come across seniors who want to transition from hypnotic medications, like Ambien, to cannabis. But there’s a lack of data comparing the two, she says.When it comes to improving sleep, there are often more effective alternatives to cannabis and medications such as Ambien, says Lachs. These include options like gabapentin and melatonin, but he particularly recommends behavioral interventions likeCBT-I, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.Ultimately, “the jury is still out on whether cannabis can be used to treat sleep”, says Kaufmann. “There definitely needs to be more studies.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCannabisAgeingDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is that a comma? Is this an octopus? Looking up, I notice that some of this stuff has broken free of the surface of the framed drawing and floated up to the ceiling, where it is trapped between the wall and the skylight, like a drifting tangle of seaweed. Some invisible current is pulling at the tendrils of colour, which tails off into the whiteness of the wall. It is like a conjurer’s misdirection, leading us from one thing to another, then back again.‘It’s torture!’ Turner-winning artist Richard Wright on obliterating his painstaking worksRead moreAnother surface is sticky with biomorphic blobs that have been coaxed into the shapes of the crests of waves and lakes of fire: if this were some band’s album sleeve, I’d be embarrassed to be seen walking around with it, though some of the best records have terrible covers. There is something hypnotic and even hallucinatory about many of Richard Wright’s images, with their wealth of abstract detail, their variousness and shifts in tempo and approach. His art asks you to pay close attention. Surprisingly, this is the largest exhibition Wright has had in the UK since winning the Turner prize in 2009. It is worth the wait.Sometimes hectic, often enveloping and filled with variety and strangeness, tumbling references and secretive allusions, Wright’s weird landscapes and abstract patterns, with all their Rorschach-like unfoldings and mirrorings, are so compelling I lose myself, time and again, in his imaginary and constructed worlds, his plays with form and formlessness. My eye goes for a swim in them. Looking at Wright’s work is one thing, describing it another. My eye quivers and dances and won’t settle. Even my smartphone has trouble keeping up with the almost cinematic tonal flicker of black and white, and the simultaneous colour contrasts.View image in fullscreenFlorid, weird … Richard Wright, Untitled, 2022.Photograph: Keith HunterThe florid and weirdly organic gives way to a sort of visual Lego that comprises chequerboard grids and runs of chevrons and angled tracks of parallel black and white stripes. They abut and shimmy apart. There’s a great deal of optical noise and interference, though Wright does his best to keep things under control. I keep getting sucked in by the places where the hand-painted geometry has gone wonky, and skidding off to other sections where the colour has switched and the tessellations have changed scale. Sometimes, the grids seem to warp and fold in on themselves. They pulse and flex with a kind of peripheral optical disturbance at the edges of my vision. I’m getting the whirling pits, and not for the first time.Sometimes I think I’m looking at a landscape or a faded oriental carpet or a piece of painted silk. Suddenly, a bulky 1920s solicitor’s cabinet arrives, which, for no clear reason, has been embellished with a jazzy black and white design reminiscent of dazzle camouflage. It stands in the gallery like some big fat vorticist elephant, out of place and time. There are delicate drawings using gold leaf on paper which defeat any attempt to focus – I keep snatching at patterns and shapes, perhaps even images, then losing them again in the surface glare. Here’s an erupting gold-leaf splat, the edges of the apparently free-form event a totally premeditated and ornamental, frozen moment, a slow-motion explosion that keeps on happening.View image in fullscreenA slow-motion explosion … Richard Wright, Untitled, 2017.Photograph: Keith Hunter/The Modern Institute/Toby Webster, GlasgowI hadn’t been in Wright’s show long before I gave up trying to work out what systems and rules he was using to make his art, though in one room there’s a big old library table covered in books and drawings that provide a sort of clue. Wright has sometimes drawn and painted and collaged on to the pages of the books themselves: a pattern much like medieval floor tiling flexes on the open pages of Aldous Huxley’s The Doors of Perception, the text flitting from El Greco to Ingres to drapery and to Botticelli, in a flight of mescaline intoxication.Images of gesticulating hands obscure the writing in Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra. Wright has tinted-in the diagrams in an old manual about poster design, and defaced Maoist tracts and the poems of Vladimir Mayakovsky with lovely bits of constructivist watercolour doodling. You could spend a happy afternoon poring over all this. Look, there’s a rare artist’s book by Ed Ruscha, sitting on top of a couple of volumes of occultist nonsense. Here’s a sheet of marbled endpaper, and an analysis of the mathematics behind the geometries of Islamic architectural decoration. All these layered references have caught Wright’s attention and fed, in various ways, the cosmologies of his art, which is as labyrinthine as a story by Jorge Luis Borges. It is like being trapped in the artist’s head.In a watercolour that could almost have been made centuries ago, perhaps by some amateur romantic on his Italian grand tour, a hill rises from a flat plain, with odd, furtive things going on in the thin washes of grey paint. Something else seems to be hiding in one of Wright’s symmetrical fields of abstract squiggles and hatchings. If I were told that this last work had been painted by some dope-fiend acquaintance of Aleister Crowley while engaged in a summoning of demons, I would not be at all surprised. Elsewhere, there are painstaking studies of architectural oddities: a set of shallow steps with alcoves scalloped beneath them, and a plain Renaissance facade of a crenelated tower, untethered from its place in a painted 15th-century urban backdrop. I love the way Wright leads you first one way, then another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another screen has been placed in front of a light well (usually hidden from view behind a false wall in the gallery’s reading room). Mostly, you enter Wright’s work through an act of imagination. These ornamental, architectural interventions extend Wright’s work into real space. Instead of looking at his art, you find yourself inside it.The same is true ofthe in-situ drawings he has made on walls and ceilings, stairwells and vestibules, from the Elizabeth Line at Tottenham Court Road station in London to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Queen’s House in Greenwich. For the past five weeks, Wright has been working on a wall drawing at Camden, the product of weeks of labour by the artist and his team of assistants. Climbing from the floor up into the high, barrel-vaulted roof where it makes its way across the ceiling, a complex fractal geometry of triangles morphs into rhomboids and chevrons, canted this way and that.They change scale, they proliferate, they turn into six-pointed stars, they split apart, they sheer and do weird things too far away for my eye to properly register and comprehend. The fact that something is happening up there is enough, as Wright moves from optical space to mental space, a place for the imagination as well as the eye.Richard Wright is atCamden Art Centre, London, until 22 June.Explore more on these topicsArtRichard WrightreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s my whole family’Donald McRaeThe 2024 winner reflects on the emotional backstory to Crucible triumph amid major health concerns for his familyFri 18 Apr 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 19.31 EDTShare“‘I still believed in myself but it was quite soul-destroying out there,” Kyren Wilson says in a back room at BarrattsSnookerClub in Northampton. The world champion once worked here as a barman because he had lost his place on tour after his first season as a professional in 2011. He was still only 19 and he had little idea that an avalanche of adversity would engulf him in the years ahead.Wilson begins the defence of his world title, with afirst-round match against Lei Peifan, in the venerable Crucible in Sheffield on Saturday morning. But it seems fitting that we should meet here, in the unpromising surroundings which once defined Wilson’s life, as he describes hisextraordinary world championshipbackstory.That tumultuous victory had been preceded by concerns over his father’s multiple sclerosis, a suspected brain tumour in his youngest son, a silent stroke for his wife and his mother’s breast cancer. But we start with his bar work at Barratts when he seemed so far away from playing at the Crucible.“It’s a hard path back on to the tour,” Wilson says, “and you go from playing in perfect conditions in front of big crowds, against the world’s best players, to being in dingy snooker clubs on poor tables. It’s a really tough process because you know a first prize in an amateur event would be trebled with a first-round win on the world snooker tour. So I had to bide my time and keep plugging away.”Wilson admits, in his amiable way, that: “I’d got up to 72 in the world, which was quite an accomplishment. But my game wasn’t good enough to stay on tour because the seasoned pros would pick me off. I was too raw and had to rebuild my game. But there was a lot of pressure. My girlfriend, Sophie, who is my wife now, had moved down from north Wales to Kettering to live with me. I was living off her wage and we needed the bar work. My family and I also said: ‘Let’s give snooker one last shot.”View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson holds the trophy aloft after the world championship final in 2024.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHis parents Rob and Sonya had given up so much to help him become a pro. Years before they even bought a derelict house, which had been empty for years, because his mum saw the potential to build a snooker room for him. They still needed to “remortgage the house two or three times” and life became more difficult when Wilson’s dad was diagnosed with MS.“I’ll never forget the time he got told about it,” Wilson says. “He went upstairs and he was inconsolable. I remember me and my brother getting in from school and Mum saying: ‘Go and give your dad a cuddle.’ I didn’t realise what was going on or the impact it would have on the family. I was 16.”The unforgiving reality of trying to making it as a pro soon bit hard and it was only in 2013, two years after his debut season, that he got back on tour. By September 2015 he was still struggling and almost completely broke. He won three qualifying matches to reach the Shanghai Masters but did not expect to remain long in China.“I didn’t want to be there as it was my dad’s 50th and we’d arranged a surprise party for him in Tenerife with the whole family,” he continues.“We’d scraped together the last €400 of savings so we could go to Tenerife. My wife and son [Finley] got there and she called me in Shanghai. She was so upset and said: ‘I’ve lost all the money. What can I do? I can’t even afford nappies now.’ We had no money left but thankfully my friends and family clubbed together and helped.”How did it make him feel that they were destitute? “I wanted to leave Shanghai. Before every match I’m planning a route to Tenerife because my mum and dad have done so much for me. My dad has MS and this is his one and only 50th birthday. It was only when I got to the quarter-finals that I accepted the best present I could give him was that trophy. I beat Ding Junhui 5-4 on the black in the quarter-finals.“There’s a video where my family are all in an Irish bar in Tenerife and they’ve managed to get the stream from Shanghai. They’re all celebrating – my nan, my grandad, my little boy, my best friend, everyone, going crazy when I potted the black.”View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson poses for a photo with a fan during the media day at the Crucible on Friday.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesHe then defeated Mark Allen and, in the final, Judd Trump. “They were both heavy favourites against me as I was an unknown. It was 9-9 in the final and Judd left me half a chance in the decider where I was cueing over the pack of reds and I dropped one in the middle pocket. If I missed that red, I’m leaving the table open but I madeone of the best 70 breaksof my life, and won 10-9. I won £85,000 and my biggest win before that would have been around £10,000.“Everything changed dramatically. It was not just the money but the confidence it gave me. I felt like I’d arrived as a professional and I didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder. So it made me hungrier.”Wilson’s career progressed steadily and in 2020, amid Covid, he reached his first world final when helost to Ronnie O’Sullivan. But his family were eventually hit by a series of potentially catastrophic health concerns.In 2023, with Wilson playing in the Players Championship where he reached the semi-finals, his youngest son, Bailey, fell extremely ill. “He had a seizure at home and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. At A&E they couldn’t work out what it was. They told my wife that there was a chance that he had a brain tumour and they couldn’t allow her in for his CT scan. Sophie kept it to herself for two days because I was in the middle of a competition. But she thought our six-year-old could have a brain tumour.”Wilson sighs in relief. “It actually turned out to be one of the highest readings for wheat allergy and lactose intolerance. We’d been giving him Actimel thinking it was good gut bacteria. But it’s like lactose and, not knowing, we’re making it worse. So he went on a gluten-free, lactose-free diet and reversed it.”But there were hidden consequences. Sophie, who had long suffered from epilepsy but been free from medication for five years, endured a terrifying episode. “I was practising here at the club,” Wilson says, “and my brother called me and said: ‘Come home, it’s not good.’ I’ve had calls before where someone’s said: ‘Sophie’s had a seizure, you need to get back.’ This was much more serious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She could blink and nod, but couldn’t talk or move her limbs. The worst was when we got her to A&E and she was on a bed and the paramedics were trying to get her into the wheelchair. But she couldn’t lift her legs to get into the wheelchair. It was very scary.”Did he fear permanent paralysis? “Yeah,” he says softly. “She couldn’t speak in A&E and, funnily enough, this elderly lady was talking to me about snooker. She was a big fan and asked Sophie if she could take a photo of us. Sophie couldn’t say no or hold the camera. But she’s seen the funny side and started laughing. Within two hours her words started to come back. Maybe she just needed a giggle.”View image in fullscreenKyren Wilson and his son Finley embrace after the 2024 world championship final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSophie had to relinquish her driving licence for a year but, having resumed her epilepsy medication, the numb sensation down one side of her body has finally disappeared. “It’s now well under control and she’s back driving,” Wilson confirms.He still had more worry to face. Three weeks before the world championships last year his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. “She kept it from me initially as she didn’t want to burden me. But then she told me because I knew something wasn’t right. She said: ‘Look, the outcome will be positive. Don’t worry about it.’ She had the tumour removed, a small dose of radiotherapy and, touch wood, she’s all clear now.”Wilson seems impressively calm but he says: “I’ve got an erratic side and that came out two weeks before the worlds. We’ve got cameras in the house and Sophie logged into the system and saw me on the floor in my snooker room at home. I was in floods of tears. She gave me a cuddle, picked me up and said: ‘Come on, crack on.’“That’s when we introduced Chris O’Connor, who works with solution hypnotherapy. I saw him every day before the worlds and he gave me a different mindset. I suddenly saw that snooker is not the be-all and end-all. Family is so important and, without your health, you’re nothing. I felt so calm, sleep was good, my stress bucket slowly emptied. I was raring to go by the worlds.”After Wilson beatJak Jones 18-14 in the finalhe sat down in his chair at the Crucible and sobbed as the enormity of all his family had faced, and what he had achieved, poured out of him. His wife and sons joined him in a memorable and profoundly emotional celebration.Wilson reaches for his phone. “My screensaver is me about to walk out for the final session. And here’s another photo from the next morning. Can you see me in bed? I’ve got the lid on my head, and there’s the trophy with my wife and two boys in bed. I’d crashed at 8.30am and that was taken at 10. I’d had an hour-and-a-half and I was still very drunk. It was incredible.”His dad’s MS remains a worry but Wilson highlights his courage. “It’s a gradual decline, but that’s testament to my dad’s mental strength because he’s got one of the most aggressive forms of MS. He’ll hate me saying this, but it’s only recently that he’s got a mobility scooter. He calls it the Ferrari. He’s battled MS for so long and it’s only now that he’s accepting help.”That same tenacity defines the 33-year-old and he is determined to win multiple world titles. “I’ve had a very good season. I won a tournament soon after the worlds and that eased the pressure. Winning becomes a habit, and you crave that feeling.”He is world No 2 and, at the Players Championship last month,he beat Trump, the runaway tour leader, 10-9 in a dramatic final. It continued the hex Wilson holds over Trump. Apart from a solitary 4-3 loss in Gibraltar, Wilson has beaten Trump every time they have met in a final – including three times this season. “He makes my job very easy, because he’s world No 1. If you don’t play well, you’re going home. That inspires me against him.”Wilson makes his ambitions plain for this year’s tournament: “I’m very hungry to do it again. I’m not ready to give up that tag of being the current world champion. But it’s not just me that’s world champion. It’s my whole family. We’re all world champions.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookerinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Conflict seemed inevitableFri 18 Apr 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere was a news story this week about a team of a hundred scientists who have spent nine years analysing a single cubic millimetre of mouse brain. The one hundred scientists have finally published their results. And those results are basically: “Whoah, have you seen this stuff?”What they found inside the cubic millimetre of mouse brain was an eternity of wiring, just miles and miles of tiny wire to be untangled, pictured in the accompanying article clumped into a single mass, like a pan of mouse brain vermicelli left overnight in the sink.The point of the study was to offer some clues in the study of the human brain. Given this is around a thousand times bigger than its mouse equivalent the group was forced to conclude it would take centuries to untangle the wiring inside a complete human brain. That box under the bed crammed with scart cables and old Blu-ray player leads might seem a bit confusing. The human brain, well, the human brain is basically unknowable.Reece James bemoans ‘poor’ Chelsea display as Legia Warsaw cause frightRead moreIt is tempting to conclude this must be the kind of thing Enzo Maresca thinks about as he lies awake at night staring at the ceiling, sifting data, poring over the impossibility of eradicating petty human variables, of ensuring Tosin Adarabioyo remembers at all times he is just an avatar of a system, that Levi Colwill knows he’s nothing more than a unit of athletic flesh.You really think it’s a logical option for Robert Sánchez to pass the ball forward? How about if I told you a single 100 gram serving of squirrel brain contains enough wire to stretch from Stamford Bridge to Venus, that its possibilities are endless and uncontrollable? What then?Or perhaps not. In the buildup to Thursday’s game against Legia Warsaw, the same day the mouse-brain report dropped, Chelsea’s website published what looked like a revelatory article. It was headlined “Enzo Maresca: ‘Football belongs to the fans’”, above a picture of a beaming Maresca, arms wide in a tender, priestly gesture, raising the prospect of some kind of Scrooge-style overnight conversion from scowling possession-ball to joy, freedom and the possibilities of a fully unleashed Noni Madueke.On closer inspection the article turned out to be a fine and sympathetic piece of work from the club admin, who managed to pack that line about fans into the headline, sub-head and opening sentence, but was forced before the opening paragraph was out to get on to the stuff he really wanted to say about how fans are only vital when they support you, how football is in fact “more complicated” than this.View image in fullscreenChelsea manager Enzo Maresca during a press conference at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAChelsea duly reeled off another strange performance against Legia, losing at home while taking 72% possession, making 721 passes, and playing like a team having a half-grasped conversation with itself about maths. And Maresca is a fascinating figure right now, both the funniest single entity in the Premier League (if you don’t have to watch the games) and a test of what this thing is supposed to mean.His best quality is that amazing air of self‑possession, the look of cultivated disdain, the smile that suggests the entire choreographed descent into mouse-brain football is just another step in his own vast, unknowable plan. And while he, Enzo, will not judge you for your inability to grasp this, he will in fact still massively judge you, despise you, and make passive aggressive remarks about you in a TV interview.Maresca’s entire professional identity is based around tactics, an ideologue’s preference for controlled buildup play from the back. Also, baiting the press. He loves, and passionately believes in baiting the press. Not to mention counterpressing then falling back quickly, like a squadron of police tactically running away from some teenagers.Chelsea fans tend to like forceful, direct football. Conflict of some kind always seemed inevitable. But more widely Maresca is a key part in the conversation about boring football. When people talk of Pep clones, of robot-ball nihilists, they’re talking about Maresca, and perhaps also that other brooding technocrat Rubin Amorim, who was pictured last week watching his players train from a hundred yards away behind a fence, glowering at the distant rondos like a divorced dad at sports day.This is all probably cyclical, a symptom of the league running out of content, or just a general intolerance for levels of ambient boredom that are now painful to the over-stimulated modern idiot-brain. But it is also fascinating to watch, mainly because Maresca is willing to go to war with club’s own fans over this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are so many managers convinced that a single idea about football must be right, this sense that there are indeed eternal truths in the universe, and that these involve slow buildup play and/or the use of wing-backs? And more widely, how have Chelsea walked into this contradictory state of affairs, the party club, a casino made entirely from fireworks, which then considers it sensible to appoint Martin Luther as manager.Looking for logic from this version of Chelsea is probably pointless.This is a place where the accounts department has long since embarked on the compliance equivalent of drinking your own urine. Where it’s considered a good idea to hire a coach for your attacking assets who is ideologically bent on making them less not more starry, on turning them into drones, like buying a prized watch and covering it with gaffer tape because you just really, really believe in gaffer tape.More interesting is Maresca’s unpopularity now in the stadium and on the internet. It is probably fair to say actual, long-standing legacy fans are a mixed blessing for the more speculative Premier League owners, who want you to like football just enough to buy it, to click, to subscribe, but not enough to feel you have any say in what happens.None of this means Maresca will necessarily be sacked, although failure to make the Champions League might seal it. He remains a powerful indicator of how much grasp of basic detail these glazed and distant Chelsea owners possess, or indeed how much the detail matters right now beyond holding a seat at the table.What seems to matter more is that Chelsea’s fans are asserting their primacy in the experience, the needs, the wants, the feelings of those in the physical space. It remains to be seen if this can have any effect, whether the manager will be given time to untangle the wiring a little more. Or whether he is actually correct in the thing he didn’t really say, that football does still belong to its fans. In this sense, and this sense alone, Maresca at Chelsea remains a fascinating slow-burn drama.Explore more on these topicsChelseacommentShareReuse this content"

Montemurro, who led Arsenal to a first Women’s Super League title in seven years in 2019, was previously back in N5 in 2023, where his Juventus team lost 1-0 in the Champions League. Arsenal look very different, on and off the pitch, to the club he left. They upped their investment in and commitment to the women’s side after a review towards the end of Montemurro’s tenure, but a face familiar to him sits in the home dugout. While with Arsenal Montemurro was paired with Renée Slegers on the Uefa coach mentor programme in the early stages of the former Netherlands international’s coaching journey. Montemurro describes her as “a perfect fit for Arsenal”: “She really has brought back a level of belief in the squad and who they are. It’s a reflection of her. She’s very confident in what she does. She’s very strategic in how she goes about things. I’m so happy for her, happy she was given the opportunity and took it because it’s a very big job but she seems to be handling it well.” He said with a laugh: “I must have taught her well.”View image in fullscreenJoe Montemurro congratulates his team after defeating Wolfsburg earlier in the competition.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesFormidable forwardsArsenal boast an enviable forward line, theirfive goals against Leicesteron Tuesday a demonstration of their depth, with four goalscorers despite the absence of Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly, who withdrew injured from the England squad in April. It is hoped both will be fit to face Lyon, who have their own formidable forward line that will test Arsenal’s No 2 goalkeeper, Manuela Zinsberger, with Daphne van Domselaar injured playing for the Netherlands. The Champions League record goalscorer, Ada Hegerberg, is always a threat in a competition that seems, at times, to be her playground. The Haitian forward Melchie Dumornay has scored 19 goals across Ligue 1 (15) and the Champions League this season, Kadidiatou Diani is Lyon’s top scorer in Europe with five and the midfielder Lindsey Heaps is their second-highest scorer in Ligue 1 on 11. Eugénie Le Sommer and Tabitha Chawinga have also contributed goals in Europe for Lyon, who have scored 25 goals and conceded two. On the threat of Dumornay, Heaps said: “I always think: ‘How the heck would I play against her?’ That’s the big question for their backline. How do you want to play against our front three? With the things that they can do they can make it really difficult in all areas.”View image in fullscreenAda Hegerberg completed the rout of Bayern Munich in the last round.Photograph: Catherine Steenkeste/Getty ImagesWhat has Montemurro brought Lyon?“He’s done a really great job just bringing us back to Lyon’s style and giving us the freedom to play, but with a few tactical adjustments here and there for certain games,” said Heaps, a US international. “It’s the vibe, the freedom to play. We nail down little bits of the structure and how we want to play, positionally where we want to be and filling roles, but then there’s the freedom to bring out your qualities and your strengths. When you have that bit of freedom it brings a lot of confidence.” Montemurro, whose character is always praised by Arsenal players who worked under him, believes finding the right levels of pressure and fun are the key. “It’s us being prepared, excited and happy with a little bit of pressure,” he said. “If we put too much pressure on the team, things aren’t going well, you don’t see things straight, you don’t adjust properly. If you don’t put enough pressure on the team it takes it a little bit easy. It’s really about us, having the team be selfless, with a little bit of humility and smiling while they want the ball and want to keep the ball.”The fanbasesThe energy from the stands could be vital. Crowds of 30,000 to 60,000 at the Emirates Stadium are increasingly common and it is not just the scale of the attendances there that is important but the atmosphere those fans create. Arsenal have an engaged and enthusiastic fanbase that increasingly feels impactful on the pitch. Lyon have struggled, despite their phenomenal dominance of women’s football in France and their Champions League successes, to significantly grow their crowds. The record attendance at the Groupama Stadium for the women’s side is 38,466 for their 2024 Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but sustained five-figure crowds have been lacking. Lyon have also struggled to grow a travelling contingent, whereas Arsenal fans are likely to travel in impressive numbers for the second leg on 27 April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Arsenal’s 5-1 defeat of her team on Tuesday she said: “Overall, Arsenal are the better team. Lyon focuses too much on individuals; if you block those individuals you can stop their chance at scoring.” Arsenal have shocked Lyon before, earning a thrilling 5-1 win at the Groupama before a 1-0 defeat in London when they topped their Champions League group in 2022-23. “That game is very much in the past,” said Heaps. “That’s one of those games where a team comes and imposes themselves. They have such incredible players and individuality – the uniqueness of some of their individuals, that’s very exciting for a team – but then also the team play is very good. I rate them very high, I respect them so much, so I think that’s what makes this game very exciting. You have two teams that love to have the ball and love to play but also have played in really big games and know what’s at stake as well.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballLyon WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Erik ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, United were seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa. Now, they are in the same 14th place but 17 points behind Manchester City in the fifth position recently confirmed as a Champions League berth. The Portuguese arrived on a ticket of a 3-4-3 shape that has proved non-negotiable despite the flatlining league performance and helter-skelter Europa League campaign.In the latter, a 92nd-minute Bruno Fernandes goalwas needed to beat Rangersin January. Rasmus Højlund’s 88th-minute strikebeat Viktoria Plzenin December. Last week, United were leading 2-1in the first leg at Lyonon 88 minutes after Joshua Zirkzee’s header but Rayan Cherki’s 95th-minute shot grabbed a draw. André Onana was culpable but the wider picture was of familiar disarray in United’s area.It is the same in attack. At Old Trafford on Thursday Maguire had to be shunted forward as a makeshift No 9 owing to a lack of alternatives, joining Kobbie Mainoo. The 19-year-old Mainoo scored a calm equaliser (in minute 120) yet shoving an attacking midfielder and centre-back up front is as unsustainable as relying on a 33-year-old Casemiro to be chief creator – the Brazilian was involved in all three of United’s extra-time goals, providing assists for Maguire and Mainoo and winning the penalty scored by Fernandes.The emergency roles for Maguire and Mainoo show up the dismal construction of a squad that contains only two centre-forwards in Zirkzee (who is injured and a more natural No 10) and Højlund, who lacks service from Amorim’s dysfunctional side.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo (left) and Harry Maguire are an unusual and unsustainable strike partnership.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAFactor in, too, Amorim’s seemingly quaint man-management of Marcus Rashford, whom he bombed out and who is pulling up trees at Aston Villa on loan.As Maguire says: “You can see that we’re probably short on attackers. We had two in the squad in Garners [Alejandro Garnacho] and Rasmus and they gave everything out there. Garners was on his last legs and he was up and down the pitch numerous times. So if he [Amorim] asks me to go up there, I’m willing to.”Maguire is frank, too, about the slipshod organisation: “I don’t know how I would have felt if I had come here and been speaking after a 4-2 defeat – it’s not even worth trying to think about that. The second half was comfortable; they had a lot of possession but they didn’t create chances. Then they scored the first goal out of nothing, really.”For nothing read Moussa Niakhaté and Alexandre Lacazette being allowed to play head-tennis before Tolisso scored with a third header on 71 minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we needed to see out those minutes and be solid, so to end up at 2-2 straight away [through Nicolás Tagliafico in the 77th minute], it was difficult to take.”Cherki’s 104th-minute finish and Lacazette’s penalty on 109 derived from further panic. Maguire says: “Then, in extra time, we obviously can’t get done on two counterattacks like that when we’re playing against 10 men; it’s criminal really. But we showed great spirit at that moment.”Party like it’s 1999: Amorim uses treble as ‘inspiration’ for crazy Lyon comebackRead moreA number of United fans left, with some returning as the game was turned upside down. On Instagram Zirkzee said alongside a clip of the Old Trafford noise: “To all the fans who left when we were down. Have a listen to this.” You could hardly blame those who did depart. As Maguire says: “This season it’s been so difficult for everyone involved, all the fans, all the players, the staff.”For those who witnessed it memories were cast. This is what United do. Thursday’s box-office finish can be added to a long list that includes last term’s last-gaspFA Cup elimination of Liverpool, the ceding of a 3-0 advantageto Coventry in the semi-finalbefore a breathless penalty shootout win, and, of course,the 1999 Champions League finaltriumph.After beating Coventry, United claimed the FA Cup and victory over Lyon capped a spine-tingling week for English clubs on the continent afterArsenal knocked out Real MadridandAston Villa went close to their own Lazarus actagainst Paris Saint-Germain.So a last question: will Maguire’s late, late seizing of the narrative prove Amorim’s Mark Robins moment or a freak occurrence that exposes United’s lack of what the coach needs to make them a force again?Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedHarry MaguireRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Northampton soon levelled after a good spell of pressure on the Newcastle tryline and some smart passing allowed Wright to burst forward and score his first Premiership try, with Rory Hutchinson adding the extras.Connon kickedNewcastleback in front with a penalty and after an impressive buildup through the phases, Callum Chick’s try was chalked off following a TMO review. Hearle then chipped the ball over the Saints’ defence before chasing it down and a quick move reached Elliott Obatoyinbo but the full-back was denied following a big tackle in the right corner.Pepper came on to replace Obatoyinbo and Saints then appeared to have struck, but Wright’s try was ruled out. The visitors took the lead for the first time in the game when a quick switch in play towards the right allowed Green to touch down for his maiden Premiership try and Smith kicked the conversion.Northampton piled on the misery for Newcastle just before the break with two tries in quick succession when Smith squeezed through a gap before converting his own effort and Glister kicked a loose ball and chased it down to bag the bonus point, with Smith’s kick successful.

So, from my perspective, you can’t work with a team and change things overnight.”This considered approach has been the ballast around which Hamilton and Fred Vasseur have held their ship steady, as the Ferrari team principal noted after the last round in Bahrain: “You won’t replace 12 years of collaboration in two weeks or two races.” He also noted in Saudi Arabia that it was a two-way street.“Lewis is coming with his own experience with 20 years of F1 with different teams,” he said. “It’s always good to have someone join the team with this kind of experience and vision, to help us to improve.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton tests out his Ferrari during the first free practice before the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.Photograph: Altaf Qadri/APFor Hamilton it is also more than just a matter of adjusting to the team. He is in a new car with distinct characteristics and adapting a driving style that was for so long attuned to the Mercedes. He felt he had advanced again in Bahrain, returning his best finish this season of fifth and where, during the second stint, he believes he may be finding a groove.Still, the caution remains. “It’s like we’re riding a rollercoaster together, up and down and I have no doubts we will get to where we plan to be, it’s just going to take time,” he said. “There are changes that are short term that we’ll do together, keep all the greatness and keep building all the areas that we could be stronger in. Some of those are short term and some of them are longer term.”A tilt at the title already looks to be wishful thinking, however, with McLaren’s Lando Norris leading the championship by three points from his teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third, eight points back. Hamilton is seventh, 52 points adrift, yet the atmosphere at Ferrari remains upbeat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team brought a new floor upgrade to Bahrain to address the issues with a narrow operating window and its weakness through high-speed corners, where running a low ride-height is key for aerodynamic efficiency.In Bahrain it was felt the floor had delivered but the real test will be in Jeddah, a high-speed, low-drag track of very fast corners joined by two hairpins at either end. If they have made another really positive step forward, Hamilton and Ferrari might well consider they are genuinely on the move.In first practice, Alpine’s Pierre Gasly topped the timesheets, albeit in the unrepresentative daytime running for what is a night race, just in front of Norris and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, with Hamilton in eighth and Verstappen, once more struggling with the balance of his Red Bull, ninth.In the night running of the second session, Norris was on top, one-tenth clear of Piastri, the McLarens looking strong again, with Verstappen improving in third and Leclerc fourth.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFormula OneFerrariSaudi Arabia and sportMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here is the textFri 18 Apr 2025 19.09 EDTShareUpon review of the government’s motion, the court denies the motion for an emergency stay pending appeal and for a writ of mandamus. The relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature. While we fully respect the Executive’s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court’s recent decision.It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all. The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done.This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order. Moreover, the government has conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or “mistakenly” deported. Why then should it not make what was wrong, right?TheSupreme Court’s decisionremains, as always, our guidepost. That decision rightly requires the lower federal courts to give “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”. That would allow sensitive diplomatic negotiations to be removed from public view. It would recognize as well that the “facilitation” of Abrego Garcia’s return leaves the Executive Branch with options in the execution to which the courts in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision should extend a genuine deference. That decision struck a balance that does not permit lower courts to leaveArticle IIby the wayside.The Supreme Court’s decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing. It requires the government “to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody inEl Salvadorand to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”. “Facilitate” is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear. The plain and active meaning of the word cannot be diluted by its constriction, as the government would have it, to a narrow term of art. We are not bound in this context by a definition crafted by an administrative agency and contained in a mere policy directive. Thus, the government’s argument that all it must do is “remove any domestic barriers to [Abrego Garcia’s] return” is not well taken in light of the Supreme Court’s command that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’srelease from custody in El Salvador.“Facilitation” does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual to the one country’s prisons that the withholding order forbids and, further, to do so in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns. “Facilitation” does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here. Allowing all this would “facilitate” foreign detention more than it would domestic return. It would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.The government is obviously frustrated and displeased with the rulings of the court. Let one thing be clear. Court rulings are not above criticism. Criticism keeps us on our toes and helps us do a better job. Court rulings can overstep, and they can further intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches. Courts thus speak with the knowledge of their imperfections but also with a sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely missed in their absence.“Energy in the [E]xecutive” is much to be respected. It can rescue government from its lassitude and recalibrate imbalances too long left unexamined. The knowledge that executive energy is a perishable quality understandably breeds impatience with the courts. Courts, in turn, are frequently attuned to caution and are often uneasy with the Executive Branch’s breakneck pace.And the differences do not end there. The Executive is inherently focused upon ends; the Judiciary much more so upon means. Ends are bestowed on the Executive by electoral outcomes. Means are entrusted to all of government, but most especially to the Judiciary by the Constitution itself.The Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraintsThe Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraints. If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” would lose its meaning.Today, both the United States and the El Salvadoran governments disclaim any authority and/or responsibility to return Abrego Garcia. We are told that neither government has the power to act. The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect. The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive’s respect for the courts. Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.It is in this atmosphere that we are reminded of President Eisenhower’s sage example. Putting his “personal opinions” aside, President Eisenhower honored his “inescapable” duty to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education II to desegregate schools “with all deliberate speed.” This great man expressed his unflagging belief that “[t]he very basis of our individual rights and freedoms is the certainty that the President and the Executive Branch of Government will support and [e]nsure the carrying out of the decisions of the Federal Courts.” Indeed, in our late Executive’s own words, “[u]nless the President did so, anarchy would result.”Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around. The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well. We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.In sum, and for the reasons foregoing, we deny the motion for the stay pending appeal and the writ of mandamus in this case. It is so ordered.This was excerpted from the order by the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit inKilmar Abrego Garcia v Kristi Noem.

Yet Mexico bucked both trends. Its governing party, Morena, not only retained the presidency but – along with itspartnersin the Sigamos Haciendo Historia coalition – gained a two-thirds supermajority in the chamber of deputies, the lower house, while the far right failed to even run a candidate. That a self-described leftwing party could have such success by fixing on Mexico’s chasmic inequality has drawn attention from hopeful progressives worldwide. But Morena’s programme has some not-so-progressive elements too. It is not necessarily one others could – or would want to – copy in its entirety.Morena first notched a historic result in 2018, when Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an old face of the left who ran for president twice before founding the party, won a record 55% of the vote during the general elections. Mexico’s constitution limits presidents to a single term. But this time, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of López Obrador’s,won 60%of the vote. Her victory was reminiscent of the heyday of Latin America’s “pink tide”, when leftist leaders like Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales were reelected for a second term with more votes than their initial victories.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images / Reuters / Guardian DesignMeanwhile, the far right didn’t even get on the ballot. Eduardo Verástegui, an actor turned activist who producedSound of Freedom, the surprise box office hit about a US federal agent busting a child-trafficking ring in Colombia, sought to bring Trumpian politics to Mexico but failed to collect the signatures required to run as an independent. Rather than developing a Mexican brand of far-right politics, Verástegui tried to transplant a distinctly American flavour that was heavy with God, guns and individualism. It didn’t take root.Morena’s success in building a leftwing movement stemmed from the party’s focus on socioeconomic justice. López Obrador developed a simple and powerful populist narrative, arguing that the country had been captured by corrupt elites, including the old political parties and their national and transnational business partners. This resonates for people in Mexico, a palpably unequal country in which roughly 27% of incomeaccrues to the richest 1%.López Obrador promised to change that. His charisma and his long track record inMexicomade him a convincing vehicle for the message, which he hammered home in trips to every corner of the country and daily press conferences known as themañaneras. In these, he touted his government’s achievements and lambasted its critics, shaping the media agenda. Morena’s message was amplified through state and social media, creating a kind of personality cult around López Obrador.And he delivered. López Obrador’s government doubled the minimum wage in real terms, while expanding social programmes and cash transfers for pensioners and the young, among others. Itclamped downon the practice of outsourcing workers to avoid paying benefits and legislated that union contracts be put todemocratic votes. And it focused infrastructure projects on the historically marginalised south, building trains and a new oil refinery. From 2018 to 2022, the percentage of the population living in poverty fell from roughly 42% to 36%.More from this seriesLoading...By putting inequality at the centre of his discourse, López Obrador created a committed base of supporters who were willing to overlook theshortcomings of his government.Although he came to power promising to improve corruption, insecurity and impunity, he achieved none of these things. His government had its owncorruption scandals, and Mexico’s homicide rate remained high, with about 30,000 murders a year. In some ways, the situation worsened: extortion is now rampant. Despite this, large parts of the population felt increasingly confident in democracy. By 2023, 61% of Mexicanssaid they had faithin their national government, compared with 29% when he took office.Mexico’s bloody cartel war rages as myth of the ‘good narco’ wears thinRead moreBut progressives elsewhere shouldn’t be too sanguine about the prospect of copying Morena’s model. While doing all the above,López Obrador also made expedient moves to the right. He cut deals with big business and swerved on tax reform. He kept fiscal austerity, meaning boosted social spending was funded with cuts elsewhere. Hecracked down on US-bound migrantsfor political capital in Washington, and he refused to take a position ongay marriageorabortion, presumably to avoid limiting Morena’s appeal. And heembraced Mexico’s military, a popular but opaque institution with a record ofhuman rights abuses, relying on them todeliver his programme. And although López Obrador set up several commissions to investigate historical abuses by the army,he later abandoned them.Criticisms came from across the political spectrum, but López Obrador brushed them off – and often insinuated they came from actors in hock to the corrupt elites of his narrative. By the end of his government, he had lost support from somefeminists,environmentalistsandvictims of violence, to name a few. Yet his base continued to grow. He left power with approval ratings of about 70%.Once it became clear that Morena was on the up, politicians of all stripes, including some dubious characters, sought to join. Morena welcomed them, diluting principle with pragmatism. This shortcut to electoral success came at the cost of internal tensions. Still, Morena maintains a membership and grassroots activity that no other party can match. It has2.3 millionregistered members, and wants to make that10 million. Sheinbaumhas commandedthe party’s activists to get out to every part of the country. (It is an article of faith in the party that López Obrador’s success was born of visiting each of Mexico’s nearly 2,500 municipalities.) All of this no doubt helps ground Morena in local realities – in contrast to the fledgling far right.The party’s connection to local contexts limitshow much progressives outside Mexico can draw from Morena’s example. Mexico is marked by its colonial history, and was under one-party rule for most of the 20th century before it transitioned to democracy in the 1990s. Today, organised crime exerts immense influence through violence and corruption,while Mexico’s economic dependence on the US is extreme. This sharp sense of injustice is a mobilising political sentiment.It would be tempting to frame Mexico’s political landscape as a story about the left successfully resisting the right. Butprogressives elsewhere must ask themselves how much they would want to draw from Morena. The focus on socioeconomic justice, the narrative control and the party organisation were tied up with some uglier aspects of populism, and an expedient adoption of rightwing positions. It’s hard to say whether the latter were necessary for Morena’s electoral success. But there is dissent on the Mexican left, where some, having weighed the results against their values, are no longer on board with the party.Thomas Graham is a freelance journalist based in Mexico City"

Reform is in league with big business in a way that Labour is notFri 18 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 13.05 EDTShareMost reviews ofGet In, the recently published history of Keir Starmer’s Labour by the Times journalists Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, focused on its exposure of the prime minister’s unease with the rough and tumble of politics, and his consequent reliance on Morgan McSweeney, now his chief of staff. A spectacular what-might-have-been moment in the book concerns another Downing Street svengali figure, however; one rumoured to beplotting Nigel Farage’s path to powerat the next election.At the beginning of 2019, it turns out, Dominic Cummingsattempted to convinceaides to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour should vote for Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement, thereby prompting a split in the Conservative party and a swift election. Labour could then fight and win that contest on its own natural territory of funding the NHS and public services. As Cummings put it in a text to Corbyn’s spokesperson: “You get Brexit through, [People’s Vote] fucked … high chance of Govt collapse … Tory civil war guaranteed for years in any scenario.”Plausible? Corbyn’s sharpest political ally, John McDonnell, was among those who didn’t buy it, fearing that Labour would be deserted by millions of middle-class remainers crying betrayal. Instead, under Starmer’s direction as shadow Brexit secretary, the other fork in the road was chosen. The party backed a second referendum, and was subsequently routed in the“get Brexit done” electionat the end of the year.Viewed in hindsight, the politics of that moment look just as invidious as they did then. But as May’s local elections approach, and Faragepromises to parkReform UK’s tanks “on the lawns of the red wall”, the anecdote is of far more than historical interest. Cummings – in bracingly ecumenical fashion – understood the social democratic potential in the disruptions of the 2010s, as the blue-collar vote asserted itself in unpredictable ways. Does Labour, even now?As a now familiar pattern of extreme political turbulence continues domestically and abroad, Labour’s massive but shallow victory last July seems almost a trick of the electoral light. Polls indicate that support is being lost to the right, the left and the centre. Front and centre in the north of England and Midlands, though, is thegathering momentumof Farageism. The Runcorn and Helsby byelection on 1 May will be a knife-edge affair – one that many Labour loyalistsbelieve Reform will win.A Farage triumph, in the first Westminster contest since the heady days of last summer, would underline that the resentments and aspirations for which Brexit was a vehicle have not gone away. As the government continues to box itself in by sticking to self-defeating fiscal rules, it may already be too late to avoid a Runcorn outcome that will trigger painful memories of December 2019. But between now and the next election, ifLabouris to avoid the strategic mistakes of the recent past it will need to think in more imaginative, ambitious and generous terms about who the Reform-facing or Reform-curious actually are, and what they are trying to say.A report in Marchby the polling group More in Common delivered one suggestive nugget that might help. Collating responses according to its own range of voter types across the political spectrum, the report’s authors noted an unusual overlap. “Loyal nationals” and “progressive activists” were both more likely than other groups to think “the government should act to limit the damage done by business”.Interesting. According toMore in Common’s typology, progressive activists will have gone deep into further education, live in cities, support Labour or the Greens, care about inequality and like the Guardian. Loyal nationals often read the Mail or the Sun, feel looked down upon by the certificated, are anxious about external threats and believe the nation should come together in defence of the collective self-interest.Is this a partial snapshot, then, of Labour’s old, fractured voting coalition finally in agreement? In asubsequent dispatchpublished in the Guardian, More in Common’s director, Luke Tryl, recorded similar sentiments in the towns of Merthyr Tydfil and Dudley, where Reform has been on the march for months. Alongside the now familiar distrust, bordering on contempt, for politicians, Tryl noted that “big business was seen as just as bad. Energy companies and supermarkets profiteering from the cost of living crisis, Amazon not paying its fair share of tax, tech companies damaging young minds, were all raised across the two days as examples of rampant corporate greed.”Though it talks a good game in the regions, and sees the potential in some judicious“old Labour”-style positioning, Reform generally aspires to satisfy corporate greed rather than challenge it. Itsgeneral election manifestopledged to slash corporation tax as well as inheritance tax rates, and drastically raise the threshold for paying the higher rate of income tax. Loyal national types are wooed by mining of the darker seams of communitarian angst: “small boats” rhetoric, thepromise to take Britain outof the European court of human rights and boilerplate attacks on “diversity”.Depressingly, it appears that Starmer and McSweeney’s Labour continues to view blue-collar voters primarily the same way – to be courted throughcrackdowns on immigrationand ahigh-profile focuson crime and policing. It is fatuous politics to play down the importance of either issue in Reform-friendly constituencies and beyond. But this remains a desperately narrow, limited interpretation of working-class values and preoccupations.Cummings’ insight throughout the Brexit period was that in regions such as South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear, there is a hankering for – and a memory of – a more collectivist politics than the exploitative rentier capitalism presided over by both the main parties for decades. The notorious£350m NHS pledgeon the side of the Brexit bus worked for a reason. However cynically it was conceived, it stood for a reassertion of popular priorities and control over everyday lives, and the classical blue-collar (and Labour) values of mutuality and solidarity.As Labour has belatedlybegun to realisein relation to the potential demise of the British steel industry, standing up for the public good against powerful but remote interests can be popular with “progressives” and “patriots”. This principle, rather than a technocratic obsession with growth, can be the cornerstone of a future Labour voting coalition that calls Reform’s bluff and injects some much-needed idealism into the nation’s politics.Such an approach would mean prosecuting a critique of the way contemporary capitalism works far more radical than the government has dared or wished to contemplate. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump is undertaking his own quixotic version of this. Is it too much to hope that modern Labour, eventually, can respond with resources already present within its own traditions?Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerReform UKNigel FarageDominic CummingscommentShareReuse this content"

We still have 45 months to go. Through his antics, the US president is normalizing, even encouraging, intense selfishness and disregard for others. The clearest example is USAID: if the richest, most powerful country in the world thinks it’s a waste to give a tiny fraction of its income to the poorest, worst off people in the world, you must be a real sucker if you care for others.Finally, the Trump regime has met its match | Robert ReichRead moreThis comes on top of a longer trend of declining western happiness and disconnection. In 2012, the United States ranked 11th in theWorld Happiness Report. This year, it was 24th. In 2023, one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone. That figure has risen 53% in just two decades.These short- and long-term trends are no coincidence.New researchshows that unhappy people vote for populists, those who promise to rip the system apart. Importantly, it also finds that trust explains which type of populists unhappy people support: low-trust people vote for far-right parties, whereas high-trust people go far left. Therefore, we should see Trumpism as both a symptom of a lower-trust, lower-happiness society and a cause of further misery and mistrust.But what should you do if you don’t like the way the world is going? Is there anything you can do?The obvious answer is to rage, doomscroll and hope for the next election. But the obvious answer is no longer an option once we realize the antidote to Trump is to build a happier, higher trust society. Drawing on my dual experience as a moral philosopher and happiness researcher, I’d like to suggest some alternative ways you can fight back.Trumpism is built on pettiness and self-interest, so resisting means embodying the opposite virtues. To paraphrase a much better president: do not ask what the world can do for your happiness – ask what you can do for the happiness of the world. You commit yourself to making the biggest difference you can – even when others do not.Fighting back doesn’t have to mean shouting louder. Another option is gracious, determined decencyIt starts internally. Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher born a Roman slave, wrote: “We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.” That idea, now a pillar of modern psychotherapy, is especially relevant in moments like this. Trump and co want to make you feel helpless and furious. Keeping your composure and finding joy are acts of resistance.It continues locally. Make an effort to build social connections where you live. Research shows when we share meals with others, volunteer or strike up friendly conversations with strangers, we’re not just making ourselves and others happier. We’re rebuilding the social fabric that authoritarian politics tears apart and reducing the distrust that fuels politicians like Trump. Higher trust and happiness make us less susceptible to the politics of fear and resentment; the data backs this up.Some good news is that our perceptions of mistrust are misplaced. There have been global studies in which researchers drop wallets to see what percentage is returned. A40-country studyfound actual wallet return rates are abouttwice as highas people expected. In the US, two-thirds were returned – against the view that one-third would be. Simply recognizing we can trust others more than we thought is a helpful step forward. You could join a localAction for Happinessgroup.Recent researcheven shows prosocial activity is reliably linked to fewer “deaths of despair”. Your kindness could save lives.At the national level, we need to see politicians taking social connection – not just the economy – more seriously. If it seems fluffy or unimportant, look at where ignoring them has got us: he’s in the Oval Office. Academics are starting to assess policies by their “bang for buck” at improving wellbeing: economists at the London School of Economics published a first,milestone review in 2024.

My colleagues and I at theHappier Lives Instituterecently published the first global analysis of how much happiness different charities produce per dollar. We found a striking result. The most effective charities – often tackling issues such as depression or malnutrition in low-income countries – have about 150 times the impact of the average rich-country charity. If someone gave $150,000 to charity, you would consider them a hero. It turns out you can do as much good by giving $1,000 – if you follow the evidence and pick wisely. Giving 1% of your income to these organizations is a quiet act of moral clarity in a noisy, self-interested world.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad BazziRead moreFighting back doesn’t have to mean shouting louder. Another option is gracious, determined decency. Choose kindness over cruelty, generosity over selfishness, and evidence over bluster. Today, these quiet choices are acts of radical courage – ones that help build a better tomorrow. They might even make you happier, too.What’s giving me hopeTrumpism is the symptom of a less happy, less trusting society. But we are far from powerless to change this. There are several ways we can each make a difference – starting with our own minds and local communities and finishing with helping others around the world. What gives me hope is realizing we have the potential to understand what’s going wrong in our society and do our part to improve it.Michael Plant is the founder and research director of the Happier Lives Institute.

The US is many things at the moment, but stable is not one of them. So, amid all this turmoil, how are all the Donald Trump voters feeling? Has buyer’s remorse set in? Are they starting to wonder whether voting in a convicted felon as president – a man who hasdeclared bankruptcy six times– might not have been the wisest move?Not according to the polls. Rather, the US appears to be a nation of Édith Piafs: they regretrien.I’m not saying that disillusioned Republicans don’t exist; do enough digging and you can certainly find a few. And journalists have been doing a lot of digging. During Trump’s first term, there was a steady stream of media pieces profiling the regretful Trump voter. The genre has remained popular through the first few months of Trump 2.0. But, according to a much-discussed segment by CNNsenior data reporterHarry Enten this week, polling proves that the idea of “regretful” Trump voters is “more of a media creation than anything else”.“I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, they regret what they did back in 2024. I’m here to tell you, uh-uh. Very few of them regret what they did back in 2024,” Enten said on Wednesday.Enten was referencing anew pollfrom the University of Massachusetts Amherst which found thatjust 2%of Trump voters agreed with the statement “I regret my [2024] vote and would vote differently if I could”. That’s almost half the number (3.5%) of Trump voters who said the same thing in February 2017. Meanwhile, 74% of Trump voters said they feel very confident that they made the right choice.In Trumpland, ‘defending free speech’ means one thing: submission to the president | Rafael BehrRead moreOf course, polls aren’t always reliable. Indeed, I’m going to be a little cruel and refer you back to an Enten segment from five days before the election, where the data guru looked at three 2024 polling trends that pointed to a potential victory for vice-president Kamala Harris. “If Harris wins the signs were clear as day,”he declared. In short: Mark Twain had the measure of polling when he said “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics”.Asking people whether they regret an important choice they just made is also a loaded question. It’s akin to asking them “are you a complete idiot?” So I would treat these particular polls with a dose of caution: just because people don’t actively admit to regretting their vote, it doesn’t mean that they’re not worried about the direction the country is headed in, or that they’re thrilled about Trump’s performance as president. On the contrary,Trump’s approval ratingis dropping and a lot of people are worried aboutinflationand higher prices. Everyone is feeling some pain right now.In ahyper-polarisedcountry, however, what seems to really matter to many voters isn’t how much pain they’re feeling themselves, but whether the other side is suffering more. I could cite various academic papers on the politics of resentment; I could surface endless statistics on the subject. But I think the best summation of Trumpism is a quote from a woman called Crystal Minton from back in 2019, whichwent viral afterbeing included in a New York Times report. Minton lived in a Florida town that had been ravaged by the double whammy of a hurricane and a Trump administration-instigated government shutdown, and was suffering. “I voted for [Trump], and he’s the one who’s doing this,” Minton complained. “I thought he was going to do good things. He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”Right now, however, Trump is hurting the sort of people many of his voters seem to be interested in seeing get hurt. He’s an avenging angel, wreaking vengeance on the elite institutions, scapegoats and bogeymen that the Republican party has spent years blaming for the state of the US. He’scut fundingto all the Ivy League universities he’s called “woke” and declared out of touch with American values. He’s goneafter transgender people. And he has rounded up immigrants and protesters, just as he promised he would do.Trump isn’t just doing every vindictive thing he told his supporters he was going to do: he’s trolling his detractors via nasty memes. He’s rubbing salt in their wounds. There has been what Marcus Maloney, a sociology professor at Coventry University in the UK, called a “4Chanification of American politics”. The White House Valentine’s Day post, for example, wasa poem: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you”. Cutesy font appeared above the floating heads of Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan. And a video last month posted by the White House showed a man being deported while Semisonic’s famous lyricsplayed in the background: “You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.” The cruelty is very much the point.While Trump may be hurting all the people he said he’d be hurting, there’s plenty of pain to go around. There has been a lot of anger from some of Trump’s backers in Wall Street over the volatility that the president’s tariff policy has injected into the stock market. Some of hisbillionaire backers, such as the investor Bill Ackman, have been screaming bloody murder. But for a lot of Trump’s backers, the fluctuations of the stock market have no immediate effect on their lives. The top 10% of Americans hold93% of all stocks. This is what happens when inequality reaches record levels: you get a group of people with nothing to lose, which means they have little to regret. You get people happy to burn the whole system down.None of this is to say that Trump voters are immune to remorse. With his tariff plan, he is just getting started. The president may be good at bluster, but even his most diehard supporters are going to realise quite quickly that food prices – which Trump promised to lower on the campaign trail – are not, in fact, going down. When the price of basic goods keep rising, there’s only so long you can keep feeding people obvious lies. Perhaps the Trumpers won’t get quite so much of a dopamine rush from “owning the libs” when they can’t afford to own anything else.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpRepublicansTrump tariffsUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Who is protecting him?April O’Neill is the winner of the 2025 Emerging Voices award (19-25 age category) recognising young talent in political opinion writingFri 18 Apr 2025 07.08 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 13.05 EDTShareSome people should never have a smartphone – and I want to tell you about one of them. For the past couple of decades, Paul* had a classic Nokiabrick-style phone. He could make calls – even send the odd text if we were lucky. But, a few years ago, he got a smartphone. At first, nothing changed much. He was reconnecting with friends, discovering emojis – there were no concerns. It has only been recently that the phone has become a problem, and that’s because he has stumbled across social media. And he is on it constantly.What do we know about Paul? He has time on his hands and, having grown up in an era when encyclopedias were the main source of knowledge, he has little media literacy when it comes to analysing sources and figuring out which ones he should trust. I can see why he probably takes it for granted that what he reads on his phone is true.According to people who’ve known him a while, Paul went from talking about birdwatching to sharing interviews featuring Tommy Robinson, to saying that migrants are taking our jobs, to embracing fake history and conspiracy theories found on YouTube. By this point, if Paul watched a video that claimed Stonehenge was a portal to another dimension and built by giants, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him engage in an online war to defend it.The Online Safety Actis now partly enforceable. Paul might make you think a bit harder about it. Understandably, much of the conversation surrounding it has been focused on protecting children, but there is a glaring hole in this legislation regarding the protection of adults. Despite a2022 reportfor the Ministry of Justice finding that the role of the internet in radicalisation pathways “was most evident for older rather than younger individuals”, the Tory governmentbacked out from provisionsthat would have prevented adults from seeing “legal but harmful” content online over fears about freedom of speech. But, if the2024 UK riotstaught us anything, it is how quickly adults can be roused to extremist mobilisation – even bymisleading poststhat may have been shared in all innocence.Ofcom reportsthat misinformation, including content that discriminates on the grounds of a protected characteristic, is the most likely form of potential harm adults will encounter online. With 52% of adultsusing social mediaas a form of news consumption, the risk of falling down a far-right rabbit hole is only going to increase. And Mark Zuckerberg’s decisionto remove independent factcheckingfrom Meta platforms will only make social media more of a breeding ground for fake news. In the UK, 77% of those aged 65 and overdescribe Facebookas their main form of social media – and as research carried out by Dr Sara Wilford, a lead researcher on the EU-funded research projectSmidge(Social Media Narratives: Addressing Extremism in Middle Age), suggests,it is older userswho are most vulnerable to this change. As they are not “digital natives”, everything they have learned online has been self-taught, so they tend to trust content at face value and are reluctant to factcheck. With the Online Safety Act neglecting them, they are (literally) left to their own devices.Making matters worse, everyone’s favourite billionaire, Elon Musk, the owner of X, is spreading his own misinformation about his newfound obsession: Britain. Nearly two million people saw Musk’sretweet of a fake Telegraph articlethat claimed the prime minister was planning on sending far-right rioters to “emergency detainment camps” in the Falklands. Most people saw the post for what it was – and Musk deleted it when it was shown to be total nonsense – but it looked real. So how can someone who is computer illiterate, who wouldn’t even twig if a bot were messaging him on Facebook marketplace wanting to exchange his used VHS tapes for a handful of beans, understand the need to be cautious when someone such as Musk – rich, powerful, chronically online – spreads fake news? And what is infuriating is that these tech bros seeminglydon’t care: Musk and Zuckerberg appear to be too busy fighting over who gets to go to Donald Trump’s birthday party to have a second thought about their users.It is such a shame. By all accounts, Paul had always been tolerant and open-minded. Over time, with what he read and absorbed, he became so angry. And he’s not that unusual.About one in fiveinternet users are unaware that apps and websites use algorithms to tailor what they are being shown. Many people do not recognise that what they are consuming online is diluted and biased; there are older people just like Paul who cannot get out of this cycle because they truly don’t know they are in it. It is troubling how many algorithms are nowpushing more extreme content. I have noticed on my own X account an increase in explicit photos of women and pro-Trump views – even people I have blocked, such as Laurence Fox, have somehow been popping up on my feed.I don’t blame older people, or think they’re stupid, for being taken in by what is often very sophisticated content. I am in my early 20s – a digital native – and I sometimes fall for fake content, too. I was totally fooled by the AI-generated image ofKaty Perry at the 2024 Met Gala(and so, apparently, was her mum). Sometimes my friends and I can’t tell if an image or video is deepfaked. If we don’t take precautions now, what will it be like when this technology becomes even more advanced?This Labour government has been so preoccupied by the threat of the left that it has left the door wide open for the far right. Until something is done, and encoded in legislation, we run the risk of more riots, more attacks, more lies. The government must review the Online Safety Act to make sure that everyone, regardless of age, is protected from fake news and far-right propaganda online – before fact becomes completely indistinguishable from fiction.April O’Neill is the winner of The Guardian Foundation’s2025 Emerging Voices Awards(19-25 age category) recognising young talent in political opinion writing*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleOpinionInternetFar rightSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

What began as a power struggle between generals has led to the killing of tens of thousands of people and widespread sexual and ethnic violence. The International Rescue Committee says the result is the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded: 640,000 peopleface catastrophic hunger. Basic services and infrastructure, already woefully inadequate, have been destroyed.“One thing that has been consistent since day one,” the Sudanese activist and commentator Dallia Mohamed Abdelmoniemobservedthis week, “[is that] it’s a war on civilians. Now, I think we’ve become so desensitised to it, that doesn’t make much of a difference any more. There’s no impact.”Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s army chief and de facto leader, and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries, had together ousted civilian leadership beforeturning on each otherin April 2023. Their vicious battle has forced tens of millions to flee their homes. Both sides havecommitted war crimes, and the US has accused the RSF and allied militias of genocide in Darfur. Outside parties have fuelled the conflict: Egypt and Saudi Arabia have close ties to the Sudanese army, while the Sudanese government and others accusethe United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, which it denies.Last month’s recapture of Khartoum by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has done nothing to end the conflict: on Wednesday, the RSF declaredthe creation of a rival government. There can be no military solution to the war. Instead, there is a growing prospect of effective partition. Having retaken the capital, the army may be even less willing to negotiate and may conclude that it is not overly concerned with the fate of Darfur and its people. There is also alarm that Gen Burhan hasdecreasing controlover his forces and is increasingly dependent on hardline Islamists, whom neither the SAF’s Gulf backers nor the west want to see return to power. The country’s ethnic divisions, too, are growing.The suffering of Sudan also has disturbing implications for a region facing other significant stresses. The influx of refugees has strainedthe impoverished eastern provinces of Chad.South Sudan, itselfon the verge of civil war, has been destabilised by the interruption to its oil exports (which transit via Sudan) as well as the arrival of so many fleeing the conflict. Meanwhile, tensions are flaring between neighbouringEthiopia and Eritrea.Yet Sudan remains largely ignored as atrocities mount. Many are disappointed that the UK, the UN security council member meant to take the lead on Sudan, hasfailed to prioritise the conflict. Even the modest aim of its conference in London on Tuesday – to persuade the Arab states involved to agree some basic diplomatic principles for future discussions –failed. Humanitarian support should be a more straightforward issue. Yet the UN appeal remains shockingly underfunded and hundreds of millions of dollars previously promised to Sudan have not materialised. USAID cuts havefurther hit relief work. Despite their suffering, Sudanese civilians are doingremarkable workto alleviate the suffering of others, running emergency kitchens and meeting other basic needs. The very least they deserve is backing for these essential efforts.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But this is themessagefrom leading figures within the industry.Amid headline-grabbing debates about the dangers of toxic online content to children sparked by Adolescence, the show has provokeddiscussionabout the threat to British TV from streaming services. Co-written by the British writers Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, and filmed with British actors in the north of England, Adolescence was funded by the US company Netflix. In February the platform launched the acclaimedToxic Town, also written by Thorne, dramatising the 1995 toxic waste scandal in Corby.Why weren’t these shows – about British working-class people with a strong social purpose – made by the BBC, ITV or Channel 4? According to Peter Kosminsky, the Bafta-award winning director of Wolf Hall, the answer is simple: the public service broadcasters canno longer afford to makehigh-end drama. He is callingfor a levy on the streamers– a “Netflix tax” – to be channelled back into British programme-making.Streaming has changed how we consume television (less than half of young people watch linear TV in a week) and sent production costs spiralling, with disastrous consequences – 70% of the freelancers on whom the industry dependsare out of work, withsenior producersforced to take jobs stacking shelves or to retrain altogether. It is also dictating the kind of shows being made. Cash-strapped executives are backing projects with international appeal – like Adolescence – at the expense of unscripted programmes and less splashy, uniquely British dramas.Wolf Hallis one of the undisputed jewels in the BBC’s crown. But Kosminskysayshe would not be able to make the final instalment,The Mirror and the Light, today. The executive producer of ITV’s surprise triumphMr Bates vs the Post Officehassaidthe same of the four-part series that drew in 4 million viewers an episode andled to new legislation. Both shows only aired last year.It is hard to imagine Netflix giving the green light to a TV series about a software malfunction in the UK Post Office. But in four hours of primetime TV, Mr Bates vs the Post Office succeeded where a decade of campaigning and journalism had failed – to make us understand the human suffering behind the headlines. Following in the tradition of Ken Loach’sCathy Come Home, the series showed that TV can be a powerful tool for social change.Its impact was testament to the importance of public service broadcasting. The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have been training grounds for many of today’s biggest names, without which we may not have the future Thorne, or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, or Michaela Coel.Televisionis hailed as the most democratic art form. If people can no longer afford to make a living from it, diversity on and off screen will suffer.The 7 million people tuning in live forThe Traitors finaleon BBC One in January proved that “appointment TV” is not dead yet. But successful television isn’t just about viewing figures. It is about telling the stories of those who might otherwise be overlooked, the “skint little people”, as Mr Bates puts it. Amid the battle between public service broadcasters and streaming giants, it is critical that those narratives do not get lost.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Male violence affects us all, but is seldom mentioned in any of these toxic debates. Instead, we get women being pitched against trans women, and one of the major underlying causes of all this distress – male violence – is allowed to remain unexamined.Putting the sports issue aside, can you imagine how different this issue would have been if there was no threat of violence (whether sexual or physical) from men, either towards women or trans women? The first step in treating a problem is to correctly name the root cause.Liz MoylettTyne and WearGenderself-identification has created confusion and inconsistency across our institutions. The sharp edge of this has, as usual, hurt mostly vulnerable women such as those in prison; those needing refuge from domestic violence; and those either working in, or requiring treatment from, NHS services. In these three examples we have ample evidence of male-bodied trans women violating women’s protected space.This clarification from the supreme court was necessary and proportionate, and should have no adverse effect on the majority, who are not violating spaces reserved for women, but simply living their lives. It also puts the onus on organisations to ensure provision for trans women who are also vulnerable to male violence, but whose needs should not be conflated with those of women for legitimate safeguarding purposes.Marian BrookeHailsham, East SussexSam Fowles writes: “It must be remembered that this is not an abstract debate – it involves real people” (The supreme court didn’t rule on the definition of ‘a woman’ – this is what its judgment does mean, 16 April). Gender-critical feminists have always known that this debate involves real people; women are real people, too. It is precisely because this inconvenient fact was forgotten by the Scottish parliament – that as real people we have suffered real abuse, vilification, fear, and denial of our sex-based human rights – that the case was brought in the first place.The ruling is absolute validation for those of us who have seen service providers and public bodies regard the expectations of 0.44% of the population as more important than the rights of 50%. It means that the spaces the women’s movement fought for, especially those for recovery from the trauma of male violence, can again become safe for women to access.Having experienced discrimination, abuse, sexual assault, violence and harassment from men because I am a woman, I do not wish anyone to experience such behaviour, be they women, trans women, trans men or men. I understand that trans women may not wish to access male spaces, so I suggest that the trans community campaign for safe transgender spaces. That way we can all have dignity and safety, and live life free from fear and intimidation.StephanieGreenIsleworth, LondonI am a mother. A mother to a transgender daughter who is about to turn 18. My daughter has rightly been devastated about this ruling and what it means for her and her hopes for the future. She hoped that the gender recognition certificate would acknowledge her identity, but she now feels her dreams have been obliterated. I would like to ask the women who have campaigned for this ruling: how many transgender women do you know? How many have you spoken to? Have you thought about what this means to them?My daughter does not want to be an athlete and compete in the Olympics or sit on a board in Scotland – she wants a normal life. A normal life is being able to drink fluids when you are at college. I’ve seen my daughter severely dehydrated, putting her health at risk, because she is too scared to go to the toilet.My daughter is so brave to go out every day and face the staring, the remarks, the laughing.Transgenderwomen already have so much to overcome. The protections stated in the Equality Act do not protect from the narrow-minded, the cruel and the heartless. On Wednesday, I was ashamed to be a woman.Name and address suppliedSince coming out as a trans woman a few years ago, I have been in the habit of using women’s loos without causing offence or even a raised eyebrow. Do I no longer have this option? With my hairstyle and general appearance, I would be an obvious misfit in the gents, inviting name-calling or worse. So what am I to do when caught short?The system before the latest ruling has generally worked well, including special exceptions for single-sex spaces where appropriate. There have been a small number of high-profile mistakes, such as the housing of a self-identified trans woman with convictions for molesting women in a women’s jail. Such things call for sensible management rather than sweeping change.I feel significantly less safe today than I did before the judgment. We have taken a sad backward step towards a darker, less compassionate age.Rachel IsherwoodBroughton-in-Furness, CumbriaI am a trans woman, I am pre-op but living full-time as a woman. I am on hormone-adjusting medication. I fought long and hard against the idea of transitioning until it became the only option for my sanity. My question is: who is most at risk, a woman when I use the ladies toilets, or me if I use the gents? This ruling and its ramifications scare me.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010WomenUK supreme courtParents and parentinglettersShareReuse this content"

The tapestry weaver William Sleath was rescued from destitution by Morris, who took him on as an apprentice at age seven.Sleath became a sensitive artist who continued to produce oils and watercolours into his 70s. His fellow weavers Walter Taylor and William Knight painted still lifes and scenes around Merton Abbey.Far from failing in “his dream of making art for all”, Morris sowed seeds of creativity at Merton Abbey that grew in radical ways. Taylor left the works to become a teacher, and delivered a tapestry course at the Central School of Arts and Crafts designed to provide occupational therapy and retraining for soldiers disabled in the first world war. One of his first students was Percy Sheldrick, who was employed at Merton Abbey after the course and rose to become master weaver.Those seeds continue to grow. Strawberry Thief may have taken over the world, but in south-west London the community arts group Made in Merton is trying to keep it local with activities that aim to connect people to the spirit of collective making. In our first project we made banners in a community workshop bearing the words “art”, “made” and “people”, with the letters cut from upcycled Morris fabrics. We then marched along the River Wandle, ending up outside the local Sainsbury’s, which stands on the site once occupied by Merton Abbey Works. A glorious occasion, made by the people and for the people.Portia DadleyMade in Merton, LondonWhen my wife, Helen, was dying last year it was thought we could get carers and have her at home instead of hospital. I told her I was buying new curtains for the room she would be in and ordered some with William Morris’s Strawberry Thief design to be made atCae Du Designsin Harlech. There they are in the room where she would have died. She never came home, so she never saw them, but was overjoyed that I’d ordered her favourite Morris design for her. When I look at them, I think of her exclaiming her delight, and so I’m grateful to William Morris.John P ButlerPwllheli, GwyneddDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

This raised important questions about potential exposure to carcinogens from wood smoke, as the use of wood fuel for home heating has increased in recent years.”Horsfall’s teamanalysed 26m energy performance certificatesfor 18m homes in England and Wales. These certificates are required when renting or selling a home and describe how well-insulated a home is and how it is heated. They calculated that 9.3% of thehomes in England and Waleshad solid-fuel heating, mainly for burning wood.Graphs of England and Wales showing usage of woodburning stovesWith availability of local wood, it is no surprise that the proportion of homes with wood burners is greatest in rural areas, especially in the south-west and north-west of England and in Wales. The Isles of Scilly tops the list for the local council with highest proportion of homes with burners (44%). The lowest is 0.5% of homes in Newham, east London. There were differences even within urban areas. In London the highest proportions of homes with wood burners were in the south-west suburbs and in Bromley, where parts of the boroughhave been exemptedfrom smoke control legislation since it was first applied in the 1950s and 1960s.The researchers found that the spatial density of burners determines the amount of air pollution that builds up in neighbourhoods on winter evenings. The density of wood burners was greatest in urban areas outside the major cities. Worthing, Norwich, Reading, Cambridge and Hastings councils had more than 100 wood burners per square kilometre.In separateresearch on 6,900 preschool children in New Zealand, the spatial density of solid-fuel heating was also associated with an increased risk of emergency hospital admissions.Horsfall said: “The sharp contrasts across small urban areas were particularly striking. What stood out most, though, was the high concentration of wood burners in smoke-control areas.”In Sheffield the greatest density of burners was found in the west of the city, and in Greater Manchester it was mainly around Stockport and Trafford. All these are smoke-control areas,raising questions about their effectiveness.Combining the home energy data with data on deprivation reveals that wood burning is overwhelmingly a pastime of those in the wealthiest areas. Most people had other forms of heating available, too. The certificates also revealed a steady increase in homes with a wood burner since 2009, with a sharp rise since 2022.Horsfall said: “We’re in a situation similar to what happened with diesel cars where we were encouraged to use an apparently environmentally friendly option, only to later discover its unanticipated impact on air quality.”This article was amended on 18 April 2025. An earlier version stated that burning wood at home adds more particle pollution to the air than vehicles on the roads; however, this should have said the exhausts of the vehicles.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionPollutionwatchEnglandWalesEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Visibility dropped to less than half a mile, causing travel disruptions, with two major airports halting flights, and streets in Basra, the largest city in southern Iraq, deserted. Respiratory problems sent thousands to hospital. The storm also affectedKuwait, where wind gusts exceeded 50mph, and visibility in some areas was diminished to zero.This massive dust cloud originated in Saudi Arabia before being blown intoIraq. While dust storms are common in Iraq, the climate crisis is expected to intensify them across the region in the future, fuelled by desertification in Saudi Arabia and Syria.Meanwhile, ex-Tropical Cyclone Tam has battered northern parts of New Zealand’s North Island as it swirls in the Tasman Sea, causing widespread damage, including power outages, fallen trees, submerged roads and flight delays at Auckland airport.

Further severe weather warnings have been issued as the cyclone continues to move southwards, disrupting the Easter weekend by delaying travel and sporting events.Meanwhile, Storm Hans, the largest of the 2024-25 European windstorm season, has lashed the Alps since Thursday, causing widespread disruption across northern Italy, southern Switzerland and south-easternFranceas the busy Easter weekend approaches.

Together with my team, I analyse extreme weather events and answer the questions of whether, and to what extent, human-induced climate change has altered their frequency, intensity and duration.When I first began my research, most scientists claimed that these questions couldn’t be answered. There were technical reasons for this: for a long time, researchers had no weather models capable of mapping all climate-related processes in sufficient detail. But there were other reasons that had less to do with the research itself.Let’s imagine extreme flooding in Munich, Rome or London and heavy rainfall in the slums of Durban on the South African coast. How the people in these various places experience this extreme weather depends on the local economic and social conditions and, fundamentally, on their political situation.Researching weather – and thus, the role of climate change – in the way I do is always political, and this makes it an uncomfortable topic for many scientists. I believe it is important to show that both obstacles – the technical and the political – can be overcome; our climate models have become better and better, and we are coming to realise that research cannot take place at a remove from the real world.View image in fullscreenA burning area of Amazon rainforest in 2020.Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesFor example, to know exactly how big the risk of a drought is – where and for whom – we need a whole lot of information. Three main factors come into play: the natural hazard, our exposure to the hazard, and the vulnerability with which we approach it.In west Africa in 2022, entire regions suffered from dramatic flooding during the rainy season. These floods were caused in part by above-average rainfall that, as my team and I discovered, was significantly more intense than it would have been without climate change. The rainfall was considered a “natural hazard,” but exacerbated so significantly by human-caused climate change that it was anything but natural.To a large extent, these floods – particularly in Nigeria – were caused by the release of a dam in neighbouring Cameroon, which flooded large parts of the densely populated Niger delta, home to more than 30 million people. The risk from rainfall is particularly high, both for the people and for local ecosystems and infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, roads and water supply lines.This region is uniquely exposed to weather and natural hazards. A dam was supposed to have been built in the Nigerian part of the delta to hold back the water, but it was never built. Given the poor infrastructure and high rates of poverty, people in this area are particularly vulnerable, affected much more adversely than those in other areas.View image in fullscreenThe community of Imburu, north east Nigeria, is almost completely submerged in September 2022.Photograph: Radeno Haniel/AFP/Getty ImagesSo how does weather become a disaster?We can’t say exactly how the effects of climate change vary by location and type of weather, but what is absolutely clear is that the more people are in harm’s way and the more vulnerable they are, the greater their risk.We’ve learned a lot more in recent years about all aspects of risk. For example, it’s now clear that climate change alters heatwaves far more than other weather phenomena. With every study that my team and I perform, we seek to answer the question of what these alterations actually mean for a small section of the global population. In these studies – known as “attribution studies” among experts – we analyse not just historical and current weather data but also information on population density, socioeconomic structures and basically everything we can find about the event itself to gain the most accurate picture of what happened and to whom.Only after all those steps do we ask whether climate change played a role. To do this, we work with various datasets that take into account a vast range of factors – land use, volcanic activity, natural weather variability, greenhouse gas levels, other pollutants, and much more.Broadly speaking, we use climate models to simulate two different worlds: one world with human-caused climate change and one without. We then use various statistical methods to calculate how likely or intense heatwaves are in specific places, both with and without human-caused global warming.But it is vulnerability and exposure that determine if weather becomes a disaster. The effects of extreme events always depend on the context – who can protect themselves from the weather (and how) is always a major factor. This is why the term “natural disaster” is entirely misplaced.For example, one of our studies from 2021 showed that the food insecurity linked to the drought in southern Madagascar was caused mainly by poverty, a lack of social structures, and heavy dependence on rainfall, but not by human-induced climate change. Nevertheless, just as with the Nigerian floods, international reports talked only of the weather and climate. The international media barely mentioned that, in fact, the local infrastructure, which had remained unfinished for decades, played a decisive role in the disastrous drought.View image in fullscreenPeople going to a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mobile clinic in Befeno, Madagascar, set up to treat the most serious cases of moderate and severe malnutrition after the 2021 drought.Photograph: RIJASOLO/AFP/Getty ImagesHow extreme events are reported – where the media focus their attention – doesn’t just influence the responsive measures we think possible. It also influences who we see as responsible for implementing the next necessary steps. Describing extreme weather as a singular moment that tells us something about climate change, and nothing more, conceals the factors that have just as much (if not more) impact on the weather’s effects, and provides politicians with a handy discussion framework as they try to divert attention from poor local decision-making and planning.There are two main reasons infrastructure in both Madagascar and Nigeria is so lacking and often nonexistent: the sustained destruction of local social structures under European colonial rule and extreme inequality within the population – inequality between the genders, between rich and poor, between different ethnic groups. It is because of factors like these that climate change becomes such a life-threatening problem.The main thing I have learned from extreme weather events is that the climate crisis is shaped largely by inequality and the still-undisputed dominance of patriarchal and colonial structures, which also prevent the serious pursuit of climate protection. By contrast, physical changes such as heavier rainfall and drier soil have only an indirect effect. In short, climate change is a symptom of this global crisis of inequality and injustice, not its cause.Weather-related disasters are largely a matter of unfairness and injustice, not misfortune or fate. This applies at a local level, for example when patriarchal structures insist that pregnant women living in traditional societies have to work outdoors in extreme heat because working in the fields for personal consumption is “women’s work”. Or when financial aid is paid to the male head of the family and never reaches those responsible for putting food on the table.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBut injustice is also apparent on a global scale. Climate science is a field dominated by white men, most with backgrounds in the natural sciences, who mainly conduct and lead studies focused on the physical aspects of the climate while disregarding numerous other issues. This is why far too few studies deal with the global interactions between social and physical changes in an evolving climate.It’s no wonder that we lack credible research findings that could inform us about the issues of loss and damage in global climate policy on a scientific basis. This makes it even more difficult to show how centuries of colonial practices by the global north against the countries of the global south continue to influence the way we live, think and act.It’s hardly news that climate change is mainly a problem because it damages people’s dignity and fundamental human rights. In fact, it’s the whole reason we talk about it on an international level.The United Nations climate change conferences have never been about polar bears or the downfall of the human race. They have always been about human lives and countless livelihoods – and, of course, about economic issues. This is demonstrated by the debate on the target of limiting heating to 2C above preindustrial levels.While this includes economic cost-benefit considerations, it is above all a political goal that doesn’t take science into account at all: not a single scientific assessment has ever defended or recommended a specific target – and with good reason, because setting such targets is ultimately an ethical issue. It can be expressed as a simple political question: how many more human lives, how many more coral reefs, how many more insects will we allow ourselves to lose to the short-term continued use of comparatively cheap fossil fuels in the global north?Heatwaves in North America and west Africa, droughts in South Africa and Madagascar, forest fires in Australia and Brazil, floods in Germany and Pakistan: these fundamentally different events hit societies that are battling very different problems, and they all demonstrate the role of climate change in different ways.View image in fullscreenA swimming pool surrounded by flood waters in Essen, western Germany on 26 December 2023.Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty ImagesBut it always proves true that the people who die are those with little money who can’t readily obtain all the help and information they need. And that doesn’t have to be the case, no matter where they are.In my opinion, the fact this keeps on happening is due to one particular, and persistent, social narrative. The basic premise is that burning fossil fuels is essential to maintaining what we call prosperity, and that “freedom” isn’t possible if we’re imposing a speed limit.If we compared modern society with the society of 300 years ago, we would unquestioningly attribute many of the achievements of recent centuries – like access to clean drinking water – to the burning of fossil energies. Historically, we associate coal, oil, and gas with democracy and western values, identifying a causal link between charcoal briquettes and the welfare state: the one affects the other. But even when this is actually true, we always forget to point out that the reverse conclusion – one perishes, and the other goes with it – is as fatal as it is false.The global north and global south both continue to argue that, for reasons of fairness, the countries in the global south must initially have very high greenhouse gas emissions too, to ensure the growth of their economies. This completely ignores the fact that in the global north (as well as elsewhere), the poor pay for the lifestyles of a small number of wealthy people, be it the workers who toil in the mines for metals or the city dwellers subjected to greater air pollution due to the use of private vehicles. Who says that what happens in the global north is naturally better and must be imposed on the world?Climate change would still have existed if Europe hadn’t conquered any colonies but humans had still burned fossil energy sources – but things would have looked very different without the west’s ongoing colonial mindset. In essence, colonial-fossil climate change is therefore not a climate crisis but a crisis ofjustice.Climate change is a problem that has less to do with a collapsing climate or other physical conditions than we might think, and the consequences of this are wider-reaching than we have been willing to admit. It clearly shows us that the main way in which we currently research and fight climate change – as a physics problem – falls far too short. Obviously, we need to transform the way in which we obtain energy. Above all, however, we need to transform participation in social life and the application of political and economic power – who makes decisions and how.This is an edited extract from Climate Injustice by Friederike Otto, which will be published by Greystone Books on 24 April (£22)Explore more on these topicsClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

The space for these projects is limited, particularly inNew York City, and they’re often expensive.Though an approach of smaller battery storage andsolarprojectscould inch the state closerto its ambitious renewable energy goals, it must be complemented by utility-scalerenewable energygeneration.That’s where Empire Wind 1, the first project in amassive buildout of offshore wind off the coast of Long Island, came in. The project, which was granted a lease from the federal government in 2017, promised to create more than 1,500 jobs and ultimately power 500,000 homes by building 54 wind turbines.On Wednesday, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum,instructed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Managementto halt all construction on the project “until further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis”.Trump signs orders to allow coal-fired power plants to remain openRead moreSince taking office in January,Donald Trumphas expressed strong opposition to offshore wind energy, saying he would not support“big, ugly windmills”that threaten wildlife. In February, his administrationfiredNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees who were monitoring the impacts of offshore wind projects on marine wildlife.On his first day in office, the presidentsigned an executive orderthat withdrew all parts of the outer continental shelf from new or renewed offshore leasing activity and suspended the approval process for all new onshore and offshore wind projects. The executive order alsodirected a reviewof all existing offshore leases, with termination possible.A spokesperson for Equinor, the Norwegian energy company behind Empire Wind 1, said construction will halt on the project. Empire Offshore Wind LLC, the limited liability company in charge of the project, is “engaging with relevant authorities to clarify this matter and is considering its legal remedies, including appealing the order”, the spokesperson said in email.The Trump administration’s stop-work order could have important ramifications for New York state’s climate goals and the growth of green job opportunities in the downstate region. About 44% of New York City’s census tracts are home to low-income communities who have experienced a disproportionate amount of negative impacts from pollution.When climate targets are delayed, or entry-level job opportunities do not materialize, these communities are often the first to suffer.The Empire Wind 1 project promised to bring green union jobs to the downstate region. Equinor is working to redevelop the marine terminal, which willhouse the project’s long-term operations and maintenance base, in conjunction with the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the terminal operator Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.This is especially beneficial for the New York City neighborhood of Sunset Park, an environmentally overburdened community located near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, whichfought to be included in the plans.“Our community has fought for years to ensure that Sunset Park would be part of solutions to reduce carbon emissions, build healthier and green energy, and provide new local union jobs,” said a statement from the office of council member Alexa Avilés, who represents the city district that encompasses Sunset Park.These projects are slated to include at least 1,000 construction jobs, 130 apprentices, 200 assembly jobs at the marine terminal and 50 permanent, long-term jobs to keep the Empire Wind project up and running, according to the mayor’s office.The city has viewed green jobs as a pathway for low-income New Yorkers, or those without a college degree, toincrease their earning potential. But as green job growthhas slowed, big projects such as Empire Wind 1 have become even more important.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Trump administration’s stop-work order is also likely to sow uncertainty well beyond the downstate regions of New York.“If we now have a situation where every change in administration could mean the revoking of permits and stop-work orders, I think it breaks the certainty that we have moving forward,” said Rob Freudenberg, the vice-president of energy and environment programs at the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that looks at how to improve the quality of life in the tristate area. “That should reverberate beyond the offshore wind industry itself.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkWind powerTrump administrationRenewable energyEnergyClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are confident that the disgust at Donald Trump is just as strong across the country.”View image in fullscreenAnti-racism campaigners at a Together Against Trump march to Parliament Square during he US president’s state visit in 2019Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/ShutterstockProtesters plan to dust off a blimp of Trump dressed in a nappy that was the focal point of previous anti-Trump protests, but also replace it with a larger version.Gardner said: “The blimp will be there or something even bigger and better. The blimp itself still exists, but we are thinking we want to take the next step and do something even more exciting.”The coalition is hoping theLondonmayor will again grant permission for anti-Trump blimps to fly over the capital.Gardner said: “Last time Sadiq Khan gave us permission to fly it. He will probably do so again, but we will have to get various permission from the GLA and the police. It might be different from last time but we are confident that a lot of people will want to come out on to the streets and show their disgust.”The demonstrations will be a test for the police even with tougher laws available tocrack down on protests and activism.Gardner said: “We want it to be a defiant but joyful celebration of all the things that Trump hates, such as the rights of LGBTQ people, the rights of women, the rights of migrants and refugees, union power and workers’ rights. It will celebrate every marginalised group in society.”The demonstrators will also target the tech and business leaders that have backed Trump. Gardner said: “If we had one strapline it would be‘Stop Trump and fight the oligarchy’. We are against empowering the super-rich, including treating Gaza like real estate and chumming up to Putin and the tech billionaires who are looking to the UK for tax breaks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gardner predicted that the protesters will vent their anger at Starmer as well as Trump.Gardner said: “Starmer should be shamed by these demonstrations. The whole country has been embarrassed by his display of rolling over like a pathetic poodle to whatever Trump does.

Her brother, Thaeb Suliman, 23, was hospitalised in Ponticelli with severe injuries.The hospital said on Friday morning that he remained “stable in the seriousness” of his injuries and would undergo further tests.The fourth person who died was the cable car operator, named locally as Carmine Parlato.The cable car service operated two cabins. The one that crashed had been travelling up the mountain, while 16 people were helped out of the cabin that had been making its way down and stopped in mid-air close to the foot of the peak.They were evacuated one by one, using harnesses, footage on RAI public television and other media showed.Locator mapItalian media reported that one of the cables supporting the cabin had snapped. The cable car service, which had opened for the spring and summer season 10 days previously, underwent a maintenance check a week ago, according to reports on Friday.“The cabin at the top has crashed,” Umberto De Gregorio, the chair of EAV, the public transport company that runs the cable car service, wrote on Facebook, calling it “a tragedy”.Vincenzo De Luca, the head of the Campania region around Naples, told RAI that rescue operations were hampered by fog and strong winds, which on Thursday had reached 60mph (100km/h).People heard a loud bang before the cable car fell, according to reports.“There was a truly severe weather situation, therefore I can imagine what could have happened at 1,500 metres above sea level,” De Luca said. “But, I repeat, technical checks must be done with the utmost rigour.”The last deadly cable car crash in Italy was in 2021, when 14 people were killed when a cable car linking the resort town of Stresa and the Mottarone mountain in the Piedmont region plummeted into the woods near Lake Maggiore.Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, was informed of Thursday’s crash during a summit in Washington with the US president, Donald Trump. She expressed her “deepest condolences” to the families of those killed and injured.The Faito cable car service was launched in 1952.

Other Green party politicians have been accused of showing hypocrisy by calling for more clean energy whileopposing solar farmsand electricity pylons in their local areas.Duddridge told the Guardian: “I am trying not to think about having to move away from the house. I love the neighbours and my four children are settled. But the reality is, once a section 21 notice has been served, there is not much I can do about it.”ALabourspokesperson said: “This is yet more rank hypocrisy from the Green party. Threatening to evict a tenant via no-fault eviction while standing on a platform to abolish section 21 simply beggars belief. Time and again they pledge one thing and do another.”A Green party spokesperson said: “We understand that Mr Pedley served the section 21 eviction notice almost a year ago. The order was served because his personal circumstances meant he required the premises for his own use.”Section 21 notices allow landlords to take back control of their properties with two months’ notice without the tenant being at fault. Labour is planning to abolish such evictions as part of itsrenters’ rights bill, which has passed the Commons and is due to be debated in the Lords.The Greens have also backed an end to no-fault evictions. In itsfair deal for renters, the party argues that ending the practice will mean tenants “don’t have their lives turned upside down on the whim of their landlords”.Carla Denyer, a co-leader of the Greens,previously tweeted: “The immediate ban on section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions is very welcome and will help protect over 10 million renters from risk of eviction.”Duddridge said Pedley had first tried to evict her and her family in 2016, but had rescinded the notice three weeks later.Last March, he issued a new section 21 notice, giving her two months to vacate the house. Duddridge has not yet moved, prompting a legal letter last August warning her to leave after 12 October.Duddridge says she plans to remain in the property until bailiffs attend as she has been advised that doing so will make her more likely to qualify for council housing.“Running in this election has been my sanctuary from the stress of the potential move,” she said. “So I couldn’t believe it when I saw my landlord had also entered the race.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Green partyNorthamptonshireLabourLocal governmentEnglandRenting propertynewsShareReuse this content"

They came into force just over a week later on 10 March.The move reportedly came after drones flying over the estate sparked a security scare on the weekend of Zelenskyy’s arrival. The Sunreportedthat one drone was traced to a man sitting in a car nearby and another to a photographer. Other drones reportedly remain unaccounted for.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, signed off on the order that restricts aircraft from flying below 2,000ft (600 metres) at Sandringham “for reasons of public safety” and to ensure the security of “royal family and other dignitaries staying at or visiting Sandringham House”.The order states: “These regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Sandringham House, Norfolk.“In view of the need for security for members of the royal family and other dignitaries staying at or visiting Sandringham House and at the request of the security services, it has been agreed by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of that location for reasons of public safety and security.”Royal flights, visitors’ aircraft and police and emergency services are exempted from the order.Zelenskyy arrived at Sandringham House by helicopter from London last month, shortly after he attended Keir Starmer’s summit for European leaders.His meeting with the king, which began at about 5.30pm, lasted just under an hour. Sources indicated the president was warmly received. There were reports that the UK government agreed to the meeting after a request from the Ukrainian president.The two heads of state had first met in 2023 at Buckingham Palace. Last year, on the second anniversary of Russia’s full invasion, the king issued a strongly worded message of support for Ukraine, speaking of the “indescribable aggression” faced by Ukrainians and hailing the “determination and strength of the Ukrainian people”.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIVolodymyr ZelenskyyMonarchyEnglandNorfolknewsShareReuse this content"

Some, including older and disabled people, said they were forced to live in saturated rooms with black mould while waiting for the leak to be resolved.Anna Petrova*, 76, said she had to use the showers at a leisure centre, a 20-minute walk away, and was unable to clean her flat, which had become infested with mould.“Thames Water has been delivering bottled water daily, but residents had to carry it up flights of stairs from the entrance hall, and it was not enough to wash up or flush the toilet,” she said. “Friends let me use their toilet, but one of my neighbours is 93 with advanced dementia and another is blind and disabled and not in a position to cope with this. I was on the phone daily to L&Q, who were unable to tell me how long we would have to live like this.”L&Q has raised my flat’s service charge by 41%. I can’t afford itRead moreResidents say they received no written notification that they would lose their water supply. An L&Q contractor had knocked on front doors before turning it off, but those not at home only discovered the fact when their taps ran dry.L&Q, which houses about 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes, mainly in London and south-east and north-westEngland, admitted to having failed to provide adequate updates and advice and had been slow to restore the supply. In a letter to residents, it acknowledged that the bottled water provided was insufficient for their needs, and that it should have advised people on how more could have been requested.The supply was restored last week but residents, including Petrova, said they were still dealing with mould and penetrating damp following the leak.“It took L&Q three weeks to admit responsibility for the leak in a communal supply pipe at the top of the building,” she said. “It then took a further six weeks to fix it, by which time water had spread from my bathroom to my kitchen, and the electricity supply had to be isolated because the light fittings were flooded. I couldn’t leave my home because I had to keep emptying buckets of water when they filled up, and the rooms are now so saturated. I’m scared the floors and ceilings will collapse.”L&Q has offered residents £420 compensation for the disruption to the water supply and promised to repair the damage to the flats of social tenants, but leaseholders, including Petrova, have been told to claim on their insurance.In 2023, L&Q wasordered to pay £142,000to residents after an investigation by the housing ombudsman identified a “prolonged period of decline” in its service. Among its criticisms were delays in carrying out repairs, and failures to heed the needs of vulnerable residents. Previously, an independent reviewcommissioned after an investigation by the Guardianhighlighted failures to address urgent repairs.L&Q told the Guardian that it had begun an urgent review into its responseto the problem, and that it had contacted residents to offer extra support.“We’re very sorry that residents at Etfield Grove experienced so much disruption and distress because of the leaks and subsequent loss of water,” said David Lewis, the company’s group director of property services.He added: “We recognise we should have done more to reach out and support them during such a difficult time.”* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsSocial housingLondonHousingEnglandRenting propertyPropertyConsumer rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was taken to hospital in Grenoble with cardiorespiratory failure but died in the evening.The incident took place as France’s Savoie and Haute Savoie departments and other Alpine regions were put under the highest alert for avalanches as heavy snow, rain and flooding caused chaos across the region.“Two municipal police officers and a patrol of three gendarmes on foot, alerted by a witness, arrived at the scene as quickly as possible and managed to extract the victim, who was in cardiorespiratory arrest at the time,” the local police prefecture said.The man was standing “at the side of the road … and was buried and swept some 15 metres below”, it said.At least four people have been reported dead as a result of extreme weather in France, Italy andSwitzerlandthat has cut off winter resorts, ​disrupted transport and left homes without electricity.View image in fullscreenCouncil workers clear snow in the Swiss canton of Valais.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAEaster skiers were advised on Friday to stick to designated runs and avoid going off piste.

The area had missed out on the clear-up operations.“We do take pride in our little road, we try to keep it as clean as possible. The way it is now, do you invite anybody down here? I don’t want anybody to come and see me. Not with a place like this. It’s embarrassing,” she said. “I’ve been everywhere, just to see if anybody’s been collected around this area and nobody hasbeen collected so I don’t know why we have been targeted for non-collection.”View image in fullscreenStudents said a lack of wheelie bins made the situation worse.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianStudents living near Edgbaston reservoir said a lack of wheelie bins made the situation worse, despite having had a recent bin collection. Some of those who do have access to wheelie bins have added padlocks in the hope of deterring neighbours from using their bins.Daniel Struczynski, a chef and culinary arts management student, said: “It’s awful because at the end of the day when we want to put rubbish out we have to put it on the streets and within like 12 hours the bags are all opened, the rubbish is all over the floor.”He added that it made it a prime target for rodents. “You see rats throughout the night going through them and then crows throughout the day and sometimes even foxes walking around the road.”Duha Aljuhani, 29, an international student living in student accommodation, said she felt the situation was dire due to not knowing when the bins in the communal waste areas at her accommodation would get collected. “It’s been really challenging especially with getting rid of the rubbish, and with the timings and it keeps getting worse and worse,” she said.Meanwhile in the affluent, leafy parts of Edgbaston, Jamie Cotton, 33, an estate agent who was waiting to do a house viewing, said he had noticed the difference over the past month. The area was largely unaffected compared with others, he said. “Edgbaston notably hasn’t been hit as hard as some other areas shall we say. Went through Selly Oak yesterday, the student territory, and it was noticeably grim.”View image in fullscreenGloria Charles, 70, who has lived in her home for over 30 years, felt the uncollected rubbish was a source of embarrassment.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianStephanie Ward, 77, who is retired, said the situation had been manageable as she had been able to move rubbish into her family’s rubbish collection in Sandwell and had a bin collection recently.“We probably haven’t by any means had such a bad time as a lot of people in the city and we also have wheelie bins, which not everybody does, which I think makes quite a big difference. The service has always been quite good actually, believe it or not in the past as well.”In addition, Radhakrishna Pillai, 64, a retired professor who lives in Edgbaston, said the area seemed well-looked after. “Fortunately for us since we have an estate agent that looks at the estate, they were good enough to come and remove the garbage after it started accumulating,” he said.Rachel Adams, a senior research fellow at the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham, pointed to a range of factors that have potentially influenced these differences, including proximity to alternative disposal sites, access to transportation, and population density.Norman Yousaf, the director of a waste disposal company, Monster Clearance, said he had experienced an influx of work, but that the upcoming bank holiday weekend would cause delays.He said the differences in the buildup of rubbish across the city were more evident in more deprived areas, and that costs were a big factor.View image in fullscreenUncollected rubbish made the streets a prime target for rodents, one local person said.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“They call in, they say £30 for a bin, I’ve got three bins here for goodness sake, that’s 90 quid, plus I’ve got 10 bin bags, that’s another 30 quid, so that’s what, £120? I can’t afford that … but in the affluent areas, people are just accepting the quote, [they] just want it gone.”He added: “I think the financial hit is wholly unfair to the end user because they’ve paid the council tax for the municipal waste to be collected. And it’s financially very unfair to all customers who have paid for a service they haven’t rendered.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionEnglandInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

One careless moment can cause a significant wildfire and have devastating consequences.“As people head outdoors this Easter, we urge everyone to help prevent wildfires by not using disposable barbecues, not dropping cigarettes or glass bottles that could ignite dry vegetation, and by respecting nature.”Tom Hind, at the Peak District National Park Authority, said the risk of wildfires this weekend was “extremely high” despite the recent rain.Charities said weeks of wildfires had “decimated” whole ecosystems and put endangered species at risk. Vast areas of habitat for small mammals and birds – including butterflies, beetles and falcons – had been damaged, they said, adding that some peat bogs could take hundreds of years to recover.In the Peak District, rangers said on Fridaythat “one careless day out can mean years repairing the damage” done to the environment by a stray spark.Park bosses in the Cairngorms, in the Highlands, plan to make it a criminal offence to light or maintain a fire between 1 April and 30 September. The bylaw will come into effect next year, if approved by the Scottish government.Steve Tatlock, a team leader at theLake DistrictNational Park Authority, said: “Wildfires have the potential to devastate the Lake District landscape, kill animals and ruin habitats. Easter is always a busy period for the region and the majority of people who enjoy the Lake District treat it respectfully. We want everyone to appreciate their time in the national park but also to be aware of the potential fire risk.“Despite a little rain this week, the recent long spell of warm dry weather has still left vegetation particularly dry and campfires, discarded cigarettes and smouldering barbecues all risk starting a wildfire with devastating consequences.”Explore more on these topicsNational parksWildfiresClimate crisisWildlifeMammalsBirdsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

They hope this would include a veterinary agreement and would harmonise food safety rules or recognise them as equivalent.In a letter to Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner for trade and economic security, the 13 companies said “unnecessary red tape” since Brexit had added £2bn to costs. Signatories of the letter, seen by the Guardian, include Morrisons, Lidl, Ocado, the sandwich makers Greencore and Samworth Brothers, as well as the meat processors Cranswick and 2 Sisters.The letter, sent this week and first reported by the Financial Times, said the rules on moving food and drink had “made it harder to supply the widest range of products at the best possible price to domestic and international markets”.The businesses, which offered “hands-on efforts to overcome practical obstacles”, added: “At a time when trading relationships around the world are being challenged, now feels like an opportune moment to solidify our economic partnership.”Food groups’ lobbying efforts come amid wider efforts to reset the UK’s relationship with the EU, while simultaneously trying to strike a trade deal with the US and swerve the worst of Donald Trump’s tariffs.The Labour government made a manifesto commitment to securing a veterinary agreement with the EU that would remove or reduce red tape at the border, such as export health certificates. The paperwork not only demands the employment of specialist teams but can hold up shipments while waiting for the correct documentation.The requirement to label products being shipped to Northern Ireland as “not for EU”, under the Windsor framework deal to ease trade across the Irish Sea, has also added significantly to costs and complications for retailers operating there and their suppliers.The system can also lead to sudden unintended disruption. A recent reclassification of custard as dairy product, rather than a composite, led to it disappearing from shelves for a period in some Irish and Northern Irish stores while the correct licences and checks were put in place.The UK government is reportedly nowmore opento considering some regulatory alignment with EU on fresh meat and dairy standards to ease trade, although this could affect a potential trade deal with the US.According to research published last month by the Food & Drink Federation, the amount of food exported to the EUslumped by 34% last yearcompared with 2019, before Britain left the bloc. Food and drink imports from the EU, which are subject to fewer checks after multiple delays by the UK government because of fears of stoking inflation, increased 3.3% last year compared with 2023.Checks are important to stop the spread of disease, with the government last week banning the import of meat and dairy products to prevent foot-and-mouth spreading to the UK after a rise of cases acrossEurope.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryBrexitEuropeSupermarketsEuropean UnionInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, Jonathan Brearley urged companies to hold “an honest conversation” about the plans.mapThe proposals have been divisive in the industry, with those in favour of the change – including OctopusEnergy, the UK’s biggest home energy supplier – arguing a series of zonal markets could create a more efficient energy system with less waste and lower bills.Those opposed – which include some of the biggest renewable energy developers – fear that a radical upending of the market risks undermining green energy investment at a crucial juncture for the government’s clean energy investment ambitions, which could ultimately wipe out potential savings on bills.Energy companies are planning tospend more than £70bn by the end of the decade to rewire Britainas part of the shift to clean energy, and as more households switch to electric cars and heat pumps.“This has been the most bruising debate to play out in the energy industry in the last 15 years,” an industry sourcetold the Guardian late last year. “I’ve fallen out with people; there have been some very nasty arguments.”Brearley told an industry conference: “I recognise there are a lot of divided views about the way forward. There are clear benefits of a zonal system, but equally there are risks that any change undermines investment and drives up costs.”“We need to balance system efficiency, with the lowest cost of investment, and the needs of the customers we serve.”The call for calm came after Brearley raised eyebrows in the industry earlier this year by coming out in favour of zonal energy pricing. He later said his views were personal, rather than that of the organisation.“I have my preference, but thankfully this decision that will be made by the secretary of state,” Brearley said. “And, ultimately, when the secretary of state decides, let’s get behind that and deliver for customers.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsEnergyHousehold billsOfgemnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the International Organisation for Migration, between 11 January and 20 March this year there have been10 deathsin the Channel.AKentpolice spokesperson said: “Kent police was called at 8.26am on Friday 18 April 2025 after a Border Force patrol responded to a medical emergency on a small boat in the English Channel.“A man has since been pronounced deceased. Officers have launched an investigation to establish the circumstances leading to the man’s death.“The priority remains to establish the man’s identity in order to notify his family. Officers are currently at Dover Lifeboat Station while initial inquiries are under way.”A UK government spokesperson said: “This morning, Border Force responded to a medical emergency onboard a small boat entering UK waters. It is with regret that we can confirm one individual has died, and our thoughts are with them and their loved ones.“Investigations are ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time, but we want to thank those who responded to this incident and who continue to work tirelessly to secure our borders and protect lives at sea.”The head of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said: “We are devastated to hear about the death on the Channel today. No one should lose their life when they are simply trying to seek safety from the horrors that see them clamber on a flimsy vessel on the Channel.“With deadly Channel crossings rapidly rising, this serves as a stark reminder that the government needs to reassess its approach.“Smuggling gangs are profiting from men, women and children who are forced into life-threatening conditions because they are in desperate search of safety. Enforcement measures alone are not enough to address this.”In relation to the discovery of a man’s body in the Channel on Thursday, a police spokesperson said: “Kent police was called at 7.40am on Thursday 17 April 2025, after a body of a man was located by a Border Force patrol in the English Channel, around two miles out from Dover. Police inquiries are ongoing to establish the man’s nationality and identity.”As of Thursday, a record 9,099 people have crossed the Channel so far this year. Figures for the first four months of 2022 were 6,691 people, and for the same period in 2023, 5,946 people, and for the first four months of 2024, 7,567 people.The highest number crossing in a single day so far this year was 705 people in 12 boats on 14 April.The government has pledged to “smash” the people-smuggling gangs and has announceda new initiativeto do so.British and French government officials arein talksabout a “migrant swap” pilot scheme in which some migrants who cross the Channel in small boats will be returned to France. In return, the UK will take others who are eligible for refugee family reunion.Announcing this plan, a Home Office spokesperson said: “We have already secured agreement from the French to deploy a new elite unit of officers at the coast, launch a specialist intelligence unit, increase police numbers and introduce new powers for the French authorities to intervene in shallow waters.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationFranceKentEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday, after returning to Washington, Van Hollen said Ábrego García told the senator that he had been moved from Cecot – where he was sharing a cell with 25 other prisoners – to a detention center with better conditions.Van Holler said he traveled toEl Salvadorfor more than just Ábrego García. “It’s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States,” said Van Hollen, as Vasquez Sura stood nearby.Ábrego García in March was arrested by immigration agents inMaryland, where he was living and working.Despite being undocumented, Ábrego García had been afforded a federal protection order against deportation to his native El Salvador, which the Trump administration ignored when it flew him and more than 200Venezuelan deporteesto El Salvador without warning or a court hearing, in a move that hasfallen foulof judges in the USright up tothe supreme court.Denied, detained, deported: the people ensnared in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreVan Hollen posted a picture of himself with Ábrego García in what appeared to be a cafeteria-style setting in the hospital wing of the prison. The previous day he was failed to be given access to the prison or his constituent after flying to El Salvador pledging to try to bring him back.Vasquez described her spouse as “a very loving husband, an amazing father”. They were just parents “trying to live the American dream,” she said.The Trump administration claims Ábrego García is a member of the Salvadorian violent gang network MS-13. But his family andthe headof the sheetmetal workers union that represents the trade in which he is an apprentice, have said he is not connected to a gang. He has not been charged with any crimes in the US or El Salvador.

He also read from a domestic violence protective order Vasquez filed against him in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, describing him as violent and hitting and scratching her. Such a record is normally confidential unless the alleged victim chooses to release it, but the US president read excerpts to reporters.Havingpreviously saidit was a bad period in their marriage that they worked through, with counseling, and forged a stronger partnership, Vasquez in the ABC interview declined to discuss the protective order further. “I’m happy he’s alive, and that’s all I can say,” she said.Meanwhile, Vasquez said on Friday that Garcia had been picked up by federal agents as he was pulled over while driving in Maryland. “What we thought was a regular traffic stop, turned out not to be a regular traffic stop,” she said, and reiterated denials that Garcia was a member of MS-13 or any other gang.“He’s not,” she added.Hours later on Friday, the White House made a sensational post on X, mocking the New York Times and Van Hollen and saying that Ábrego García is “never coming back”.Inscathingcourt order, a US court of appeals for the fourth circuit on Thursday denied the administration’s effort to appeal an earlier order from a federal judge in Maryland requiring the government to facilitate Ábrego García’s return, and the judge issued a stark warning about US constitutional democracy, as Donald Trump continues to defy courts’ orders on numerous fronts.The court said the administration’s claim that it can’t do anything to free the father from the prison and return him “should be shocking” to the public.The blistering order further ratcheted up the escalating conflict between the US government’s co-equal executive and judicial branches.Judge James Wilkinson said: “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.”“Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” he added.The panel emphasized that Ábrego García is entitled to due process. “If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,” the panel said.Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’Read more“The judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions,” the judges said.Lawyers for migrants in Texas on Friday told a judge that they believed the Trump administration were about to deport their clients under the Alien Enemies Act. An attorney for Trump’s justice department said no deportation flights were planned – though the homeland security department said it reserved the right to remove people Saturday, CNNreported.Meanwhile, federal judge Brian Murphy on Friday barred the Trump administration from implementing a new policy allowing it to rapidly deport hundreds if not thousands of migrants to countries other than their own without giving them a chance to show they fear being persecuted, tortured or killed there.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsMarylandAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Several passengers, including women and children, died after jumping into the water without being able to swim.Dozens were saved but many of the survivors were left badly burnt. The search for the missing included rescue teams supported by the Red Cross and provincial authorities.The motorised wooden boat caught fire near the town of Mbandaka, Loyoko said. The boat, HB Kongolo, had left the port of Matankumu for the Bolomba territory.“The death toll among the 500 passengers on board was extremely high,” said senator Jean-Paul Boketsu Bofili on Friday. “As we speak, more than 150 survivors suffering from third-degree burns are without humanitarian assistance.”Deadly boat accidents are common in the central African country, where late-night travels and overcrowded vessels are often blamed. Authorities have struggled to enforce maritime regulations.Congo’s rivers are a main means of transport for its more than 100 million people, especially in remote areas with little infrastructure. Hundreds have been killed in boat accidents in recent years as more people abandon the few available roads for wooden vessels packed with passengers and their goods.“Our magnificent Congo River and the lakes our country abounds in have become huge cemeteries for the Congolese people. This is unacceptable,” said Bofili.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Over the years, the image was adapted in various ways.In 1901, Virginia officials ordered that the depiction of the bared breast be included to show clearly that the figure of Virtus was female.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theban, which began in August 2023, is a result of a standoff between the tech giant and Ottawa over the Online News Act that forced intermediaries such as Meta and Google’s parent company Alphabet to compensate journalism outlets for sharing their content. Meta described the legislation, Bill C-18 – passed on 18 June – as “unworkable” and argued that the only way to comply with the law is to “end news availability for people in Canada”.Canada elections: who are the key players and what is at stake?Read moreBut media researchers found more than half of Canadians still say they get political news from Facebook, despite the platform’s ban on news articles from reputable outlets.“People using Facebook aren’t often thinking, ‘Am I reading the news?’ But they leave feeling more informed politically, either from comments from friends or family, about the election. They might see a post from a candidate or follow cultural news aggregating types of accounts,” said Aengus Bridgman, the executive director of the MEO.“But we know this is not the same quality of information they might have accessed before the ban. The richest, densest and most accurate and factchecked information is not making it through any more. Neither is information that might contradict the views they hold. All of that just has been cut really – like, off at the knees.”Bridgman says that most of the content the team uncovered – including more than 40 Facebook pages promoting fraudulent ads, with new pages being created and identified every day – were meant to be humorous or ironic, instead of convincing. None of the content the team found is expected to sway the electorate.But Canada’s Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (Site) is monitoring the election for disinformation and says it expects increased online political activity following the two closely-watched leaders debates. China, Russia and Iran remain the greatest threats to Canada’s election, according to the taskforce.Last week, Site officials said they had found an information operation linked to China on Chinese-language social media platform WeChat, the popular news account Youli-Youmian.“Foreign interference has been top of mind this election, with candidates bludgeoning each other on this issue. We monitor these platforms and our evaluation of that incident in particular doesn’t feel as though it had any material influence or consequence,” said Bridgman.“We don’t think one WeChat channel posting a couple times about Canadian politics articles consistent with their editorial line amounts to foreign interference.”Instead, researchers have focused their attention on a series of scams that appear to be a continuation of a trend replicated in other countries, in which ads showing “fake sensational political headlines” impersonate small business and personal accounts.View image in fullscreenA piece of fake political content on social media.Photograph: XBridgman cautioned that the broader risk of deepfakes comes when a population is uninformed. “If you’ve never heard about this person before, you cannot distinguish audio or video of them in compromising situations or making offensive remarks. And in the context of politics, we worry that with more unfamiliar candidates, the risk of convincing deep fakes escalates,” he said.Among posts examined by the team were seven deep fake videos falsely showing prime ministerMark Carneypromoting the fraudulent investment platforms featured directly in the ads. These deepfakes typically mimic broadcasts by the CBC or CTV, two of the top news outlets in Canada.In one of those, the headline reads “Mark Carney announces controversial retaliatory tariff plan in response to Trump’s devastating tariff hikes this week”. The article shows Carney meeting with a top CBC news anchor and includes a purported transcript of an interview, in which he promises to send money to Canadians if they register for what purports to be a newly formed government programme. The link, however, brings users to a cryptocurrency scam.In another, a page called Money Mindset, which uses the logo of the CBC/Radio-Canada, bought five French-language Facebook ads that were active from one to four hours between 4 and 9 April. One of the ads, featuring a deep fake video of Carney, cost US$300–$399 (about C$500) and received between five and six thousand impressions. In total, the five ads represent an investment of approximately C$1,000 and have received around 10,000 impressions.“These imposter ads, fake news articles, and deepfake videos can undermine the credibility of both the targeted party leaders featured in the content and the news brands and journalists whose names, logos, or visual designs are being impersonated,” the report said.A spokesperson forMetatold the Guardian it was “against our policies to run ads that try to scam or impersonate people or brands” adding the company encouraged people to report fraudulent content.“This is an ongoing industry-wide challenge – scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams.”‘We’re going to stand up to Trump,’ says Mark Carney in second Canadian election debateRead moreBut researchers say the response from tech companies “appears to have been inconsistent and insufficient for preventing these ads from spreading” – pointing to the proliferation of ads in recent days. The observatory also found that since many of these ads do not self-disclose as political, they often do not appear in the Meta’s ad library, which hampers the ability to assess the scope of the trend.“Imagine that on TV there’s an ad using clearly fraudulent content or is a deepfake. In what world would that be allowed? It would never get approved for use because of the advertising standards in this country,” said Bridgeman.“And yet, Facebook runs these ads that get hundreds of thousands of views across the country and it’s just a pure scam. In the midst of a federal election using an image of Carney and a fake CBC news website on a platform that bans the news – this feels like we’re kind of in like a Black Mirror kind of moment. And what worries me is that it feels like people are just okay with this.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyMetanewsShareReuse this content"

The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,” a man who said he worked at the port told al-Masirah.Ras Isa terminal has a storage capacity of 3m barrels and was the first port built for oil exports from Yemen, about 40 years ago.A Nasa satellite system that monitors fires picked up an intense blaze early on Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island.In a statement posted on social media, US Central Command said: “US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorise the entire region for over 10 years.“This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”The US has vowed to keep attacking Yemen’s Houthis, in its biggest military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January, unless the Houthis cease attacks on Red Sea shipping.Asked for comment on the Houthis’ casualty figure and its own estimate, US Central Command said it had none beyond the initial announcement of the attacks.Iran called the US strikes “barbaric”, while the Palestinian militants Hamas denounced them as “blatant aggression”.The latest US campaign was triggered by Houthi threats to resume attacks on international shipping in protest at Israel’s blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip.The Houthis have launched dozens of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were targeting ships linked to Israel in protest over the war in Gaza.Early on Friday, hours after the US attack, Israel’s military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.Recent expert analysis for the Atlantic Council was dubious about the practicality of US war aims in Yemen. “The United States’ ability to track [Abdel Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis’ leader] is likelyhindered by limited intelligenceon the ground in Yemen. This reality was echoed early last year when the US had difficulty assessing the success of its operations and the group’s full arsenal due to a lack of intelligence,” it said.“Without a reliable presence or informant network, targeting such a well-hidden leader will prove challenging.”The Trump administration’s clumsy handling of the enlarged US campaign against the Houthis was already mired in controversy before Friday’s large death toll, afterdetails of the initial attack planwere discussed by senior Trump officials on an unsecured chat service to which a journalist had been invited to join.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Nightclubs are shut, and cinemas are restricted in the type of films they can screen, although rules differ between the 16 federal states.Germany’s state criminal police have said they will be out in force at scene hotspots, including retail car parks, alpine tunnels (favoured as they amplify the sound of car motors) and iconic racing tracks such as the Nürburgring in the mountainous Eifel region in western Germany.Enthusiasts, who often gather from acrossEurope, also typically seek out long stretches of straight public roads for races that they illegally block, and sometimes the many sections of Germany’sautobahnwhere there is no speed limit.In statements to German media, the police said they would seek to clamp down on unauthorised tuning, illegal races and noise and emissions pollution, including that caused by so-called ‘burn-outs’, in which cars are held still with the handbrake on, the wheels spun so fast that the tyres smoke.Those in contravention of the law could face high fines, punitive points on their driving licences as well as the revocation of licences and confiscation of their vehicles, police said.Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the country’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia in western Germany, where 3,000 traffic violations were reported and about 4,000 fines issued last Good Friday, said targeted controls would aim to pull over vehicles considered unfit to be driven. This included cars rebuilt for lowriding, the Mexican-American subculture of cruising as close to the surface of the road as possible.“I have nothing against lowered cars, as long as they are roadworthy,” Reul said. “However, it is important that all road users arrive home safely.”The car-tuning scene began in the US in the 1990s, spurred on by cult films such as 2001’sThe Fast and the Furious and its many sequels, and is celebrated in everything from video games to toy lines.According to the publication Motor Trend, it has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, “becoming a cornerstone of today’s automotive passions”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday 7 April, an 11-year-old boy reported that a man attempted to film him in a restroom of a fast food restaurant, and on Wednesday 9 April, police officers received another report from the restaurant, that a man was “entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males at the business”.Officers arrested Seiders at the scene, and secured search warrants for his home, vehicle and phone: “Evidence was located implicating him in the two reported incidents, along with additional crimes, including possessing child pornography,” the statement reads. He was also charged with annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy.Seiders is being held in jail with bail set at $1m, and is due in court on 22 April.The New Pornographers responded with a statement reading: “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified, and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders – and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.”Fronted by AC Newman and the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Neko Case, the band are an enduring presence in North American indie, with a catalogue dating back to 2000 debut album Mass Romantic. One of their former members isDan Bejar, AKA Destroyer. Their biggest chart success came with 2014 album Brill Bruisers, which reached No 13 in the US charts, after which their long-time drummer Kurt Dahle left and was replaced by Seiders.As well as touring with the band, Seiders performed on their three most recent studio albums. He has also backed Case as well as artists including John Oates, Juliana Hatfield and Gary Jules, and previously played in the group Beat Club.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The images frequently depict men of colour, often armed with knives, attacking women or police officers.Antonio Nicita, a PD senator, said: “In the images published by Salvini’s party and generated by AI there are almost all categories of hate speech, from racism and xenophobia to Islamophobia.“They are using AI to target specific categories of people – immigrants, Arabs – who are portrayed as potential criminals, thieves and rapists.“These images are not only violent but also deceptive: by blurring the faces of the victims it is as if they want to protect the identity of the person attacked, misleading users into believing the photo is real. These are images that incite hatred.”“This is serious,” said Francesco Emilio Borrelli, an MP for the Greens and Left Alliance. “AI generates content based on our instructions, and in this case it was clearly instructed to generate images of black people robbing an elderly woman or a frightened woman. It is part of their strategy to create fear among citizens.”A spokesperson for Salvini’s party confirmed that “some of the pictures” featured on their social media channels had been “generated digitally”.In a statement it said: “The point is not the image. The point is the fact. Each post is based on true reports from Italian newspapers, with names, dates and places.“If reality seems too harsh, do not blame those who report it, but those who make it so. If it is about a crime, it is hard to accompany the news with cheerful or reassuring images.”View image in fullscreenA spokesperson for the League party, which is led by Matteo Salvini (pictured), said ‘some of the pictures’ had been ‘generated digitally’.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPASalvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, said the League pictures bore “all the hallmarks of artificial intelligence”.“They are out‑of‑context photos in which the subject is in the foreground and the rest is entirely blurred. What worries me is that these AI‑generated images are becoming ever more realistic.”The complaint to Agcom cites several examples of images thought to have been digitally generated, saying they have appeared alongside the branding of reputable mainstream media outlets which have reported on the crimes mentioned but not used images of the alleged perpetrators.In one case, the League’s post says: “A foreigner attacks the train conductor” and pairs the text with an image of a man of colour with his fist raised.Theoriginal headline in Il Resto del Carlinoreads: “He attacks the [female] train conductor and sparks panic on board.” The article makes no mention of the suspect’s nationality beyond calling him a “foreigner”. There was no photograph of the alleged attack.Another image featured in the complaint shows a mother and father in Islamic dress appearing to shout angrily at a girl, “thus feeding racial and Islamophobic prejudice”.Il Giorno, the newspaper that is cited, makes no reference in its report to the religion of either the family or the girl allegedly abused by her parents, beyond saying the child had attended Arabic language school. There was no photograph of the family.The use of AI‑generated images forpropaganda by far‑right parties is a growing phenomenonthat entered the mainstream around last year’s European elections, when images designed to stoke fears over immigration or demonise leaders such as Emmanuel Macron began circulating on social media.“Then came the American elections withDonald Trump and Elon Musk, who effectively normalised this trend,” said Romano.“Today we see that far‑right parties have not only continued to generate fake images for propaganda but have also increased their use at a time when AI tools have improved content quality, making the phenomenon all the more worrying.”Despite social platforms being obliged to take steps to anticipate these risks – for example by adding a label specifying that an image has been generated by AI – Romano says that, in practice, this mechanism is almost always ineffective.Asked if the League was aware that the images could generate hate speech, a spokesperson for Salvini’s party said: “We are sorry, but our solidarity goes to the victims, not the perpetrators.“If denouncing crimes committed by foreigners means ‘xenophobia’, perhaps the problem is not the word but those who use it to censor debate. We will continue to denounce, with strong words and images, what others prefer to ignore.’’If Agcom deems the flagged content offensive it can, under the EU’s Digital Services Act, order posts to be taken down, accounts to be removed and social media platforms to be fined for failing to police user behaviour.In 2023,Agcom fined Meta€5.85m (£5m) and ordered the removal of dozens of accounts for breaching the ban on gambling advertising.Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, was approached for comment. A spokesperson for X said: “We are not under any obligation legally to label every AI-generated image. It’s pretty clear these posts are straightforward politicking.“Rest assured, we believe that it is critical to maintain the authenticity of the conversation on X, and we make sure that we are well equipped to fight against any manipulated media – including the rising trend of ‘deepfakes’ – and put visible labels on any such content that has been debunked by a credible source.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ItalyThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Their value and importance are difficult to overestimate.”Ireland retained theBook of Kells, a masterpiece that is now displayed at Trinity College Dublin, but lost most of its ancient books to the Vikings and subsequent centuries of political turmoil, Seaver said. “That’s why today there are more Irish manuscripts in Britain and the continent than in Ireland.”The exhibition, which coincides with challenges to international trade and European unity, is a reminder of economic, cultural and political ties that threaded the Atlantic to the Alps from the fifth century.After much of Ireland converted to Christianity, its monasteries became centres of learning that produced and replicated academic and religious manuscripts, including the oldest surviving copy ofEtymologiae, an encyclopedia of the origin of words that has been called antiquity’s internet.View image in fullscreenA page fragment of the medieval encyclopedia Etymologiae.Photograph: National Museum of IrelandScribes who wrote a grammar book titled Priscian’s Institutiones Grammaticae recorded not only Latin language rules but, in the margins, scribbled comments about their daily lives. One admitted to being “ale-killed” – having a hangover. Some complained of the cold, others grumbled at their materials. “New parchment, bad ink. O I say nothing more.”Another expressed hope that a storm would deter any Viking raid. “Bitter is the wind tonight, it tosses the ocean’s white hair: I fear not the coursing of a clear sea by the fierce heroes from Lothlend.”Such comments showed the manuscripts were not just relics of scholarship, Seaver said. “They’re full of human voices, humour, frustration and resilience, offering us a rare and very real glimpse into the daily lives and personalities of early medieval Irish monks.”Taking manuscripts to the continent was a response to the Viking threat and also part of a system of cultural exchange, said the curator. “It was a two-way street. From an early stage, Ireland was receiving books and scholars from the continent and Anglo-Saxon England.”It is thought that ships that brought wine, oils, pottery and other wares from the continent took Irish monks in the other direction.View image in fullscreenAn early medieval brooch pin that will form part of the National Museum of Ireland exhibition.Photograph: Fran Veale/it_freelanceThe most famous, Saint Columba, also known as Columbanus, established monasteries in the seventh century in the Frankish and Lombard kingdoms. One of his reputed disciples, Saint Gall, founded a hermitage that became an abbey in what is now the Swiss city of St Gallen.The abbey library, now a Unesco world heritage site, has agreed to lend 17 manuscripts for the exhibition, which will run from 30 May to 24 October.The National Museum of Ireland will display the books with more than 100 artefacts from its own collection, including the Lough Kinale Book Shrine, which is the earliest and largest known container for a sacred text. Discovered broken at the bottom of a Longford lake, it makes its public debut in the exhibition after years of conservation.Explore more on these topicsIrelandExhibitionsEuropeHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

They’re made to look the way they want them to look. There’s no thought put into the human being. So what happens is that you just start sweating … So in that thing, you’d just be pouring water, because you have that cowl over it. Like, there’s one thing to wear the suit, but once you cover your head, I guess that’s where all your heat kind of escapes and you feel it.”Affleck said that even highly trained stunt performers found it difficult to wear the suit for long periods. “They could do that for about like 45, 50 minutes and then they’re like gonna get heatstroke. So you had to come out of it.”It doesn’t make you feel very heroic, because you’re instantly exhausted and sweatyHe added: “It just made it difficult to make the movie, because you’re so hot. It also does not make you feel very heroic, because you’re instantly exhausted and really sweaty.”Affleck played Batman in two features directed by Zack Snyder:Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justicein 2016 andJustice Leaguein 2017 (with the latter re-edited and released in 2021 asZack Snyder’s Justice League), as well as cameos inSuicide SquadandThe Flash. Affleck was originally attached to star in, direct and co-write subsequent standalone filmThe Batman, but wasultimately replaced in the role by Robert Pattinsonafter the disappointing commercial performance of Batman v Superman and Justice League.From mech-suit to Batnipples: the best and worst Batman suits of all timeRead moreAffleck’s Batsuit, designed by Oscar-nominated costume designer Michael Wilkinson andbuilt by Jose Fernandez and Ironhead Studio, was reportedly made from multiple layers of Lycra and foam, taking Affleck around 25 minutes to get into it, with up to six costume assistants helping. In 2015, Wilkinson described the cowl as “incredible engineering”, saying that previous Batsuits had not allowed actors to turn their heads, and that the costume as designed was “comfortable and very flexible” and allow Affleck to perform in “a very natural and forceful way”.Affleck’s Batsuit is not the first to attract criticism, with the“nipple suit” George Clooney worefor Batman & Robin in 1997 often cited as one of the reasons for the film’s poor performance.Explore more on these topicsFilmBen AffleckBatmanBatman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeJustice LeagueZack SnydernewsShareReuse this content"

Jack Black’s Minecraft song Steve’s Lava Chicken becomes shortest ever UK Top 40 hitAt 34 seconds, the spectacularly silly song from A Minecraft Movie beats the previous record by two secondsBen Beaumont-ThomasFri 18 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 15.13 EDTShareActor and musicianJack Blackhas made UK chart history, with the shortest ever song to reach the Top 40: his novelty track Steve’s Lava Chicken is just 34 seconds long.The spectacularly silly song reaches No 21 this week, and is taken fromA Minecraft Movie, the video game spin-off film, which has earned $570m (£430m) so far at the global box office – and caused cinemas to be overrun by the game’s young and high-energy fanbase.Black performs the song in the film as the character Steve, as he shows the other protagonists around the alternate universe, the Overworld, and hymns the virtues of chicken cooked in lava (“Crispy and juicy, now you’re havin’ a snack / Ooh, super spicy, it’s a lava attack”).It beats the previous record-holder by two seconds. The Ladies’ Bras was an equally silly song by UK duo Jonny Trunk & Wisbey, with a chorus of “the ladies’ bras, the ladies’ bras / the ladies’ knickers and the ladies’ bras” repeated multiple times over an easy listening backing. It amused radio DJs Scott Mills and Danny Baker – the former playing it multiple times an hour on his Radio 1 show at some points – and it became a cult hit, reaching No 27 in 2007.Steve’s Lava Chicken is Black’s highest UK chart position yet, beating both his track Pod with duo Tenacious D (No 24 in 2006) and another song from a video game-film tie-in: Peaches, his power ballad performed as nefarious pixellated reptile Bowser in 2023’s The Super Mario Bros Movie, which reached No 28.At 95 seconds, that was another of the shortest-charting songs in chart history, behind the likes of 2007 Simpsons Movie song Spider Pig (64 seconds) and Liam Lynch’s 2002 punk hit United States of Whatever (86 seconds).Black made a video message to mark the success of Steve’s Lava Chicken, saying: “I want to send big love to all theMinecraftfans for getting us up there – it’s insane! Love you!”Despite being met with bafflement or outright dismay by many film critics, A Minecraft Movie has become a pop cultural sensation.It beat The Super Mario Bros Movie in securing the highest global opening weekend for a video game spin-off (though still has a way to go beat that film’s $1.3bn (£980m) final score). By filling the film with references cherished by the game’s fans, from the figure of “chicken jockey” to a tribute to the late Minecraft personality Technoblade, it has been playing to joyous and uproarious crowds: sometimes too uproarious, with some cinemas posting warning messages about antisocial behaviour. One group of US patrons brought a live chicken to a screening – “safe to say we got kicked out” ran a caption on TikTok.Elsewhere in this week’s pop charts, US singer and online personality Alex Warren notches up the longest stretch for a No 1 single so far in 2025: his song Ordinary scores its fifth week at the top.Welsh rockers Those Damn Crows get their first UK No 1 album, with God Shaped Hole. It’s their fourth LP, following the No 3 success of 2023’s Inhale/Exhale. “We’ve been working so hard for so many years, this is a huge reward,” the band said in a statement. “We’re not going anywhere, man!”Bon Iver’s fifth studio album Sable, Fable is this week’s second-highest new entry, at No 4.Explore more on these topicsUK chartsJack BlackPop and rockA Minecraft MovieMinecraftGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

The eyes tend to be drawn to the grander wonders – the altars, the stained glass, the pillars and flowing arches. But once the marks carved into the stonework ofSalisbury Cathedralby centuries of pilgrims, churchgoers and mischief-makers are pointed out, they begin to pop out all over the place.A“graffiti tour”of the great Wiltshire church is being launched in May with guides pointing out what feel like whispered messages from the past.There are thousands of marks, from initials of people long-forgotten to images of animals and flowers and “protection marks” thought to keep evil at bay. There is also a piece of backwards writing that some think may be a curse.View image in fullscreenSalisbury Cathedral.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAA team of volunteers have spent a year finding and mapping the graffiti, and experts have tried to pin down some of the stories behind it, but the reality is that most of the tales they could tell remain elusive.“That’s quite nice,” said John Mangan, one of the guides. “We know so much about other parts of the cathedral, for example the stained glass windows – when they were made, who designed them and so on – but we can’t know everything about the graffiti.“People have lived in, worked in and known the cathedral through the centuries and left their marks. We can speculate in some instances and try to understand the lives of people back then but we can’t know everything.”Another guide, Caroline Burrows, described the fun of finding a new mark. “It’s exciting to spot things that may not have been seen for years. And then we can debate what they mean,” she said.The Guardian was given a preview of the tour, starting with a couple of footprints close to the west doors. About 600 years ago, two people, possibly pilgrims, placed their footwear on a hunk of limestone supporting a pillar and carved around their footprints, with the initials “JG” and “WS” next to them. A statement that they had made it, perhaps.View image in fullscreenFoot shapes and the initials JG and WS.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianIn the north porch, the name Webber can be seen. The deliberate, curvy style of writing has been dated to the 17th century and, having pored through its archive, the cathedral thinks it may have been created by a man called Nicholas Gilberd, who was having a row with the authorities over boundaries. At the bottom of a letter to the cathedral, he refers to himself as “alias Webber”.In the south quire aisle there is a collection of lines and dots, which may be music notation. It is possible that members of a medieval choir carved a long-lost tune here as they waited to sing.Close by is a piece of medieval Latin text, difficult to decipher but the cathedral thinks it may be a curse because some of it is written backwards. On the other hand, it could also be that this wasn’t a very good writer.There is a gaming board in the morning chapel and the guides like to imagine medieval priests sitting down to while away a few minutes in a quiet corner.View image in fullscreenA cat in the cloisters.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianBeasts featured include a salamander tucked on a pillar beneath the spire, and there is a cat in the cloisters. One of Mangan’s favourites is a bird and the creator has cleverly used a triangular natural break in the stone for its beak.The cathedral is not suggesting modern visitors follow suit. Katherine Pell, the cathedral curator, said: “In the past, attitudes seem to have been much more accepting. Marks are often found in very public areas, suggesting they were both accepted and acceptable.”View image in fullscreenMarks on a memorial to John Salcot.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianPell is fond of the initials and names remembering “ordinary” people. The top of a memorial to John Salcot, a bishop during Henry VIII’s reign, is thick with carved inscriptions, believed to have been carved by mourning relatives of people who may not have been commemorated elsewhere.“When we look around the cathedral and see memorials to the rich and famous, we rarely get a glimpse of the ordinary folk,” she said. “Well, this is where they are.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageWiltshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Insiders discuss how YouTube became the TV of tomorrowAmelia TaitFri 18 Apr 2025 08.01 EDTShareWhat’s the difference betweenYouTubeand TV? Two decades ago, that would have been a very easy question to answer. TV was the stuff that was on – you guessed it – television, with its budgets, scripts, multiple camera angles and lights. The first video ever uploaded to YouTube, meanwhile, could never have been mistaken for it. “All right, so here we are in front of the, uh, elephants,” a pixelated young man told the camera. “The cool thing about these guys is that … is that they have really, really, really long, um, trunks.” The video was uploaded on 23 April 2005 and marked the true launch of the video-sharing site.This February, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan declared: “YouTube is the new television.” He was referring to the fact that more and more people watch YouTube videos on the big screen: apparently, users play 1bn hours of YouTube on their smart TVs a day. But at the same time, more and more people are watching TV on YouTube: Disney uploaded the first three episodes of its Star Wars spin-offAndorto the site in March, while ITV has been sharing its shows on YouTube since December.Today, TV is on YouTube and YouTube is on TV – some YouTubers have even struck deals with streamers, creating their own shows for the box.Beast Games, a reality competition created by the world’s most-subscribed YouTuber, MrBeast, debuted on Prime Video last December and quickly became the platform’s most-watched unscripted series of all time, generating $100m in profit. So what’s the difference between YouTube and TV? Increasingly, less and less. How did we get here? And where are we going to end up?“I woke up to a cold email from an employee at Netflix, and then woke up to another cold email from another streaming platform, and then they kind of started trickling in,” says Victor Bengtsson, managing director of Sidemen Entertainment. The Sidemen are seven YouTubers who have accumulated 146 million subscribers with their skits, challenges and reaction videos over various channels. In 2024, they created their own reality competition on YouTube, Inside, earning more than 50m views – that year, the finale of Love Island All Stars attracted just 1.3 million viewers. No wonder, then, that Netflix acquired season two of Inside, which premiered on the platform in March.View image in fullscreenBro money … The Sidemen.Photograph: PRThis is far from the first collaboration between YouTubers and the mainstream media, even if it did take traditional broadcasters almost a decade to notice the appeal of online celebs. In 2015, the BBC invited beauty vlogger Zoella to take part in The Great Comic Relief Bake Off, while her brother Joe Sugg starred in Strictly Come Dancing three years later. Meanwhile, across the pond, YouTubers were offered their very own shows. In 2016, Netflix releasedHaters Back Off,a series created by online musical comedian Colleen Ballinger. NBC gave Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh a short-lived talkshow in 2019, though she herself joked about its unappealing 1.30am slot before it was cancelled two years later.The trouble with some of these shows is that you can’t just copy and paste a YouTuber and expect them to fit inside a different box; guerrilla content can lose its appeal when it’s moulded into telly’s pre-existing formats. But at a time of crisis in television – senior producers are nowtaking shelf-stacking jobsdue to lack of work – it seems broadcasters are more and more willing to yield to YouTubers’ ways. Bengtsson says the Sidemen feel “respected” by Netflix and is encouraged that “they’re not trying to change what we do. They’re not trying to change who we are.”Inside’s first season was shot over seven days, edited in nine, and debuted a day later. Working with Netflix for season two meant the team had a lot more breathing room and Bengtsson believes the final product was more polished, but still creatively free. “You put people from their platform in the same room as us and it’s like two worlds colliding, it’s two tsunami waves just crashing in,” he says.One issue that arose was the length of the content – the first episode of Inside season one was two hours long, while Netflix told Bengtsson its reality shows typically last 45 minutes. As a compromise, Inside season two has hour-long episodes. Netflix also agreed to drop new episodes daily – like Sidemen viewers were used to – instead of all at once. “This super-successful streaming platform and the Sidemen are merged into one, trying to get what the future of reality TV could look like.”View image in fullscreenA seat at the table … YouTuber turned NBC talkshow host Lilly Singh.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesBut are execs conceding too much to YouTube talent, who are often used to working with fewer constraints? Beast Games has been branded a “dystopian nightmare” – five of its contestants are suing MrBeast for allegedly “unsafe” conditions during filming. Even if you ignore the lawsuit, the show’s contents have proved troubling. The Guardian’s own Stuart Heritage wrote, “There is a cruel ruthlessness to Beast Games that is truly unpalatable … There is endless pleading and crying and full-blown adult tantrums.” Are broadcasters in a race to the bottom?MrBeast’s degrading game show is a dystopian nightmare – perfect for America in 2025Read more“We have a key rule here: it’s not art, it’s entertainment,” says Bengtsson. “Don’t disrespect the format of easy-to-engage content … There is incredible pride in being able to create something that is funny, clever and commercialised.” He adds that the money the Sidemen generate for streamers could “be redistributed to real artists who have real projects”. Of course, the terms “YouTuber” and “artist” are not mutually exclusive: comedian Bo Burnham got his start on YouTube and won three Emmys for his 2021 Covid-themed Netflix special.While broadcasters increasingly attract YouTubers, YouTube is also increasingly attracting broadcasters – the relationship seems to be more symbiotic than ever before. “There are a lot of platforms that can help you with awareness and reach, but I think YouTube is relatively uniquely positioned in being able to generate revenue,” says Neil Price, a UK partner manager at YouTube who helps traditional broadcasters understand how their content can work on the site. Like any other YouTuber, broadcasters can earn money from ads that are displayed around their content.Price says that in recent years, broadcasters have gone from posting small clips of their shows on YouTube to episodes wholesale, as well as creating new content for digital audiences. Between 2023 and 2024, Channel 4 tripled its YouTube views by uploading long-standing shows such as Hollyoaks to its “Channel 4.0” while also launching new online-only prank series and gameshows. “It’ll be interesting to see how production entities continue to evolve their thinking,” Price says. “I think the entire industry deserves real credit for what can feel uncomfortable … for being open to the possibility of exploring new things.”View image in fullscreenA safe bête … MrBeast AKA Jimmy Donaldson.Photograph: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockBut is YouTube having its cake and eating it – competing with broadcasters by hosting their content, not creating its own? Between 2016 and 2022, the site did try its hand at becoming a more traditional media company, launching YouTube Originals, a division that created new shows and films for paying subscribers. Entertainment executive Susanne Daniels was brought on to head the initiative – she previously helped develop shows such as Dawson’s Creek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.“Original content allows a company to have a voice,” Daniels says – she is especially proud of an Emmy-winning YouTube special she helped create, Recipe for Change: Standing Up to Antisemitism. But does YouTube want a voice? Ultimately, the company chose to be a platform rather than a publisher; CEO Mohan said the Originals division shut because YouTubers were already producing successful content, “so that eliminated the need for us to do anything.” Daniels left the company in 2022. “YouTube is run by engineers and product executives like Neil Mohan who are focused primarily on their distribution capabilities and have little appreciation for the power of premium content,” she says.In the US, more people now watch YouTube on their TVs than watch Disney+, Prime Video and Netflix. No wonder Netflix is rumoured to currently be in talks with YouTubers Dude Perfect and Mark Rober, and Disney is apparently searching for family-friendly creators. But Daniels believes that while “YouTube is definitely a competitor in terms of watch time and eyeballs”, it isn’t a competitor in quality. “Is YouTube the democratisation of content? Yes, arguably it is, in that everyone can make their own YouTube show, but everyone can’t make The Crown or The Sopranos.”Even before they had their own Netflix show, the Sidemen were being watched on TV: more than 45% of the group’s watch time comes from smart TVs. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of YouTube views on TV screens increased more than 130%. This means that while YouTubers may not be making The Sopranos, YouTube videos are becoming more televisual – with bigger budgets, longer watch times and greater production values to fit the big screen. A single MrBeast YouTube video can now cost £3m to make.Viewers would be forgiven for not being able to tell the difference between YouTube and traditional TV. YouTube is becoming more like TV, while TV is becoming more like YouTube. The differences between the two mediums are eroding, and it is unlikely they will ever be distinct again.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Admiring the intricate artworks adorning the walls of our homes, hand-loomed rugs crafted by my own grandmother, barberry-laden rice and saffron-infused stews, the music of Googoosh, Bijan Mortazavi and Susan Roshan blasting from dawn to dusk.My parents spoke Farsi to one another and to me when I was a child and as such it was my mother tongue. But I was born in Australia, so it was only going to be a matter of time before I became more proficient in English. Now I stumble my way through conversations in broken Farsi, longing for the day whenIranwill be safe enough to finally visit and I can hopefully scrub up my language skills.Ed Sheeran: Azizam review – a cross-cultural Persian experiment … which sounds incredibly EnglishRead moreMy parents have never returned to Iran. Not since they left at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 due to their belief in the Bahá’í faith – a religion promoting the unity of mankind whose adherents have beenpersecutedin Iran since its inception in the mid 19th century.The closest my mother has ever beento her homeland was last year, when we stopped over in Qatar on our way to France.Iran has had a bad rap over the years; many in the west associate it with terrorism, religious extremism and crimes against humanity.And for good reason.It’s constantly under scrutiny for its oppression of women and other minority groups, and its identity is framed by the media’s negative portrayal of the country, its people and regime.And then, a white man sings.Ed Sheeran has released a new single titled Azizam, which translates to “my dear” or “my love” in Farsi – and the diaspora is going wild. The song was written and produced alongside Iranian-born Swedish songwriter Ilya Salmanzadeh. While the melody is all western pop, the Middle Eastern influences are clear, with instruments including thedafandsantoormaking a welcome appearance.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMy own children, who are Persian-Canadian and born in Australia, have always grappled with their cultural identity. When they heard Sheeran’s new song, they were euphoric. Here was a piece of music that was crossing cultural boundaries, allowing them to piece together who they were – albeit superficially. A white person, like them, singing in Farsi, also like them!Critics may sniff at Ed Sheeran’s Persian fusion hit Azizam – but we Iranians love itRead moreRecently, Persian comedian Maz Jobrani posted ashort explainer on his Instagramabout why Persians are so excited about the new song, saying: “Ever since we came to the west, we’ve been getting negative press. From the hostage crisis, to the movie Not Without My Daughter … so anytime anyone in the west does anything remotely good about us, we get excited!” For so long, Iran has been regarded as just a country in peril. With Sheeran’s new song, the western world can now catch a glimpse of the beauty, excitement and life that has been harboured within the country – if only it had the freedom to share it more liberally.For my entire life, my parents made sure I knew that Iran was a country with potential. Over thousands of years, since ancient Persian civilisation, our culture has influenced fashion, architecture and language. The contributions it has made to art, music, faith and science are some of the most profound the world has ever known. We want the beauty of our culture to define us. The fact that Iran continues to committhe most cruel and intense human rights crimesis a cause for lament both in the country and beyond.Azizam was inspired by Sheeran’s wife, but it’s much more than a love song. It’s a showcase of the beauty inherent in Iran, and a reconceptualisation of its identity. To those who emigrated or fled, it is an ode to their own homeland; it evokes a yearning to reunite with their beloved. To those in the broader diaspora, it’s a connection with their heritage. When Sheeranreleases the entire song in Farsi, I can just imagine the weddings, celebrations andmehmoonis(Persian gatherings) blasting the song from dawn to dusk; the chant becoming a rally cry reminiscent of the glory days – albeit in broken Farsi.Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranIranPop and rockMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

We’re not talking about ER here, but The Pitt, a strikingly similar medical drama starring Carter himself, Noah Wyle, but that for legal reasonswe probably shouldn’t describe as a spin-off. Since its debut in January, The Pitt has become aslow-burn sensation in the states, thanks to its realism, accuracy and timeliness, but most of all it’s high-concept, high-stakes conceit: the show takes place in real-time, across one, gruelling 15 hour shift in a Pittsburgh emergency department. So it’s not just ER, then, but ER meets24. Can you imagine a more moreish prospect? You want to watch it right now, don’t you? Well … you can probably guess what I’m going to say next: you can’t.That’s right, The Pitt can’t be watched legally anywhere in the UK at this moment. There had been some hope it might air on Sky and Now as part oftheir deal with Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), but Sky have confirmed to me that the show will not be airing on their platforms. That might be because of the slightly fiddly nature of the current deal, which allows Sky automatic access to series that air, in the US, on the WBD-owned HBO network –you might just have heard of it!– but not automatic access to series that air on WBD’s Max streaming service, of which HBO is a part. (Confused? Bored? Me too, on both counts.)While Sky/Nowdoair some Max shows, includingAnd Just Like That …andHacks, others – egTokyo ViceorOur Flag Means Death, appear elsewhere (both available on iPlayer). Perhaps The Pitt will turn up on another platform in the next few months, although there’s a chance that it may instead premiere on the UK version of Max that WBD will launch with some fanfare next year. (Yep, another new streamer – although at least Sky and Now customers will have Max bundled into their subscription.) There’s a logic to WBD’s decision – Max will need some big new shows to launch with, especially iftheir Harry Potter seriesisn’t ready to go by then – but for us audiences that will mean waiting for, in all likelihood, a year, and, well … I want it now!View image in fullscreenThat’s not a ketchup spill … The Pitt.Photograph: WBDThis is just the latest episode in a long and proud history in British broadcasting of waiting absolutely ages for an American show to reach our screens. So much so, in fact, that in the 90s when the Guide was a newspaper supplement rather than a newsletter, we used to have a column where a US-based journalist would tantalise us with all the exciting shows that wouldn’t hit UK shores for months … or even years. (Though even in those pre-internet-enabled days a fast turnaround was still possible, just about: the Dallas episode that revealed who shot JR aired in the UK a mere day after the US, the tapes of ithaving been flown into Heathrow, accompanied by a security guard.)I think we all expected that to change with streaming and, in fairness, it mostly has. Many of those HBO shows air on Sky at the exact same time as they are premiering in the US (great for insomniacs!), and the likes of Netflix go further by dropping their shows at the same time for everyone the world over. But shows still slip through the cracks, often due to arcane licensing rights issues. The third season of Hacks, for example, took aeons to appear on UK screens – despite seasons one and two arriving in fairly short order – because its previous broadcaster Amazon no longer held the rights (Sky would eventually pick up seasons three and four earlier this year). And I don’t think the later seasons of terrific sitcom The Other Two have ever made their way over here, despite its first seasongetting great reviewsin the UK when it aired on E4 in the before-Covid times.At the same time, other series bounce between different streaming platforms depending on who has bought the rights at that point (one minute Seinfeld is on Amazon, the next Netflix). It all adds to a sense of customer befuddlement, as some shows disappear from a platform at short notice, and others never find their way on to it at all. Wasn’t streaming supposed to solve all this? In reality, streaming has only complicated things: those older media companies have had to scramble to catch up with Netflix, building their own rival streamers and spreading TV series across more and more platforms, much to the confusion and annoyance of those of us signing up to them. Perhaps it’s no wonder that some have opted for more illicit means of watching their favourite shows: there has been a 12%rise in visits to piracy websitessince 2020 according to anti-piracy analyst Muso.The arrival of Max in the UK next year will be the latest episode in this mad streaming land grab, and with it will hopefully come The Pitt, if it hasn’t arrived before then. Wherever The Pitt lands, it better be quick: I’m in urgent need of seeing someone performing a risky appendix surgery in real time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s where the pressure washer comes in. These handy tools connect to your hose pipe and squirt water at any cleaning problem. Stubborn and unpleasant stains, from bird dirt to years of neglect, can be lifted from your garden’s hard-wearing surfaces in seconds. With the right attachments, you can also use your pressure washer to hose down cars, bikes and boats.At a glanceBest pressure washer overall:Ava Go P40£149.90 at AvaBest budget pressure washer:Kärcher K 2 Classic£72 at ArgosBest cordless pressure washer:Stihl Rea 60 Plus£224.99 at CharliesBest for high-power deep cleaning:Bosch UniversalAquatak 135£135 at B&QWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing all sorts of cleaning gadgets for years. I’ve testedvacuum cleaners, mops, hard-floor cleaners, carpet cleaners,window vacsand various robots designed to do jobs automatically, from internal cleaning to lawn mowing. I’ve got a keen nose for a labour-saving device, and I live in a busy household that never seems short of a dirty surface to test things on, including an extensive patio area and a filthy car. There was a perfect alignment of dirty jobs crying out to test these pressure washers on.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I found a neighbour with a deck that hadn’t had a deep clean for a few years.’Photograph: Andy ShawI gathered eight pressure washers of various types and prices from a range of manufacturers, and put each through the same tests. First, I used each washer to clean one of the dirty paving slabs at the side of my house. This is where the dog gets washed after walks and it’s a well-trodden thoroughfare, making it a dark and grimy corridor.Next, I wanted to test the washers on decking. Unfortunately, I don’t have a deck of my own, so I had to find someone else’s to clean. Fortunately, a shoutout on our neighbourhood WhatsApp group found a neighbour with a deck that hadn’t had a deep clean for a few years, so it was primed and ready to challenge the washers. This was by far the wettest job of the lot – but my neighbour was delighted with the extreme hose down I gave it.I then washed the wheels of my car. As with most cars, it has only four, so I washed half of each wheel with each washer, so I could compare their work.Where appropriate, I tried the various attachments and settings that I hadn’t used previously on other jobs. It included cleaning out empty water butts, clearing a few years of built-up algae off my whirligig and testing the supplied foam cannon on the rest of my car.All of the pressure washers were supplied by their manufacturers, most of whom will pick them up when I’ve finished. Any that don’t get collected will be given toWorkaid, a Chesham-based charity that refurbishes tools of all kinds. It donates them to training centres and self-help organisations in Africa and the UK, to help young people develop new skills or start their own businesses.The best pressure washers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy ShawBest pressure washer overall:Ava Go P40View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£149.90 at Ava£149.90 at AmazonAva may not be a household name in the UK but the Norwegian pressure washer manufacturer has entered the market with affordable products that are designed to last. The P40 is a great entry-level device that should last for years, with a 10-year warranty to back it up.Why we love itIt’s clear that the design focused on how the product would be used. It feels better built than similarly priced rivals, from the kink-free steel-lined pressure hose to robust but easy-to-release clips that hold all the parts together.My favourite feature is the extendable lance. At the push of a button, the lance can extend from 84cm to 116cm. If you’re working on cleaning a floor, there’s no question this will reduce the amount of bending you have to do.The kit I reviewed came with two nozzles (one variable for adjusting the width and pressure of the cleaning area, and another turbo nozzle for particularly tough jobs) and a foam cannon. Matching this with Ava’s detergents made car cleaning a breeze, and it performed well in all my tests.It’s a shame that …it’s not as powerful as the most powerful products we’ve tested here, so it can be bettered for stubborn dirt on the hardest surfaces.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length:6mWeight:4.5kgCorded or cordless:cordedCleaning power:11,313 cleaning units (6.5 litres a minute x 1,740PSI)Attachments included:zoom lance, turbo nozzle, vario nozzle, foam cannonWarranty:10 yearsBest budget pressure washer:Kärcher K 2 ClassicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£72 at ArgosKärcher sells more pressure washers than any other manufacturer, with the low price of the K 2 indicating why. None of the other washers we tested were as affordable as this compact unit.Why we love itIts affordability makes it ideal if you want something quick for occasional use. Considering the low price you’re still getting a surprisingly effective cleaner. It doesn’t have the clever design and high build quality of corded rivals from Ava and Bosch, but there’s been no skimping on raw cleaning power.It’s a lesser specification but still comes with two nozzles, which are pre-attached to their own lances. One produces a lighter spray at a fixed angle, while the other is a turbo nozzle that sends out a powerful rotating jet. The turbo nozzle was good at cleaning paving slabs and the lighter nozzle did good work on my car wheels.It’s a shame that …you get what you pay for in build quality: the pressure hose wants to stay curled up, no matter what you do with it, and the unit is so light that it’s prone to falling over.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length:3mWeight:3.2kgCorded or cordless:cordedCleaning power:9,573 cleaning units (6 litres a minute x 1,595PSI)Attachments included:single spray lance, dirt blaster lanceWarranty:five yearsBest cordless pressure washer:Stihl Rea 60 PlusView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£219 at Just Lawnmowers£224.99 at CharliesMoving from corded to cordless washers usually incurs an increase in cost and a decrease in pressure. But while the mega battery for Stihl’s Rea 60 Plus is pricey, it can push out water at pressures that rival corded tools.Why we love itDuring testing, the Rea 60 Plus surprised me with its high pressure, which is closer to corded levels than the other battery-powered washers we tested. Although full-pelt washing diminishes the battery rapidly, Stihl has added a power dial that lets you tame the jet. That means you can wash at a lower pressure for longer, and this lower pressure is useful for more delicate tasks as well. You can also control the flow with the handy nozzle, which lets you choose between three jet types (fan, rotary and cleaning agent, with the latter fed from a hose on the side of the main unit).What I really admired about the Rea 60 Plus was how neatly it all packs away, largely thanks to its pressure hose reel. When you start you can just pull out what you need, up to its 5m length. The storage clips for the dismantled lance and gun and the lack of a power cord also help keep things neat and tidy.It’s a shame that …although the Rea 60 Plus is affordable, it doesn’t come with abatteryorcharger, which adds another £197 to the cost.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehicles, away from homePressure hose length:5mWeight:6.7kgCorded or cordless:cordlessQuoted battery run time:25minsCleaning power:8,485 cleaning units (4.5 litres a minute x 1,885PSI)Attachments included:3-in-1 nozzleWarranty:three yearsBest for high-power deep cleaning:Bosch UniversalAquatak 135View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£135 at B&Q£128.25 at AmazonThe Bosch UniversalAquatak 135 is a corded pressure washer that offers a good balance between high pressure, reasonable price and usable design.Why we love itWith a high maximum pressure and a high flow rate, the cleaning power of the UniversalAquatak 135 isn’t really in question. In my tests it quickly lifted dirt from every surface I pointed it at.There’s a little assembly to be done but it’s nothing too arduous and doesn’t require any tools: it’s just a case of clipping the wheels on to the unit and assembling the handle mechanism.

In the garden, you can connect your hose directly to the lance, so there’s no pressure hose to worry about, but you do then have to drag your hose around. I didn’t find this to be any more of a problem than using it for regular watering, though.It comes with its own hose, too, which you can connect up and dip into any water supply, further enhancing its portability. This would be great for washing down equipment after a boating trip, for example, where there’s a plentiful supply of water. You could also use it with captured rainwater from a water butt or similar.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t provide the same kind of pressure as the winners, although it’s certainly the right tool for the right job.

In fact, it’s the most powerful washer I tested, yet is available from Screwfix for less than £100, with only the less powerful Kärcher K 2 Classic beating it on price.Once I’d assembled the washer (see below) it made short work of the cleaning tasks I set it. It comes with two nozzles and I generally preferred the power nozzle over the other, as it did a significantly better job of lifting off dirt. It was also the only model to come with a patio cleaning brush tool, though I found this to be too light to be of much use and preferred the roto nozzle during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it took more assembly than any others, requiring a screwdriver to put together some of the parts.

My garden hose has a Hozelock connector, which fitted perfectly on to every model, so check yours is compatible. Once the water is connected and the tap is on, you can power up the washer either by connecting it to the mains or charging and slotting in a battery.Then you simply select an appropriate attachment or setting, depending on the pressure you want, and point it at the dirt. The gun has a trigger so you can start and stop the water as you please without returning to the main unit or closing the tap.What safety equipment do you need?Keep in mind that dirt and debris can fly around when squirted at high pressure. Safety glasses, long trousers and proper shoes should be worn. Gloves are a good idea, and you might want to deck yourself out in some waterproof clothing.What is a good pressure for home use?Different jobs require different amounts of pressure. Heavy-duty dirty work, such as blasting a concrete paving slab, is best done with high-pressure washers that can produce pressure in excess of 100 bar (1,450PSI). You can get decent results from lower-pressure washers, too, but it might take a bit longer.Softer surfaces, such as wooden fencing and decking, shouldn’t be attacked with the highest pressure settings of a powerful washer but can be hosed down with a less powerful spray. Washers with pressure of less than 100 bar can be used for this kind of thing. Try your washer on a small and inconspicuous area first to see how it fares before tackling the whole thing.Some jobs are best done with the pressure at a minimum, such as washing your car. Although you can still use a pressure washer for this, you should use a rinse setting, or a fan setting from a safe distance – the pressure is most intense at the tip of the nozzle. Pressure washers with foam cannon are good for covering a car with soap, which you can then rinse after it’s lifted off some of the dirt. Don’t mix detergent with your pressure washer’s main water supply, though, as this can damage the device.Are pressure washers noisy?None of the pressure washers I’ve reviewed here were particularly noisy. Your nextdoor neighbour will notice when you’re using one, but they’re quieter than lawnmowers and hedge trimmers.

Just dinner, and lots of it’ – restaurant reviewHad enough of small plates that send you home hungry? This glam new Ukrainian spot serves big portions of filling carbsGrace DentFri 18 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 07.34 EDTShareTatar Bunar, a new Ukrainian restaurant in Shoreditch, east London, is styled as quaintly and charmingly rustic: wooden-fronted, with sage curtains, glass-panelled doors and stacks of higgledy-piggledy plates artfully arranged on shelves. Then there’s the food: sprats, potato latkes,varenyky, borscht and an abundance of wild mushrooms, and all of it influenced by chef Alex Cooper’s home town of Tatarbunary in southern Ukraine.It’s no mean feat to take on a corner of Curtain Road just yards from the shrieking neon ballpit that is theBallie Ballersoncocktail bar and aSimmonds“fun pub”, and somehow create Tatar Bunar’s nigh-rural ambience, or the odd sense that it’s been here since for ever. But then, Tatar Bunar is Ukrainian, so in recent years Cooper and his co-owner, Anna Andriienko, have faced down far bigger problems than tricky interior design.View image in fullscreenThere is nothing ‘measly’ about Tatar Bunar’s ‘big, plump’ mushroomvarenyk.Their new restaurant, the owners say, is an attempt to open up Ukrainian cuisine to a British audience. During the build and launch, Cooper remained in his homeland, where he uses the pair’s original restaurant as a food distribution point, while Andriienko was based in London. The result – featuring Ukrainian ceramics and materials from the Carpathian region in the country’s southwest, as well as putting the cooking in the very capable hands of Kate Tkachuk – certainly feels like a mini satellite version of their successful mothership,Tatar Bunar inOdesa.What Tatar Bunar certainly doesnotfeel like, however, is “a humble little restaurant run by proud people from a war-blighted country to keep their hope alive, etc”, or any other such patronising nonsense. This is a confident, expertly staged, rather sexy dining spot with flattering, soft peachy lighting, Bessarabian wagyu on the grill andBlack Seayafe nagarby the glass. In fact, it’s all rather glam: servers are clad in floor-length, rust-coloured gowns and the bill arrives with a postcard of a Ukrainian shepherd at twilight.View image in fullscreen‘It’s all rather glam’: Tatar Bunar’s borscht course.The crowd, when I visited, were in the main tall, sharp cheek-boned, model-esque types speaking Slavic languages, and within minutes of entering I muttered to myself: “This is going to be a terribly hard place to get into within a fortnight.” For a start, at a time when the London restaurant scene is awash with pricey European small plates that send you home hungry and angry, Tatar Bunar dishes up whopping great portions of sating carbs, cream and potatoes. Take the potato latkes with creamy wild mushrooms, which for £12 is a satisfying bowl of earthy joy. Or the £13 sprats “starter”, featuring roughly 10 fish, all boned, flattened, salted and served with a bowl of buttered boiled potatoes and a mound of pickled red onion. Or the truly delicious Bunar tartare: a semi-cooked lamb/beef tartare, if such a contradiction even exists, with a hunk of grilled bread. Similarly, there is nothing slinky or measly about thevarenyky, or dumplings, offering. A varenyk, I have learned, is akin to a Polish pierogi that, aesthetically, verges on a Jamaican patty. They are big, plump and here stuffed with minced meat or cabbage, or more mushroom and peppery potato.View image in fullscreenTatar Bunar’s generous starter portion of sprats comes with separate bowls of pickled red onion and buttery boiled potatoes.By the time we had finished those “small” plates and were moving on to mains, we were already well aware that we had chronically over-ordered. But who could blame us? I’ve spent 12 months being sold four small artichokes alone on a plate for £22. In modern London, no one actually expects to befedany more; these days, it’s more about the experience. Then along comes Tatar Bunar and its luscious lamb chops with show-stopping spicy pickled tomatoes. Oh, those tomatoes … so sweet, so powerful. And chunks of grilled cod with soft flakes, crisp skin and a generous pile of buttered samphire. No faff, no fuss, no lecture with each course, no long-winded explanation as to the cooking techniques involved, and no hovering or unwelcome input at all. Just dinner, and lots of it.Regardless of the lack of tableside lectures, I picked up a lot about Ukrainian cookery during the course of our meal, or at least Cooper and Tkachuk’s interpretation of it. Does the crisp-topped, generous, two-person portion of creme brulee strictly need to have an unexpected layer of pleasingly stodgy dumplings in the base of the dish? Well, yes, I rather think it does. And the crepes – short, fatly stuffed and folded, one filled with cheese, one with berries and a third with rich, black, fragrant poppy seed sauce – came in a bowl of glorious custard. Tatar Bunar is indulgent, delicious and a breath of fresh air. And it’s already most definitely a highlight of 2025.Tatar Bunar152 Curtain Road, London EC2, 07771 013190 Open dinner only, Tues-Sun, 6-10.30pm (10pm Sun).

But the second I saw this beautiful Boston terrier, who had flown from his breeder in Arkansas to our home in Miami in March 2017, I fell in love. Clever, loving and stubborn, Lucas was so much more than a dog. He became my soulmate, and I couldn’t bear for us to be apart.When I was hospitalised with hepatitis a few months after his arrival, I missed Lucas so much that I persuaded the nursing staff to let him stay by my side. He had an extraordinary ability to sense my emotions and was a constant source of comfort. Over the years, the two of us visited more than 30 countries together. I couldn’t imagine life without him.But a week after his seventh birthday we found out he had lymphoma. It was devastating; I was frantic, determined to find a solution. We looked into a bone marrow transplant, but that needed a compatible donor.We hoped Lucas’s brother from the same litter might be a fit. When that wasn’t possible, we had another idea: cloning. Initially, this wasn’t to replace Lucas, but to create a genetically identical sibling who could serve as a compatible donor.But there wasn’t enough time for a clone to be created – Lucas died 27 days after his diagnosis. I was bereft, sitting with him for hours not knowing how I could go on.Cloningfelt like a life raft: Lucas’s body might have died, but perhaps his spirit hadn’t gone.The fact that it would cost $50,000 (nearly £40,000) was irrelevant. I swiped my credit card without even thinking about it. Luckily, I run my own successful business, so I was able to pay off the bill in full. But, even if it had cost a million dollars, I would have somehow found the money.The resemblance was astonishing, not just in appearance but in personality and behaviourA clinic takes a tissue sample, reproduces new cells from it, places one of those cells in the nucleus of a female dog’s egg and then creates an embryo. A surrogate carries the embryo, and a genetically identical puppy is born. Cloning animals isn’t legal in the UK, except for scientific research purposes, but commercial cloninghas been taking placein the US since 2004.At first, Justin was supportive, but, as the process went on, he began to have second thoughts. By the time of the embryo transfer, he said that it was a ridiculous amount of money to spend. I simply replied: “I’m doing it anyway.”It usually takes four weeks to cultivate the 1m cells aimed for, but in just 10 days the clinic had 2.9m. It felt like a sign from Lucas that he wanted to be reborn.When I told my family and friends, many were supportive. But my parents thought it was crazy to spend so much money, and a close friend criticised me for “playing God”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I felt that my grief about Lucas’s death had been invalidated. For a while, I struggled with depression. I couldn’t get out of bed for days.But when the clinic told me their surrogate dog was pregnant, I was ecstatic.Five months after Lucas died, the clinic called to say that two puppies had been born. Even though I’d known that multiple clones was a possibility, I felt my confidence wobble. Could Lucas’s spirit really be divided?Six weeks later, as I waited for the clinic to bring the puppies to our apartment, I swung from hope to numbness and worry. I desperately wanted to feel Lucas reborn in the puppies I’d seen pictures of for weeks.Then, suddenly, they were in my arms, and I felt Lucas’s presence stronger than ever. The resemblance was astonishing, not just in appearance but in personality and behaviour. In the weeks that followed, I’d cry as I watched them sit in Lucas’s favourite spots in the apartment, and display the same combination of obnoxious confidence, loyalty and happiness.Within a week I knew that one puppy was absolutely Lucas reincarnated. I called him Lucas Prince and his brother Lucas Gabriel, after the angel.I know that not everyone agrees with cloning. But for me it has been a miracle that has healed my heart. You can’t put a price on that.As told to Kate GrahamDo you have an experience to share?

The 85-year-old designer unveiled his autumn/winter 2025 collection with a catwalk show staged in the historic Clock Tower building, a gilded wonder just a short hop away from Wall Street.Temu and Shein warn of US price hikes from next week due to Trump tariffsRead moreGuests including the actors Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams and Naomi Watts were greeted by waiters holding trays of champagne in the building’s former beaux-arts bank hall, complete with Corinthian columns and ornate ceilings.Although the show had been in the brand’s pipeline for months (Lauren holds his shows off-schedule rather than during the traditional fashion week calendar), the sudden volatility created by Trump’s trade war meant it served as a fashion red herring.What better way to quell the chatter around fluctuating stocks and waning consumer confidence than with a star-studded front row and clothes such as glamorous evening gowns that looked as if they had been plucked straight from the wardrobes of those living the American dream?View image in fullscreenRalph Lauren waves after presenting his latest collection in New York.Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/ReutersWith long-established Asia-centric supply chains, the fashion sector has been left particularly wounded from Trump’s decision to impose duties on finished products. China, most outsourcing is undertaken, faces tariffs of up to245%while Vietnam, another fashion manufacturing hub, faces blanket tariffs of 46% –albeit suspended for 90 days after the president’s abrupt U-turn.Meanwhile, despite talks with the US, the EU is still grappling to come to a trade compromise. The announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” triggered a sharp decline in shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, as well as LVMH, whose portfolio includes Dior and Louis Vuitton. Ralph Lauren stock fell by 7%.Lauren’s show occurred just hours after there was further retrenchment in the luxury sphere. Earlier in the week, the Birkin bag maker Hermès had been expected to overtake LVMH in size but on Thursday it reported 7% year-on-year revenue growth, less than the 8.8% expected. Elsewhere, LVMH’s stock dropped heavily amid disappointing first-quarter results, leading to the chief executive, Bernard Arnault, appearing to attempt to soothe investor fears by announcing the ex-Loewe starJonathan Anderson as the new head of Dior’s menswear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWith continued confusion on how the tariffs will actually work, brands are unable to accurately ascertain the fallout. Some have been left with no option but to simply wait it out. But perhaps there is opportunity to be found in the interim. While brands cannot control government decisions, they can control the optics surrounding them.Insiders say the time is ripe for renewed brand positioning that focuses on heritage, craftsmanship and desirability. When prices inevitably rise and houses pass the increased costs on to consumers (Hermès has already said from May its prices in the US will climb), brands that have built an emotional connection with customers may also fare better, especially among aspirational shoppers.Achim Berg, the founder of FashionSights, a luxury industry thinktank, emphasised the importance of marketing and brand events in times of heightened uncertainty. “Everyone is reviewing what they need to do now. From shows to new store openings, it makes sense given the uncertainty everyone is dealing with.”With the industry in flux, investors may find comfort in a trusted pair of hands steering the ship. Lauren is one of the last fashion greats still helming the £9.4bn empire he has built. Most recentnet revenue earnings were up 11%. The son of Jewish immigrants, his journey to the top has long been heralded as epitomising the traditional American dream. Under Trump’s tenure, many are questioning if that idea exists any more. However, as Lauren took his bow from the top of an elaborate gold and marble staircase, waving to perfectly coiffed and glossy guests below, it felt very much alive.Explore more on these topicsFashion industryTrump tariffsManufacturing sectorRetail industryNew YorkTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who should eat humble pie?Find out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonFri 18 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 09.12 EDTShareThe prosecution: BillI know Rita struggles with anxiety, but she only gave us an hour’s notice that she wasn’t comingMy youngest daughter, Rita, is late for everything and known as the unreliable one in our family. Recently, she was inconsiderate, and I feel she needs to learn that actions have consequences.I had booked dinner for my 58th birthday at a nice restaurant with my family (which includes my other daughters, Bernice and Gina, and my wife, Linda), two friends and Rita.But just an hour before, Rita texted to say she wasn’t coming because she was too tired. The restaurant had a strict cancellation policy, so I was still charged for her meal. I tried talking to the staff but they said it was the policy.Everyone else insisted on splitting the bill between them as it was my birthday, so they ended up paying Rita’s share in her absence. I was quite cross and believe that Rita should reimburse them. She didn’t even bother telling me she wasn’t feeling up to it until just before we sat down.Everyone seems to use mental health as an excuse these days. But sometimes you’ve just got to get on with itShe thinks that because she wasn’t feeling well she shouldn’t have to pay. She apologised to me and I accepted it because I love her. But she only apologised to our friends when I asked her to, and her sisters and my wife received no apology.Everyone seems to use mental health as a reason for everything these days. But sometimes you’ve just got to get on with it. Rita lives an hour away, so I think she just couldn’t be bothered to make the journey on a Sunday evening.It’s not just about the money, which I don’t really care about. It’s part of a larger issue of Rita being inconsiderate and unreliable. I’ve always tried to be patient, knowing she struggles with anxiety, but there comes a point where understanding becomes enabling.Our friends were gracious about covering her share, but I was annoyed and it ruined my birthday a bit. On one hand, I want to support her mental health, but on the other I don’t want her to think that her actions have no impact on others.My wife thinks I should let it go for the sake of family harmony. But I’d like Rita to learn to take more responsibility and at least offer to repay our friends.The defence: RitaI don’t know why Dad is obsessed with merepaying the money – he just wants to save faceI understand why my family are upset, but I don’t think I should have to pay for my meal. I was genuinely feeling unwell, and I gave them two hours’ notice, not one. I’ve always been open about my struggles with stress and anxiety, and sometimes when it hits hard, it’s more than I can manage.I wasn’t just tired, I felt physically and mentally exhausted after a long time studying and panicking about my exams, and I didn’t feel capable of going out that evening.I know two hours’ notice isn’t enough and, looking back, I can see how that was inconsiderate. I really did want to see Dad – I had bought his present and I gave it to him the next time I saw him, which was a week later. He seemed fine then, but he texted me to tell me I needed to apologise to his friends, which I did.I didn’t know everyone else would have to cover me. I know Dad’s friends won’t accept the money to cover my part of the bill, so I don’t know why Dad is obsessed with me offering it. He just wants to save face.It’s frustrating that my mental health struggles are often dismissed. I should have communicated better, but I wasn’t in the right state of mindYou be the judge: should my boyfriend stop spitting in public?Read moreMy parents have given me support in the past, but sometimes I think they see anxiety as just an excuse for laziness, when really it can be debilitating.My older sisters can also be unsympathetic. When I cancelled, Bernice texted me to say Mum and Dad were cross and that I owed everyone money. I didn’t need that when I was already struggling.It’s frustrating that my mental health struggles are often dismissed. Yes, I was supposed to be there and I should have communicated better, but I wasn’t in the right state of mind. I didn’t think it would become such a big issue. Now I feel that my parents are punishing me financially. I wasn’t in any state to enjoy the meal anyway. It wasn’t intentional – I’d never want to cause trouble for anyone, least of all my family.I wish my family could be more patient with me. I’m really sorry they’re disappointed. Maybe this is a lesson for me, too, about balancing my own needs with the impact my actions have on others. I just hope Dad won’t hold this against me for too long.The jury of Guardian readersShould Rita contribute toBill’s birthday dinner?Bill should apologise. While claiming to support Rita’s mental health, he actually disregards it, going out of his way to humiliate her, and asking her to apologise for her mental health issues to others. He didn’t seem to miss her, being more concerned with what others may have thought.Jesus, 39I do feel for Rita, as she is clearly remorseful, but she needs to think about how to react to social situations when first asked. She has apologised to her dad’s friends, but she should have spoken to her mother and sisters first. It has been stressful for everyone – perhaps they all need to be a bit more considerate of each other in the future.Valerie, 65The money is beside the point. Rita is clearly struggling and has learned a lesson about how her problems can affect others. Bill needs to learn a more important lesson: to trust his daughter, before she feels she can no longer talk openly with him.Carl, 29Rita was unaware of her meal being charged, then acknowledged her poor communication; Bill didn’t acknowledge his. He sees her as free-spirited when really she’s stressed and anxious. If he had told Rita upfront of the charge, she would have been able to make an informed decision.Kath, 61Bill is going too far by insisting that Rita pay the money back, but she should have tried to put him first on his birthday. As someone who struggles with anxiety myself, I know it can be strangely helpful when you are forced to put yourself aside for an evening and think of others, rather than always bringing it back to your own needs, no matter how valid they may be.Kitty, 33Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Rita make a contribution?The poll closes on Thursday 24 April at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherMandy should respond to her friend Priya’s textsmore rapidly?59%of you said yes –Mandy is guilty41%of you said no –Mandy is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re the remnants of a landbridge between the Prom and Tasmania’s Freycinet, a link easily seen in the areas’ shared beauty: fine white sand, rough granite and bright orange lichen contrasting with a startlingly blue sea. It’s the nature, the beauty and the walking that brought us here, as well as a sense of unfinished business.A local’s guide to Narooma: ‘People are amazed at how turquoise the water is’Read moreMy husband and I had been coming to Wilsons Prom for decades, for day walks and multi-day hikes. But we’d never made it to the lighthouse, or stayed in the cottages converted to walkers’ accommodation. To tackle the trip, we booked two bunkrooms and roped in the Schultz family. It would be the first time either of our families – four adults and five kids aged nine to 15 – had attempted a four-day walk, but there was a reward waiting at the end. After 30km of trekking around the Prom, on the last night we’d have luxuries: the cottages’ hot showers and comfy beds.View image in fullscreenThe Prom’s beloved boulders.Photograph: Megan HolbeckTime has brought minimal obvious changes to the 50,000-hectare national park. The past is everywhere: in the bush, geology and Indigenous history. The area sits atop a granite batholith, a huge mass of cooled magma that forms the Prom’s boulders and mountains, as well as the nearby islands.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe Bunurong and Gunaikurnai people have lived in the area for thousands of years, maintaining strong connections to the place they call “Wamoon” or “Yiruk”. Wilsons Promontory appears in many dreamtime stories, with shellfish middens dotting its western coast.Names such as Sealers Cove hint at the area’s colonial history, as do mining and cattle-grazing relics, while the lightstation has safeguarded ships for more than 150 years. The buildings of Tidal River betray the settlement’s origins as a commando training centre in the second world war.View image in fullscreenThe first day was short: an 8km walk to the campsite.Photograph: Megan HolbeckOur walk starts and ends at Tidal River, which is now the park’s main hub, with a shop, campsite and tourist information.The first day was short, an 8km walk to our campsite at Oberon Bay – perfect for adjusting to packs. Under low clouds and strong headwinds, we walked through the tall tangle of tea-tree to Norman Beach where surfers shared the water with a darting seal. On the horizon the Glennie islands showed the boundary of Victoria’s largest marine national park.A smattering of walkers followed the track to Little Oberon Beach, where they formed drifts of people sheltering from the wind. We followed the coast round to Norman Point lookout, which had views to our white sand destination. We picked our way across Growler Creek, admiring tangled piles of driftwood and boulders painted in orange lichen.The campsites at the wide beach’s southern end are in tunnels of tea-tree, perfect for hide and seek. We set up tents while the kids played, until the sight of a dozy tiger snake made us pause the game. We switched to cards and took freezing swims and examined shells and massive cuttlefish bones, until a red sun set over the ocean.Floods in 2021 destroyed some of the track to Sealers Cove, so we couldn’t walk the classic four-day circuit. This route is scheduled to reopen sometime in 2025. Instead, our second day’s route cut across the Prom from west to east, over dry heathland and tea-tree swamps, past looming boulders, to hit Waterloo Bay’s squeaky white sand and clear sea just after lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wombats wandered through the short grass while superb fairy wrens darted about, their blue heads a similar shade to the nearby ocean. We spent the afternoon swimming again in the freezing sea, exploring the beach and the surrounding rock shelves.The next day I woke to the sound of waves and the thought of hot showers. On this leg, the track climbed steeply through tea-tree and eucalypt forest dotted with wildflowers. Glimpses over the previous day’s route looked like scenes from the Whitsundays, only colder and further south. As we climbed we saw the lightstation ahead, a point decorated with tiny white buildings. After ups and downs and a thigh-burning final climb, we reached its lush lawn, kept trim by marsupials and divided by drystone walls, crowned by the granite lighthouse.We were met by ranger Bailey, who showed us our home for the night, a historic lightstation keeper’s house with four bedrooms, a snug lounge, central kitchen with a long table; and the veranda with uninterrupted sea views. Then we raced for the showers.View image in fullscreenThe lighthouse keeps quarters.Photograph: Christian Pearson/Parks VictoriaLater, Bailey took us up the tower and explained its history. Built in 1859, the light originally burned oil. Its running was overseen by a team of four, their families forming a remote community. In a museum at the lightstation’s base, illustrations clipped from newspapers showed terrified women being hoisted ashore and a handwritten story told of the year supply ships ran late and Christmas dinner was delivered by a nine-year-old jumping on a Cape Barron goose.Now the lighthouse is automated, with LED lights and self-changing bulbs. Ranger Bailey told us the fog can get so thick, buildings become invisible at five metres. But that day was clear. From the balcony we were treated to a sea of “whale soup” as humpbacks leapt and cavorted on their way down south.View image in fullscreenA beacon for curious minds, the lighthouse has a museum at its base.Photograph: Nick Esser/Parks VictoriaAfterwards, we lay on the grass, watching wombats, wallabies and whales, until the sun disappeared behind South Point, the southern-most point of mainland Australia.Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreOur final day was the longest – 20-odd kilometres down the middle of the Prom. The sun baked and our sore bits ached, but two things kept spirits high: a generous supply of lolly snakes and the promise of ice-creams when we reached Tidal River. As we sat out the front of the Tidal River shop, we made a toast: to a great family adventure, and many more to come.Food and accommodationWalkers need to be entirely self-sufficient.Bookingsare needed for all campsites and lighthouse accommodation.The Parks Victoriasite gives further information, including about track closures and water availability.Transport and logisticsThe walk starts and finishes at Tidal River, and you’ll need your own transport to get there.

In most cases the government has cited their roles in pro-Palestinian campus protests overIsrael’s war in Gazafollowing the7 October 2023 attack. Claims that they “supportHamas” are invoked as justification for wanting to deport them, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Those taken include:Mahmoud KhalilA recent graduate student of Columbia University in New York,Mahmoud Khalil, 30, is a Palestiniangreen card holderwho was a leaderduring protestslast year.

She was told her visa was being revoked and she was being deported to her native Russia.When Petrova, 30, said she feared political persecution there because she had criticized the invasion of Ukraine, she was taken away and alsoended upin an overcrowded detention facility in Louisiana.Student visas revokedMore than 1,300 international students from at least 200 colleges across the US have had their “legal status changed” by the state department, including the revoking of visas, between mid-March and mid-April, Inside Higher Educationhas reported. The specialist publication called it “an explosion of visa terminations”.The schools and students have been given little information, but secretary of state Marco Rubio has lambasted protesters and campus activistsas “lunatics”. Some have been cited for pro-Palestinian views, others concluded they must have been targeted because of minor crimes or offenses, such asa speeding ticket. Some can find no specific reason why their visa would be revoked. Many are from India and China, the Associated Pressreported, and panic is setting in on campuses.High-profile cases include:Felipe Zapata VelásquezView image in fullscreenBodycam footage of Felipe Zapata Velásquez being arrested by the Gainesville police department.Photograph: Gainesville Police DepartmentThe family of University of Florida student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, 27,said he is“undergoing a physical and emotional recovery process” in his native Colombia after police arrested him in Gainesville in March for traffic offenses and turned him over to Ice. He agreed to be deported, to avoid lengthy detention and legal battles. Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost accused authorities of “kidnapping” Velásquez.Momodou TaalTaal, a dual citizen of Britain and Gambia,was pursuinga PhD at Cornell University’s Africana Studies and Research Center, and was an outspoken activist on the Ivy League campus. He was suspended last year for his role in anti-Zionist protests.

But then itessentially defieda US supremecourt orderto “facilitate” his return to his home and family in Maryland from abrutal mega-prisonin the central American country. Ábrego García was undocumented but had protected status against being deported to El Salvador. He wasflown there anyway, without a hearing. The administration accuses him of being a violent gangster and has abandoned him,infuriatinga federal judge and prompting warnings ofa constitutional crisis. He has not been charged with any crimes but was swept up with hundreds of Venezuelans also deported there. Sheet metalworkers union chief Michael Coleman described Ábrego García as an “apprentice working hard to pursue the American dream”and saidhe was not a gang member. Trump said hewas eyeingSalvadoran prisons for US citizens.Deported to a third country, without due processThe USdeported morethan 230 Venezuelan men tothe mega-prisonin El Salvador without so much as a hearing in mid-March despite aninfuriated federal judgetrying to halt the flights, thenblockingothers. Donald Trump took extraordinary action to avoid due process by invoking the1798 Alien Enemies Act(AEA), a law meant only to be used in wartime, prompting court challenges led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). John Roberts, the US chief justice,rebukedthe president when he threatened the judge. The justices, by a majority,did not stopTrump from using the AEA but the benchunanimously reaffirmedthe right to due process and said individuals must be able to bring habeas corpus challenges.Most of the men are reportedly not violent criminals or members of violent gangs, as the Trump administration asserts, according to a New York Timesinvestigation.Many appear to have been accused of being members of the transnational Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua partly onthe basis of their tattoos, with their families speaking out, including:Andry José Hernández Romeroskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Period – period,” Neil Duhon, whose rapist wasLawrence Hecker, said in an interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, the first and only time he’s ever revealed his identity to the public.Referring to theCatholicarchdiocese ofNew Orleans, the institution that employed and protected Hecker for decades and kept doing so even after the cleric admitted he had preyed sexually on minors throughout his career, Duhon added: “I hope they get some type of criminal charge.“You know, they are responsible for all of this.”New Orleans clergy abuse survivors say they’ve lost confidence in case’s judgeRead moreAnd Duhon, who is now 65 but was about 16 when Hecker raped him in 1975, had particularly harsh words for a judge who handled part of his ordeal. New Orleans criminal court judge Benedict Willard delayed Hecker’s trial date for more than a year before recusing himself on the day that jury selection for the case was to begin. Only by handing the matter over to another judge did Willard finally clear the way for Hecker to plead guilty in December – shortly before the priestdied.Duhon called Willard “a coward – a coward. That’s it.”The hours-long interview Duhon granted a pair of outlets whose reporting aided Hecker’s successful prosecution provided the most detailed account yet of the stand he took against one of the Catholic church’s most inveterate abusers. Hecker’s prosecution also showed how theclergy molestation crisis roilingthe US church for decades was not yet over.As Duhon told it, he was a freshman student at New Orleans’ St John Vianney high school – which catered to boys interested in joining the priesthood – when he met Hecker in 1973. The school, which has since closed, required students to essentially help local Catholic churches with their masses and other services. And Duhon was assigned to do that at a church adjacent to St John called St Theresa and colloquially known as Little Flower, where Hecker introduced himself to him.Hecker left Little Flower – which has since closed, too – in about 1974. But during the summer of the following year, Duhon saw him again at one of the weekly pool parties that the Notre Dame seminary, an institution in New Orleans that educates and trains priests, would host for St John students.According to Duhon, Hecker recognized him and asked if he was still working at Little Flower. Duhon said he was.Days later, after finishing his mass-related duties at Little Flower, Duhon was exercising on a weight bench set up in a room attached to the church bell tower. Hecker appeared unannounced, offered to give him pointers that could help Duhon earn a spot on a wrestling team being started at St John, and eventually put him in a headlock.‘Why you fighting, Neil?’Duhon tried to force himself free of Hecker but couldn’t. He said he suddenly felt Hecker’s penis inside of him. As he tensed up, Duhon said Hecker’s arm came across his upper chest toward his neck. Duhon said he lost consciousness and woke up alone.The shadows cast in the room were much longer than he remembered them, suggesting hours had passed. Duhon said he soon realized he had semen on his backside. His mind raced as he removed his gym shorts and underwear, changed into his trousers and rushed to his bus stop. Along the way, he said he suddenly realized he was carrying the soiled clothes and – overcome with disgust – threw them in a garbage can.Duhon said his mother was the first person he told about his rape, when laundry day arrived the following Friday. He said he disclosed the attack to her after struggling to give an answer when she asked where his gym shorts and underwear were so she could wash them.View image in fullscreenA photo of Neil Duhon while he attended New Orleans’ St John Vianney high school.Photograph: Courtesy of Neil DuhonHe said his mother said nothing but appeared to be in shock. Duhon said he was never sure whether she disclosed the rape to his father. But his parents soon decided he would not return to Little Flower and instead would work a newspaper delivery route with his father.Not immediately realizing that he was traumatized, Duhon said he returned to St John much more combative than he had been before. One priest and teacher, Luis Fernandez, had the habit of using a lengthy stick to strike students who were sleeping, talking or inattentive. He hit Duhon with it one day that year, and the pupil snatched it away, igniting a heated confrontation that got him sent to the office of the principal, Paul Calamari.Clergy abuse survivor begs Louisiana not to release child molester: ‘It’s just not right’Read moreCalamari initially punished Duhon with detention. But later that same day, Duhon was standing in the lunch line with a friend and began arguing with him over something he can no longer remember. They ended up in a fistfight. Teachers sent Duhon back to Calamari. Duhon recalled the principal saying: “Ah … you’re fighting now. Why you fighting, Neil?”As he remembered it, Duhon didn’t mince any words and immediately told Calamari that Hecker had raped him. Duhon said Calamari’s reaction was to angrily ask who else the boy had told.“My mom,” Duhon recalled saying, which prompted Calamari to summon the boy’s parents and meet with them without their son present.Ultimately, Duhon recalled agreeing to undergo treatment from a psychiatrist in lieu of expulsion over the fight with his friend and confrontation with Fernandez. The sessions – which Duhon suspects were paid for by the school – focused on managing his anger problems and what Calamari called “fantasy stories” instead of addressing his rape at the hands of Hecker, he said.“We never talked once about that,” said Duhon, adding that the sessions went on for months.Duhon said he eventually graduated from St John, burned his memorabilia from the school and threw his class ring into Lake Pontchartrain. Despite everything, his mother wanted him to become a priest, and he enrolled briefly at St Joseph seminary college north of New Orleans. Yet he said he intentionally tanked his studies and withdrew, having concluded he was not comfortable around priests and felt “hypocritical” pretending he was.Duhon later served in the US navy and coast guard. And he served as an emergency medic and police officer, first inLouisianaand then in north-west Ohio. He got married, started a family in Ohio and tried not to think about St John.‘A pedophile ring’But that became impossible beginning in 2018 when, amid its efforts to manage the fallout of the worldwide Catholic church’s clergy abuse crisis, New Orleans’ archdiocese released a list of priests and deacons whom it had judged to be credibly accused of child molestation.Hecker was on that list in connection with reported abuse that had nothing to do with Duhon. Another person on that list was Calamari, who became a priest after Duhon’s rape. Carl Davidson, a priest who worked at St John and had successfully recruited Duhon to join a choir there, was on the list, too.Robert Cooper, who taught at St John while Duhon was a student there, would be added after a 2020 investigation by WWL Louisiana and a reporter now at the Guardian.Not on the list was Fernandez, whom the reporters also investigated later. After the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020 in an attempt to limit its liability from lawsuits prompted by the abusive conduct underlying the list, the church quietly canceled most of Fernandez’s retirement benefits. The priest, who moved to Florida, later told the Guardian that a church attorney told him he lost the benefits because of a credible child molestation accusation, though he correctly said he had never been put on the New Orleans archdiocese’s credibly accused list.View image in fullscreenNeil Duhon when he was about 15.Photograph: Courtesy of Neil DuhonDuhon noted that the credibly accused list’s publisher, Archbishop Gregory Aymond, worked at St John at the beginning of his career alongside all those clergymen. Looking back, Duhon said it was as if his high school education unfolded within the clutches of “a pedophile ring”.“I actually feel [that] as an adult now looking back,” Duhon said.Louisiana state police troopers would arrive at a similar suspicion after Duhon was put in touch with attorney Richard Trahant, who frequently represents clergy abuse survivors. Duhon – with Trahant’s help – reported Hecker to law enforcement in June 2022, formally accusing him of rape, a crime for which he could be prosecuted no matter how long ago it occurred.Duhon immediately realized how grueling the ensuing process would get. For example, immediately after Duhon described passing out as Hecker began raping him, an apparently inattentive investigator filling in that day for a co-worker jabbered: “There’s no penetration.”“Yep – this is over,” Duhon recalled saying irately as he got up to leave and considered abandoning his complaint.Yet he calmed down and continued cooperating, though there was little progress for several months.In June 2023, the Guardian reported on a printed copy of a confession Hecker provided to his church superiors in 1999, in which the priest admitted molesting or sexually harassing several children other than Duhon. The Guardian provided the confession to WWL Louisiana in August 2023, and journalists from both outlets confronted Hecker on camera.Hecker told the outlets that his written confession about “overtly sexual acts” with underage boys was accurate and authentic. Nonetheless, he insisted that the children were “100% willing” despite their legal inability to consent.As part of the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy, the judge overseeing the proceeding – Meredith Grabill – was provided that confession. But as she weighed whether such information about Hecker should remain secret because of confidentiality rules governing the bankruptcy or be accessible to the public, she indicated she would “destroy” documents “that this court received” pertaining to the self-admitted child abuser.Duhon, after learning about that during his interview with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian, said Grabill has “got to get [her] head examined”.“A judge squashing that … is absolutely ridiculous,” Duhon said. “It’s just ridiculous.”The media outlets were also able to report ona video depositionthat Hecker gave during civil litigation stemming from a separate complaint against him. The video was confidential but obtained by the outlets. In it, Hecker outlined how New Orleans’ last four archbishops had helped him avoid all accountability over the course of decades.We need to hold the archdiocese accountable. Their secrets cannot stay secret any longerNeil DuhonHecker alsotestifiedabout collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of retirement benefits after he retired in 2002, in effect on his own terms.In September 2023, just two weeks after Hecker’s on-camera confession to WWL and the Guardian made national headlines, the office of New Orleans’ district attorney, Jason Williams, obtained a grand jury indictment charging Hecker with rape, kidnapping and other crimes against Duhon.The case was the first time Hecker faced consequences for his crimes. It was randomly allotted to Judge Willard.Hecker turned 92 shortly after his indictment. And over the next year, Willard repeatedly postponed trying the case over questions about whether Hecker – at his advanced age – had the mental competence required to withstand trial.‘Felt free’Doctors determined that Hecker had dementia but fit the constitutional criteria to legally stand trial. It seemed that Hecker would be tried in late September. And Duhon flew in from Ohio to be the star witness, one of nearly a dozen victims of Hecker whom prosecutors had lined up to testify against the clergyman.Yet on the morning of jury selection, Willard suddenly recused himself from handling the case, citing nothing more than a clash of personalities with one of Williams’s prosecutors.Duhon, through Trahant, released a media statement saying Willard’s waffling on the bench offered an example of why many rape survivors decline to ever come forward.It wasn’t immediately clear how much more time Willard’s recusal might cost Hecker’s prosecution. But the judge who took over the case, Nandi Campbell, set a trial date for 3 December. And Campbell made clear the trial would go forward that day barring the death of Hecker, who by then had turned 93.Neil Duhon speaks to WWL Louisiana and the Guardian exclusively after helping bring down one of the worst Catholic clergy abusers New Orleans has ever seen.On the morning of the trial, as prospective jurors gathered outside the courtroom, Hecker suddenly pleaded guilty as charged. Campbell imposed a mandatory life sentence a little more than two weeks later.But first, she held a hearing during which Duhon addressed his rapist. It was the first time Duhon had seen Hecker in person in half a century.Duhon directed his words at Hecker, saying that he couldn’t wear trousers without underwear to this day without thinking of the rape.“My whole aspect of church changed” because of that attack, Duhon said to Hecker, as a weeping Campbell listened.Duhon also said he would never forgive Hecker – not that the priest asked for it when Campbell gave him the chance to address the courtroom before he was sentenced.Hecker served eight days of his punishment. He died early in the morning of 26 December of natural causes as he awaited transfer to Louisiana’s maximum-security state penitentiary, infamously nicknamedAngola.Duhon got emotional reflecting back on his reaction when he first got word of Hecker’s death.“I actually felt free,” Duhon said. He said he regretted that he had lost both of his parents before ever experiencing the relief Hecker’s death brought him.Still, “my feeling [was], ‘It’s finally over,’” Duhon remarked.But he also feels the case isn’t totally resolved. Duhon said he was aware that his case spurred a broader investigation into Hecker’s former employer.Statements sworn under oath in April 2024 by the Louisiana state police investigator who built the case against Hecker, Scott Rodrigue, allege that authorities already have probable cause to suspect that the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was illegally “covered up and not reported” to authorities, Rodrigue’s sworn statement said.Calamari was questioned about Hecker as part of that investigation. And he admitted he was a child molester, according to Rodrigue’s sworn statement. However, Calamari has not been charged for, as Duhon put it, sending an underage boy to therapy without alerting police that the child had been raped.And neither had any of Hecker’s other superiors – who Hecker acknowledged in his deposition had coddled him despite knowing he was a serial child molester.Duhon said he decided to shed his anonymity to lend weight to his plea for Rodrigue and his colleagues to complete that investigation, no matter the political and logistical hurdles that may complicate their efforts.“We need to hold the archdiocese accountable,” Duhon said. “I mean – their secrets cannot stay secret any longer. [They] really can’t.”In prior statements, archdiocesan officials have said they are cooperating with the state police investigation. They have said that they “hope and pray [Hecker’s] death will bring closure and peace to … survivors”.Duhon furthermore said he wanted to openly tell his story as a demonstration of strength to his fellow survivors.As he put it: “I’m Neil Duhon. I was sodomized [and] choked unconscious by a priest named Father Lawrence Hecker.“I couldn’t say that with my name attached to it prior to his death. But now … to publicly say this, I feel that it just sets [me] right.”In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Inspired by Ratajkowski, self-professed hot girls piled on their endorsements, posting selfies with the hashtag #HotGirlsForBernie. Some saw it as a way to counter the persistent“Bernie bro” narrative, a rebuke of the idea that Sanders’s fandom consisted solely of obnoxious, socialist-in-name-only men who lived their lives on Twitter.Five years later, “Hot Girls for Bernie” is a relic, one of the last gasps of hope young progressives felt before the reality of Trump 2.0 took hold. Nevertheless the phrase has returned, this time in support ofZohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens who is running forNew York Citymayor. This week, a social media account called “Hot Girls 4 Zohran” dropped on X and Instagram to give away free Mamdani swag.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani campaigns in New York.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThough the account is unaffiliated with the Mamdani’s official campaign (and Mamdani’s representative declined to comment), it speaks to the grassroots enthusiasm fueling the millennial’s run for office.Mamdani does not have the widespread name recognition of contenders such as the current mayor,Eric Adams, who is running as an independent after aseries of scandals,orAndrew Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after facingmultiple sexual harassment accusations, which he denied. But Mamdani’s campaign has tapped a hyper-progressive wellspring by putting forth policies that sound ripe for a Fox News scare segment. They include increasing the city’s minimum wage from $16.50 to $30, opening city-owned grocery stores, and making childcare and bus fares free.It’s empowering for women, and it brings us together. There’s an intersectionality to itCaitMamdani, a failed rapper and son of the indie filmmaker Mira Nair, is most at home on social media, especially TikTok. He exudes a kind of nerdy-cool vibe, which has earned him aGQ profileand aspreadin Interview Magazine, where he fielded questions from New York luminaries such as Chloë Sevigny, Cynthia Nixon, Eileen Myles and Julio Torres. Last month, more than 18,000 citywide donors helped his campaignsecure $8m, hitting the fundraising limit set by the city.Hot Girls 4 Zohran is run by two friends, Cait, 24, and Kaif, 28, who live inBrooklynand did not want their last names published due to privacy concerns. Cait, who is very active on X, says she has been harassed by users who don’t agree with her political opinions. But she’s fine with her face being out there – she posed for the account next to a box of Hot Girls 4 Zohran T-shirts.Cait and Kaif say they are supporting Mamdani because he wants to make the city more affordable for the working class and courts individual donors over the super-rich. “We’re both fairly skeptical of institutional politicians, especially given the last election,” said Cait, who works in marketing. “We really just want to get his name out there.”And hot girls help. Not in an ogling way, but as a tongue-in-cheek way for voters to self-identify and convince others to do so too. “It’s empowering for women, and it brings us together,” Cait said. “There’s an intersectionality to it.” Kaif says that they use the “girl” descriptor liberally – it’s more of a mindset than a gender classification. “So many men have also reached out to us asking for T-shirts,” he said.Ahh look at all those \"\"\"BernieBros\"\"\"... Knocking doors on this cold Chicago evening ;)#HotGirlsForBernie#BernieBrospic.twitter.com/BkRIBkoEKd— Hot Girls For Bernie (@HotGirls4Bernie)February 29, 2020Cait was in high school when Hot Girls for Bernie went viral. “I was still pretty young, but I noticed it even back then,” she said.She has Danaka Katovich to thank for the inspiration. In 2020, after seeing playful memes about Ratajkowski’s support for Sanders, the then student at DePaul University in Chicago made a group chat for “hot girl” Bernie supporters. Katovichtold Voxthat 50 friends joined the group, which dropped a social media campaign featuring equally sexy and silly selfies.“I’m surprised people are still doing this,” said Katovich, who is now 25 and working for a feminist non-profit aimed at ending US warfare and imperialism. “Back then, journalists asked me: ‘What does Hot Girls for Bernie mean to you?’ I was 20 – it didn’t mean anything to me, since it started as a joke.”Katovich remembers people criticizing the “hot girls” label for being glib or exclusionary, but she insists it was inclusive. “Anyone could post a picture, non-binary people were included,” she said. “Sure, there were some dudes who would comment on a picture and say, ‘You’re actually more of a seven,’ but at the time, it didn’t feel like anyone who mattered really cared what you looked like at all.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Cuomo holds a strong lead in the Democratic primary pack, thanks to older voters.Photograph: Lev Radin/REX/ShutterstockKari Winter, a professor in the global gender and sexuality studies department at the University at Buffalo, agreed that “hot girls” can mean whatever posters want. “Although I personally would not use the term ‘hot’ or ‘girl’ as a trend, I like the way young women, LGBT, non-binary and disabled people use it to claim their own multi-faceted existence in the world,” she said. “It reminds me of a time when a lot of us had bumper stickers and T-shirts that said, ‘This is what a feminist looks like,’ and the point was to be inclusive, because feminists look like everything and anything.”A recent AARP New York and Siena Collegepollshows that Cuomo holds a strong lead of 34% in the Democratic primary pack, thanks to older voters. Mamdani follows at 16%, and 20% of Democratic voters say they are undecided among the nine total candidates. The June primary isranked-choice voting, a confusing system that has New Yorkers listing candidates in order of preference. The winner will probably face off against Adams and a Republican in November.Despite Cuomo’s early lead, Winter says that Mamdani’s intense focus on courting working-class voters can serve as a lesson to Democrats. “Democrats need to understand that the way to energize people is not to keep trying to play to some mythical middle, but to galvanize people who are so sick of corruption and the pandering to wealth,” she said. “The only way forward is to galvanize people who care about common people and the common good.”View image in fullscreenEmily Ratajkowski’s Bernie Sanders endorsement.Photograph: YoutubeThe Democratic national convention might not recognize a hot girl delegation, but Bernie evangelists say the movement wasn’t all frivolous.Hadiya Afzal, a former DePaul University student who was active in the Sanders group chat, says that many of her friends went on to work in progressive politics and still dedicate much of their time to the causes they care about.“I think that’s what folks should take away from this kind of campaign: at the end of the day, it’s about the policies,” Afzal said. “There would have been no Hot Girls for Bernie without an actual policy platform. That’s the backbone of what made it meaningful.”Over at Hot Girls 4 Zohran, Cait and Kaif want people do more with the T-shirts than pose in them for social media. “If you wear the shirt out and about, then it spreads the word, and we really want to mobilize voters of all ages,” Kaif said. Ultimately, he and Cait hope the moniker will aid the candidate in hisgoalof building “the single largest volunteer operation” of any New York mayoral race ever. With aforceof 10,000 door knockers, Mamdani is well on his way.One of those volunteers is Joshua Leirer, a 37-year-old who lives in Ridgewood, Queens. When Leirer canvassed in one of Brooklyn’s parks in March, there were so many volunteers that they had to spread into the “outskirts”. And, crucially, “the volunteers are hot.”“The people I talked to were really cool and friendly,” Leirer said. “A lot of glasses, a lot of beanies. I would call it a Brooklyn hot.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsBernie SandersEric AdamsAndrew CuomoBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The company has forecast revenue will rise to $11.04bn in the three months to the end of June, “driven primarily by membership growth and higher pricing”.Long gone are the early days ofYouTubewhen wanting to create a business as a creator or influencer was viewed with scepticism, and subscribers were notched up with budget content filmed on low-tech mobile phones.View image in fullscreenJake Paul’s boxing match against Mike Tyson last year was the most-streamed sporting event ever.Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today SportsMrBeast spendsmore than $1m to create each video, watched by his 375 million subscribers, while Sidemen has a production team of more than 100.“The internet is now mainstream media and we are also really seeing the quality of content on YouTube entering a new level,” says Brandon Baum, a British YouTuber specialising in visual effects who hasmore than 15 million subscribers.“Every video we create takes four to 10 weeks, and a team size of five to 15 people. I have a team of 30. They all come from a TV background. The skills that creators have learned for YouTube audiences now does apply to other areas and platforms. This is the first time I’ve really seen other broadcasters, streamers and studios really embrace it.”The quality of content and, equally importantly, the vast, mostly young global audiences the top creators have amassed have become a must-have for broadcasters and streamers looking to boost subscriptions and viewers.Despite the eye-watering price tag of Beast Games, on which Amazon reportedly still made a $100m profit, the cost of getting creators on to television is typically a fraction of the budgets needed for major films and premium TV shows featuring A-list casts and top quality production.“They want something from each other,” says Ben Woods, a creator economy analyst at MIDiA Research. “There are really big creators who aremainstream intellectual property in their own right nowand they want to fully exploit that.“With that comes audiences who will follow and engage with them regardless of the platform they are on. That is why Wembley sold out for a creator football match, and the Tyson fight did such good numbers for Netflix. For mainstream media and streamers they represent an effective way of getting younger viewers on to their platform and watching their content.”The blurring and merging of YouTube and its thriving creator economy with TV has been coming for some time. The platform is the most streamed service on smart TVs in the US, according to Nielsen.And last month Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief executive, said TV screens had officially overtaken mobile phones and desktop computers as the primary device for viewing the platform’s content in the US.YouTube says that between 2021 and 2023 it paid more than $70bn to creators, artists and media companies. And for those who have made it big – Forbes lists MrBeast as theworld’s most successful internet creator, making an estimated $85m last year – the commercial opportunities appear almost endless.View image in fullscreenForbes estimates that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson made $85m last year.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APMrBeast has lent his brand to everything from clothing toburgers, and even joined a consortium considering apotential bid for TikTok’s US operations, which faces the threat of closure from a federal law if it remains owned by a Chinese parent company.And the Sidemen havealmost notched up a Christmas No 1, produced trading cards, opened a chain ofrestaurants called Sides, which has inspired a frozen food and sauce range, developed the vodka brand XIX and launched a $25m venture capital fund called Upside.“The YouTube business is the engine room for everything else,” says Schwarzenberger.MIDiA Research forecasts that by 2031 video creators globally will make almost $64bn in revenue from their core businesses, compared with the $30bn the market was valued at three years ago.The lure of fame and fortune, the growth of YouTube and platforms such as TikTok, and the increasing ease of producing content through the introduction of technology such as artificial intelligencew, will continue to fuel a boom in those looking to become creators.By 2031 there will be an estimated 696 million video creators of all stripes, up from 239 million in 2022, according to MIDiA.“The creator economy is still a young thing and only a minority will become superstars,” says Woods. “With all the entertainment options out there, there is only a finite amount of audience time. The next layer down are probably able to make a living out of it. And then there are those where it is more of a side hustle, or who unable to push through that threshold to hit that tipping point of audience on their platform.”YouTube does not reveal revenue figures for specific creators but says that in the UK there are more than 80,000 YouTube channels that have more than 10,000 subscribers, more than 15,000 channels that have 100,000-plus and more than 2,000 channels that pass the 1 million-subscribers mark.“I think there has been this penny slowly starting to drop over the last year in the TV industry,” says Schwarzenberger. “There are only a handful of creators with the infrastructure and professional operations that can engage at a top level. We are the guinea pigs of this [transition to TV] and it is going to raise confidence among creators that maybe they can do it too.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeNetflixInternetReality TVTelevisionGoogleTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In other circumstances, its arrival would be unremarkable. But the moment Navios Alegria reaches the Lincolnshire port will be the culmination of the government’s high-wire act to keep the UK’s last steel furnaces running.MPs were recalled from their Easter recess last Saturday to pass emergency legislation handing the government control over British Steel, whichoperates Britain’s last two blast furnacescapable of producing steel from scratch using coke and iron ore.Long-running talks between the government and Jingye Group, the Chinese conglomerate that owns the Scunthorpe plant, broke down 10 days ago after executives declined an offer of £500m to keep the furnaces running. Ministers became convinced that Jingye bosses were determined to shut them down come what may.Senior figures in Downing Street and Whitehall believe the company’s decisions were motivated bya desire in Beijingto make the UK a dumping ground for Chinese steel exports, particularly inthe context of Donald Trump’s tariffs.“It became clear that when they saw the writing was on the wall they tried to shut down our steelmaking,” one senior official told colleagues. Another senior government source told the Guardian: “They decided to shut it down because China needs to dump its steel somewhere.”Jingye has arguedthe plant is no longer financially sustainable and running a loss of £700,000 a day.View image in fullscreenThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, during a visit to the British Steel site in Scunthorpe.Photograph: Darren Staples/PA MediaKeir Starmer asked to receive hourly updates between his engagements on Thursday of last weekafter the talks with Jingye broke down. In the early hours of Friday, he was informed that ownership of the cargo on Navios Alegria had been transferred from British Steel to Jingye – a sign that the Chinese company intended to sell off the coal needed to keep the blast furnace running. Unions have claimed that Jingye had turned away the Amstel Tiger, a second cargo ship that was carrying coking coal to Scunthorpe and had set off from the US.The prime minister convened cabinet at 9am on Friday and told ministers they would gather again for a 15-minute meeting at lunchtime. Aides say he was concerned about the prospect of steelworkers being caught between the government and Jingye’s orders, and that he asked the attorney general, Richard Hermer, to look at how workers defying Jingye bosses could be protected in that scenario. He also resolved torecall parliament on Saturdayand travel to Scunthorpe in a show of support.The other overriding concern in No 10 was ensuring the delivery of the Navios Alegria’s cargo. Starmer was convinced the move to transfer ownership of it away fromBritish Steelwas illegal. While government lawyers pored over the details, aides drew up a plan to divert the vessel – which was travelling up the coast of Liberia and was due to refuel in Spain – to Gibraltar, on the basis that if it docked at a British port its cargo could be seized.This gambit, which would have required some diplomatic manoeuvring with Spanish authorities, was nicknamed “Steelback” by aides – a reference to the nickname of the British army regiment that received battle honours during thesiege of Gibraltar in 1779.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer meeting British Steel workers in Appleby village hall near Scunthorpe last Saturday.Photograph: Peter Byrne/ReutersOfficials also drew up contingency plans to source coking coal from other suppliers such as commodity traders andTata Steel. By Saturday morning when Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was addressing the Commons everything hung in the balance.“Commodities traders were telling us they couldn’t get there on time,” a senior No 10 source said. “No one knew what would happen with the Liberian vessel [Navios Alegria]. We were on edge.” There were suggestions that the navy would need to be deployed to escort shipments of coking coal to Immingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Government lawyers overseen by Hermer concluded that the person who had signed away the Navios Alegria cargo did not have the relevant permissions to do so. This discovery – which meant the cargo legally belonged to British Steel and would therefore soon be under the government’s control – shifted the mood in Downing Street. Starmer was in Scunthorpe when he was given the news. At 6pm, the government’s emergency billreceived royal assentand gave ministers powers to exercise control over British Steel.Cheaper energy, more cash and a bit of scrap: how to save British SteelRead moreOn Tuesday, shipments of coking coal and iron ore from the US completed theircomparatively uneventful journey to Imminghamafter the government settled the payment to deliver the supplies needed to keep the furnaces running.Downing Street figures say they took the decisions they did because amid an escalating global trade war and European rearmament, producing steel in the UK is a matter of national security. Officials believe the crisis may lead to a reassessment of what is deemed critical national infrastructure. Steel is not, but unions have called for a rethink in the wake of Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel imports.Serious questions remain over the future of the Scunthorpe plant and the beleaguered British steel industry. The two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe are nearing the end of their lives. The cleaner electric arc furnaces that are slated to replace them would not produce steel from scratch, but instead smelt existing steel scrap. The government is due to publish a steel strategy within weeks, including a verdict on whether the UK needs to produce virgin steel.In the meantime, the government is looking for private sector investment to avoid the need to nationalise British Steel in the longer term – a route the Conservatives were keen to avoid in 2019 whenJingye was the only bidder. If no others emerge this year, ministers will face mounting questions about the cost to the taxpayer.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial policyBritish SteelSteel industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Heads bowed over candles, and escorted by people bearing aloft large gold crosses, they made their way to a platform at the heart of the ancient square.The ceremony on Holy Thursday, in which the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem washes the feet of 12 monastic priests to commemorate the Last Supper, is one of manyEasterrituals that have taken place in the Old City of Jerusalem for hundreds of years. For Christians, there is no holier place to commemorate Easter than here, the site where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified, buried and resurrected.Yet the crowd that assembled outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday morning was small and muted. International pilgrims jostled with dark-robed Greek Orthodox monks, but one group of native worshippers was noticeably absent.For generations, the tens of thousands of Palestinian Christians living in Israeli-occupied West Bank villages and cities such as Ramallah, Bethlehem and Taybeh would travel to Jerusalem’s Old City at Easter to take part in the prayers, processions and rituals such as the Holy Fire ceremony. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself is in East Jerusalem, which was captured byIsraelfrom Jordan in the six-day war of 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1980.View image in fullscreenA Greek Orthodox cleric during the Washing of the Feet ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersYet centuries of tradition have been ruptured by Israel’s increasingly draconian control over Palestinian movement – which means any Palestinian in the West Bank living outside Jerusalem, must obtain a military permit if they want to enter the city. For years, Christians inPalestinian territorieswere regularly granted permits to visit Jerusalem around Easter but since the war with Hamas broke out on 7 October 2023, they have become almost impossible to obtain.This Easter, the government announced it had issued 6,000 permits, though there are 50,000 Christians – mostly Catholic or Greek Orthodox – living in the West Bank beyond East Jerusalem. However, in reality, just 4,000 were given, according to Christian leaders, and often only to a few members of each family who applied.These permits are valid for just one week and do not allow the Palestinian pilgrims to stay in Jerusalem overnight, meaning they have to make the gruelling journey back to the West Bank by bus or taxi – crossing a multitude of army checkpoints – every evening, limiting the festivities they can take part in. A group from the village of Taybeh said the Israeli military still did not allow them to cross over to Jerusalem for Palm Sunday even though they had valid permits.The few who do make it to the Old City have been met with increased police brutality in recent years. In April 2023, Palestinian Christian worshipers and international pilgrims were beaten by Israeli police and armed forces as they attempted to reach the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.“People are very afraid and many will not risk attending the Easter processions any more,” said Omar Haramy, who runs Sabeel, a Christian organisation based in Jerusalem. He said several staff were beaten last year as they tried to attend Easter festivities in the Old City, and Christians in the Old City regularly faced hostility outside churches or as they went about their daily lives.One of the greatest sources of distress among the Christian community is the introduction of blockades and aggressive policing that prevented thousands of Christians being able to take part in the Holy Fire festivities that mark the resurrection on Easter Saturday afternoon, as they have done for hundreds of years in the Old City.View image in fullscreenThe sun shines through the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition has it that Christ was crucified, buried and resurrected.Photograph: Debbie Hill/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockWhile the restrictions have been justified in the name of safety, many Christians view them as another way for the Israeli state to exert dominance over the community.“I will go to the celebrations on Holy Saturday because my family has been part of this tradition for thousands of years, but I’m not going to bring my kids, it’s too dangerous now, with the police violence,” Haramy said.The spectre of Gaza also hangs over this year’s Easter festivities. Palestinian Christians are among the 51,000 people killed in Gaza since the war with Israel began and on Palm Sunday, an Israeli missilehit the only Christian-run hospitalin the strip. There are about 500 Christians are sheltering in Holy Family church, one of only two left standing. Those contacted by the Guardian said they were too afraid to talk, fearful of anything that might make them a target of Israeli airstrikes.For all its biblical significance and abundance of churches, convents and monasteries, Jerusalem’s Old City has become increasingly dangerous for all Christians, not just those from Arab backgrounds. Since the rise of Jewish ultranationalism in Israel, and the election of the most far-right government in the country’s history, extremist and settler Jewish movements – who want to claim all of Israel and Palestinian-controlled territories as a state only for Jews – have been emboldened in their actions against both Christians and Muslims.Historically, the relationship between Christians and Jews has been fraught, because of the Christian church’s historic role in antisemitism and the persecution of Jews. The ongoing presence of proselytising evangelical Christians, many from the US, who travel to Israel with the sole purpose of converting Jews, has also been inflammatory, particularly among the Jewish Orthodox community.But religious intolerance and antichristian sentiment has been made mainstream by Israeli political leadership – the ultra-hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, described Israelis spitting on Christians as “an old Jewish tradition” – and old suspicions have escalated into brazen, all-out violence. There have also been growing incidences of settler groups attempting to seize Christian land in Jerusalem. In 2023, the Holy Land Roman Catholic patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa accused the government of establishing a “cultural and political atmosphere that can justify, or tolerate, actions against Christians”.A recent report by the Rossing Center for Education and Dialogue documented the steep rise in the scale and severity of attacks on Christians in Jerusalem and across Israel in 2024, ranging from spitting at priests and public hate speech to the desecration of graves, arson attacks and vandalising of churches.“It’s usually young Israeli Jewish men who are conducting these attacks with impunity. They face very little punishment, if the police get involved at all,” said John Munayer, the director of international engagement at the Rossing Center.“It’s a clear attempt by hardcore settler Zionists to Judaise the Old City of Jersualem and trying to make it unbearable for Christians who have been there for centuries.”As he attended the Easter prayer ceremony on Thursday, Father Nikon Golovko, the deputy head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, said he had “really seen things change for the worse for Christians in the past nine years”.View image in fullscreenCatholic clerics during the Washing of the Feet procession at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APHe said: “We receive a lot more hostility and even aggression from the Jewish community. They spit on priests, even when we are walking through the Christian quarter. It sends a message that the city belongs not to all communities but only to the Jews. It was not like this before.”After an incident in which Orthodox Jews were caught on video spitting at Christians, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Israel was “totally committed to safeguard the sacred right of worship and pilgrimage to the holy sites of all faiths”.Xavier Abu Eid, a Palestinian Christian political analyst and the author of Rooted in Palestine: Palestinian Christians and the Struggle for National Liberation 1917-2004, said that despite the mounting harassment they faced, the diminishing numbers of Christians left in the West Bank and the unrelenting horrors of the war in Gaza, he still viewed Easter as a time of hope and “the timely message that life defeats death”.“As Palestinian Christians, we know that this generation will either make it or break it,” said Abu Eid.“So making clear to the Israeli occupation that we are going to stay, that we will celebrate the same religious events that we’ve been celebrating for centuries is both a national mandate and a religious mission that we have. Keeping our Christian traditions alive, praying – they have become an act of resistance.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesChristianityEasterIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Gen Z are also drinking less than previous generations. So why are gen Z choosing working out over hanging out at the pub?“I see on social media, people saying, if you do this, and you do this, and you do this, then you’ll feel better, and then you’ll look better,”Isabel Brooks, a freelance reporter and “zillennial”, tellsHelen Pidd.“It’s framed as this mental health advice, but it feels like it all boils down to being a kind of the best version of yourself, and that feels inherently capitalist, inherently individualistic.”But don’t they want to see friends at a pub or a club?“It’s expensive,” Isabel says. “I mean, my gym subscription is £28, and I can drop that in a flash on a birthday pub event at a London pub, especially where the pints are like almost £7.”Helen also visits charity workerNiyi Akinseyeat a gym in central London, where he works out for four hours a day. He’s made friends at the gym, but wishes that their generation were more connected.“I often reflect that I see people in the gym more than I see my mum or any family member, but you don’t say hello to them. You just walk past them awkwardly. And I think that’s what I’ve really encouraged myself to break down, to do, to actually get to know the people you see every day.“History is one of my passions outside of fitness. One of my favourite periods of time is, for example, the French Revolution. And a lot of those ideas were formed by young people going in pubs and discussing ideas. And I think there’s definitely something missed by people of our generation not meeting more and actually discussing the real issues that are going on in society right now.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Serhii Bobyk/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsFitnessToday in FocusSocial mediaYoung peoplePubs"

Several passengers, including women and children, died after jumping into the water without being able to swim.Dozens were saved but many of the survivors were left badly burnt. The search for the missing included rescue teams supported by the Red Cross and provincial authorities.The motorised wooden boat caught fire near the town of Mbandaka, Loyoko said. The boat, HB Kongolo, had left the port of Matankumu for the Bolomba territory.“The death toll among the 500 passengers on board was extremely high,” said senator Jean-Paul Boketsu Bofili on Friday. “As we speak, more than 150 survivors suffering from third-degree burns are without humanitarian assistance.”Deadly boat accidents are common in the central African country, where late-night travels and overcrowded vessels are often blamed. Authorities have struggled to enforce maritime regulations.Congo’s rivers are a main means of transport for its more than 100 million people, especially in remote areas with little infrastructure. Hundreds have been killed in boat accidents in recent years as more people abandon the few available roads for wooden vessels packed with passengers and their goods.“Our magnificent Congo River and the lakes our country abounds in have become huge cemeteries for the Congolese people. This is unacceptable,” said Bofili.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday, after returning to Washington, Van Hollen said Ábrego García told the senator that he had been moved from Cecot – where he was sharing a cell with 25 other prisoners – to a detention center with better conditions.Van Holler said he traveled toEl Salvadorfor more than just Ábrego García. “It’s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States,” said Van Hollen, as Vasquez Sura stood nearby.Ábrego García in March was arrested by immigration agents inMaryland, where he was living and working.Despite being undocumented, Ábrego García had been afforded a federal protection order against deportation to his native El Salvador, which the Trump administration ignored when it flew him and more than 200Venezuelan deporteesto El Salvador without warning or a court hearing, in a move that hasfallen foulof judges in the USright up tothe supreme court.Denied, detained, deported: the people ensnared in Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreVan Hollen posted a picture of himself with Ábrego García in what appeared to be a cafeteria-style setting in the hospital wing of the prison. The previous day he was failed to be given access to the prison or his constituent after flying to El Salvador pledging to try to bring him back.Vasquez described her spouse as “a very loving husband, an amazing father”. They were just parents “trying to live the American dream,” she said.The Trump administration claims Ábrego García is a member of the Salvadorian violent gang network MS-13. But his family andthe headof the sheetmetal workers union that represents the trade in which he is an apprentice, have said he is not connected to a gang. He has not been charged with any crimes in the US or El Salvador. And the government admitted in a court filing that he had beendeported in error, but it since has refused to work to secure his return to the US despite court orders to do so.View image in fullscreenA post on X from the official account for the White House.Photograph: XFederal judge Paula Xinis has rebuked theTrump administrationfor resisting the court’s instructions to have the father returned, saying that the government has not submitted any evidence to her court that Ábrego García is a gang member or criminal.The US president posted on social media criticizing the senator and the press in characteristic Trump language, saying Van Hollen “looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone”.Hours later in the White House, Trump reeled off unsubstantiated allegations against Ábrego García as “an MS-13 member, an illegal alien and a foreign terrorist, I assume”. He also read from a domestic violence protective order Vasquez filed against him in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, describing him as violent and hitting and scratching her. Such a record is normally confidential unless the alleged victim chooses to release it, but the US president read excerpts to reporters.Havingpreviously saidit was a bad period in their marriage that they worked through, with counseling, and forged a stronger partnership, Vasquez in the ABC interview declined to discuss the protective order further. “I’m happy he’s alive, and that’s all I can say,” she said.Meanwhile, Vasquez said on Friday that Garcia had been picked up by federal agents as he was pulled over while driving in Maryland. “What we thought was a regular traffic stop, turned out not to be a regular traffic stop,” she said, and reiterated denials that Garcia was a member of MS-13 or any other gang.“He’s not,” she added.Hours later on Friday, the White House made a sensational post on X, mocking the New York Times and Van Hollen and saying that Ábrego García is “never coming back”.Inscathingcourt order, a US court of appeals for the fourth circuit on Thursday denied the administration’s effort to appeal an earlier order from a federal judge in Maryland requiring the government to facilitate Ábrego García’s return, and the judge issued a stark warning about US constitutional democracy, as Donald Trump continues to defy courts’ orders on numerous fronts.The court said the administration’s claim that it can’t do anything to free the father from the prison and return him “should be shocking” to the public.The blistering order further ratcheted up the escalating conflict between the US government’s co-equal executive and judicial branches.Judge James Wilkinson said: “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.”“Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done,” he added.The panel emphasized that Ábrego García is entitled to due process. “If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,” the panel said.Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’Read more“The judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions,” the judges said.Lawyers for migrants in Texas on Friday told a judge that they believed the Trump administration were about to deport their clients under the Alien Enemies Act. An attorney for Trump’s justice department said no deportation flights were planned – though the homeland security department said it reserved the right to remove people Saturday, CNNreported.Meanwhile, federal judge Brian Murphy on Friday barred the Trump administration from implementing a new policy allowing it to rapidly deport hundreds if not thousands of migrants to countries other than their own without giving them a chance to show they fear being persecuted, tortured or killed there.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsMarylandAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Theban, which began in August 2023, is a result of a standoff between the tech giant and Ottawa over the Online News Act that forced intermediaries such as Meta and Google’s parent company Alphabet to compensate journalism outlets for sharing their content. Meta described the legislation, Bill C-18 – passed on 18 June – as “unworkable” and argued that the only way to comply with the law is to “end news availability for people in Canada”.Canada elections: who are the key players and what is at stake?Read moreBut media researchers found more than half of Canadians still say they get political news from Facebook, despite the platform’s ban on news articles from reputable outlets.“People using Facebook aren’t often thinking, ‘Am I reading the news?’ But they leave feeling more informed politically, either from comments from friends or family, about the election. They might see a post from a candidate or follow cultural news aggregating types of accounts,” said Aengus Bridgman, the executive director of the MEO.“But we know this is not the same quality of information they might have accessed before the ban. The richest, densest and most accurate and factchecked information is not making it through any more. Neither is information that might contradict the views they hold. All of that just has been cut really – like, off at the knees.”Bridgman says that most of the content the team uncovered – including more than 40 Facebook pages promoting fraudulent ads, with new pages being created and identified every day – were meant to be humorous or ironic, instead of convincing. None of the content the team found is expected to sway the electorate.But Canada’s Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (Site) is monitoring the election for disinformation and says it expects increased online political activity following the two closely-watched leaders debates. China, Russia and Iran remain the greatest threats to Canada’s election, according to the taskforce.Last week, Site officials said they had found an information operation linked to China on Chinese-language social media platform WeChat, the popular news account Youli-Youmian.“Foreign interference has been top of mind this election, with candidates bludgeoning each other on this issue. We monitor these platforms and our evaluation of that incident in particular doesn’t feel as though it had any material influence or consequence,” said Bridgman.“We don’t think one WeChat channel posting a couple times about Canadian politics articles consistent with their editorial line amounts to foreign interference.”Instead, researchers have focused their attention on a series of scams that appear to be a continuation of a trend replicated in other countries, in which ads showing “fake sensational political headlines” impersonate small business and personal accounts.View image in fullscreenA piece of fake political content on social media.Photograph: XBridgman cautioned that the broader risk of deepfakes comes when a population is uninformed. “If you’ve never heard about this person before, you cannot distinguish audio or video of them in compromising situations or making offensive remarks. And in the context of politics, we worry that with more unfamiliar candidates, the risk of convincing deep fakes escalates,” he said.Among posts examined by the team were seven deep fake videos falsely showing prime ministerMark Carneypromoting the fraudulent investment platforms featured directly in the ads. These deepfakes typically mimic broadcasts by the CBC or CTV, two of the top news outlets in Canada.In one of those, the headline reads “Mark Carney announces controversial retaliatory tariff plan in response to Trump’s devastating tariff hikes this week”. The article shows Carney meeting with a top CBC news anchor and includes a purported transcript of an interview, in which he promises to send money to Canadians if they register for what purports to be a newly formed government programme. The link, however, brings users to a cryptocurrency scam.In another, a page called Money Mindset, which uses the logo of the CBC/Radio-Canada, bought five French-language Facebook ads that were active from one to four hours between 4 and 9 April. One of the ads, featuring a deep fake video of Carney, cost US$300–$399 (about C$500) and received between five and six thousand impressions. In total, the five ads represent an investment of approximately C$1,000 and have received around 10,000 impressions.“These imposter ads, fake news articles, and deepfake videos can undermine the credibility of both the targeted party leaders featured in the content and the news brands and journalists whose names, logos, or visual designs are being impersonated,” the report said.A spokesperson forMetatold the Guardian it was “against our policies to run ads that try to scam or impersonate people or brands” adding the company encouraged people to report fraudulent content.“This is an ongoing industry-wide challenge – scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement. Our work in this area is never done, and we continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people on our platforms from scams.”‘We’re going to stand up to Trump,’ says Mark Carney in second Canadian election debateRead moreBut researchers say the response from tech companies “appears to have been inconsistent and insufficient for preventing these ads from spreading” – pointing to the proliferation of ads in recent days. The observatory also found that since many of these ads do not self-disclose as political, they often do not appear in the Meta’s ad library, which hampers the ability to assess the scope of the trend.“Imagine that on TV there’s an ad using clearly fraudulent content or is a deepfake. In what world would that be allowed? It would never get approved for use because of the advertising standards in this country,” said Bridgeman.“And yet, Facebook runs these ads that get hundreds of thousands of views across the country and it’s just a pure scam. In the midst of a federal election using an image of Carney and a fake CBC news website on a platform that bans the news – this feels like we’re kind of in like a Black Mirror kind of moment. And what worries me is that it feels like people are just okay with this.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMark CarneyMetanewsShareReuse this content"

They also debated on Wednesday night, in French, Canada’s other official language.Trump’s trade warand annexation threats have caused broad outrage across Canada and the Tory leader has faced criticism for directing his ire entirely at the Liberals instead of attacking Washington.Canada elections: who are the key players and what is at stake?Read moreAs the campaign has evolved, Poilievre has increasingly sought to do both: condemning Trump while accusing the Liberals of weakening the economy during Trudeau’s decade in power and leavingCanadavulnerable to hostile US policies.He continued that strategy at Thursday’s debate, charging the Liberals had given “Donald Trump and the US a near monopoly over our energy” by refusing to build pipelines that could allow Canadian oil to be exported abroad.Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has served in parliament for two decades, consistently tried to brand Carney as an extension of Trudeau, who became deeply unpopular toward the end of his tenure. “The question you have to ask is, after a decade of Liberal promises, can you afford food? Is your housing more affordable than it used to be?” Poilievre asked.“How can we possibly believe that you [Carney] are any different than the previous 10 years of Liberal government?” Poilievre further said, repeatedly saying that Carney had served as “Justin Trudeau’s economic adviser”.Trump effect leaves Canada’s Conservatives facing catastrophic lossRead moreAddressing the Conservative leader, Carney said: “I know you want to be running against Justin Trudeau. Justin Trudeau isn’t here.”Throughout the night, Carney tried to refocus attention on Trump.“The biggest risk we have to this economy is Donald Trump,” said the 60-year-old former central banker, who has never served in parliament or held a publicly elected office.Trump, he added, “is trying to break us so he can own us”.“We’re all going to stand up against Donald Trump. I’m ready.”Carney also took fire from the two other party leaders on stage, the head of the leftwing New Democratic party, Jagmeet Singh, and the leader of the Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois, Yves-Francois Blanchet.Both hit Carney over his years in the private sector, including with the major Canadian corporation Brookfield, questioning whether the Liberal leader would advocate for workers given his background.Carney spent the early part of his career as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs.Carney countered that his private sector experience would help him in government but rejected suggestions that his loyalties were divided.“I’m on the side of Canadians,” he said.On 6 January, the day Trudeau said he would resign, the Liberals trailed the Conservatives by 24 points, according to the public broadcaster CBC’s poll aggregator.On Thursday, the CBC data put Liberal support at 43.3% and gave the Conservatives 38% backing.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyJustin TrudeauAmericasTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, posted images of the meeting minutes before Van Hollen shared his post, saying: “Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody.”Who is Kilmar Ábrego García, the man wrongly deported to El Salvador?Read moreBukele continued mockingly: “Kilmar Ábrego García, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ and ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” The tweet ended with emojis of the US and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them.The meeting came in the hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison while he was trying to check on Ábrego García’s wellbeing and attempting to push for his release.The Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about 3km from the Terrorism Confinement Center, orCecot, even as they let other cars go on.“They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,” Van Hollen said.Donald Trumpand Bukele said this week that they have no basis to send Ábrego García back, even as the Trump administration has called his deportation a mistake and the US supreme court hascalled on the administrationto facilitate his return.Trump officials have said that Ábrego García, a Salvadorian citizen who was living inMaryland, has ties to the MS-13 gang, but his attorneys say the government has provided no evidence of that and Ábrego García has never been charged with any crime related to such activity.Van Hollen’s trip has become a partisan flashpoint in the US asDemocratshave seized on Ábrego García’s deportation as what they say is a cruel consequence of Trump’s disregard for the courts. Republicans have criticized Democrats for defending him and argued that his deportation is part of a larger effort to reduce crime.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt held a news conference on Wednesday with the mother of a Maryland woman who was killed by a fugitive from El Salvador in 2023.Van Hollen told reporters on Wednesday that he met with Vice-President Félix Ulloa, who said his government could not return Ábrego García to the United States.“So today, I tried again to make contact with Mr Ábrego García by driving to the Cecot prison,” Van Hollen said on Thursday.Van Hollen said Ábrego García has not had any contact with his family or his lawyers. “There has been no ability to find out anything about his health and wellbeing,” Van Hollen said. He said Ábrego García should be able to have contact with his lawyers under international law.“We won’t give up until Kilmar has his due process rights respected,” Van Hollen said. He said there would be “many more” lawmakers coming to El Salvador.New Jersey senator Cory Booker is also considering a trip to El Salvador, as are some House Democrats.While Van Hollen was denied entry, several House Republicans have visited the notorious gang prison in support of the Trump administration’s efforts. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, posted on Tuesday evening that he’d visited the prison where Ábrego García is being held. He did not mention Ábrego García but said the facility “houses the country’s most brutal criminals”.“I leave now even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our homeland,” Moore wrote on social media.US senator says El Salvador denied request to meet Kilmar Ábrego GarcíaRead moreMissouri Republican Jason Smith, the chair of the House ways and means committee, also visited the prison. He posted on X that “thanks to President Trump” the facility “now includes illegal immigrants who broke into our country and committed violent acts against Americans”.The fight over Ábrego García has also played out in contentious court filings, with repeated refusals from the government to tell a judge what it plans to do, if anything, to repatriate him.Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the US more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes – and placed them inside the country’s maximum-security gang prison just outside San Salvador. That prison is part of Bukele’s broader effort to crack down on the country’s powerful street gangs, which has put 84,000 people behind bars and made Bukele popular at home.Human rights groups have accused Bukele’s government of subjecting those jailed to “systematic use of torture and other mistreatment”. Officials there deny wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationMarylandDemocratsUS SenateUS CongressTrump administrationEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

It did not give details of why they had been added to the sanctions list.China says it is a neutral party to the conflict, although its leader, Xi Jinping, and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, are public allies, with a “no limits” partnership between their countries.Last week,two Chinese nationals were capturedin Ukraine fighting alongside Russian forces. At the time, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of trying to involve China “directly or indirectly” in the conflict.He said the men were amongat least 155 other Chinese membersof Russia’s armed forces, and accused Russia of conducting “systemic work” in Chinato recruit fighters, including through social media. He claimed Beijing was “turning a blind eye” to the recruitment.Beijing denied the accusations, suggesting the fighters were travelling to Russia independently and saying the government warned its citizens to stay away from all conflict zones.“I would like to reiterate that China is not the initiator of the Ukrainian crisis, nor is China a participating party,” Lin said last week. “We are a firm supporter and active promoter of a peaceful settlement of the crisis.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineChinaRussiaEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The US and China arelocked in a trade war.Trump tariffs will send global trade into reverse this year, warns WTORead moreThose proposals prompted a backlash from US domestic industries, which warned the port charges would increase prices for American consumers, and sent a wave of concern through the global shipping industry.The USTR said it would start charging port fees in 180 days, and they would rise incrementally over the coming years.Under the new rules, Chinese-linked ships will be charged fees linked to the weight of their cargo or the number of containers on board, rather than according to how many US ports they call at.The fees will be assessed up to five times a year, and can be waived if the owner places an order for a ship built in the US.“Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” said the US trade representative Jamieson Greer, announcing the new fees, most of which will begin in mid-October.“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships,” Greer added.Will Trump’s tariff chaos be China’s gain in global trade wars?Read moreThe proposed fees came as part of the USTR’s investigation intoChina“targeting the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance”, which was launched in April 2024 under the Biden administration.Chinese-built ships make up most of the fleets of the world’s 10 largest shipping carriers, while other east Asian countries including South Korea and Japan also dominate global shipbuilding.The US shipbuilding industry, which was dominant after the second world war, has declined over the years and now accounts for less than 1% of global output.Under the USTR’s plans, there will be separate fees charged on Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships, which will gradually increase in subsequent years.The fees for Chinese-built ships will begin at $18 per net ton (NT) or $120 per container, which could mean that a ship loaded with 15,000 containers would be charged $1.8m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shipping operators on these routes had expressed concern what the original port fee proposals would have meant for trade.The USTR’s original plans prompted significant criticism during hearings in Washington DC in late March, as shipping companies and trade groups said the fees would hurt US farm exports, increase consumer prices and put at risk the jobs of US dock-workers.Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order aimed atrevitalising the US shipbuilding industry, for both commercial and defence purposes, through increasing investment in the sector.Shipping companies and industry analysts forecast it would take years for the US to increase its shipbuilding capacity.Explore more on these topicsChinaUS foreign policyShipping industryTrump administrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

I was amazed.”What had caught his eye at his home in Sydney was a mantis shrimp – a crustacean with some of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and that (when it’s not dead in a bag of prawns) can strike prey so fast it can be akin to a bullet shooting from a gun.View image in fullscreenProf Shane Ahyong says he ‘was the kid that turned over every rock on the beach.’Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianThat chance encounter helped spark a career studying marine life – in particular, mantis shrimps and what he calls their “superpowers” of incredible speed and vision.And Ahyong’s latest discovery – a mantis shrimp so unusual it needed its own new genus – has now beennamed as one of the top 10 most remarkable discoveries of 2024by the World Register of Marine Species in a list that includes a worm that mimics coral, a carnivorous sponge and a sea star that lives on sunken wood.‘Definitely a new species’The story of the newly discovered chimera mantis shrimp –Incertasquilla chimera –started in 2008 when Japanese scientists found a specimen while undertaking marine life surveys off the Ningaloo coast in Western Australia.They sent it to Ahyong – by now becoming a world authority on mantis shrimps – who was working at New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and AtmosphericResearch.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“As soon as I saw it I thought: it’s definitely a new species – the form of the tail fan and the head – everything was unlike any species I had seen before,” said Ahyong, now the acting chief scientist at the Australian Museum in Sydney.Ahyong’s Japanese scientific colleagues later found the same mantis shrimp living off Iheya Island in Japan.There are several families of the shrimps but Ahyong couldn’t make this new find fit neatly into any of them – despite having discovered about 100 new species of mantis shrimp.“It had features that you could find in three families – it flummoxed me bit. It looked like a mashup of three different families.”Thenew speciesis about 9cm long – considered small to medium for mantis shrimps – with “gorgeous” stripes and fake eye-spots on its tail, both features to confuse would-be predators.Some mantis shrimp have blunt clubs as claws that they use to hammer through the shells of clams and snails.View image in fullscreenThe chimera mantis shrimp is equipped with a folding claw ‘like a flick knife’.Photograph: Hiroki NakajimaOthers, like the chimera, have appendages with spines they can flick outwards – unfolding them and striking in as little as four one thousandths of a second, at a speed of up to 8 metres per second, as they spear fast moving prey like small fish.“It unfolds the claw really quickly and it’s slammed into their prey – it’s like a flick knife. But the only way you can see it is with a super slow-motion camera,” said Ahyong.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each eye has binocular vision, meaning it can judge distances incredibly accurately, and each one can move independently of the other. They also see in a range of light spectra that humans can’t see.‘Ferraris of the crustacean world’A couple of years before the rogue mantis turned up in the bag of prawns, Ahyong’s interest in marine invertebrates was sparked with a birthday present from an aunt – a copy of the 1970 book Australian Crustaceans in Colour.“I was the kid that turned over every rock on the beach,” said Ahyong.By the age of 14, he had a mantis shrimp as a pet.View image in fullscreenAhyong is the chief scientist for the Australian Museum in Sydney.Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianHe still has one in a tank an aquarium at home but he hasn’t named it.His previous one lived for eight years and was called Lilly, after the wife of his mentor – the late Ray Manning, one of the curators at the Smithsonian Institution.“I never tire of seeing them,” says Ahyong.“Once they get used to you as a diver, they’ll come and touch your hand. But then if prey comes it’s back to work – no mercy.“They’ve a reputation for being a bit brutish. But I think they’re powerful with a great deal of grace and finesse.“They’re like the Ferrari of the crustacean world.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeWildlifeResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

They then forced the woman into the back seat of the SUV and drove away with her, police were told.The boy was treated for serious head injuries by attending paramedics from NSW Ambulance before being taken to hospital for further treatment.He underwent surgery this morning for serious head wounds and was in an induced coma in intensive care, police said, in what they described as a serious but stable condition.The woman’s other son, a 15-year-old who was also present at the time, was taken to hospital for assessment.Hart said the welfare and security of the two boys was “paramount”, and a detective was with them in hospital.He said police had made contact with their father, the victim’s husband, who police understood had been interstate for business at the time of the incident.Hart said on Friday morning the man was “on his way back to Sydney now to support his two children and to assist police with their inquiries”.The body in the car was “extremely burnt” and not able to visually identified, Hart said, so a postmortem and forensic examination would need to occur in order to formally identify the victim and determine the cause of death.The family was “not well known to police at all”, Hart said.“We don’t know if it’s organised crime. We don’t know if it’s gang related … [but] they are not known to police [such] that we would consider them a high target.”A crime scene was established in both the Bankstown and Beverly Hills locations and officers from Bankstown police area command commenced Strike Force Bushfield to investigate, with assistance from Campsie police and the state homicide squad.Hart said police had already spoken to “a number of witnesses”, and “implored” anyone with information to come forward.“Detectives will be working night and day to make sure we have every available evidence, but like I said, I need the community to help us out.”Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

But it isn’t clear whether theTrump administrationhasthreatened to give up on a Russia-Ukraine peace dealas a negotiating tactic or simply because it lacks the concentration for a complicated negotiation – a shortcoming that has dogged the administration’sforeign policythrough its first three months in office.Standing on a tarmac in Paris, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, issued a threat that the US could simply“move on”from mediating the biggest military conflict in Europe since the second world war. That would be the latest about-face for an administration that has already taken a back seat on negotiating a peace in Gaza and retreated on implementing worldwide tariffs that shook financial markets around the globe earlier this month.Diplomacy, it turns out, is hard.The 24 hours that Donald Trump promised he would need to halt the fighting in Ukrainehave long since passed. And the administration has done little of the hard diplomatic work that was required to secure landmark deals like the Dayton agreement or the Camp David accords in the past.US ready to abandon Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress, says Marco RubioRead moreThere have been plenty of meetings: Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has spoken three times with Vladimir Putin, during which he has listened to the Kremlin leader’s thoughts onUkrainefor hours, and Rubio was on the phone with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and met with Ukrainian officials and European leaders in Paris on Thursday.But there are few indications that new ground has been struck, that the US has exerted any pressure on the Kremlin or that the negotiations have identified what kinds of security guarantees would exist to ensure thatRussiawouldn’t simply continue the war when it sees fit. One element of a “Trump deal” appears to be this: that it doesn’t take very long or involve very much effort to achieve.“We’re not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,” Rubio said, noting that the US wanted to stop “thousands” of people from dying in the next year. “So if they’re serious about peace – either side, or both – we want to help. If it’s not going to happen, then we’re just going to move on. We’re going to move on to other topics that are equally if not more important in some ways to the United States.”Rubio clearly wished to vent frustration on Friday, a day after Trump had said in the White House that he was waiting for Russia’s response to the proposed framework for a peace deal and expected to have it this week. The White House appears to be increasingly frustrated with Moscow, something that both European and Ukrainian officials had hoped would take place.But if Trump walks away from a deal and the war altogether, the decision will still play into Putin’s hands – relieving Ukraine of a key ally and financial backer in its fight against Russia. Moscow appears to see the situation as a win-win: either taking a favourable deal with the White House or waiting for Trump to lose patience. Which he is now threatening to do.There are more hopeful voices in the administration. JD Vance, the Ukraine-sceptic vice-president, told Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday that he felt “optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close”. There had been “some things … even in the past 24 hours” that he said could indicate a chance to secure a ceasefire.But to listen to Rubio or Witkoff, the various sides have barely moved from their opening positions. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the United States had offered Russia some sanctions relief in exchange for a deal – something that Rubio had offered as far back as his confirmation hearings in January. And Witkoff appeared surprised on Fox News that Russia wanted “so much more” than just a ceasefire. “I mean, it’s just a lot of detail attached to it,” he said. “It’s a complicated situation from, you know – rooted in some real problematic things happening between the two countries.”There was always an expertise gap in the difficult negotiations over a ceasefire to the Russian war in Ukraine. Now the administration appears to have a patience gap and has signaled it is ready to walk away. Ukraine does not have that option.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMarco RubioEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Her brother, Thaeb Suliman, 23, was hospitalised in Ponticelli with severe injuries.The hospital said on Friday morning that he remained “stable in the seriousness” of his injuries and would undergo further tests.The fourth person who died was the cable car operator, named locally as Carmine Parlato.The cable car service operated two cabins. The one that crashed had been travelling up the mountain, while 16 people were helped out of the cabin that had been making its way down and stopped in mid-air close to the foot of the peak.They were evacuated one by one, using harnesses, footage on RAI public television and other media showed.Locator mapItalian media reported that one of the cables supporting the cabin had snapped. The cable car service, which had opened for the spring and summer season 10 days previously, underwent a maintenance check a week ago, according to reports on Friday.“The cabin at the top has crashed,” Umberto De Gregorio, the chair of EAV, the public transport company that runs the cable car service, wrote on Facebook, calling it “a tragedy”.Vincenzo De Luca, the head of the Campania region around Naples, told RAI that rescue operations were hampered by fog and strong winds, which on Thursday had reached 60mph (100km/h).People heard a loud bang before the cable car fell, according to reports.“There was a truly severe weather situation, therefore I can imagine what could have happened at 1,500 metres above sea level,” De Luca said. “But, I repeat, technical checks must be done with the utmost rigour.”The last deadly cable car crash in Italy was in 2021, when 14 people were killed when a cable car linking the resort town of Stresa and the Mottarone mountain in the Piedmont region plummeted into the woods near Lake Maggiore.Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister, was informed of Thursday’s crash during a summit in Washington with the US president, Donald Trump. She expressed her “deepest condolences” to the families of those killed and injured.The Faito cable car service was launched in 1952.

The images frequently depict men of colour, often armed with knives, attacking women or police officers.Antonio Nicita, a PD senator, said: “In the images published by Salvini’s party and generated by AI there are almost all categories of hate speech, from racism and xenophobia to Islamophobia.“They are using AI to target specific categories of people – immigrants, Arabs – who are portrayed as potential criminals, thieves and rapists.“These images are not only violent but also deceptive: by blurring the faces of the victims it is as if they want to protect the identity of the person attacked, misleading users into believing the photo is real. These are images that incite hatred.”“This is serious,” said Francesco Emilio Borrelli, an MP for the Greens and Left Alliance. “AI generates content based on our instructions, and in this case it was clearly instructed to generate images of black people robbing an elderly woman or a frightened woman. It is part of their strategy to create fear among citizens.”A spokesperson for Salvini’s party confirmed that “some of the pictures” featured on their social media channels had been “generated digitally”.In a statement it said: “The point is not the image. The point is the fact. Each post is based on true reports from Italian newspapers, with names, dates and places.“If reality seems too harsh, do not blame those who report it, but those who make it so. If it is about a crime, it is hard to accompany the news with cheerful or reassuring images.”View image in fullscreenA spokesperson for the League party, which is led by Matteo Salvini (pictured), said ‘some of the pictures’ had been ‘generated digitally’.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPASalvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, said the League pictures bore “all the hallmarks of artificial intelligence”.“They are out‑of‑context photos in which the subject is in the foreground and the rest is entirely blurred. What worries me is that these AI‑generated images are becoming ever more realistic.”The complaint to Agcom cites several examples of images thought to have been digitally generated, saying they have appeared alongside the branding of reputable mainstream media outlets which have reported on the crimes mentioned but not used images of the alleged perpetrators.In one case, the League’s post says: “A foreigner attacks the train conductor” and pairs the text with an image of a man of colour with his fist raised.Theoriginal headline in Il Resto del Carlinoreads: “He attacks the [female] train conductor and sparks panic on board.” The article makes no mention of the suspect’s nationality beyond calling him a “foreigner”. There was no photograph of the alleged attack.Another image featured in the complaint shows a mother and father in Islamic dress appearing to shout angrily at a girl, “thus feeding racial and Islamophobic prejudice”.Il Giorno, the newspaper that is cited, makes no reference in its report to the religion of either the family or the girl allegedly abused by her parents, beyond saying the child had attended Arabic language school. There was no photograph of the family.The use of AI‑generated images forpropaganda by far‑right parties is a growing phenomenonthat entered the mainstream around last year’s European elections, when images designed to stoke fears over immigration or demonise leaders such as Emmanuel Macron began circulating on social media.“Then came the American elections withDonald Trump and Elon Musk, who effectively normalised this trend,” said Romano.“Today we see that far‑right parties have not only continued to generate fake images for propaganda but have also increased their use at a time when AI tools have improved content quality, making the phenomenon all the more worrying.”Despite social platforms being obliged to take steps to anticipate these risks – for example by adding a label specifying that an image has been generated by AI – Romano says that, in practice, this mechanism is almost always ineffective.Asked if the League was aware that the images could generate hate speech, a spokesperson for Salvini’s party said: “We are sorry, but our solidarity goes to the victims, not the perpetrators.“If denouncing crimes committed by foreigners means ‘xenophobia’, perhaps the problem is not the word but those who use it to censor debate. We will continue to denounce, with strong words and images, what others prefer to ignore.’’If Agcom deems the flagged content offensive it can, under the EU’s Digital Services Act, order posts to be taken down, accounts to be removed and social media platforms to be fined for failing to police user behaviour.In 2023,Agcom fined Meta€5.85m (£5m) and ordered the removal of dozens of accounts for breaching the ban on gambling advertising.Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, was approached for comment. A spokesperson for X said: “We are not under any obligation legally to label every AI-generated image. It’s pretty clear these posts are straightforward politicking.“Rest assured, we believe that it is critical to maintain the authenticity of the conversation on X, and we make sure that we are well equipped to fight against any manipulated media – including the rising trend of ‘deepfakes’ – and put visible labels on any such content that has been debunked by a credible source.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ItalyThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Nightclubs are shut, and cinemas are restricted in the type of films they can screen, although rules differ between the 16 federal states.Germany’s state criminal police have said they will be out in force at scene hotspots, including retail car parks, alpine tunnels (favoured as they amplify the sound of car motors) and iconic racing tracks such as the Nürburgring in the mountainous Eifel region in western Germany.Enthusiasts, who often gather from acrossEurope, also typically seek out long stretches of straight public roads for races that they illegally block, and sometimes the many sections of Germany’sautobahnwhere there is no speed limit.In statements to German media, the police said they would seek to clamp down on unauthorised tuning, illegal races and noise and emissions pollution, including that caused by so-called ‘burn-outs’, in which cars are held still with the handbrake on, the wheels spun so fast that the tyres smoke.Those in contravention of the law could face high fines, punitive points on their driving licences as well as the revocation of licences and confiscation of their vehicles, police said.Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the country’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia in western Germany, where 3,000 traffic violations were reported and about 4,000 fines issued last Good Friday, said targeted controls would aim to pull over vehicles considered unfit to be driven. This included cars rebuilt for lowriding, the Mexican-American subculture of cruising as close to the surface of the road as possible.“I have nothing against lowered cars, as long as they are roadworthy,” Reul said. “However, it is important that all road users arrive home safely.”The car-tuning scene began in the US in the 1990s, spurred on by cult films such as 2001’sThe Fast and the Furious and its many sequels, and is celebrated in everything from video games to toy lines.According to the publication Motor Trend, it has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, “becoming a cornerstone of today’s automotive passions”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “But hopefully we won’t have to do that.”Trump declined to give a “specific number of days” for when the US would stop trying to negotiate a truce. “But quickly. We want to get it done.”Asked whether he was being “played” by Putin, Trump said: “Nobody’s playing me, I’m trying to help.”Trump’s comments came after the US secretary of state,Marco Rubiosaid the US was ready to abandon its efforts “within days.Speaking in Paris on Friday after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said Trump was still interested in a deal. But he added that the US president had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress.“It is not our war. We didn’t start it,” Rubio said, adding that if a deal were not possible – with both sides still far apart – the US president was “probably at a point where he’s going to say, well, we’re done”. Trump felt “very strongly” about this, he said.Rubio’s comments were the clearest signal yet that the White House is ready to walk away from its diplomatic attempts to negotiate an end to the war. It was unclear if this would also mean an end to US military assistance to Kyiv. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that deliveries had already “practically stopped”.0:40Trump says US will ‘take a pass’ on Ukraine peace deal ‘if parties make it difficult’ – videoLast month Zelenskyy agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin, however, has rejected the plan. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that ending the war was “not a simple topic”. Moscow was seeking a settlement that “ensured its own interests”, he added.In recent weeks Russia has launched a fresh military push across the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and stepped up its air attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. On Sunday itbombed the city of Sumy, killing 35 people and injuring 117.Since Trump returned to the White House in January he haspiled pressure on Ukraine, stopping most US military assistance and temporarily cutting off intelligence sharing. This week he falsely blamed Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war.In contrast, Trump has refused to criticise the Russian president or to impose sanctions on or punish Moscow. Senior US officials – including thespecial envoy Steve Witkoff, who held talks last week with Putin in St Petersburg – have instead parroted Kremlin talking points.According to Bloomberg, the latest US peace plan presented on Thursday to European leaders would in effect freeze the war along the existing frontline.Russiawould keep the territory it occupies, while Kyiv would not be allowed to join Nato.Talks are due to continue in London next week. US officials conceded that the proposal would be irrelevant if the Kremlin did not agree to stop the fighting, and said security guarantees were essential for Ukraine if the deal were to work, Bloomberg reported.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio (right) with Steve Witkoff at the Paris talks.Photograph: Tschaen Eric/Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockThe US vice-president, JD Vance, speaking in Rome after a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said he was optimistic “the very brutal war” could be stopped. “Even in the past 24 hours, we think we have some interesting things to report on,” he said.Meanwhile, significant details of the minerals deal remain unclear, including whether Kyiv has agreed to a White House demand that it “pays back” the cost of earlier military assistance.Zelenskyy was poised in February to sign a framework agreement over a wide-ranging economic partnership. It was derailed after his disastrous encounter with Trump and Vance in the Oval Office.Since then negotiations have continued. Overnight, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yuliia Svyrydenko, said a memorandum had been finalised. It paved the way for the setting up of an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, she indicated.“We are happy to announce the signing with our American partners,” she said. Speaking to reporters in the White House, Trump said a deal could be signed next Thursday.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, added: “We’re still working on the details.” He said the latest version ran to 80 pages and was “substantially what we’d agree on previously”. “That’s what we will be signing,” he said.According to the latest draft, seen by the Guardian, Ukraine acknowledges the “significant material and financial support” Kyiv has received from the US since Russia’s 2022 invasion and the desire from both countries for a “lasting peace”.It says Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, will visit Washington next week to hold final “technical talks” with Bessent. They are expected to complete discussions on a “reconstruction investment fund”, the memo adds.The deal would need to be ratified by Ukraine’s parliament, Ukraine’s deputy minister of economy said on Friday.Ukraine war briefing: China arming Russia and building weapons on its soil, says ZelenskyyRead moreZelenskyy is keen to improve relations with the Trump administration. At the same time, he hasso far rejected the White House’s demandthat revenue from the new joint fund is used to cover the cost of weapons deliveries provided by the Biden administration.Trump has previously said Ukraine “owes” the US $300bn (£226bn). Zelenskyy has pointed out this assistance was given as a grant, not as a loan, with Republicans and Democrats approving it in Congress. Any future partnership has to be based on “parity”, and should benefit both countries, he says.The deal may help US weapons manufacturers, who are facinga critical shortfall of key rare-earth mineralsimported from China. Beijing has restricted its export in response to Trump’s escalating trade war.Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy thinktank in Kyiv, said the deal had gone through “multiple iterations”. He added: “It’s hard to say what’s inside.”Landa said he did not expect Kyiv to accept that previous “non-refundable military aid” was now “debt”. “That’s not only unfair and unrealistic, but may also negatively affect the full global financial system,” he said.He continued: “If it suddenly turns out that countries and organisations can demand payments for aid given unconditionally in previous years, it will make recipients more cautious, and could reopen difficult issues from previous decades around the world.”The latest negotiations came as Russia killedone person and injured about 70 in a ballistic missile strike on a residential area of the city of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine. Five of the injured were children. There were also strikes on Dnipro, Kyiv and Mykolaiv, as well as the Donetsk region.“This is how Russia began this Good Friday – with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shaheds – maiming our people and cities,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the Russians used ballistic missiles equipped with cluster munitions. “That is why the affected areas are so extensive,” he said. At least 20 blocks of flats, 30 houses and an educational institution were damaged.On Palm Sunday Russiadropped two Iskander missiles in the city centre of Sumy. One of them hit a congress centre. The other exploded between two university buildings and next to a crowded bus and cars.Explore more on these topicsUkraineMarco RubioRussiaUS foreign policyUS politicsTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,” a man who said he worked at the port told al-Masirah.Ras Isa terminal has a storage capacity of 3m barrels and was the first port built for oil exports from Yemen, about 40 years ago.A Nasa satellite system that monitors fires picked up an intense blaze early on Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island.In a statement posted on social media, US Central Command said: “US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorise the entire region for over 10 years.“This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully.”The US has vowed to keep attacking Yemen’s Houthis, in its biggest military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January, unless the Houthis cease attacks on Red Sea shipping.Asked for comment on the Houthis’ casualty figure and its own estimate, US Central Command said it had none beyond the initial announcement of the attacks.Iran called the US strikes “barbaric”, while the Palestinian militants Hamas denounced them as “blatant aggression”.The latest US campaign was triggered by Houthi threats to resume attacks on international shipping in protest at Israel’s blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip.The Houthis have launched dozens of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were targeting ships linked to Israel in protest over the war in Gaza.Early on Friday, hours after the US attack, Israel’s military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.Recent expert analysis for the Atlantic Council was dubious about the practicality of US war aims in Yemen. “The United States’ ability to track [Abdel Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis’ leader] is likelyhindered by limited intelligenceon the ground in Yemen. This reality was echoed early last year when the US had difficulty assessing the success of its operations and the group’s full arsenal due to a lack of intelligence,” it said.“Without a reliable presence or informant network, targeting such a well-hidden leader will prove challenging.”The Trump administration’s clumsy handling of the enlarged US campaign against the Houthis was already mired in controversy before Friday’s large death toll, afterdetails of the initial attack planwere discussed by senior Trump officials on an unsecured chat service to which a journalist had been invited to join.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

As she spent the past 18 months of war documenting airstrikes, the demolition of her home, the endless displacement and the killing of 11 family members, all she demanded was that she not be allowed to go quietly.“If I die, I want a loud death,” Hassouna wrote on social media. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time, and a timeless image that cannot be buried by time or place.”On Wednesday, just days before her wedding, 25-year-old Hassouna was killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit her home in northern Gaza. Ten members of her family, including her pregnant sister, were also killed.The Israeli military said it had been a targeted strike on a Hamas member involved in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.‘In Gaza, a press vest makes you a target’: the journalists who have paid a price for reporting on the warRead moreTwenty-four hours before she was killed, it was announced that a documentary focusing on Hassouna’s life in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began would be debuted at a French independent film festival that runs parallel to Cannes.Made by the Iranian director Sepideh Farsi, the film, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, tells the story of Gaza’s ordeal and the daily life of Palestinians through filmed video conversations between Hassouna and Farsi. As Farsi described it, Hassouna became “my eyes in Gaza … fiery and full of life. I filmed her laughs, her tears, her hopes and her depression”.“She was such a light, so talented. When you see the film you’ll understand,” Farsi told Deadline. “I had talked to her a few hours before to tell her that the film was in Cannes and to invite her.”She said she had lived in fear for Hassouna’s life but added: “I told myself I had no right to fear for her, if she herself was not afraid. I clung to her strength, to her unwavering faith.”Farsi, who lives in exile in France, said she feared that Hassouna had been targeted for her much-followed work as a photojournalist and recently publicised participation in the documentary. Gaza has been the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history, with more than 170 killed since 2023, though some estimates put it as high as 206.Since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza, after the attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, more than 51,000 people have been killed, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Since the ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March, Israel has resumed its deadly airstrikes with vigour, and at least 30 people were killed in strikes on Friday.Fellow journalists in Gaza reacted with grief and anger at the news that an Israeli airstrike had taken Hassouna from them, just as she had feared it would. “She documented massacres through her lens, amid bombardment and gunfire, capturing the people’s pain and screams in her photographs,” said Anas al-Shareef, an Al Jazeera reporter based in Gaza.Miqdad Jameel, another Gaza-based journalist, called on people to “see her photos, read her words – witness Gaza’s life, the struggle of its children in war, through her images and her lens”.Her death prompted a statement from the Cannes Acid film festival, where Farsi’s documentary will be screened in May. “We had watched and programmed a film in which this young woman’s life force seemed like a miracle,” they said. “Her smile was as magical as her tenacity. Bearing witness, photographing Gaza, distributing food despite the bombs, mourning and hunger. We heard her story, rejoiced at each of her appearances to see her alive, we feared for her.”Haidar al-Ghazali, a Palestinian poet in Gaza, saidin a post on Instagramthat before she was killed, Hassouna had asked him to write a poem for her when she died.Speaking of her arrival into a kinder afterlife, it read: “Today’s sun won’t bring harm. The plants in the pots will arrange themselves for a gentle visitor. It will be bright enough to help mothers to dry their laundry quickly, and cool enough for the children to play all day. Today’s sun will not be harsh on anyone.”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesJournalist safetyIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Hayya said it was their “natural right” to possess weapons.In a video statement, Hayya said that Hamas was no longer willing to accept “partial agreements as a cover for their political agenda, which is based on continuing the war of extermination and starvation”.He said that Hamas was ready to agree to a “comprehensive package” that ensured the release of all the hostages, in return for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. A key condition, he added, was that Israel “must completely end the war against our people and fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip”.This week, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, had made it clear that Israeli troops intended to remain in “security buffer zones” it had established in Gaza since the ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March.No plans to allow any aid into Gaza, says Israeli ministerRead moreIn recent weeks, Israeli troops have taken control of about 30% of Gaza, including parts of Rafah. More than 1,600 people in Gaza have been killed since the ceasefire collapsed, with 15 people, including 10 people from the same family, killed in airstrikes overnight.After Hamas’s rejection of the deal, Netanyahu’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said it was time to “open the gates of hell” on Gaza. Earlier this week, Katz had pledged to escalate the conflict with “tremendous force” if Hamas did not return the hostages.Attempts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the ceasefire and bring home the hostages have hit major stumbling blocks, and no progress was made in the latest round of talks in Cairo this week, according to officials.Aid supplies including food, water and fuel have been blocked from entering Gaza since 2 March. Hamas has accused Israel of using mass starvation as a weapon, which they say is a war crime.There are also fears for the lives of the remaining living hostages as Israel continues its airstrikes on Gaza. This week, a spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing said it had lost contact with the group holding the Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander after a “direct strike” on his location.The White House criticised Hamas for its rejection of the deal offered by Israel.“Hamas’s comments demonstrate they are not interested in peace but perpetual violence,” said the US national security council spokesperson James Hewitt. “The terms made by the Trump administration have not changed: release the hostages or face hell.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Heads bowed over candles, and escorted by people bearing aloft large gold crosses, they made their way to a platform at the heart of the ancient square.The ceremony on Holy Thursday, in which the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem washes the feet of 12 monastic priests to commemorate the Last Supper, is one of manyEasterrituals that have taken place in the Old City of Jerusalem for hundreds of years. For Christians, there is no holier place to commemorate Easter than here, the site where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified, buried and resurrected.Yet the crowd that assembled outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday morning was small and muted. International pilgrims jostled with dark-robed Greek Orthodox monks, but one group of native worshippers was noticeably absent.For generations, the tens of thousands of Palestinian Christians living in Israeli-occupied West Bank villages and cities such as Ramallah, Bethlehem and Taybeh would travel to Jerusalem’s Old City at Easter to take part in the prayers, processions and rituals such as the Holy Fire ceremony. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself is in East Jerusalem, which was captured byIsraelfrom Jordan in the six-day war of 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1980.View image in fullscreenA Greek Orthodox cleric during the Washing of the Feet ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersYet centuries of tradition have been ruptured by Israel’s increasingly draconian control over Palestinian movement – which means any Palestinian in the West Bank living outside Jerusalem, must obtain a military permit if they want to enter the city. For years, Christians inPalestinian territorieswere regularly granted permits to visit Jerusalem around Easter but since the war with Hamas broke out on 7 October 2023, they have become almost impossible to obtain.This Easter, the government announced it had issued 6,000 permits, though there are 50,000 Christians – mostly Catholic or Greek Orthodox – living in the West Bank beyond East Jerusalem. However, in reality, just 4,000 were given, according to Christian leaders, and often only to a few members of each family who applied.These permits are valid for just one week and do not allow the Palestinian pilgrims to stay in Jerusalem overnight, meaning they have to make the gruelling journey back to the West Bank by bus or taxi – crossing a multitude of army checkpoints – every evening, limiting the festivities they can take part in. A group from the village of Taybeh said the Israeli military still did not allow them to cross over to Jerusalem for Palm Sunday even though they had valid permits.The few who do make it to the Old City have been met with increased police brutality in recent years. In April 2023, Palestinian Christian worshipers and international pilgrims were beaten by Israeli police and armed forces as they attempted to reach the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.“People are very afraid and many will not risk attending the Easter processions any more,” said Omar Haramy, who runs Sabeel, a Christian organisation based in Jerusalem. He said several staff were beaten last year as they tried to attend Easter festivities in the Old City, and Christians in the Old City regularly faced hostility outside churches or as they went about their daily lives.One of the greatest sources of distress among the Christian community is the introduction of blockades and aggressive policing that prevented thousands of Christians being able to take part in the Holy Fire festivities that mark the resurrection on Easter Saturday afternoon, as they have done for hundreds of years in the Old City.View image in fullscreenThe sun shines through the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition has it that Christ was crucified, buried and resurrected.Photograph: Debbie Hill/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockWhile the restrictions have been justified in the name of safety, many Christians view them as another way for the Israeli state to exert dominance over the community.“I will go to the celebrations on Holy Saturday because my family has been part of this tradition for thousands of years, but I’m not going to bring my kids, it’s too dangerous now, with the police violence,” Haramy said.The spectre of Gaza also hangs over this year’s Easter festivities. Palestinian Christians are among the 51,000 people killed in Gaza since the war with Israel began and on Palm Sunday, an Israeli missilehit the only Christian-run hospitalin the strip. There are about 500 Christians are sheltering in Holy Family church, one of only two left standing. Those contacted by the Guardian said they were too afraid to talk, fearful of anything that might make them a target of Israeli airstrikes.For all its biblical significance and abundance of churches, convents and monasteries, Jerusalem’s Old City has become increasingly dangerous for all Christians, not just those from Arab backgrounds. Since the rise of Jewish ultranationalism in Israel, and the election of the most far-right government in the country’s history, extremist and settler Jewish movements – who want to claim all of Israel and Palestinian-controlled territories as a state only for Jews – have been emboldened in their actions against both Christians and Muslims.Historically, the relationship between Christians and Jews has been fraught, because of the Christian church’s historic role in antisemitism and the persecution of Jews. The ongoing presence of proselytising evangelical Christians, many from the US, who travel to Israel with the sole purpose of converting Jews, has also been inflammatory, particularly among the Jewish Orthodox community.But religious intolerance and antichristian sentiment has been made mainstream by Israeli political leadership – the ultra-hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, described Israelis spitting on Christians as “an old Jewish tradition” – and old suspicions have escalated into brazen, all-out violence. There have also been growing incidences of settler groups attempting to seize Christian land in Jerusalem. In 2023, the Holy Land Roman Catholic patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa accused the government of establishing a “cultural and political atmosphere that can justify, or tolerate, actions against Christians”.A recent report by the Rossing Center for Education and Dialogue documented the steep rise in the scale and severity of attacks on Christians in Jerusalem and across Israel in 2024, ranging from spitting at priests and public hate speech to the desecration of graves, arson attacks and vandalising of churches.“It’s usually young Israeli Jewish men who are conducting these attacks with impunity. They face very little punishment, if the police get involved at all,” said John Munayer, the director of international engagement at the Rossing Center.“It’s a clear attempt by hardcore settler Zionists to Judaise the Old City of Jersualem and trying to make it unbearable for Christians who have been there for centuries.”As he attended the Easter prayer ceremony on Thursday, Father Nikon Golovko, the deputy head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, said he had “really seen things change for the worse for Christians in the past nine years”.View image in fullscreenCatholic clerics during the Washing of the Feet procession at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Thursday.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APHe said: “We receive a lot more hostility and even aggression from the Jewish community. They spit on priests, even when we are walking through the Christian quarter. It sends a message that the city belongs not to all communities but only to the Jews. It was not like this before.”After an incident in which Orthodox Jews were caught on video spitting at Christians, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Israel was “totally committed to safeguard the sacred right of worship and pilgrimage to the holy sites of all faiths”.Xavier Abu Eid, a Palestinian Christian political analyst and the author of Rooted in Palestine: Palestinian Christians and the Struggle for National Liberation 1917-2004, said that despite the mounting harassment they faced, the diminishing numbers of Christians left in the West Bank and the unrelenting horrors of the war in Gaza, he still viewed Easter as a time of hope and “the timely message that life defeats death”.“As Palestinian Christians, we know that this generation will either make it or break it,” said Abu Eid.“So making clear to the Israeli occupation that we are going to stay, that we will celebrate the same religious events that we’ve been celebrating for centuries is both a national mandate and a religious mission that we have. Keeping our Christian traditions alive, praying – they have become an act of resistance.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesChristianityEasterIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It did not acknowledge any casualties.US bombing of Yemen compounding dire humanitarian situation – rights groupsRead moreThe Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack, showing corpses strewn across the site. It claimed paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.On 9 April, the US state department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen. “The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,” it said.An Associated Press review found the new US operation against the Houthis under Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former president Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.The US campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

At the heart of her visit, though, will be talks with the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, whom British officials regard as one of their most likely allies in negotiating a deal.With Donald Trumptalking aboutcoming to the UK for a state visit in September, officials are increasingly hopeful they can agree tariff reductions in the coming months or even weeks.The US president and Keir Starmer spoke to each other by phone on Friday afternoon, with trade top of the agenda. It was the first time the two leaders had spoken since Trump made his tariff announcement.Downing Street said they discussed “the ongoing and productive discussions between the UK and US on trade”. A spokesperson said: “The prime minister reiterated his commitment to free and open trade and the importance of protecting the national interest.” One source said the call lasted 35 minutes.A senior government source had said earlier that Reeves would “make the argument for a trade relationship that is deeper and more open that the one on the table at the moment”.The chancellor said earlier this week that “active negotiations” were ongoing. “Any deal that’s able to be secured will always have front and centre British national interest,” she said.Ministers have put a trade deal at the top of their list of priorities for US-UK relations. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said a full-blown global trade warcould wipe 1%off gross domestic product in 2026-27.UK officials are pessimistic about their chances of persuading Trump to give them an exemption from his 10% global tariff, but they hope to be able to agree reductions to the 25% rates being promised on certain items.British officials have presented a draft deal to their US counterparts that includes reductions to tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Sources say it does not cover pharmaceuticals, however. Trump has said he will announce tariffs for the sector “very shortly” that could cost British drug companies billions of pounds in revenue.Pharmaceuticals are the UK’s second-biggest export to the US at about £7bn, after cars which account for about £8bn.In return, the UK has offered to reduce the headline rate of its digital services tax, which is currently paid by a small number of US technology companies.1:51Starmer says he will act in UK's national interest over Trump's tariffs – videoSources said the proposed agreement was relatively narrow in nature but that a broader trade deal could be still be worked on afterwards. A more wide-ranging trade agreement would face political difficulties, however, such as UK resistance to importing chlorinated chicken and other meat, and the US desire to sell goods and services to the NHS.Trump and his key officials have given positive signals in recent days about the chance of getting a deal signed soon. Some reportssuggest US officials hope to have it completed in as soon as three weeks’ time.Trump’s press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, said on Wednesday that the US would be announcing its first deals “very soon”, and the vice-president, JD Vance, saidon Thursday: “There’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.”Trump said on Thursday night that he was expecting to travel to the UK in September for a second state visit, calling the prospect “beautiful”.One British official said: “They have the outline agreement, we presented it to them before the tariff announcement. The ball is in their court. The only question is: do they want to do a deal or not?”Reeves’ meeting with Bessent, who is not one of the tariff hardliners in theTrump administration, will cover the trade deal as well as wider questions about the global economy.The Guardian view on a UK-US trade deal: MPs must get a vote on any agreement with Trump | EditorialRead moreA government source said Reeves would not be negotiating directly with Bessent but would present an argument “making clear our overarching view on free trade”, underlining the UK’s key priorities of steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.Bessent has prioritised the UK along with countries such as Japan, Australia, South Korea and India in the 90-day pause on higher tariffs, but ge told Yahoo Finance this week that not all trade deals were likely to be completed within the window.During her US trip, Reeves will also take part in a panel hosted by the IMF in which she will argue for more free and open trade and reform of international financial institutions to take account of the new global economic realities.The source said Reeves would say that countries and institutions must recognise that change has happened, and that bodies such as the IMF, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank need to adapt.The chancellor will also meet business leaders as she hopes to drum up investment opportunities for the UK, pitching it as a safe haven in a tumultuous economic world. She will have discussions with finance leaders from Europe and India as Britain tries to improve its trading relationships with partners outside the US.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyRachel ReevesEconomic policyTrump tariffsUS foreign policyTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are confident that the disgust at Donald Trump is just as strong across the country.”View image in fullscreenAnti-racism campaigners at a Together Against Trump march to Parliament Square during he US president’s state visit in 2019Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/ShutterstockProtesters plan to dust off a blimp of Trump dressed in a nappy that was the focal point of previous anti-Trump protests, but also replace it with a larger version.Gardner said: “The blimp will be there or something even bigger and better. The blimp itself still exists, but we are thinking we want to take the next step and do something even more exciting.”The coalition is hoping theLondonmayor will again grant permission for anti-Trump blimps to fly over the capital.Gardner said: “Last time Sadiq Khan gave us permission to fly it. He will probably do so again, but we will have to get various permission from the GLA and the police. It might be different from last time but we are confident that a lot of people will want to come out on to the streets and show their disgust.”The demonstrations will be a test for the police even with tougher laws available tocrack down on protests and activism.Gardner said: “We want it to be a defiant but joyful celebration of all the things that Trump hates, such as the rights of LGBTQ people, the rights of women, the rights of migrants and refugees, union power and workers’ rights. It will celebrate every marginalised group in society.”The demonstrators will also target the tech and business leaders that have backed Trump. Gardner said: “If we had one strapline it would be‘Stop Trump and fight the oligarchy’. We are against empowering the super-rich, including treating Gaza like real estate and chumming up to Putin and the tech billionaires who are looking to the UK for tax breaks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other Green party politicians have been accused of showing hypocrisy by calling for more clean energy whileopposing solar farmsand electricity pylons in their local areas.Duddridge told the Guardian: “I am trying not to think about having to move away from the house. I love the neighbours and my four children are settled. But the reality is, once a section 21 notice has been served, there is not much I can do about it.”ALabourspokesperson said: “This is yet more rank hypocrisy from the Green party. Threatening to evict a tenant via no-fault eviction while standing on a platform to abolish section 21 simply beggars belief. Time and again they pledge one thing and do another.”A Green party spokesperson said: “We understand that Mr Pedley served the section 21 eviction notice almost a year ago. The order was served because his personal circumstances meant he required the premises for his own use.”Section 21 notices allow landlords to take back control of their properties with two months’ notice without the tenant being at fault. Labour is planning to abolish such evictions as part of itsrenters’ rights bill, which has passed the Commons and is due to be debated in the Lords.The Greens have also backed an end to no-fault evictions. In itsfair deal for renters, the party argues that ending the practice will mean tenants “don’t have their lives turned upside down on the whim of their landlords”.Carla Denyer, a co-leader of the Greens,previously tweeted: “The immediate ban on section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions is very welcome and will help protect over 10 million renters from risk of eviction.”Duddridge said Pedley had first tried to evict her and her family in 2016, but had rescinded the notice three weeks later.Last March, he issued a new section 21 notice, giving her two months to vacate the house. Duddridge has not yet moved, prompting a legal letter last August warning her to leave after 12 October.Duddridge says she plans to remain in the property until bailiffs attend as she has been advised that doing so will make her more likely to qualify for council housing.“Running in this election has been my sanctuary from the stress of the potential move,” she said. “So I couldn’t believe it when I saw my landlord had also entered the race.”Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Green partyNorthamptonshireLabourLocal governmentEnglandRenting propertynewsShareReuse this content"

He said that he was sleep-deprived on the US domestic flight when he was approached by a fan who wrote a “lovely note”, praising his Netflix documentary that detailed his struggles with fame.“I explained I’d been up since 4.30am, had two hours’ sleep, and wrangled four kids through the airport. I’ve got bags under my eyes and I’m dealing with anxiety,” he said. “I explained that if they came and took a photo with me, my anxiety would spike – because then the whole cabin would start wondering who I am.”More requests came, with another passenger sending him a note, and another making him feel “obliged” after walking up to him and asking outright for a photo, Williams said.He said: “Every interaction – with strangers or even people I know well – fills me with discomfort. I mask it well. But social interaction still frightens me. So much so, I didn’t go out for years. And I had to do it without drugs or drink.“I used to find it impossible. Now I’m … OK-ish. But still crawling inside. Every time a stranger approaches – and they are strangers – I panic.”Williams said this was “dodgy terrain for a famous person to give context around”, as he felt there was an “unspoken law: as a celebrity, you should be accessible 24/7”.He added that celebrities were expected to “greet all strangers like you’re the mayor of the best town anyone’s ever visited” and “make sure their wishes are met, whatever they are”, but some people were “fans of fame, not necessarily of me”.“Now listen – if we cross paths in the wild and you are a fan of me, I want you to tell me,” Williams said. “That means a lot. I’ll make time. I’ve got gratitude for that. It warms my heart when I feel I’ve warmed yours.”He urged fans to give celebrities the “dignity of their privacy, their wants, their needs”, as he could be “on the phone with my mum, talking around her dementia” or “thinking about my dad’s Parkinson’s”.Williams, 51, is equal first with the Beatles as the act with the most No 1 albums in the UK, having had 15 chart-topping records. A biopic, Better Man, was released last year, in which he is portrayed with CGI as an anthropomorphic chimpanzee, a comment on how he feels like a “performing monkey”.The former Take That singer has a well-documented history of depression, as well as being agoraphobic, and has been in rehabilitation in the past for drug and alcohol abuse.Explore more on these topicsRobbie WilliamsAnxietyMental healthCelebrityHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Jack Black’s Minecraft song Steve’s Lava Chicken becomes shortest ever UK Top 40 hitAt 34 seconds, the spectacularly silly song from A Minecraft Movie beats the previous record by two secondsBen Beaumont-ThomasFri 18 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 15.13 EDTShareActor and musicianJack Blackhas made UK chart history, with the shortest ever song to reach the Top 40: his novelty track Steve’s Lava Chicken is just 34 seconds long.The spectacularly silly song reaches No 21 this week, and is taken fromA Minecraft Movie, the video game spin-off film, which has earned $570m (£430m) so far at the global box office – and caused cinemas to be overrun by the game’s young and high-energy fanbase.Black performs the song in the film as the character Steve, as he shows the other protagonists around the alternate universe, the Overworld, and hymns the virtues of chicken cooked in lava (“Crispy and juicy, now you’re havin’ a snack / Ooh, super spicy, it’s a lava attack”).It beats the previous record-holder by two seconds. The Ladies’ Bras was an equally silly song by UK duo Jonny Trunk & Wisbey, with a chorus of “the ladies’ bras, the ladies’ bras / the ladies’ knickers and the ladies’ bras” repeated multiple times over an easy listening backing. It amused radio DJs Scott Mills and Danny Baker – the former playing it multiple times an hour on his Radio 1 show at some points – and it became a cult hit, reaching No 27 in 2007.Steve’s Lava Chicken is Black’s highest UK chart position yet, beating both his track Pod with duo Tenacious D (No 24 in 2006) and another song from a video game-film tie-in: Peaches, his power ballad performed as nefarious pixellated reptile Bowser in 2023’s The Super Mario Bros Movie, which reached No 28.At 95 seconds, that was another of the shortest-charting songs in chart history, behind the likes of 2007 Simpsons Movie song Spider Pig (64 seconds) and Liam Lynch’s 2002 punk hit United States of Whatever (86 seconds).Black made a video message to mark the success of Steve’s Lava Chicken, saying: “I want to send big love to all theMinecraftfans for getting us up there – it’s insane! Love you!”Despite being met with bafflement or outright dismay by many film critics, A Minecraft Movie has become a pop cultural sensation.It beat The Super Mario Bros Movie in securing the highest global opening weekend for a video game spin-off (though still has a way to go beat that film’s $1.3bn (£980m) final score). By filling the film with references cherished by the game’s fans, from the figure of “chicken jockey” to a tribute to the late Minecraft personality Technoblade, it has been playing to joyous and uproarious crowds: sometimes too uproarious, with some cinemas posting warning messages about antisocial behaviour. One group of US patrons brought a live chicken to a screening – “safe to say we got kicked out” ran a caption on TikTok.Elsewhere in this week’s pop charts, US singer and online personality Alex Warren notches up the longest stretch for a No 1 single so far in 2025: his song Ordinary scores its fifth week at the top.Welsh rockers Those Damn Crows get their first UK No 1 album, with God Shaped Hole. It’s their fourth LP, following the No 3 success of 2023’s Inhale/Exhale. “We’ve been working so hard for so many years, this is a huge reward,” the band said in a statement. “We’re not going anywhere, man!”Bon Iver’s fifth studio album Sable, Fable is this week’s second-highest new entry, at No 4.Explore more on these topicsUK chartsJack BlackPop and rockA Minecraft MovieMinecraftGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of the city of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.District judge James Wesley Hendrix this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because immigration officials filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported.But the ACLU’s Friday filing includes sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. In one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials and who only spoke Spanish, was told to sign papers in English.“Ice informed FGM that these papers were coming from the president, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,” Brown wrote.The ACLU asked Hendrix to issue a temporary order halting any such deportations. Later on Friday, with no response from Hendrix, the ACLU asked district judge James Boasberg in Washington to issue a similar emergency order, saying they had information that detainees were being loaded on buses.In their court filing, lawyers say clients receiveda documentFriday from immigration officials, titled “Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal under the Alien Enemies Act”.It reads: “You have been determined to be … a member of Tren de Aragua.”“You have been determined to be an alien enemy subject to apprehension, restraint and removal from the United States … This is not a removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act,” the notice reads.Writing on X, Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat,denouncedthe reported plan to deport more Venezuelans under the 1798 law as a violation of the supreme court’s ruling “that Trump had to give people adequate notice before deporting them”.“We cannot stand by,” Jayapal wrote, as theTrump administration“continues to disappear people”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her lawyers had requested that she be released immediately, or at least brought back to Vermont.The 30-year-old doctoral student was taken by immigration officials as she walked along a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville on 25 March. After being taken to New Hampshire and then Vermont, she was put on a plane the next day and moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Basile, Louisiana. An immigration judge denied her request for bond Wednesday.Ozturk is among several people with ties to American universities whose visas were revoked or have been stopped from entering the US after they were accused of attending demonstrations or publicly expressing support for Palestinians. A Louisiana immigration judge has ruled that the US can deport Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil based on the federal government’s argument that he poses a national security risk.Ozturk’s lawyers are challenging the legal authority for Ice’s detention. They asked that she be immediately released from custody, or in the alternative, be returned to Vermont while her immigration case continues.A lawyer for the justice department said her case should be dismissed, saying the immigration court has jurisdiction.Ozturk’s lawyers first filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts. Initially, they didn’t know where she was. They said they were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. Ozturk herself said she unsuccessfully made multiple requests to speak to a lawyer.Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide”, disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.Ozturk’s lawyers say her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process.A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said last month, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a US-designated terrorist group.Earlier this week, however,the Washington Post reportedthat a State department review of the DHS investigation conducted before Ozturk’s arrest had cast doubt on that claim, and noted that there was no evidence that she had engaged in antisemitic activity or made any public statement indicating support for a terrorist organization.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

But Joe Biden overturned it after defeating him in the 2020 election. The idea aligns with a major plank ofProject 2025, the conservative policy manifesto, which calls for a federal government more beholden to the executive branch to drive out a supposed “deep state” that stood in Trump’s way before he won his second presidency.Most federal government employees serve in roles that are not politically appointed. About 4,000 employees are in roles appointed based on who is in power. Friday’s move would expand that by about 50,000 people, prior estimates have shown.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the years, the image was adapted in various ways.In 1901, Virginia officials ordered that the depiction of the bared breast be included to show clearly that the figure of Virtus was female.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report cited five anonymous sources with knowledge of the situation.The so-called “department of government efficiency” reportedly pushed for the appointment of Shapley using channels within the White House. Bessent was not consulted about the installation, according to the report, which adds that Bessent received Trump’s approval to unwind the decision.Michael Faulkender, the current deputy secretary of the US treasury, is expected to become the next acting head of the tax-collecting agency, the newspaper reported. Missouri congressman Billy Long is Trump’s nominee to hold the permanent position, and he would ultimately take over if approved by the Senate.It was reported earlier this week bythe Leverthat Long had significant personal debt abruptly paid off using campaign contributions acquired after Trump announced his intention to nominate him to lead the IRS.Shapley was chosen by Trump on Tuesday following the resignation of the previous interim head, Melanie Krause.

It is unclear whether it will abide by the latest ruling.A handful of divisions have been completely eliminated by the administration, according to court filings, including the office of servicemember affairs, the office of older Americans, and the office of fair lending. Only eight employees remain in the office of consumer response, while the entire team responsible for the CFPB’s data storage systems has been terminated.Trump halts construction of big wind farm off New York coast: ‘reckless and overreaching’Read moreThe layoffs, via hundreds of reduction in force (RIF) letters sent on Thursday, are just the latest blow in an ongoing battle over the agency’s bleak future.In February, Jackson had ordered a halt to terminations at the CFPB and barred the agency from deleting data or transferring reserve funds except for operational purposes.According to a declaration from an employee who had been laid off, filed under the pseudonym Alex Doe, this week’s layoffs were managed by Gavin Kliger,a staffer at the tech billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge. “He kept the team up for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out yesterday (17 April).”That declaration also said that when team members raised concerns about court orders requiring “particularized assessment” of employees, “they were told that all that mattered was the numbers”.The staff union immediately filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing the terminations violate the court’s preliminary injunction which prohibited actions that “would interfere with the performance of the defendants’ statutory duties”.“We started receiving our RIF notices yesterday afternoon and they went out in batches through the evening,” said one CFPB employee who requested anonymity fearing retaliation. “As a result, large swaths of the work we do, including statutorily required work, won’t get done.”Following the cuts, all affected employees will lose system access by 6.00pm local time on Friday, after which they will be placed on administrative leave until formal separation, according to a copy of the RIF reviewed by the Guardian.The senator Elizabeth Warren, who originally proposed creating the CFPB after the 2008 financial crisis, blasted the move.“President Trump just gutted almost all CFPB staff, so the agency can’t do its job of helping Americans who get scammed by big banks and giant corporations,” Warren said in a statement. “Dismantling the CFPB in the face of a court order blocking an illegal shutdown is yet another assault on consumers and our democracy.”Many have pointed to the influence of Musk, who reportedly placed Doge employees inside the agency and has publicly made a call to “delete” the CFPB for being duplicative of other regulators. Musk has been accused of being the mastermind behind the shutdown so it could benefit his planned financial services platform, X Money, as part of his social media platform’s eventual aspiration to become an everything app.Since its creation, the bureau has recovered over $21bn for defrauded consumers through enforcement actions against major financial institutions, including a $3.7bn order against Wells Fargo in 2022. There has been broad support for the agency, with aSeptember pollfrom Americans for Financial Reform finding that 91% of voters believed it is important to regulate financial services to make sure they are fair for consumers – including 95% of Democrats and 87% of Republicans.“[It] breaks my heart that they’re just erasing so much work and goodwill,” said another laid-off CFPB employee. “And people all over the country have no idea that the things they count on are disappearing.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskConsumer rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Discover has since terminated these practices and is repaying those fees to affected customers, according to the Federal Reserve. The board’s action is being taken in coordination with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.It said Capital One had committed that it would comply with the board’s action against Discover of Riverwoods, Illinois, including remediation requirement, as a condition of approval.The OCC said its approval reflects its “careful analysis of the effect of the merger on communities, the banking industry, and the US financial system”.Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, said it expected to complete the acquisition on 18 May now that it has received all required regulatory approvals. Shareholders of both companies approved the deal in February.The deal joins two of the largest credit card companies that are not banks first, such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, with the notable exception of American Express. It also brings together two companies whose customers are largely similar: often Americans who are looking for cash back or modest travel rewards, compared to the premium credit cards dominated by AmEx, Citi and Chase.It also will give Discover’s payment network a major credit card partner in a way that could make the payment network a major competitor once again. The US credit card industry is dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly with AmEx in a distant third place and Discover in an even more distant fourth place.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFederal ReserveBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

The US and China arelocked in a trade war.Trump tariffs will send global trade into reverse this year, warns WTORead moreThose proposals prompted a backlash from US domestic industries, which warned the port charges would increase prices for American consumers, and sent a wave of concern through the global shipping industry.The USTR said it would start charging port fees in 180 days, and they would rise incrementally over the coming years.Under the new rules, Chinese-linked ships will be charged fees linked to the weight of their cargo or the number of containers on board, rather than according to how many US ports they call at.The fees will be assessed up to five times a year, and can be waived if the owner places an order for a ship built in the US.“Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,” said the US trade representative Jamieson Greer, announcing the new fees, most of which will begin in mid-October.“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships,” Greer added.Will Trump’s tariff chaos be China’s gain in global trade wars?Read moreThe proposed fees came as part of the USTR’s investigation intoChina“targeting the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance”, which was launched in April 2024 under the Biden administration.Chinese-built ships make up most of the fleets of the world’s 10 largest shipping carriers, while other east Asian countries including South Korea and Japan also dominate global shipbuilding.The US shipbuilding industry, which was dominant after the second world war, has declined over the years and now accounts for less than 1% of global output.Under the USTR’s plans, there will be separate fees charged on Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships, which will gradually increase in subsequent years.The fees for Chinese-built ships will begin at $18 per net ton (NT) or $120 per container, which could mean that a ship loaded with 15,000 containers would be charged $1.8m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shipping operators on these routes had expressed concern what the original port fee proposals would have meant for trade.The USTR’s original plans prompted significant criticism during hearings in Washington DC in late March, as shipping companies and trade groups said the fees would hurt US farm exports, increase consumer prices and put at risk the jobs of US dock-workers.Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order aimed atrevitalising the US shipbuilding industry, for both commercial and defence purposes, through increasing investment in the sector.Shipping companies and industry analysts forecast it would take years for the US to increase its shipbuilding capacity.Explore more on these topicsChinaUS foreign policyShipping industryTrump administrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He was in the starting lineup for the second game of the four-game series.Chisholm was ejected in the seventh inning on Thursday night by plate umpire John Bacon when Chisholm argued after a called third strike on a full-count pitch from Mason Montgomery that appeared low. It was his fifth career ejection and first with the Yankees.Chisholm then posted on his X account, “Not even fucking close!!!!!”, then deleted the post.MLB’s regulations ban the use of electronic devices during games. The social media policy prohibits “displaying or transmitting content that questions the impartiality of or otherwise denigrates a major league umpire.”“I didn’t think before I had anything that I said was ejectable but after probably,” Chisholm said after the game. “I’m a competitor, so when I go out there and I feel like I’m right and you’re saying something to me that I think doesn’t make sense, I’m going to get fired up and be upset.“I lost my emotions.

US Olympian Conner Mantz has his sights set on Boston Marathon podiumCallum JonesThe 28-year-old is aiming to become the first American man to win the race since 2014. He says learning to take pressure off himself has helped his careerFri 18 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 07.29 EDTShareEvery now and then, Conner Mantz allows his mind to drift back to the same stretch of last November’s New York CityMarathon.Around 16 miles in, coming off the Queensborough Bridge into Manhattan, the lead pack accelerated. Mantz, starting to feel uncomfortable, let the other runners go.But grinding through to the end, he finished strong – with the fastest final mile in the top 10 – and crossed the line with enough in the tank to leave that dangerous question, as old as time itself. What if?“Had I gone with that move, maybe I would have blown up,” Mantz told the Guardian in an interview. “But maybe I would have been there fighting for the win at the end.“I would rather be there, risking it a little bit more, so that at the end I can try and win, than getting a safe [result]: always ending up in the top eight, but never being in the top three.”Last year was an extraordinary one for the 28-year-old, whowon the US Olympic marathon trialsin February;finished eighth, as top American, at the Olympic marathon in August; andfinished sixth in New Yorkin November.View image in fullscreenConner Mantz celebrates after placing first during the 2024 US Olympic team trials for marathon on 3 February 2024 in Orlando, Florida.Photograph: Mike Ehrmann/Getty ImagesHe is seen, understandably, as a serious contender for Monday’sBoston Marathon.“The competitor that he is, I feel like he has a great chance of podium, for sure,” said Meb Keflezighi, who won Boston in 2014 – thefirst American man to do so in three decades– and New York in 2009. “Don’t count him out.”Mantz, by his own admission, gives himself a hard time. “You sound like you ran terrible,” a former college teammate commented after the trials last February. “But you won.”He had struggled through the final stages of the race, in lockstep with his training partner Clayton Young, who ultimately allowed him to take the win. “I may have beaten Clayton. But in my mind, he demolished me,” said Mantz.And while Paris last summer and New York in the fall solidified his position as one of the brightest hopes in US distance running, he left both feeling disappointed.“I’d had a lot of self-belief heading into New York and the Olympics,” said Mantz. “And when both of those …” He paused, catching himself. “Not that they went poorly, but I think just kind of missed this …” He trailed off. “I expected to do a little bit better.”New York stung. After Paris, Mantz believed he had taken a big leap in training: his workouts stronger, his mileage higher, and his recoveries quicker. “I thought that would come together … and I’d do something really big that day,” he said. “And I don’t think I did.”Mantz was only beaten in New York by four former champions and an Olympic silver medalist, who won. But accomplished goals – like making the Olympics, and being top American in four consecutive marathons – are overshadowed, at least in his mind, by ones that remain out of reach.“Until he’s at the level ofEliud Kipchogein his prime, winning everything and running faster at everything, I think there is going to be that sense of wanting more,” said Ed Eyestone, the two-time Olympian and Brigham Young University (BYU) coach who trains Mantz and Young. “That’s what makes him so competitive.”This year has been “pretty seamless for Conner thus far,” added Eyestone. Mantzshattered the US men’s half marathon recordin Houston in January,narrowly missing outon victory. He ran a few seconds faster in March at the New York City Half Marathon, organized by New York Road Runners, coming second.View image in fullscreenMantz at a race in New York last month.Photograph: Courtesy of New York Road RunnersBack on the streets of Brooklyn and Manhattan in the New York City Half, Mantz felt in control. He focused on execution – making and meeting moves that defined the race – and leaving no room to wonder what might have been. “That might have been the best race I’ve ever run,” he said.Both performances helped boost his confidence that he may well pull off something really big, soon. A fast, flat, record-eligible marathon – Chicago, Berlin, or even Valencia – may well come later in the year. “Breaking the record in the half gave me a lot more confidence that I could do it in the full.”For now, though, all eyes are on Boston: a notoriously punishing course, where no American man has won since Keflezighi, in 2014. Des Linden became thefirst American woman to win the race in three decades in 2018.“I think I could be an American winner,” said Mantz, who stressed his primary aim is to podium. Sixth is his best finish at a World Major marathon to date. “Fifth is kind of next step,” he added. “But I think I’m strong enough that I think I can be top three.”The world’s oldest annual marathon attracts a stacked elite field. Other men on the start line this year include reigning champion Sisay Lemma; two-time champion Evans Chebet; and a host of strong US athletes, including Young and CJ Albertson.When Mantz last ran Boston, in 2023, he finished 11th. “He’s a different person now,” observed Keflezighi. “He has closed that gap.”“Regardless of what happens, Conner Mantz will be in that lead pack for as long as he can,” said Eyestone. “As long as he can put one foot in front of the other, at the pace that’s being dictated, he will be there.”Mantz, who studied mechanical engineering at BYU, served as a missionary in Ghana for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints before college. He credits the experience, and his faith, with giving him perspective.“It taught me athletics and sports, it can’t be something that defines you. Because, to be quite honest, most people don’t care,” he said, with a brief laugh. “I love this sport. I have so much fun doing it. But there’s so much more important things in this life.”There is a “healthy level” of obsession, added Mantz, who concedes he spent his fair share of time on the wrong side of this line. But nowadays, even as he dedicates more time than ever to running, thinking about running, and talking about running, “I don’t think I’m as obsessed”.Mantz has worked with a sports psychologist on expectations – and the pain and possibility presented by each marathon. “You should expect there’s going to be times in the race, whether it’s going to be 5K or 10K, that are going to be very difficult,” he said. “They’re going to hurt.”But you should try to turn up with a bit of curiosity, excitement, “and less expectations on yourself”, he continued. “What could happen if I make this move, or I push the pace here?”Forget what might have happened if everything fell into place last time around. What’s going to happen now?His objective for Boston – and every race, he insists – is the podium, rather than victory. This goal “usually negates a little bit of what other people are doing,” he said. He can run his own race, and worry “just a tiny bit” less about the rest of the pack.“Winning every race? I just, I don’t know who’s more talented, I don’t know who’s training better, I don’t know – I hope noone’s cheating, but, you know, we know how our sport is, and a lot of people dope,” said Mantz. “But top three is a nicer goal for me.”“I did have my best race of my life and finished second” at the New York City Half last month, he noted. “And if I’m disappointed because I didn’t win, when maybe the guy ahead of me is just more talented and harder working than me, or just as hard working and just as talented, but he just had a better day, I can’t really do anything about that.”Next week in Boston, his sights are set on what he can control. Whatever happens, Mantz is determined not to finish wondering what might have been.Explore more on these topicsBoston MarathonMarathonAthleticsUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And money. Lots and lots of money. Only one trophy is handed out at the conclusion of thePremier Leagueseason, meaning the most tangible reward most teams are playing for over the final few weeks of the campaign is a bigger check.Last season, each Premier League team received anywhere between £175.9m and £109.7m for their participation in the self-styled Greatest League in the World. These payouts take into account everything from league position, the number of matches broadcast on TV and commercial revenue among other factors.The numbers for the 2024-25 season won’t be released until after the end of the campaign, but last season provides an idea of what Premier League teams can expect to receive. Here’s a breakdown that doesn’t account for club-specific factors such as gate receipts, transfers and sponsorship deals.The winnersMoney won’t be at the forefront of Arne Slot and his players’ minds when Liverpool are confirmed as Premier League champions, but Fenway Sports Group (FSG) could be forgiven for counting their notes. Last season, Manchester City collected £56.4m in pure prize money (something called “merit payments”), meaning Liverpool can expect to receive a similar payout.On top of this, City were handed £86.9m in equal share payments from domestic and international broadcast rights. A further £24.4m was added to Manchester City’s pile of broadcast cash based on the number of matches they had broadcast in the UK over the course of the season (the Premier League labels this “facility fees”).A £8.2m share of the league’s central commercial revenue streams brought City’s total payout to £175.9m, the most of any team in the division. Winning the title also brings access to the following season’sChampions Leaguewith qualification worth £15.7m before £1.8m for each League Phase win is factored into the equation.The Champions League contingentIf you ain’t first, you’re last, as Ricky Bobby famously said. Unless if you finish in the Champions League places (first to fourth, sometimes fifth depending on Uefa’s coefficient rankings) in the Premier League table, in which case you’re still very well remunerated.In fact, Arsenal received more in so-called “facility fees” than Manchester City last season - £26.9m compared to £24.4m. Factoring in prize money, equal share payments and a cut of the league’s central commercial revenue, the Gunners made just £0.4m less (£175.5m in total) than the champions.Third-place Liverpool (£25.2m) also took more in “facility fees” than City, collecting £171m in total, with the final Champions League qualifier, Aston Villa, raking in £162.4m from the Premier League. This, of course, is before any European money is factored into the equation; Villa’s run in this season’s Champions League has been worth an estimated £40m to them.These are the sort of riches Nottingham Forest are chasing. Nuno Espirito Santo’s team were fighting relegation last season, but have since risen into Champions League contention. Having taken £123.3m from a 17th place finish in 2023-24, Forest stand to earn £40m to £60m more by making their place in the top five stick.The European other guysTottenham Hotspur’s fifth-place finish in 2023-24 was enough to qualify for this season’s Europa League, and enough to collect £164.4m in total payments from the Premier League, which was interestingly more than Aston Villa’s £162.4m despite Unai Emery’s team reaching the Champions League. This was down to Spurs earning £5m more in “facility fees”, meaning they had more games broadcast on domestic TV.Despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, Manchester United qualified for the Europa League by beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final. This was worth £3.6m to the Old Trafford club, but still wasn’t enough to make up for the financial shortfall of a disappointing league campaign, although United still collected £156.2m in total.Chelsea, who rallied late under Mauricio Pochettino to finish sixth and make the Conference League, took £159.2m while Newcastle United, who finished ahead of Manchester United but missed out on Europe altogether, earned £154.7m. The difference between Spurs in fifth and Manchester United in eighth amounted to just £8.4m in payments from the Premier League.As things stand, this is the realm Chelsea, Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Fulham and Brighton fall into with as many as eight different teams jostling for Champions League, Europa League and Conference League qualification. The difference between just a few places in the table can be significant.The middlersMid-table mediocrity is worth a lot in the Premier League, as it turns out. Indeed, a ninth-place finish for West Ham last season earned the London Stadium outfit £147.4m with Crystal Palace rewarded to the tune of £139.6m for finishing smack bang in the middle of the table (once again, the primary differentiator was “facility fees” where West Ham collected £5m more).From Brighton in 11th place to Wolves in 14th place, Premier League clubs collected anywhere between £136.8m to £130m. For context, Real Madrid received just €53.3m for winning the La Liga title last season, highlighting the financial might of the Premier League’s mid-tier. This is how a club like Bournemouth (average attendance: 11,000) can spend £40m on a player like Evanilson.This season, the usual mid-table equation could be disrupted by the presence of Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, both of whom have endured historically bad campaigns. As “big” clubs, they should expect to earn a lot more than the teams around them (Brentford, Palace, Everton, etc) in “facility fees”.The relegation fodderSouthampton, Leicester City and Ipswich Town have had a long time to brace for the impact of relegation. However, the blow will be softened by the amount of money they will receive for just one season in the Premier League. Between this and three years of parachute payments, there’s plenty in the trust fund.Last season, Sheffield United received £109.7m for finishing bottom. Burnley took £110.1m while Luton Town collected £115.4m. Everton, who finished 15th after flirting with relegation for much of the season, were handed £20.2m in “facility fees” which was more than any of the six teams above them in the table up to Manchester United. Their struggles made for good TV.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it time for a change?Colin HorganFri 18 Apr 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 04.31 EDTShare“It’s the stupidest thing ever.” This was Washington Capitals’ forward Daniel Winnik’s review in 2017 of the NHL’s still (somewhat) newplayoff format. Three seasons earlier, along with realigning its divisions, the NHL had abandoned it’s previous, simple playoff arrangement. For 20 years, the top eight teams from each conference qualified for the playoffs, with the first-placed team playing the eighth-placed team, the second-placed team played the seventh, and so on. “I don’t know why it’s not one to eight,” Winnik said. “I don’t know why we got away from that.” A lot of people are still asking the same question.On Sunday, as the NHL locked in its first Western conference playoff matchup, confirming that the Dallas Stars will face the Colorado Avalanche, some fans took to online forums to both celebrate and lament. “Anybody else hate the divisional format? I truly think both of these teams are legit contenders,” one userposted to the r/hockey subredditunder a link announcing the matchup. “Pretty sure literally everyone does,” anotherresponded. Indeed, it seems unfair that one of the top teams in the West will be eliminated so soon into the postseason. Worse, is that, thanks in part to the playoff format, fans have seen this matchup coming for ages – a predictability that is supposed to build anticipation, but has instead become annoying.Alex Ovechkin is now the NHL’s greatest goalscorer. It’s debatable what else he isRead moreHere’s how theNHLplayoffs work now: Since 2014, the top three teams from each NHL division qualify for the postseason, plus the next two highest-placed teams by points, regardless of their division, as wildcard entrants. In the first round, each of the top divisional seeds plays a wildcard team, with the team with the most points playing the wildcard team with the least. Meanwhile, the second- and third-placed teams from each division face off.When it was announced for the 2014 season, the revamped playoff rearrangement was just one piece of a broader league-wide realignment. The NHL redesigned its divisions and conferences to align more closely with time zone boundaries to both reduce travel and make TV schedules better for fans. “We played a majority of games outside the Eastern time zone, and our next generation of fans wanted to be able to watch and listen. But so many of our games started too late,” John Davidson, president of the Columbus Blue Jackets – who moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference during the realignment –saidwhen the changes were approved.NHL commissioner Gary Bettman also felt the realignment would create more intense rivalries, because it meant that teams began to play inside their division and conference more frequently – three or four times each – with the remainder of the games against teams from the other conference. On the eve of the 2014 Stanley Cup final, Bettman declared the effort a mission accomplished. “I think the entire realignment this season has been received overwhelmingly in a positive way,” Bettmansaidat a 2014 press conference. “The rivalries have been great,” he said, speaking of that year’s postseason – the first under the new format.Whether or not divisional or conference rivalries have intensified since the realignment is a point of debate. What’s clearer is that the playoff matchups in an ever-expanding league remain in some cases painfully predictable.View image in fullscreenCould this be the year the Toronto Maple Leafs’ 58-year Stanley Cup drought finally ends?Photograph: Steve Russell/Toronto Star/Getty ImagesThe LA Kings of recent years are a good example. This postseason will be the fourth year in a row that LA will face the Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the playoffs. The Oilers have won the past three meetings. Forget rivalry, this is more like a recurring nightmare for Kings fans – and one they could see coming for months. It’s a similar, though less pronounced, issue for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who’ve faced the Boston Bruins three times in the first round since 2018 and the Tampa Bay Lightning twice. “You see LA-Edmonton every year in the first round. Is that really good for the league?” Winnipeg forward Gabriel Vilardiasked reportersin March. “You can’t make rivalries. They just happen naturally. That’s my opinion.”What to do? The solution to all this might not be a fresh overhaul of the playoff format itself, but of the regular-season points system. Some have suggested that the NHL should adopt the 3-2-1 points system it used in the Four Nations tournament earlier this year – that is, three points for a win, two for an overtime win or shootout win, and one for an overtime or shootout loss (zero for a loss in regulation). Currently, the NHL awards two points for any win and one point for a loss in overtime or a shootout. The theory is that the 3-2-1 system would incentivize teams to win more games in regulation, thereby shifting the overall standings, and rewarding teams that might have otherwise not made the postseason. One poll in 2024showed78.7% of NHL fans want the change. Yet, if the 3-2-1 points system had been applied this season, the Oilers and Kings stillwould havelikely played one another in the first round. And the Leafs would not have played the Senators (as they will), but instead, uh, the Lightning.For now, Bettman doesn’t think the format needs a rethink. “I’m pretty dug in on this,” hesaidin March. “I like exactly what we have and if you look at the races that we’re having for the regular season, playoffs have started already,” Bettman added, referring to the fact that some teams have been relatively certain of the team they’ll face in the first round for many weeks. Bettman referred to this inevitability as the NHL’s “play-in tournament”, referring to the NBA’s extra games that determine the final teams to make the postseason. But, even by his own account, Bettman should consider a change. When the current playoff format was introduced, Bettman said it would stand for at least three years “barring another relocation or expansion” – neither of which, he noted, were being considered. Since then, the NHL has seen one team relocate and two new join. It might be time.Playoff predictionsWestern Conference finalLas Vegas v WinnipegEastern Conference finalToronto v WashingtonStanley Cup finalWinnipeg v TorontoIf this proves to be the matchup, it would be fitting for a year in which Canada has (re)defined itself so much via hockey that a Canadian team finally ends the nation’s 35-year Cup drought. Things have aligned well for the Leafs this season, but the hockey gods are also endlessly cruel, so if this unbelievable Cup Final should occur, the safe bet would be with the Jets.Explore more on these topicsNHLUS sportsIce hockeyStanley CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He remains unfazed by the process of adapting, having long considered it would be an evolution, even given the weight of all the expectation and scrutiny.This weekend at the fifth round of the season in Saudi Arabia,Ferrariand Hamilton are optimistic they will be making another stride in bridging the gap to the dominant McLaren.‘Very alarming’: Red Bull hold crisis talks as Verstappen stews over Bahrain F1 GPRead moreIt was always going to be impossible for Hamilton and Ferrari to manage expectations around his debut season. The greatest driver of the modern era finally donning therosso corsato likely see out his career with the sport’s most famous and most successful marque, and potentially ending a Ferrari drivers’ title drought that stretches back to 2007.Yet before the season had even begun Hamilton was advocating caution, aware how complex it would be to adapt to a new car, new personnel and new methodologies after so much success at Mercedes over 12 years.So it proved in the opening four rounds where Hamilton’s relationship with his new family has been under intense examination, a process not helped by the Ferrari playing catch-up at the same time Hamilton is learning his way around the new machinery.However, the British driver is no stranger to the spotlight and at the Jeddah Corniche circuit was handling it with equanimity. “It’s to be expected, Ferrari is the greatest team inFormula Onehistory, it’s that special,” he said. “Of course more stories are written about it and people have opinions and it’s not always been smooth sailing. So, from my perspective, you can’t work with a team and change things overnight.”This considered approach has been the ballast around which Hamilton and Fred Vasseur have held their ship steady, as the Ferrari team principal noted after the last round in Bahrain: “You won’t replace 12 years of collaboration in two weeks or two races.” He also noted in Saudi Arabia that it was a two-way street.“Lewis is coming with his own experience with 20 years of F1 with different teams,” he said. “It’s always good to have someone join the team with this kind of experience and vision, to help us to improve.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton tests out his Ferrari during the first free practice before the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.Photograph: Altaf Qadri/APFor Hamilton it is also more than just a matter of adjusting to the team. He is in a new car with distinct characteristics and adapting a driving style that was for so long attuned to the Mercedes. He felt he had advanced again in Bahrain, returning his best finish this season of fifth and where, during the second stint, he believes he may be finding a groove.Still, the caution remains. “It’s like we’re riding a rollercoaster together, up and down and I have no doubts we will get to where we plan to be, it’s just going to take time,” he said. “There are changes that are short term that we’ll do together, keep all the greatness and keep building all the areas that we could be stronger in. Some of those are short term and some of them are longer term.”A tilt at the title already looks to be wishful thinking, however, with McLaren’s Lando Norris leading the championship by three points from his teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third, eight points back. Hamilton is seventh, 52 points adrift, yet the atmosphere at Ferrari remains upbeat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team brought a new floor upgrade to Bahrain to address the issues with a narrow operating window and its weakness through high-speed corners, where running a low ride-height is key for aerodynamic efficiency.In Bahrain it was felt the floor had delivered but the real test will be in Jeddah, a high-speed, low-drag track of very fast corners joined by two hairpins at either end. If they have made another really positive step forward, Hamilton and Ferrari might well consider they are genuinely on the move.In first practice, Alpine’s Pierre Gasly topped the timesheets, albeit in the unrepresentative daytime running for what is a night race, just in front of Norris and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, with Hamilton in eighth and Verstappen, once more struggling with the balance of his Red Bull, ninth.In the night running of the second session, Norris was on top, one-tenth clear of Piastri, the McLarens looking strong again, with Verstappen improving in third and Leclerc fourth.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFormula OneFerrariSaudi Arabia and sportMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was patient attrition over the two games, worthy of a place in the Carlsen-David Howell book Grind like a Grandmaster.The decisive first game had some technical errors, which the Norwegian described almost apologetically in hispost-game interview. The rematch was more routine as the 34-year-old simplified to his goal of a drawn rook endgame and a move-40 handshake.Carlsen now has the overall lead in the five-leg Grand Slam which ­continues later in the year at Las Vegas, Delhi and Cape Town.Chess: Magnus Carlsen in form at Paris Freestyle after Hans Niemann drops outRead moreEarlier, he ­displayed his creativity when he gave up his queen for three minor pieces in his quarter-final, and his versatility and his continuing ­hunger for more chess when, his day’s work done in Paris, he took part inchess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday and made aclean sweep of all 11 games, a rare feat which he has achieved twice ­previously, winning with an unbeaten 11/11.The openings in Freestyle are a treacherous swamp, where careless play can lead to a lost position within a dozen moves. Relevant experience helps, though. Freestyle has 960 different starting positions, but there have been cases where one of the 960 appeared in a previous tournament, and a GM has remembered it.Some time in the first 20 or so moves, a Freestyle position often becomes recognisably similar to normal chess and the players can use their previous knowledge effectively. In Carlsen’s Freestyle games, he spots this metamorphosis and transformation faster than his rivals, and that is one secret of his continued success.A negative at Paris was the failure of the four Indian players who have dominated classical chess in recent years. Only Arjun Erigaisi, who remained true to his attacking style and emerged in fifth place, did well, while Gukesh Dommaraju, the 18-year-old classical world champion, did worst, finishing 11th out of 12.View image in fullscreen3968:Vishy Anand v Veselin Topalov, Dortmund 2001. Black, in time pressure, chose 1...Qh4? when White forced a drawn ending by 2 Qh2! Can you do better for Black?What happens to the 2025 Freestyle Grand Slam in the coming months remains to be seen. Its third leg, scheduled for New York in late July, has been moved to Las Vegas and reduced from eight days to five, allowing two games a day in the interests of publicity. This means a faster time limit, from slow classical chess, as championed by Carlsen, to one-hour rapid games.The change may also reflect the worsened economic climate. The Grand Slam series, which was projected to break even with the help of new trading partners by 2026, is financially backed by a $12m investment from the New York based venture capitalist firm Left Lane Capital, which is privately quoted but is still susceptible to market downturns and recessions. The pressures for Freestyle to achieve faster profitability, and wider support among the chess public and media, are increasing.Ju Wenjun, the holder, won four games in succession against her demoralised challenger, Tan Zhongyi, to score a 6.5-2.5 victoryin the $500,000 Women’s World Championship matchin Chongqing. Game seven was Tan’s nadir as she allowed her a8 black bishop to be entombed by her own c6 pawn and a c5 white knight. Ju needed just a draw in Wednesday’s ninth game (of 12) to take the crown for the fifth time in her career.Ju has now equalled the title totals of Nona Gaprindashvili and Maia Chiburdanidze, both of Georgia, who each won five crowns between 1962 and 1988. The all-time record holder remains Vera Menchik, a Czech who lived most of her life in London.

Conflict seemed inevitableFri 18 Apr 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 18.07 EDTShareThere was a news story this week about a team of a hundred scientists who have spent nine years analysing a single cubic millimetre of mouse brain. The one hundred scientists have finally published their results. And those results are basically: “Whoah, have you seen this stuff?”What they found inside the cubic millimetre of mouse brain was an eternity of wiring, just miles and miles of tiny wire to be untangled, pictured in the accompanying article clumped into a single mass, like a pan of mouse brain vermicelli left overnight in the sink.The point of the study was to offer some clues in the study of the human brain. Given this is around a thousand times bigger than its mouse equivalent the group was forced to conclude it would take centuries to untangle the wiring inside a complete human brain. That box under the bed crammed with scart cables and old Blu-ray player leads might seem a bit confusing. The human brain, well, the human brain is basically unknowable.Reece James bemoans ‘poor’ Chelsea display as Legia Warsaw cause frightRead moreIt is tempting to conclude this must be the kind of thing Enzo Maresca thinks about as he lies awake at night staring at the ceiling, sifting data, poring over the impossibility of eradicating petty human variables, of ensuring Tosin Adarabioyo remembers at all times he is just an avatar of a system, that Levi Colwill knows he’s nothing more than a unit of athletic flesh.You really think it’s a logical option for Robert Sánchez to pass the ball forward?

It was headlined “Enzo Maresca: ‘Football belongs to the fans’”, above a picture of a beaming Maresca, arms wide in a tender, priestly gesture, raising the prospect of some kind of Scrooge-style overnight conversion from scowling possession-ball to joy, freedom and the possibilities of a fully unleashed Noni Madueke.On closer inspection the article turned out to be a fine and sympathetic piece of work from the club admin, who managed to pack that line about fans into the headline, sub-head and opening sentence, but was forced before the opening paragraph was out to get on to the stuff he really wanted to say about how fans are only vital when they support you, how football is in fact “more complicated” than this.View image in fullscreenChelsea manager Enzo Maresca during a press conference at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAChelsea duly reeled off another strange performance against Legia, losing at home while taking 72% possession, making 721 passes, and playing like a team having a half-grasped conversation with itself about maths. And Maresca is a fascinating figure right now, both the funniest single entity in the Premier League (if you don’t have to watch the games) and a test of what this thing is supposed to mean.His best quality is that amazing air of self‑possession, the look of cultivated disdain, the smile that suggests the entire choreographed descent into mouse-brain football is just another step in his own vast, unknowable plan. And while he, Enzo, will not judge you for your inability to grasp this, he will in fact still massively judge you, despise you, and make passive aggressive remarks about you in a TV interview.Maresca’s entire professional identity is based around tactics, an ideologue’s preference for controlled buildup play from the back. Also, baiting the press. He loves, and passionately believes in baiting the press. Not to mention counterpressing then falling back quickly, like a squadron of police tactically running away from some teenagers.Chelsea fans tend to like forceful, direct football. Conflict of some kind always seemed inevitable. But more widely Maresca is a key part in the conversation about boring football. When people talk of Pep clones, of robot-ball nihilists, they’re talking about Maresca, and perhaps also that other brooding technocrat Rubin Amorim, who was pictured last week watching his players train from a hundred yards away behind a fence, glowering at the distant rondos like a divorced dad at sports day.This is all probably cyclical, a symptom of the league running out of content, or just a general intolerance for levels of ambient boredom that are now painful to the over-stimulated modern idiot-brain. But it is also fascinating to watch, mainly because Maresca is willing to go to war with club’s own fans over this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are so many managers convinced that a single idea about football must be right, this sense that there are indeed eternal truths in the universe, and that these involve slow buildup play and/or the use of wing-backs? And more widely, how have Chelsea walked into this contradictory state of affairs, the party club, a casino made entirely from fireworks, which then considers it sensible to appoint Martin Luther as manager.Looking for logic from this version of Chelsea is probably pointless.This is a place where the accounts department has long since embarked on the compliance equivalent of drinking your own urine. Where it’s considered a good idea to hire a coach for your attacking assets who is ideologically bent on making them less not more starry, on turning them into drones, like buying a prized watch and covering it with gaffer tape because you just really, really believe in gaffer tape.More interesting is Maresca’s unpopularity now in the stadium and on the internet. It is probably fair to say actual, long-standing legacy fans are a mixed blessing for the more speculative Premier League owners, who want you to like football just enough to buy it, to click, to subscribe, but not enough to feel you have any say in what happens.None of this means Maresca will necessarily be sacked, although failure to make the Champions League might seal it. He remains a powerful indicator of how much grasp of basic detail these glazed and distant Chelsea owners possess, or indeed how much the detail matters right now beyond holding a seat at the table.What seems to matter more is that Chelsea’s fans are asserting their primacy in the experience, the needs, the wants, the feelings of those in the physical space. It remains to be seen if this can have any effect, whether the manager will be given time to untangle the wiring a little more. Or whether he is actually correct in the thing he didn’t really say, that football does still belong to its fans. In this sense, and this sense alone, Maresca at Chelsea remains a fascinating slow-burn drama.Explore more on these topicsChelseacommentShareReuse this content"

Montemurro, who led Arsenal to a first Women’s Super League title in seven years in 2019, was previously back in N5 in 2023, where his Juventus team lost 1-0 in the Champions League. Arsenal look very different, on and off the pitch, to the club he left. They upped their investment in and commitment to the women’s side after a review towards the end of Montemurro’s tenure, but a face familiar to him sits in the home dugout. While with Arsenal Montemurro was paired with Renée Slegers on the Uefa coach mentor programme in the early stages of the former Netherlands international’s coaching journey. Montemurro describes her as “a perfect fit for Arsenal”: “She really has brought back a level of belief in the squad and who they are. It’s a reflection of her. She’s very confident in what she does. She’s very strategic in how she goes about things. I’m so happy for her, happy she was given the opportunity and took it because it’s a very big job but she seems to be handling it well.” He said with a laugh: “I must have taught her well.”View image in fullscreenJoe Montemurro congratulates his team after defeating Wolfsburg earlier in the competition.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesFormidable forwardsArsenal boast an enviable forward line, theirfive goals against Leicesteron Tuesday a demonstration of their depth, with four goalscorers despite the absence of Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly, who withdrew injured from the England squad in April. It is hoped both will be fit to face Lyon, who have their own formidable forward line that will test Arsenal’s No 2 goalkeeper, Manuela Zinsberger, with Daphne van Domselaar injured playing for the Netherlands. The Champions League record goalscorer, Ada Hegerberg, is always a threat in a competition that seems, at times, to be her playground. The Haitian forward Melchie Dumornay has scored 19 goals across Ligue 1 (15) and the Champions League this season, Kadidiatou Diani is Lyon’s top scorer in Europe with five and the midfielder Lindsey Heaps is their second-highest scorer in Ligue 1 on 11. Eugénie Le Sommer and Tabitha Chawinga have also contributed goals in Europe for Lyon, who have scored 25 goals and conceded two. On the threat of Dumornay, Heaps said: “I always think: ‘How the heck would I play against her?’ That’s the big question for their backline. How do you want to play against our front three? With the things that they can do they can make it really difficult in all areas.”View image in fullscreenAda Hegerberg completed the rout of Bayern Munich in the last round.Photograph: Catherine Steenkeste/Getty ImagesWhat has Montemurro brought Lyon?“He’s done a really great job just bringing us back to Lyon’s style and giving us the freedom to play, but with a few tactical adjustments here and there for certain games,” said Heaps, a US international. “It’s the vibe, the freedom to play. We nail down little bits of the structure and how we want to play, positionally where we want to be and filling roles, but then there’s the freedom to bring out your qualities and your strengths. When you have that bit of freedom it brings a lot of confidence.” Montemurro, whose character is always praised by Arsenal players who worked under him, believes finding the right levels of pressure and fun are the key. “It’s us being prepared, excited and happy with a little bit of pressure,” he said. “If we put too much pressure on the team, things aren’t going well, you don’t see things straight, you don’t adjust properly. If you don’t put enough pressure on the team it takes it a little bit easy. It’s really about us, having the team be selfless, with a little bit of humility and smiling while they want the ball and want to keep the ball.”The fanbasesThe energy from the stands could be vital. Crowds of 30,000 to 60,000 at the Emirates Stadium are increasingly common and it is not just the scale of the attendances there that is important but the atmosphere those fans create. Arsenal have an engaged and enthusiastic fanbase that increasingly feels impactful on the pitch. Lyon have struggled, despite their phenomenal dominance of women’s football in France and their Champions League successes, to significantly grow their crowds. The record attendance at the Groupama Stadium for the women’s side is 38,466 for their 2024 Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but sustained five-figure crowds have been lacking. Lyon have also struggled to grow a travelling contingent, whereas Arsenal fans are likely to travel in impressive numbers for the second leg on 27 April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Arsenal’s 5-1 defeat of her team on Tuesday she said: “Overall, Arsenal are the better team. Lyon focuses too much on individuals; if you block those individuals you can stop their chance at scoring.” Arsenal have shocked Lyon before, earning a thrilling 5-1 win at the Groupama before a 1-0 defeat in London when they topped their Champions League group in 2022-23. “That game is very much in the past,” said Heaps. “That’s one of those games where a team comes and imposes themselves. They have such incredible players and individuality – the uniqueness of some of their individuals, that’s very exciting for a team – but then also the team play is very good. I rate them very high, I respect them so much, so I think that’s what makes this game very exciting. You have two teams that love to have the ball and love to play but also have played in really big games and know what’s at stake as well.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenWomen's footballLyon WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Erik ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, United were seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa. Now, they are in the same 14th place but 17 points behind Manchester City in the fifth position recently confirmed as a Champions League berth. The Portuguese arrived on a ticket of a 3-4-3 shape that has proved non-negotiable despite the flatlining league performance and helter-skelter Europa League campaign.In the latter, a 92nd-minute Bruno Fernandes goalwas needed to beat Rangersin January. Rasmus Højlund’s 88th-minute strikebeat Viktoria Plzenin December. Last week, United were leading 2-1in the first leg at Lyonon 88 minutes after Joshua Zirkzee’s header but Rayan Cherki’s 95th-minute shot grabbed a draw. André Onana was culpable but the wider picture was of familiar disarray in United’s area.It is the same in attack. At Old Trafford on Thursday Maguire had to be shunted forward as a makeshift No 9 owing to a lack of alternatives, joining Kobbie Mainoo. The 19-year-old Mainoo scored a calm equaliser (in minute 120) yet shoving an attacking midfielder and centre-back up front is as unsustainable as relying on a 33-year-old Casemiro to be chief creator – the Brazilian was involved in all three of United’s extra-time goals, providing assists for Maguire and Mainoo and winning the penalty scored by Fernandes.The emergency roles for Maguire and Mainoo show up the dismal construction of a squad that contains only two centre-forwards in Zirkzee (who is injured and a more natural No 10) and Højlund, who lacks service from Amorim’s dysfunctional side.View image in fullscreenKobbie Mainoo (left) and Harry Maguire are an unusual and unsustainable strike partnership.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAFactor in, too, Amorim’s seemingly quaint man-management of Marcus Rashford, whom he bombed out and who is pulling up trees at Aston Villa on loan.As Maguire says: “You can see that we’re probably short on attackers. We had two in the squad in Garners [Alejandro Garnacho] and Rasmus and they gave everything out there. Garners was on his last legs and he was up and down the pitch numerous times. So if he [Amorim] asks me to go up there, I’m willing to.”Maguire is frank, too, about the slipshod organisation: “I don’t know how I would have felt if I had come here and been speaking after a 4-2 defeat – it’s not even worth trying to think about that. The second half was comfortable; they had a lot of possession but they didn’t create chances. Then they scored the first goal out of nothing, really.”For nothing read Moussa Niakhaté and Alexandre Lacazette being allowed to play head-tennis before Tolisso scored with a third header on 71 minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“It was pinball in our box and they managed to put it in,” Maguire says. “With the season that we’ve had, at Old Trafford especially, we started maybe playing a little anxiously, and that’s understandable. But we needed to see out those minutes and be solid, so to end up at 2-2 straight away [through Nicolás Tagliafico in the 77th minute], it was difficult to take.”Cherki’s 104th-minute finish and Lacazette’s penalty on 109 derived from further panic. Maguire says: “Then, in extra time, we obviously can’t get done on two counterattacks like that when we’re playing against 10 men; it’s criminal really. But we showed great spirit at that moment.”Party like it’s 1999: Amorim uses treble as ‘inspiration’ for crazy Lyon comebackRead moreA number of United fans left, with some returning as the game was turned upside down. On Instagram Zirkzee said alongside a clip of the Old Trafford noise: “To all the fans who left when we were down. Have a listen to this.” You could hardly blame those who did depart. As Maguire says: “This season it’s been so difficult for everyone involved, all the fans, all the players, the staff.”For those who witnessed it memories were cast. This is what United do. Thursday’s box-office finish can be added to a long list that includes last term’s last-gaspFA Cup elimination of Liverpool, the ceding of a 3-0 advantageto Coventry in the semi-finalbefore a breathless penalty shootout win, and, of course,the 1999 Champions League finaltriumph.After beating Coventry, United claimed the FA Cup and victory over Lyon capped a spine-tingling week for English clubs on the continent afterArsenal knocked out Real MadridandAston Villa went close to their own Lazarus actagainst Paris Saint-Germain.So a last question: will Maguire’s late, late seizing of the narrative prove Amorim’s Mark Robins moment or a freak occurrence that exposes United’s lack of what the coach needs to make them a force again?Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedHarry MaguireRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Speculation has been rife that the Uruguay international, whom Slot criticised for his work rate against Wolves and Aston Villa in February, was left out for disciplinary reasons.Asked on Friday to clarify the situation, Slot said: “He didn’t feel himself the day before the match, and he went inside and he wasn’t able to be part of the team the day after.” Didn’t feel himself? “That can mean multiple things, yes,” Slot replied. “He didn’t feel himself.”Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreSlot confirmed the £85m club record signing would be in the squad for Sunday’s trip to Leicester.Liverpoolwill win the Premier League title with victory against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s struggling side if Arsenal lose at Ipswich.Slot was directly asked whether Núñez had a heated exchange with a member of the backroom team during Saturday’s training session. “No, he didn’t,” said Slot. “He did leave the pitch because he didn’t feel himself.” As in, he was ill? “As in he didn’t have words with a staff member.”Liverpool’s big summer has already begun, according to Slot, with the securing of the servicesof Virgil van Dijkand Mohamed Salahfor the next two years. Van Dijk claimed “a big summer” awaited Liverpool before he followed Salah in signing a new two-year contract. Slot believes retaining two world-class talents, in deals that could cost Liverpool about £90m, is a fundamental part of that strategy. He again refused to be drawn on the future of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is the only one of Liverpool’s potential free agents not to recommit and has an offer from Real Madrid.“At Liverpool there is always a big summer and it is already a big summer now,” Slot said. “By already holding on to two it is already a big summer. Let’s see what the rest of the summer will bring but it would be strange for me to say now I am not happy with the team. Maybe if we can keep that team it will already be a big summer.”Liverpool are expected to target a centre-forward and a young left-back but, like last summer, Slot does not believe many improvements are needed for a squad on the verge of winning the Premier League by some distance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City sit fifth having recovered from an awful end to 2024, but they have work to do in the fight for a Champions League spot that may have a bearing on who they can attract this summer.“It depends on the players we want and whether they just have one option,” Guardiola said. “If they have many, I’m pretty sure the players take a look at the ones in the Champions League, of course.”Manchester City may now be just another very good team | Jonathan WilsonRead moreAsked if City have different lists for whether they qualify for the Champions League, the manager said: “No. In the conversations with the club, the club don’t have one list for the Champions League and one list for a relegation battle.“Maybe players come anyway and there are other ones who say they don’t want to go because of no Champions League. I don’t know. I didn’t speak with one player potentially for the next season, so I don’t know.”As well as affecting arrivals, a lack of Champions League football could mean some players eye a move elsewhere. But that prospect is not in Guardiola’s mind, with Saturday’s trip to Everton followed by another Premier League match at home to Aston Villa before next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.“They have contracts,” the City manager said. “Except Kevin [De Bruyne], all the other have contracts. The club and organisation decide what is the best. Now I’m not … The club is working of course behind the scenes what they have to do, but I’m concerned about these six games and FA Cup. “After that one week, 10 days off, fifth of June start again with seven days before flying to the United States and preparing for the [Club] World Cup.”The goalkeeper Ederson will miss Saturday’s game at Everton with a groin problem, but Phil Foden and Manuel Akanji could return for a match in which James McAtee will be hoping to retain his starting place. The 22-year-old marked his first Premier League start for the club with a goal in last weekend’s5-2 turnaround against Crystal Palaceand is subject of interest with his deal expiring next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only did Watford score – to make it just the 14th of Burnley’s 43Championshipmatches in which they have conceded – but James Trafford endured a torrid afternoon preventing the hosts from becoming the first team to put two goals against him in the Championship this season.Championship updates; Holland sacked; Slot’s ‘big summer’: football – liveRead moreAlas, a collective loss ofWatfordheads precipitated a flurry of cards and in effect brought the game to a premature end, allowing the thoughts of Scott Parker’s side to return once again to potential top-flight football.By the time Watford were reduced to nine men soon after the hour mark, they had relinquished their early lead and found themselves 2-1 down to goals from Zian Flemming and Josh Brownhill. Whether they could have found a route back with parity of numbers will remain unknown.While Watford’s fans made their feelings towards the referee Matt Donohue clear at full time, Tom Cleverley laid the blame firmly at his senior players as the game descended into mayhem with 11 second-half cards issued, including those crucial two reds in the space of nine minutes.Given he had already been booked, Moussa Sissoko’s decision to return Flemming’s gentle push with a heftier shove of his own was nothing short of stupidity from the captain. Edo Kayembe could count himself slightly harder done, shown a second yellow when he put his arm out to fend off a challenge and inadvertently connected with Marcus Edwards’ neck.“We were certainly the bull and they were the matador,” said Cleverley. “We need to be more streetwise. I didn’t think it would be Moussa and Edo making those mistakes.“It’s disappointing because the performance in the first half was some of the best football we’ve produced this season. We certainly lost our head a little bit and have to learn from that. We can look at ourselves for why we ended up with nine men, and can’t point too many fingers at the referee. There will be no complaints from us with the red cards.”In fact, Watford still managed to threaten despite their significant numerical disadvantage, butBurnleystood firm. Their unbeaten league run now stands at an extraordinary 30 games and it is increasingly difficult to envisage anything preventing their promotion. Victory at home against third-placed Sheffield United on Easter Monday will secure a Premier League return.View image in fullscreenEdo Kayembe protests after receiving Watford’s second red card of the match.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA“We started a little bit slowly,” Parker said. “I thought we reacted very, very well once they got their nose in front. Overall I’m delighted. We came here for three points and managed to walk away with them. It’s a massive game on Monday night.”Considering Burnley’s prowess, the Malian teenager Mamadou Doumbia must have been shocked by the ease with which he was allowed to nod a fine looping cross from the 20th-birthday boy Rocco Vata past a full-stretch Trafford. Burnley’s wait goes on to match Port Vale’s Football League record of 30 clean sheets, set in the 1953-54 Third Division North.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf that goal came as a shock, it was matched only by disbelief that Watford – and Kayembe in particular – did not double their lead. Having missed a prime opportunity to nod in when totally unmarked at the edge of the six-yard box, the Democratic Republic of the Congo midfielder then saw Trafford tip his 25-yard rocket on to the underside of the bar – a wonder save both managers hailed as world class – before the Championship player of the season contender beat away a third Kayembe shot.Alas, between those efforts, Burnley had found an equaliser, Jaidon Anthony whipping in a pinpoint cross from the left for Flemming to head home. The visitors went ahead just before the hour when Brownhill nodded in Hannibal Mejbri’s knockdown from a couple of yards. Then followed the two red-card flashpoints.As Burnley pushed, Egil Selvik did wonderfully to deny Brownhill a second from point-blank range, before the nine men of Watford somehow manufactured a stirring effort in the closing stages.First, CJ Egan-Riley produced a magnificent last-ditch tackle to deny Vakoun Bayo when he was played through on goal, and then Trafford dived full stretch to keep out Ryan Andrews’ long-range strike. What might Watford have managed with all their players on the pitch?Burnley could not care less. As their fans joyously sang, they are (almost certainly) going up.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipWatfordBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Chris Wilder’s side had surprisingly lost their last three games in a hugely damaging blow to their automatic promotion hopes. But Gustavo Hamer’s typically impish first-half opener and Ben Brereton Díaz’s late strike were enough to revive home spirits on a soggy evening at Bramall Lane.Crucially, victory lifted United back to within five points of Burnley, whowon 2-1 at Watfordearlier in the day, ahead of the Blades’ important trip to Turf Moor on Easter Monday.Victory in east Lancashire would keep Wilder’s team in the hunt for a top-two finish and they will head across the Pennines knowing that nothing less than three points will do.Oxford United v Leeds: Championship – liveRead more“When you lose games you’re expected to win, getting over the line with that first win again is the hardest,” said Wilder after beating struggling Cardiff. “To get back to winning ways – with our 27th win of the season – was important.“There were some good performances out there but we needed the result more than anything and we got it. We’ve got to set the team up in the right way on Monday and it’s going to be one hell of a game. We’re going to have to produce a performance and we’ll go into the game as chasers – Burnley will go into it as big favourites.”United did enough, just, against Cardiff although this was no vintage display. Then again, it was probably never going to be after their recent wobble which nobody saw coming.Wilder has seen his men lose at Oxford, at home to Millwall, and then againat Plymouth last weekend. The United manager, a fierce competitor, clashed with Argyle players and coaching staff after the 2-1 reverse at Home Park which led to both clubs being charged with misconduct by the Football Association.The recent run of Wilder’s team had clearly dampened spirits among the Bramall Lane faithful and the miserable weather hardly helped lift the gloom. The atmosphere was flat and the swagger that United have played with for much of the season was again missing. Passes were undercooked, overhit or simply misplaced as Cardiff had few problems keeping their hosts at bay.View image in fullscreenGustavo Hamer beats goalkeeper Ethan Horvath from close range to open the scoring for Sheffield United against Cardiff.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/PACardiff threatened on the counterattack and midway through the first half but it came to nothing and from there United broke upfield. On-loan Crystal Palace winger Jesurun Rak-Sakyi showed impressive skill to outfox the Cardiff captain, Callum O’Dowda, on halfway. Rak-Sakyi drove at the heart of the visitors’ defence inside the right channel before failing to get his shot away when inside the 18-yard box.In the 33rd minute, Tyrese Campbell latched on to a clever pass from Hamer and struck a left-foot shot which deflected off a Cardiff defender. It fell kindly to the onrushing Hamer, whose deft touch with the outside of his right boot sent the ball pass Ethan Horvath from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neil Warnock has even been linked with a dramatic return to Cardiff as a replacement for Riza before Monday’s must-win home meeting with Oxford.Riza, who was forced to apologise earlier in the week after labelling Cardiff supporters “clueless”, said of the abuse: “I’m very sad about it. But I need to take it on the chin and be strong for my players.”As Cardiff fight desperately to stay in the division, Wilder and his players can prepare to face Burnley with renewed hope of maybe, just maybe, escaping it automatically.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedCardiff Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Thompson, who retired at the age of 29 in 2019, was diagnosed with ­cancer for a third time last year.His former club said in a statement: “Rochdale Football Club is devastated to learn of the passing of Joe Thompson. Joe, who had been bravely battling cancer for a third time, passed away peacefully at home on Thursday, with his family by his side.”Thompson, who played more than 200 games for Rochdale, was first diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2013 while playing for Tranmere. He later signed for Bury and spent time on loan at Southport and Wrexham as he tried to build his match fitness following treatment. The midfielder returned to Rochdale from Carlisle in 2016 but the illness soon returned, requiring extensive treatment.Thompson announced he was cancer free in June 2017 and less than a year laterscored the goal that kept Rochdale in League One, Dale ­beating Charlton on the final day of the season.View image in fullscreenJoe Thompson celebrates after scoring for Rochdale in 2010 during his first spell with the club.Photograph: PA Wire/PAHowever, he announced his retirement two years later, saying at the time his body had been pushed “to the limit” by his illness. Last year, he was diagnosed with cancer for a third time, with stage four lymphoma which had spread to his lungs.Thompson joined Manchester United’s academy when he was just nine before he joined Rochdale in 2005.In their statement, Rochdale continued: “We first knew Joe primarily as a talented footballer, but we would soon grow to adore his loving, infectious personality. He faced every battle head-on, both on and off the pitch. His journey and indomitable spirit have been an inspiration for everyone who has been touched by his story.“Above all of that, Joe was a loving husband to Chantelle and an incredible father to Thailula and Athena Rae. Our thoughts are with Joe’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time.”Rochdale’s players will wear black armbands for their National League match against Altrincham on Friday.Explore more on these topicsFootballRochdaleShareReuse this content"

We’ve been getting close and tonight that was a super goal.”The icing was added by McKenna with a long-range free-kick.“These moments are very special.” said Matricciani. “I’m really pleased, after the season I might enjoy it a bit more, but we’ve still got a lot of football to play.”Together with runners-up Melbourne Victory, City now go straight into the second stage of the play-offs. Adelaide, Canberra United, Central Coast Mariners and Western United will contest the first stage with the fixtures to be determined by the rest of the weekend’s game.Earlier on Friday, underlining their decline since last season’s grand final, Sydney FC lost 2-1 at Adelaide United to conclude their worst season since the league began in 2008-09.

We got the job done and it’s a fully deserved semi-final of a big European competition.”Tottenham start the weekend 15th and face Nottingham Forest on Monday looking to avoid an 18th Premier League defeat after finishing fifth in Postecoglou’s first season. Vicario acknowledged it had been a difficult campaign but said they were delighted to deliver a crucial victory for their manager.“Of course we are because everyone suffered a lot this season,” he said. “It’s been a very tough one but now we are still alive and we want to fight for something special. It’s an important achievement. The job is not done but it’s a big win forTottenham Hotspur, for everyone, for the boss, for us players, for the staff, for the fans.

Certified paedophile,” Lamar’s track was one of a number of diss tracks issued by the rappers against each other in spring 2024. Not Like Us became the most commercially successful, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and it also won Lamar five Grammy awards including record and song of the year.In JanuaryDrake sued UMG, the label that he and Lamar share, over the song, alleging UMG “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”. UMG argued the case was “utterly without merit” and called for it to be dismissed.Drake’s legal team have now amended the lawsuit with new allegations, claiming that the Super Bowl performance, which was the most-watched half-time show ever, “further solidified the public’s belief in the truth of the allegations against Drake … Not only did streams of the recording increase significantly following these two mega-cultural events, but threats against Drake and his family did as well.”Lamar omitted the words “certified paedophile” from the performance, but included the “I hear you like ’em young” line, delivered while staring into the camera in a moment that was widely shared on social media. The omission was made, the lawsuit claims, because “everyone understands that it is defamatory to falsely brand someone a ‘certified paedophile’”. Lamar is not being sued by Drake, only UMG.UMG responded to the amendments by saying: “Drake, unquestionably one of the world’s most accomplished artists and with whom we’ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another.”Drake secured a small victory in the ongoing case earlier this month, when a judge allowed his team to access certain UMG documents as they built their case, a process known as “discovery” which UMG had attempted to block.Alongside their statement about the amendments, UMG addressed that decision, saying: “Drake will personally be subject to discovery as well. As the old saying goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’.”Drake’s team then responded in kind, saying: “Drake knows exactly what he asked for: the truth and accountability.”Elsewhere at the Super Bowl show, Serena Williams – who reportedly once dated Drake – danced on stage to Not Like Us, an appearance which was perceived by some viewers as mocking Drake. Asked by Time magazine this week whether that was the case, Williams said: “Absolutely not. I would never do that. And that was sad, that anyone would ever think that. I respect how they could … But absolutely not. I have never had negative feelings towards him. We’ve known him for so many years.”Drake and Lamar are also currently locked in another battle, for the top of the US singles chart. Lamar’s track Luther, featuring SZA, has been at No 1 for eight weeks, but Drake’s track Nokia has returned to the No 2 spot this week.Explore more on these topicsDrakeKendrick LamarUniversal MusicRapHip-hopSuper Bowl LIXNFLnewsShareReuse this content"

The two were fired within days. The Microsoft president, Brad Smith, and the former CEO Steve Ballmer were shouted down at Seattle’s Great Hall on 20 March by a current and former employee.The March event was preceded by a rally outside that also included current and former employees of the tech giant. Protesters projected a sign on to the hall’s wall saying: “Microsoft powers genocide” – a reference to Israel’s extensive use of the company’s AI and cloud computing services since 7 October 2023, as “the IDF’s insatiable demand for bombs was matched by its need for greater access to cloud computing services,”the Guardianreported.Revealed: Microsoft deepened ties with Israeli military to provide tech support during Gaza warRead moreThe rally and disruption were the latest of a growing number of protests in which employees at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington state, have urged the company to cut ties withIsrael, after discontent around the issue among some of them simmered for a year-plus on company message boards, in emails and on calls with what the company calls “workplace conflict” team members.Taken together, the protests suggest that more will follow, as well as employees deciding to leave the company altogether, according to present and past employees who spoke to the Guardian. Microsoft did not reply to a request for comment.The series of events echoes those at other tech companies, including Google, where employees have likewise protested against the company’s ties to Israel and been fired. In February, Googlechanged its AI guidelines, removing commitments not to use artificial intelligence for surveillance or weapons.Unrest on the rise in RedmondThe former Microsoft software engineer Hossam Nasr described the situation at the company as “very close to a tipping point”. He highlighted the recent events, a24 February demonstrationat the company’s first in-person town hall since early in the pandemic and a24 October lunchtime vigilfor the tens of thousands of Palestinians that Israel has killed in the last 18 months, as examples of rising discontent.The February demonstration was short-lived: as the Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, began talking up new products, five employees stood on a platform above, exposing lettering on their T-shirts that spelled out the words: “Does Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?” Within minutes, several men quietly ushered them out of the room. As for the October rally, Nasr and researcher and the data scientist Abdo Mohamed helped organize the event;both were firedshortly afterward.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft’s head office campus in Redmond, Washington state.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyThe dismissals, together with a spate of recent, in-depth articles about Microsoft’s role in Israel’s siege onGaza, have helped galvanize those in the company who are concerned about the issue, according to Nasr, the former employee Aboussad, and two current employees who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.Aboussad told the Guardian she had grown increasingly conflicted in recent months as a software engineer working in AI. After several years at the company, she said, recent reporting “showed [me] more and more Microsoft’s deep ties to the Israeli government”. AnAP reporton the use of US-made AI in Gaza, including Microsoft’s, was the “last straw because it showed that AI is being used to target and murder Palestinians … I began thinking, there’s no way I can stay at Microsoft and have clean hands,” Aboussad said.The software engineer said it was impossible to know if her work was deployed in Gaza, since the company “anonymizes” all contracts with the Israeli government. At the same time, she said: “I’m not confident my paycheck doesn’t originate from money that comes from the Israeli government.”Within days of speaking to the Guardian, Aboussad was fired. A half-dozen or so colleagues have told her they were thinking of leaving the company, she said.From Viva Engage to IRLBefore the recent, in-person protests, Microsoft employees had been mostly weighing in online about Hamas’s attack and Israel’s ongoing retaliation. Some discourse on Microsoft’s Viva Engage company message board grew contentious. One employee posted: “There is no symmetry between people who educate their children on [sic] schools to murder Jewish people and people that are just defending themselves.” Several pleas for compassion for Palestinians were met with the blunt epithet “terrorist supporters”.Employees concerned about the fate of Palestinians or critical of Israel have also been complaining about what they viewed as a double standardsince shortly after 7 October. They allege Microsoft censors their viewpoints in internal forums but does not treat supporters of Israel the same. One employee who spoke with the Guardian shared screenshots of emails from members of the company’s “Global Employee Relations Team”, whose job is to handle “complex and sensitive matters, conduct investigations and manage workplace conflict”, according toMicrosoft.One email details an employee complaint over the use of terms such as “ethnic cleansing” on Viva Engage, to describe Israel’s actions in Gaza. Another message underlines the need to follow “company values” like “respect and kindness to each other” when posting about Israel and Gaza or the West Bank. On 16 November 2023, Microsoft blocked employees from posting in the message board’s “All Company” channel altogether, which broadcasts to all of Microsoft’s 400,000 employees and vendors.View image in fullscreenIsraeli army Merkava main battle tanks move along the border fence with the northern Gaza Strip on March 18, 2025.Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP via etty ImagesThe tenor of online, internal activism changed over the course of 2024, said Nasr. In the months following 7 October, many employees with concerns about events in Gaza focused on Microsoft’s public statements and circulated a petition urging the company to publicly call for a ceasefire. But their attention gradually turned to the company’s own business practices, he said. By mid-year, Nasr and others were organizing “No Azure for Apartheid” a reference to Microsoft’s Azure suite of cloud computing and AI products. The group gathers signatures from fellow employees on a petition urging the company to cancel its cloud computing and AI contracts with the Israeli military and to disclose its ties to the country’s government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dropsite shared the documents with the Guardian, leading toanother story, and with+972 magazine,an Israeli outlet. A month later, on 18 February, theAP publishedits own reporting. This run of detailed, in-depth reporting fueled the simmering concerns among some Microsoft employees. The day after the AP’s investigation published, according to screenshots of Viva Engage messages, an employee asked senior leadership about the articles, wondering whether “Microsoft has completely abandoned its … Human Rights Statements?”The post notes that Microsoft’s human rights commitments include “champion[ing] the positive role of technology across the globe” and “reduce[ing] the risk of harm”.“However, this AP investigation clearly shows the AI technology we provide directly enables Gaza’s destruction,” the post reads. By the next morning, the post was removed from the chat.The handful of articles has been “absolutely critical” to offline organizing efforts, said Anna Hattle, who has been with the company nearly five years. This is particularly true since “a lot of tech workers exist in a bubble, and Microsoft wants to keep it that way. An employee who doesn’t know their work is being used for AI weapons isn’t going to do anything about it.” At work and at rallies, she said, “individual conversations with [fellow employees]” helps spread information contained in the coverage.View image in fullscreenA national march in support of Palestinians and against Morocco’s normalisation of ties with Israel, in the capital Rabat on 6 April 2025.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesNasr said that No Azure for Apartheid also worked with Boycott, Divest, Sanctions (BDS) to add Microsoft to its list of boycott campaigns. BDS announced thecampaign3 April, highlighting how the “Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements.”At the same time, one Microsoft employee told the Guardian she was “exhausted” by the struggle to draw attention to what she sees as a betrayal of the company’s stated values in its contracts with Israel. As an example, she cited an event in which the Palestinian journalistAhmed Shihab-Eldinwas invited in November 2023, to speak to employees. Israeli employees filed reports alleging that the organizers were antisemitic, and the company cancelled the event. She also pointed to the back and forth on Viva Engage, including one screenshot that showed an employee calling Palestinians “Killers. Terrorists. Monsters.”Other employees have already left. On 4 December, Angela Yu sent an email to nearly 30,000 employees announcing her resignation. “I joined Microsoft with the belief that my work will advance technology ‘for the good of humanity’,” she wrote. Yu highlighted the recent reporting on Microsoft’s ties to Israel and said: “It hurts my conscience to know that the products you and I work on are enabling the Israeli military to accelerate its project of ethnic cleansing.”Yu went on to urge anyone reading to sign “No Azure for Apartheid’s” petition. She noted that the company had dropped business contracts for ethical reasons before – includingin 1986,when it cut ties with South Africa over apartheid.At the time, Microsoft’s global sales were about $100m, according to contemporaneous news coverage – or less than the current value of one contract between the tech company and Israel’s ministry of defense.The “exhausted” employee said these numbers point to the difficulty of protesting against Microsoft’s presence in Israel. The company is “a money machine”, she said. “All they care about is money. AI and work, work, work.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world’s most popular YouTuber, Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, also played at the Wembley game.Donaldson, who is touted to become the Google-owned video sharing platform’s first billionaire creator, sparked a bidding war for his$100m (£75m) TV debut Beast Games, which recently set the record as the most expensive reality show.The success of the show, a take on Netflix’s hit Squid Game that reportedly provided Amazon with its biggest-ever subscriber uptake, has MrBeast touting the next two series at $150m a pop.When the Sidemen appeared at a recent Netflix event that showcased this year’s programming highlights, one member quipped that they had signed up with Netflix “for the money”.View image in fullscreenOlajide Olatunji (KSI), Percy Kiangebeni (PK Humble) and Simon Minter (Minter) in the second series of Inside.Photograph: NetflixJordan Schwarzenberger, the Sidemen’s manager, says: “Creators are looking to evolve and enhance the level of what they are doing and finding partners to help them do that. Beast Games, Inside, you need partners to fund ambition. There is only so much you can-self fund, self-run, it’s about how can we elevate the production. [These deals] are another string to the bow and a sign of growing ambition.”Netflix continues to power ahead too, and on Thursday revealedquarterly revenue of $10.54bn, passing expectations. The company has forecast revenue will rise to $11.04bn in the three months to the end of June, “driven primarily by membership growth and higher pricing”.Long gone are the early days ofYouTubewhen wanting to create a business as a creator or influencer was viewed with scepticism, and subscribers were notched up with budget content filmed on low-tech mobile phones.View image in fullscreenJake Paul’s boxing match against Mike Tyson last year was the most-streamed sporting event ever.Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today SportsMrBeast spendsmore than $1m to create each video, watched by his 375 million subscribers, while Sidemen has a production team of more than 100.“The internet is now mainstream media and we are also really seeing the quality of content on YouTube entering a new level,” says Brandon Baum, a British YouTuber specialising in visual effects who hasmore than 15 million subscribers.“Every video we create takes four to 10 weeks, and a team size of five to 15 people. I have a team of 30. They all come from a TV background. The skills that creators have learned for YouTube audiences now does apply to other areas and platforms. This is the first time I’ve really seen other broadcasters, streamers and studios really embrace it.”The quality of content and, equally importantly, the vast, mostly young global audiences the top creators have amassed have become a must-have for broadcasters and streamers looking to boost subscriptions and viewers.Despite the eye-watering price tag of Beast Games, on which Amazon reportedly still made a $100m profit, the cost of getting creators on to television is typically a fraction of the budgets needed for major films and premium TV shows featuring A-list casts and top quality production.“They want something from each other,” says Ben Woods, a creator economy analyst at MIDiA Research. “There are really big creators who aremainstream intellectual property in their own right nowand they want to fully exploit that.“With that comes audiences who will follow and engage with them regardless of the platform they are on. That is why Wembley sold out for a creator football match, and the Tyson fight did such good numbers for Netflix. For mainstream media and streamers they represent an effective way of getting younger viewers on to their platform and watching their content.”The blurring and merging of YouTube and its thriving creator economy with TV has been coming for some time. The platform is the most streamed service on smart TVs in the US, according to Nielsen.And last month Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief executive, said TV screens had officially overtaken mobile phones and desktop computers as the primary device for viewing the platform’s content in the US.YouTube says that between 2021 and 2023 it paid more than $70bn to creators, artists and media companies. And for those who have made it big – Forbes lists MrBeast as theworld’s most successful internet creator, making an estimated $85m last year – the commercial opportunities appear almost endless.View image in fullscreenForbes estimates that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson made $85m last year.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APMrBeast has lent his brand to everything from clothing toburgers, and even joined a consortium considering apotential bid for TikTok’s US operations, which faces the threat of closure from a federal law if it remains owned by a Chinese parent company.And the Sidemen havealmost notched up a Christmas No 1, produced trading cards, opened a chain ofrestaurants called Sides, which has inspired a frozen food and sauce range, developed the vodka brand XIX and launched a $25m venture capital fund called Upside.“The YouTube business is the engine room for everything else,” says Schwarzenberger.MIDiA Research forecasts that by 2031 video creators globally will make almost $64bn in revenue from their core businesses, compared with the $30bn the market was valued at three years ago.The lure of fame and fortune, the growth of YouTube and platforms such as TikTok, and the increasing ease of producing content through the introduction of technology such as artificial intelligencew, will continue to fuel a boom in those looking to become creators.By 2031 there will be an estimated 696 million video creators of all stripes, up from 239 million in 2022, according to MIDiA.“The creator economy is still a young thing and only a minority will become superstars,” says Woods. “With all the entertainment options out there, there is only a finite amount of audience time. The next layer down are probably able to make a living out of it. And then there are those where it is more of a side hustle, or who unable to push through that threshold to hit that tipping point of audience on their platform.”YouTube does not reveal revenue figures for specific creators but says that in the UK there are more than 80,000 YouTube channels that have more than 10,000 subscribers, more than 15,000 channels that have 100,000-plus and more than 2,000 channels that pass the 1 million-subscribers mark.“I think there has been this penny slowly starting to drop over the last year in the TV industry,” says Schwarzenberger. “There are only a handful of creators with the infrastructure and professional operations that can engage at a top level. We are the guinea pigs of this [transition to TV] and it is going to raise confidence among creators that maybe they can do it too.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeNetflixInternetReality TVTelevisionGoogleTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The images frequently depict men of colour, often armed with knives, attacking women or police officers.Antonio Nicita, a PD senator, said: “In the images published by Salvini’s party and generated by AI there are almost all categories of hate speech, from racism and xenophobia to Islamophobia.“They are using AI to target specific categories of people – immigrants, Arabs – who are portrayed as potential criminals, thieves and rapists.“These images are not only violent but also deceptive: by blurring the faces of the victims it is as if they want to protect the identity of the person attacked, misleading users into believing the photo is real. These are images that incite hatred.”“This is serious,” said Francesco Emilio Borrelli, an MP for the Greens and Left Alliance. “AI generates content based on our instructions, and in this case it was clearly instructed to generate images of black people robbing an elderly woman or a frightened woman. It is part of their strategy to create fear among citizens.”A spokesperson for Salvini’s party confirmed that “some of the pictures” featured on their social media channels had been “generated digitally”.In a statement it said: “The point is not the image. The point is the fact. Each post is based on true reports from Italian newspapers, with names, dates and places.“If reality seems too harsh, do not blame those who report it, but those who make it so. If it is about a crime, it is hard to accompany the news with cheerful or reassuring images.”View image in fullscreenA spokesperson for the League party, which is led by Matteo Salvini (pictured), said ‘some of the pictures’ had been ‘generated digitally’.Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPASalvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, said the League pictures bore “all the hallmarks of artificial intelligence”.“They are out‑of‑context photos in which the subject is in the foreground and the rest is entirely blurred. What worries me is that these AI‑generated images are becoming ever more realistic.”The complaint to Agcom cites several examples of images thought to have been digitally generated, saying they have appeared alongside the branding of reputable mainstream media outlets which have reported on the crimes mentioned but not used images of the alleged perpetrators.In one case, the League’s post says: “A foreigner attacks the train conductor” and pairs the text with an image of a man of colour with his fist raised.Theoriginal headline in Il Resto del Carlinoreads: “He attacks the [female] train conductor and sparks panic on board.” The article makes no mention of the suspect’s nationality beyond calling him a “foreigner”. There was no photograph of the alleged attack.Another image featured in the complaint shows a mother and father in Islamic dress appearing to shout angrily at a girl, “thus feeding racial and Islamophobic prejudice”.Il Giorno, the newspaper that is cited, makes no reference in its report to the religion of either the family or the girl allegedly abused by her parents, beyond saying the child had attended Arabic language school. There was no photograph of the family.The use of AI‑generated images forpropaganda by far‑right parties is a growing phenomenonthat entered the mainstream around last year’s European elections, when images designed to stoke fears over immigration or demonise leaders such as Emmanuel Macron began circulating on social media.“Then came the American elections withDonald Trump and Elon Musk, who effectively normalised this trend,” said Romano.“Today we see that far‑right parties have not only continued to generate fake images for propaganda but have also increased their use at a time when AI tools have improved content quality, making the phenomenon all the more worrying.”Despite social platforms being obliged to take steps to anticipate these risks – for example by adding a label specifying that an image has been generated by AI – Romano says that, in practice, this mechanism is almost always ineffective.Asked if the League was aware that the images could generate hate speech, a spokesperson for Salvini’s party said: “We are sorry, but our solidarity goes to the victims, not the perpetrators.“If denouncing crimes committed by foreigners means ‘xenophobia’, perhaps the problem is not the word but those who use it to censor debate. We will continue to denounce, with strong words and images, what others prefer to ignore.’’If Agcom deems the flagged content offensive it can, under the EU’s Digital Services Act, order posts to be taken down, accounts to be removed and social media platforms to be fined for failing to police user behaviour.In 2023,Agcom fined Meta€5.85m (£5m) and ordered the removal of dozens of accounts for breaching the ban on gambling advertising.Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, was approached for comment. A spokesperson for X said: “We are not under any obligation legally to label every AI-generated image. It’s pretty clear these posts are straightforward politicking.“Rest assured, we believe that it is critical to maintain the authenticity of the conversation on X, and we make sure that we are well equipped to fight against any manipulated media – including the rising trend of ‘deepfakes’ – and put visible labels on any such content that has been debunked by a credible source.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ItalyThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

UK Biobank was set up 20 years ago by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome with the mission to create the most detailed source of health data for researchers worldwide. The dream became a reality thanks to half a million volunteers across the UK.Researchers from academia, charity and industry, and from more than 60 countries, including China, are using UK Biobank data to study the entire spectrum of human health, producing thousands of groundbreaking studies. This is leading to new ways to predict, prevent and target diseases.Our participants volunteered to advance health research. They have given their explicit consent for researchers around the world to study their de-identified health data, and we know their satisfaction in the results. Many have emphasised the importance of their GP data being analysed too, which is why we are now working with theNHSto access primary care data in accordance with the participants’ explicit consent.As with any large-scale database, a fine balance is needed to promote access while ensuring data privacy. Our protective measures have been overwhelmingly successful at achieving this aim. The scientific discoveries that have been enabled, combined with the negligible levels of improper use over 20 years, demonstrate that UK Biobank navigates this balance successfully.Data locked away benefits no one, but when data is shared responsibly and carefully with bright minds everywhere, we get results that will give us all a healthier future.ProfRory CollinsChief executive and principal investigator, UK BiobankExplore more on these topicsMedical researchHealthData protectionNHSPrivacylettersShareReuse this content"

Your lawnmower might do a good job of keeping your garden in check, but keeping your patio, decking and outdoor furniture spick and span can take hours, especially if you rely on a bucket of soapy water and a scrubbing brush.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s where the pressure washer comes in. These handy tools connect to your hose pipe and squirt water at any cleaning problem. Stubborn and unpleasant stains, from bird dirt to years of neglect, can be lifted from your garden’s hard-wearing surfaces in seconds. With the right attachments, you can also use your pressure washer to hose down cars, bikes and boats.At a glanceBest pressure washer overall:Ava Go P40£149.90 at AvaBest budget pressure washer:Kärcher K 2 Classic£72 at ArgosBest cordless pressure washer:Stihl Rea 60 Plus£224.99 at CharliesBest for high-power deep cleaning:Bosch UniversalAquatak 135£135 at B&QWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing all sorts of cleaning gadgets for years. I’ve testedvacuum cleaners, mops, hard-floor cleaners, carpet cleaners,window vacsand various robots designed to do jobs automatically, from internal cleaning to lawn mowing. I’ve got a keen nose for a labour-saving device, and I live in a busy household that never seems short of a dirty surface to test things on, including an extensive patio area and a filthy car. There was a perfect alignment of dirty jobs crying out to test these pressure washers on.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I found a neighbour with a deck that hadn’t had a deep clean for a few years.’Photograph: Andy ShawI gathered eight pressure washers of various types and prices from a range of manufacturers, and put each through the same tests. First, I used each washer to clean one of the dirty paving slabs at the side of my house. This is where the dog gets washed after walks and it’s a well-trodden thoroughfare, making it a dark and grimy corridor.Next, I wanted to test the washers on decking. Unfortunately, I don’t have a deck of my own, so I had to find someone else’s to clean. Fortunately, a shoutout on our neighbourhood WhatsApp group found a neighbour with a deck that hadn’t had a deep clean for a few years, so it was primed and ready to challenge the washers. This was by far the wettest job of the lot – but my neighbour was delighted with the extreme hose down I gave it.I then washed the wheels of my car. As with most cars, it has only four, so I washed half of each wheel with each washer, so I could compare their work.Where appropriate, I tried the various attachments and settings that I hadn’t used previously on other jobs. It included cleaning out empty water butts, clearing a few years of built-up algae off my whirligig and testing the supplied foam cannon on the rest of my car.All of the pressure washers were supplied by their manufacturers, most of whom will pick them up when I’ve finished. Any that don’t get collected will be given toWorkaid, a Chesham-based charity that refurbishes tools of all kinds. It donates them to training centres and self-help organisations in Africa and the UK, to help young people develop new skills or start their own businesses.The best pressure washers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy ShawBest pressure washer overall:Ava Go P40View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£149.90 at Ava£149.90 at AmazonAva may not be a household name in the UK but the Norwegian pressure washer manufacturer has entered the market with affordable products that are designed to last. The P40 is a great entry-level device that should last for years, with a 10-year warranty to back it up.Why we love itIt’s clear that the design focused on how the product would be used. It feels better built than similarly priced rivals, from the kink-free steel-lined pressure hose to robust but easy-to-release clips that hold all the parts together.My favourite feature is the extendable lance. At the push of a button, the lance can extend from 84cm to 116cm. If you’re working on cleaning a floor, there’s no question this will reduce the amount of bending you have to do.The kit I reviewed came with two nozzles (one variable for adjusting the width and pressure of the cleaning area, and another turbo nozzle for particularly tough jobs) and a foam cannon. Matching this with Ava’s detergents made car cleaning a breeze, and it performed well in all my tests.It’s a shame that …it’s not as powerful as the most powerful products we’ve tested here, so it can be bettered for stubborn dirt on the hardest surfaces.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length:6mWeight:4.5kgCorded or cordless:cordedCleaning power:11,313 cleaning units (6.5 litres a minute x 1,740PSI)Attachments included:zoom lance, turbo nozzle, vario nozzle, foam cannonWarranty:10 yearsBest budget pressure washer:Kärcher K 2 ClassicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£72 at ArgosKärcher sells more pressure washers than any other manufacturer, with the low price of the K 2 indicating why. None of the other washers we tested were as affordable as this compact unit.Why we love itIts affordability makes it ideal if you want something quick for occasional use. Considering the low price you’re still getting a surprisingly effective cleaner. It doesn’t have the clever design and high build quality of corded rivals from Ava and Bosch, but there’s been no skimping on raw cleaning power.It’s a lesser specification but still comes with two nozzles, which are pre-attached to their own lances. One produces a lighter spray at a fixed angle, while the other is a turbo nozzle that sends out a powerful rotating jet. The turbo nozzle was good at cleaning paving slabs and the lighter nozzle did good work on my car wheels.It’s a shame that …you get what you pay for in build quality: the pressure hose wants to stay curled up, no matter what you do with it, and the unit is so light that it’s prone to falling over.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length:3mWeight:3.2kgCorded or cordless:cordedCleaning power:9,573 cleaning units (6 litres a minute x 1,595PSI)Attachments included:single spray lance, dirt blaster lanceWarranty:five yearsBest cordless pressure washer:Stihl Rea 60 PlusView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£219 at Just Lawnmowers£224.99 at CharliesMoving from corded to cordless washers usually incurs an increase in cost and a decrease in pressure. But while the mega battery for Stihl’s Rea 60 Plus is pricey, it can push out water at pressures that rival corded tools.Why we love itDuring testing, the Rea 60 Plus surprised me with its high pressure, which is closer to corded levels than the other battery-powered washers we tested. Although full-pelt washing diminishes the battery rapidly, Stihl has added a power dial that lets you tame the jet. That means you can wash at a lower pressure for longer, and this lower pressure is useful for more delicate tasks as well. You can also control the flow with the handy nozzle, which lets you choose between three jet types (fan, rotary and cleaning agent, with the latter fed from a hose on the side of the main unit).What I really admired about the Rea 60 Plus was how neatly it all packs away, largely thanks to its pressure hose reel. When you start you can just pull out what you need, up to its 5m length. The storage clips for the dismantled lance and gun and the lack of a power cord also help keep things neat and tidy.It’s a shame that …although the Rea 60 Plus is affordable, it doesn’t come with abatteryorcharger, which adds another £197 to the cost.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehicles, away from homePressure hose length:5mWeight:6.7kgCorded or cordless:cordlessQuoted battery run time:25minsCleaning power:8,485 cleaning units (4.5 litres a minute x 1,885PSI)Attachments included:3-in-1 nozzleWarranty:three yearsBest for high-power deep cleaning:Bosch UniversalAquatak 135View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£135 at B&Q£128.25 at AmazonThe Bosch UniversalAquatak 135 is a corded pressure washer that offers a good balance between high pressure, reasonable price and usable design.Why we love itWith a high maximum pressure and a high flow rate, the cleaning power of the UniversalAquatak 135 isn’t really in question. In my tests it quickly lifted dirt from every surface I pointed it at.There’s a little assembly to be done but it’s nothing too arduous and doesn’t require any tools: it’s just a case of clipping the wheels on to the unit and assembling the handle mechanism. Despite having wheels, it’s not particularly large or heavy, so there’s no problem lifting it and carrying it around.It comes with a single nozzle that can be rotated to select one of three jet settings – fan, rotary and pencil – to provide various pressures to suit your requirements.It’s a shame that …I found the long 7m pressure hose had a strong desire to stay curled up, and it doesn’t have the extendable lance or extra-long warranty of the Ava P40.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length:7mWeight:6.9kgCorded or cordless:cordedCleaning power:14,685 cleaning units (7.5 litres a minute x 1,958PSI)Attachments included:3-in-1 nozzle, 450ml detergent nozzleWarranty:three yearsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

In the garden, you can connect your hose directly to the lance, so there’s no pressure hose to worry about, but you do then have to drag your hose around. I didn’t find this to be any more of a problem than using it for regular watering, though.It comes with its own hose, too, which you can connect up and dip into any water supply, further enhancing its portability. This would be great for washing down equipment after a boating trip, for example, where there’s a plentiful supply of water. You could also use it with captured rainwater from a water butt or similar.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t provide the same kind of pressure as the winners, although it’s certainly the right tool for the right job. The lack of pressure wasn’t particularly apparent in my cleaning tests, but you will notice it when tackling the toughest jobs.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehicles, bikes, away from home;pressurehose length:N/A;weight:2.7kg;corded or cordless:cordless;quoted battery runtime:24mins;cleaning power:1,091 cleaning units (3 litres a minute x 360PSI);attachments included:3-in-1 nozzle, 6m siphoning hose, 18V battery and charger;warranty:three yearsBosch UniversalAquatak 36V-100View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£391 (including battery and charger) at Bosch£177.95 (no battery) at AmazonBest for:an affordable cordless pressure washerThis battery-powered Bosch sits somewhere between the Stihl and the Ryobi in terms of its cleaning power. It doesn’t have the full-pelt power of the Stihl but it’s more affordable. And while not quite as portable as the Ryobi, it does at least have the option of portability, whether you’re using it around the garden or flinging it in the car to take elsewhere.It comes with much the same equipment as the mains-powered Bosch, including the handy three-in-one nozzle and a clip-on detergent tank you can use to quickly cover a dirty item in cleaning foam.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not quite as portable as the Ryobi or as neat as the Stihl.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, vehicles, away from home;pressurehose length:4m;weight:4.7kg;corded or cordless:cordless;quoted battery run time:45mins;cleaning power:4,496 cleaning units (3.1 litres a minute x 1,450PSI);attachments included:3-in-1 nozzle;warranty:three yearsKärcher K 3 ClassicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£130 at Argos£129 at AmazonBest for:a better-built version of the K 2If you’ve got a little more to spend than the sub-£100 for the K 2, then the K 3 is a level up in build quality. The pressure and flow rate are improved, so you get a more powerful clean, though I didn’t notice a huge difference in my tests. However, the device itself is a definite step up, with a longer pressure hose, wheels for dragging it about and an extendable handle.Otherwise, it’s largely the same as the K 2, but better balanced and less prone to falling over.It didn’t make the final cut because …if you’re moving up from the K 2 and can afford it, the Ava P40 and the Bosch UniversalAquatak 135 are better options for only a few pounds more.Suitable for:patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, vehicles;pressurehose length:6m;weight:3.8kg;corded or cordless:corded;cleaning power:11,023 cleaning units (6.3 litres a minute x 1,740PSI);attachments included:single spray lance, dirt blaster lance;warranty:five yearsTitan TTB1800PRWView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw£79.99 at ScrewfixBest for:affordable powerThe Titan TTB1800PRW from Screwfix is a no-nonsense pressure washer that’s affordable and powerful. In fact, it’s the most powerful washer I tested, yet is available from Screwfix for less than £100, with only the less powerful Kärcher K 2 Classic beating it on price.Once I’d assembled the washer (see below) it made short work of the cleaning tasks I set it. It comes with two nozzles and I generally preferred the power nozzle over the other, as it did a significantly better job of lifting off dirt. It was also the only model to come with a patio cleaning brush tool, though I found this to be too light to be of much use and preferred the roto nozzle during testing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it took more assembly than any others, requiring a screwdriver to put together some of the parts. I didn’t like the extendable handle: it doesn’t lock into place and can catch you out when reaching to pick it up.Suitable for:patio, garden tools, vehicles;pressurehose length:6m;weight:7.1kg;corded or cordless:corded;cleaning power:14,891cleaning units (7.3 litres a minute x 2,031PSI);attachments included:vario fan nozzle, roto nozzle, patio cleaner;warranty:two yearsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy ShawHow do you use a pressure washer?Pressure washers are simple tools that accept water from a water supply, build up the pressure using an electric motor, and then squirt out the water again from a gun attached to a separate hose (called a pressure hose).All the washers I tested use a universal garden hose attachment that lets them easily hook up to your water supply. My garden hose has a Hozelock connector, which fitted perfectly on to every model, so check yours is compatible. Once the water is connected and the tap is on, you can power up the washer either by connecting it to the mains or charging and slotting in a battery.Then you simply select an appropriate attachment or setting, depending on the pressure you want, and point it at the dirt. The gun has a trigger so you can start and stop the water as you please without returning to the main unit or closing the tap.What safety equipment do you need?Keep in mind that dirt and debris can fly around when squirted at high pressure. Safety glasses, long trousers and proper shoes should be worn. Gloves are a good idea, and you might want to deck yourself out in some waterproof clothing.What is a good pressure for home use?Different jobs require different amounts of pressure. Heavy-duty dirty work, such as blasting a concrete paving slab, is best done with high-pressure washers that can produce pressure in excess of 100 bar (1,450PSI). You can get decent results from lower-pressure washers, too, but it might take a bit longer.Softer surfaces, such as wooden fencing and decking, shouldn’t be attacked with the highest pressure settings of a powerful washer but can be hosed down with a less powerful spray. Washers with pressure of less than 100 bar can be used for this kind of thing. Try your washer on a small and inconspicuous area first to see how it fares before tackling the whole thing.Some jobs are best done with the pressure at a minimum, such as washing your car. Although you can still use a pressure washer for this, you should use a rinse setting, or a fan setting from a safe distance – the pressure is most intense at the tip of the nozzle. Pressure washers with foam cannon are good for covering a car with soap, which you can then rinse after it’s lifted off some of the dirt. Don’t mix detergent with your pressure washer’s main water supply, though, as this can damage the device.Are pressure washers noisy?None of the pressure washers I’ve reviewed here were particularly noisy. Your nextdoor neighbour will notice when you’re using one, but they’re quieter than lawnmowers and hedge trimmers. There’s no requirement to wear ear defenders.Andy Shaw is a freelance consumer journalist and technology addict.

This is one of the themes – and indeed the mechanics – ofLost Records, a narrative adventure about four teenage girls who develop an intense friendship in rural Michigan during the summer of 1995. In the first instalment, they form a band, discover an old shack in the woods to use as a clubhouse, and encounter a supernatural force emanating from a deep hole they discover nearby. But as autumn draws in and the girls plan a climactic rock gig, tragic secrets are uncovered.Cleverly, the story is told mostly in flashback, as the characters meet again, decades later, in their long-abandoned home town – they’re older, wiser and with new perspectives on what happened to them as teenagers. Lead character Swann, a keen photographer whose video camera provides a key game interface in the first episode, is living a solitary life, while Autumn is still filled with anxiety and Nora is now an influencer. Missing is Kat whose terminal cancer diagnosis obliterates their world at the close of part one.View image in fullscreenIncredibly poignant … Lost Records: Bloom & Rage (Tape Two).Photograph: Don’t NodWhile the first instalment focused on the excitement and hubris of the teenage characters, this is a much darker story concentrating on the adults as they pick apart their lives. Through dialogue trees and interactive memory segments you help Swann navigate the meeting, as well as moments from the past. There is less of the video camera this time. In the first part, there were multiple occasions where you had to film certain scenes, creating a nicely personal bank of footage which could be edited and reshot. There is also much less actual gameplay: an early scene where you have to pack a box and a later stealth sequence where you sneak into Kat’s bedroom are the only real moments of ludic challenge. I missed taking more of an active role.What you get instead, are some incredibly poignant narrative scenes, as the girls battle with the reality of Kat’s diagnosis and the raw ambiguity of their feelings for each other. Two moments stand out especially: Swann and Nora meeting alone one afternoon, talking and exchanging gifts, every word, every gesture, communicating a mass of unspoken feelings. Then, Swann sneaking into Kat’s bedroom and helping her cut her hair before chemotherapy takes it. This is some of the most profound, sensitively structured and emotionally resonant writing about the teenage experience of love and loss I have ever encountered in a video game.Tape Two ends on an ambiguous note, though I think this is utterly true to the experience of playing. The mysterious hole in the woods, which the characters call “the abyss”, can be interpreted as entirely symbolic, as can all the supernatural events in the game, and this is a brave, credible narrative decision. Sometimes, there are no answers, and sometimes the magic we perceived around us when we were young turns out to have been something else entirely – perhaps just friendship or imagination, or the yearning to be something in the world.The effect is like Stranger Things directed by Kelly Reichardt – a realist fantasy in which silence and ambiguity come to the fore. Lost Records is ultimately a game about love, grief and self-recrimination, and the different intensities of those forces as we age. By the end you miss the optimism and verve of those girls in the woods, as though you were one of them – and quite possibly, in a lot of ways, you were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While we fully respect the Executive’s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court’s recent decision.It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all. The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done.This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order. Moreover, the government has conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or “mistakenly” deported. Why then should it not make what was wrong, right?TheSupreme Court’s decisionremains, as always, our guidepost. That decision rightly requires the lower federal courts to give “due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”. That would allow sensitive diplomatic negotiations to be removed from public view. It would recognize as well that the “facilitation” of Abrego Garcia’s return leaves the Executive Branch with options in the execution to which the courts in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision should extend a genuine deference. That decision struck a balance that does not permit lower courts to leaveArticle IIby the wayside.The Supreme Court’s decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing. It requires the government “to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody inEl Salvadorand to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”. “Facilitate” is an active verb. It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear. The plain and active meaning of the word cannot be diluted by its constriction, as the government would have it, to a narrow term of art. We are not bound in this context by a definition crafted by an administrative agency and contained in a mere policy directive. Thus, the government’s argument that all it must do is “remove any domestic barriers to [Abrego Garcia’s] return” is not well taken in light of the Supreme Court’s command that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’srelease from custody in El Salvador.“Facilitation” does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual to the one country’s prisons that the withholding order forbids and, further, to do so in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns. “Facilitation” does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here. Allowing all this would “facilitate” foreign detention more than it would domestic return. It would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.The government is obviously frustrated and displeased with the rulings of the court. Let one thing be clear. Court rulings are not above criticism. Criticism keeps us on our toes and helps us do a better job. Court rulings can overstep, and they can further intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches. Courts thus speak with the knowledge of their imperfections but also with a sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely missed in their absence.“Energy in the [E]xecutive” is much to be respected. It can rescue government from its lassitude and recalibrate imbalances too long left unexamined. The knowledge that executive energy is a perishable quality understandably breeds impatience with the courts. Courts, in turn, are frequently attuned to caution and are often uneasy with the Executive Branch’s breakneck pace.And the differences do not end there. The Executive is inherently focused upon ends; the Judiciary much more so upon means. Ends are bestowed on the Executive by electoral outcomes. Means are entrusted to all of government, but most especially to the Judiciary by the Constitution itself.The Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraintsThe Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraints. If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” would lose its meaning.Today, both the United States and the El Salvadoran governments disclaim any authority and/or responsibility to return Abrego Garcia. We are told that neither government has the power to act. The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect. The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive’s respect for the courts. Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.It is in this atmosphere that we are reminded of President Eisenhower’s sage example. Putting his “personal opinions” aside, President Eisenhower honored his “inescapable” duty to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education II to desegregate schools “with all deliberate speed.” This great man expressed his unflagging belief that “[t]he very basis of our individual rights and freedoms is the certainty that the President and the Executive Branch of Government will support and [e]nsure the carrying out of the decisions of the Federal Courts.” Indeed, in our late Executive’s own words, “[u]nless the President did so, anarchy would result.”Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around. The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well. We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.In sum, and for the reasons foregoing, we deny the motion for the stay pending appeal and the writ of mandamus in this case. It is so ordered.This was excerpted from the order by the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit inKilmar Abrego Garcia v Kristi Noem.

But it’s dangerous to overlook the question of classFri 18 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 10.02 EDTShareSince about 2020, a number of researchers havedeterminedthat the most salient divide in politics today is the diploma divide – that is, the division between those who have a four-year college degree and those who do not. Those who have a degree are more liberal, those who don’t are less. The former tend to vote for Democrats, the latter for Republicans.There is a certain elegance to how simple and clean the picture is. And, by virtue of this tidiness, some insist that “educational polarization” is a better way to understand political shifts today than reliance on older, softer, messier ideas likesocial class. Conceptual cleanliness is certainly attractive. It’s far easier to determine who is “college educated” and who is not than it is to establish similarly defined boundaries between the working and middle classes. Yet whether we understand shifting political alignments as a function of class, as a broad social and relational concept, or education, a narrow credential category, implies a great deal about political strategy.Don’t just blame Trump – Democrats paved the way for this campus crackdown | Musa al-GharbiRead moreFor one thing, it’s not a good sign that those who wish to craft a political strategy for progressives are looking for yet more ways to make class disappear from the conversation. Traditional class concepts, by their mere mention, reveal something significant about the nature of our society. To talk about “the working class” in politics reminds us that there is a relationship between the type of work people do, their labor market position, their economic interests and their ideology. To say that a political party wins the “the working class vote” is to suggest that they persuaded these voters that they stand for the interests of the humble against the interests of the elite. Yet if we focus only on education, we risk suggesting something different altogether. If we say that a given party wins the “non-college-educated vote”, without reference to social class, we risk suggesting that political behavior is related, primarily, to intelligence or achievement.Today, many liberals are proud that their party wins the majority of college-educated voters. They see this as a sign that they are the “smart party” and that the Republicans are dumb. No doubt, there is goodevidencethat higher education itself leads to more progressive views. In this light, progressives might conclude that the only real political problem to be solved is that there aren’t enough educated voters to give Democrats a majority. Intuitively, that suggests partisans should focus on getting more people to go to college so that we might have a society where 51% of the people are college-educated liberals, at which point the “smart party” would have an absolute majority.This isn’t that far from what theDemocratshave actually tried to do over these last three decades – they’ve relied on consolidating their gains among college-educated voters and encouraged everyone else to go to college. Not only has this failed as a political strategy, it’s actually made the class conundrum worse. Saturating the labor market with more college-educated workers has weakened the wage premium for these workers and saddled them with an immense amount of debt that they are increasingly unable to pay off. That fueled a political rift when Joe Biden’s plans to forgive some of this debt were viewed by many blue-collar workers as an unfair attempt at rewarding the already well-off.And by increasing the proportion of college-educated people from20% in 1990 to over 38% in 2021, we’ve done absolutely nothing for those workers who don’t have a degree, except, in a particularly cruel irony, made it harder for them to get certain jobs that now require college credentials. Over this period those without a college degree have seen their wages stagnate or decline, and the income and wealth gap between them and their college-educated counterparts has grown wide. The very rich, meanwhile, have taken off into the exosphere, sitting on a celestial plane so high above us that they flit between the parties based on whoever they think will win.Worse still, by making education a major part of the Democratic party’s plan for achieving social uplift and economic growth, Democrats have unwittingly surrounded themselves with voters and staffers who don’t understand the world beyond their laptops. More than the wage advantage, a college education offers workers a shield from manual work, routine layoffs and the opportunity to help shape our common culture. As a result, college-educated voters are less worried about the effects of immigration as a downward pressure on their wage, they don’t fret over free trade deals and they broadly welcome cultural changes. It’s not that the Democratic party is the “smart party”, but it is the “go to college” and “learn to code” party, the party of looser immigration restrictions and cosmopolitan norms. If it’s not opposed to the economic interests of those without a college degree, it has become ambivalent about them.In fact, for a long time the Democratic party has focused its appeals on the edges of the working class (the very poor and the not-so-professional-class). As a result, it has neglected the views and interests of the great big hunk in the center of the wage distribution. By doing so, Democrats have neglected any substantive critique of the increasingly hi-tech hyper-global economy that has left working-class voters behind. Democrats are now seen as defenders of the status quo, representatives of the well-heeled and well-educated and totally unequipped to challenge Trump’s national-populist narrative.Working-class disaffection with the Democrats began with blue-collar white voters. Many liberals assumed this was the political price they had to pay for civil rights. Relatedly, they also assumed that working-class voters of color would remain loyal to the Democratic party. They haven’t. Democratic party disaffection has spread from working-class whites to working-class Latino and Black voters.What exactly will keep lower-income college-educated voters in the Democratic coalition? What does the party offer them as their economic position erodes? Meanwhile, as the wage premium for college-educated workerscontinues to shrink, there is reason to believe that college-educational attainment will stall and Democrats’ college-educated base will only get smaller.An emphasis on education just can’t fill the working-class sized hole in Democrats’ electoral coalition. If they are ever to chart their way back to power, progressives need to develop a program that addresses class grievances as class grievances.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS educationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The US is many things at the moment, but stable is not one of them. So, amid all this turmoil, how are all the Donald Trump voters feeling? Has buyer’s remorse set in? Are they starting to wonder whether voting in a convicted felon as president – a man who hasdeclared bankruptcy six times– might not have been the wisest move?Not according to the polls. Rather, the US appears to be a nation of Édith Piafs: they regretrien.I’m not saying that disillusioned Republicans don’t exist; do enough digging and you can certainly find a few. And journalists have been doing a lot of digging. During Trump’s first term, there was a steady stream of media pieces profiling the regretful Trump voter. The genre has remained popular through the first few months of Trump 2.0. But, according to a much-discussed segment by CNNsenior data reporterHarry Enten this week, polling proves that the idea of “regretful” Trump voters is “more of a media creation than anything else”.“I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, they regret what they did back in 2024. I’m here to tell you, uh-uh. Very few of them regret what they did back in 2024,” Enten said on Wednesday.Enten was referencing anew pollfrom the University of Massachusetts Amherst which found thatjust 2%of Trump voters agreed with the statement “I regret my [2024] vote and would vote differently if I could”. That’s almost half the number (3.5%) of Trump voters who said the same thing in February 2017. Meanwhile, 74% of Trump voters said they feel very confident that they made the right choice.In Trumpland, ‘defending free speech’ means one thing: submission to the president | Rafael BehrRead moreOf course, polls aren’t always reliable. Indeed, I’m going to be a little cruel and refer you back to an Enten segment from five days before the election, where the data guru looked at three 2024 polling trends that pointed to a potential victory for vice-president Kamala Harris. “If Harris wins the signs were clear as day,”he declared. In short: Mark Twain had the measure of polling when he said “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics”.Asking people whether they regret an important choice they just made is also a loaded question. It’s akin to asking them “are you a complete idiot?” So I would treat these particular polls with a dose of caution: just because people don’t actively admit to regretting their vote, it doesn’t mean that they’re not worried about the direction the country is headed in, or that they’re thrilled about Trump’s performance as president. On the contrary,Trump’s approval ratingis dropping and a lot of people are worried aboutinflationand higher prices. Everyone is feeling some pain right now.In ahyper-polarisedcountry, however, what seems to really matter to many voters isn’t how much pain they’re feeling themselves, but whether the other side is suffering more. I could cite various academic papers on the politics of resentment; I could surface endless statistics on the subject. But I think the best summation of Trumpism is a quote from a woman called Crystal Minton from back in 2019, whichwent viral afterbeing included in a New York Times report. Minton lived in a Florida town that had been ravaged by the double whammy of a hurricane and a Trump administration-instigated government shutdown, and was suffering. “I voted for [Trump], and he’s the one who’s doing this,” Minton complained. “I thought he was going to do good things. He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”Right now, however, Trump is hurting the sort of people many of his voters seem to be interested in seeing get hurt. He’s an avenging angel, wreaking vengeance on the elite institutions, scapegoats and bogeymen that the Republican party has spent years blaming for the state of the US. He’scut fundingto all the Ivy League universities he’s called “woke” and declared out of touch with American values. He’s goneafter transgender people. And he has rounded up immigrants and protesters, just as he promised he would do.Trump isn’t just doing every vindictive thing he told his supporters he was going to do: he’s trolling his detractors via nasty memes. He’s rubbing salt in their wounds. There has been what Marcus Maloney, a sociology professor at Coventry University in the UK, called a “4Chanification of American politics”. The White House Valentine’s Day post, for example, wasa poem: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you”. Cutesy font appeared above the floating heads of Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan. And a video last month posted by the White House showed a man being deported while Semisonic’s famous lyricsplayed in the background: “You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.” The cruelty is very much the point.While Trump may be hurting all the people he said he’d be hurting, there’s plenty of pain to go around. There has been a lot of anger from some of Trump’s backers in Wall Street over the volatility that the president’s tariff policy has injected into the stock market. Some of hisbillionaire backers, such as the investor Bill Ackman, have been screaming bloody murder. But for a lot of Trump’s backers, the fluctuations of the stock market have no immediate effect on their lives. The top 10% of Americans hold93% of all stocks. This is what happens when inequality reaches record levels: you get a group of people with nothing to lose, which means they have little to regret. You get people happy to burn the whole system down.None of this is to say that Trump voters are immune to remorse. With his tariff plan, he is just getting started. The president may be good at bluster, but even his most diehard supporters are going to realise quite quickly that food prices – which Trump promised to lower on the campaign trail – are not, in fact, going down. When the price of basic goods keep rising, there’s only so long you can keep feeding people obvious lies. Perhaps the Trumpers won’t get quite so much of a dopamine rush from “owning the libs” when they can’t afford to own anything else.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpRepublicansTrump tariffsUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

We still have 45 months to go. Through his antics, the US president is normalizing, even encouraging, intense selfishness and disregard for others. The clearest example is USAID: if the richest, most powerful country in the world thinks it’s a waste to give a tiny fraction of its income to the poorest, worst off people in the world, you must be a real sucker if you care for others.Finally, the Trump regime has met its match | Robert ReichRead moreThis comes on top of a longer trend of declining western happiness and disconnection. In 2012, the United States ranked 11th in theWorld Happiness Report. This year, it was 24th. In 2023, one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone. That figure has risen 53% in just two decades.These short- and long-term trends are no coincidence.New researchshows that unhappy people vote for populists, those who promise to rip the system apart. Importantly, it also finds that trust explains which type of populists unhappy people support: low-trust people vote for far-right parties, whereas high-trust people go far left. Therefore, we should see Trumpism as both a symptom of a lower-trust, lower-happiness society and a cause of further misery and mistrust.But what should you do if you don’t like the way the world is going? Is there anything you can do?The obvious answer is to rage, doomscroll and hope for the next election. But the obvious answer is no longer an option once we realize the antidote to Trump is to build a happier, higher trust society. Drawing on my dual experience as a moral philosopher and happiness researcher, I’d like to suggest some alternative ways you can fight back.Trumpism is built on pettiness and self-interest, so resisting means embodying the opposite virtues. To paraphrase a much better president: do not ask what the world can do for your happiness – ask what you can do for the happiness of the world. You commit yourself to making the biggest difference you can – even when others do not.Fighting back doesn’t have to mean shouting louder. Another option is gracious, determined decencyIt starts internally. Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher born a Roman slave, wrote: “We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.” That idea, now a pillar of modern psychotherapy, is especially relevant in moments like this. Trump and co want to make you feel helpless and furious. Keeping your composure and finding joy are acts of resistance.It continues locally. Make an effort to build social connections where you live. Research shows when we share meals with others, volunteer or strike up friendly conversations with strangers, we’re not just making ourselves and others happier. We’re rebuilding the social fabric that authoritarian politics tears apart and reducing the distrust that fuels politicians like Trump. Higher trust and happiness make us less susceptible to the politics of fear and resentment; the data backs this up.Some good news is that our perceptions of mistrust are misplaced. There have been global studies in which researchers drop wallets to see what percentage is returned. A40-country studyfound actual wallet return rates are abouttwice as highas people expected. In the US, two-thirds were returned – against the view that one-third would be. Simply recognizing we can trust others more than we thought is a helpful step forward. You could join a localAction for Happinessgroup.Recent researcheven shows prosocial activity is reliably linked to fewer “deaths of despair”. Your kindness could save lives.At the national level, we need to see politicians taking social connection – not just the economy – more seriously. If it seems fluffy or unimportant, look at where ignoring them has got us: he’s in the Oval Office.

My colleagues and I at theHappier Lives Instituterecently published the first global analysis of how much happiness different charities produce per dollar. We found a striking result. The most effective charities – often tackling issues such as depression or malnutrition in low-income countries – have about 150 times the impact of the average rich-country charity. If someone gave $150,000 to charity, you would consider them a hero. It turns out you can do as much good by giving $1,000 – if you follow the evidence and pick wisely. Giving 1% of your income to these organizations is a quiet act of moral clarity in a noisy, self-interested world.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’.

They might even make you happier, too.What’s giving me hopeTrumpism is the symptom of a less happy, less trusting society. But we are far from powerless to change this. There are several ways we can each make a difference – starting with our own minds and local communities and finishing with helping others around the world. What gives me hope is realizing we have the potential to understand what’s going wrong in our society and do our part to improve it.Michael Plant is the founder and research director of the Happier Lives Institute.

That sends an important signal: resistance is possible.But universities must realize that the government is adopting a divide-and-rule tactic: they should collaborate on a shared litigation strategy, take a common approach in getting the public on their side, and do everything possible to have Congress push back against Trump treating money allocated by the legislature as if it were a private slush fund to be used for political blackmail.Some faculty have already begunto unite. In principle, not just progressives, but self-respecting conservatives – if any remain – should be responsive to such a three-pronged strategy.It has become abundantly clear that Trump 2.0 is using a moral panic about “woke” and pro-Palestinian protests as pretexts to subjugate institutions posing multiple threats to aspiring autocrats: universities constitute an independent source of information; they encourage critical thinking; they gather in one spot young people easily outraged by injustices. Of course, like all institutions, they have flaws; but, unlike, let’s say, businesses, they give wide latitude to criticism and position-taking (if you think colleges are censoring speech, try some political oratory on the factory floor or in the boardroom).Finally, the Trump regime has met its match | Robert ReichRead moreSome academic leaders think they might mollify the Trumpists, or at least get a better deal, if they concede points about allegedly widespread antisemitism, as well as supposed indoctrination and discrimination. Self-criticism should of course be part of university life, buttrumpeting on page-one op-edsthat there are deep structural problems with higher education is naive at best. For one thing, there are no simple generalizations about the roughly 4,000 colleges and universities in the US; even what are usually called “elite universities” are hardly all the same.Yet far too many academics are uncritically repeating the right’s propaganda about a “free speech crisis” and conservatives feeling marginalized. Is it perhaps relevant that the most popular majors remain business and health sciences – subjects hardly taught by dogmatic lefties hell-bent on silencing dissent? Is it just about possible that some much-cited statistics – that many more professors vote for the Democrats – have more to do with the GOP having turned itself into the anti-science party, rather than professors all wanting to corrupt the youth with socialist nonsense?Even those worried about whatthe government’s letter to Harvardcalled “ideological capture” might balk at the proposed remedy: what can only be called totalitarian social engineering in the name of assuring “viewpoint diversity”. The government seeks to subject an entire university to an ideology audit: both faculty and students would have to be tested for “viewpoints” – whatever that means exactly. If an imbalance were to be found, departments would have to bring in what the Trumpist education commissars call a “critical mass” of faculty and students with viewpoints deemed politically correct by the commissars.This is not just an attack on academic freedom; it is a license to probe individuals’ minds and consciencesThis is not just an attack on academic freedom; it is a license to investigate individuals’ minds and consciences (could a student be hiding a secret interest in Judith Butler? Only extensive interrogations would reveal the truth!). Might students be encouraged to denounce their professors, in ways already popular on rightwing websites? Might professors in turn be encouraged to tell on their charges (he looks preppy, but he once wrote an essay on gender ideology)?Besides the obvious contradiction of violating freedoms in the name of freedom, there is the rank hypocrisy of demanding “viewpoint diversity” while seeking to outlaw any diversity initiatives not based on political ideology. And the practical enforcement of viewpoint diversity would probably also be a tad uneven: no economics department would be forced to hire Marxists; evangelical colleges are unlikely to be led towards balance by having to bring in a “critical mass” of faculty promoting atheism.Trumpists are trying hard to frame university leaders as feeling “entitled” – one small step from calling them welfare queens and kings parasitic to the taxpayer. Education, they insinuate, is a luxury for spoilt kids, research a pretext for faculty to impose loony personal beliefs. If one accepts this framing, an otherwise inexplicable idea starts to make sense: Christopher Rufo, the much-platformed strategist of the attacks on academic freedom, wants to “reduce the size of the sector itself”.Why would one want to deny opportunities for kids to learn and for research to advance, unless one fears critical thinking? Or unless one has a completely warped view – Musk-style – of how science actually works? Or unless one exhibits willful ignorance of the fact that the government does not just shovel cash to universities so they can organize more pride parades, but that it concludes contracts for research after highly competitive selection processes?Clearly, the Trump administration is in the business of unprecedented national self-harm. Those who think of themselves as “conserving” must ask whether they really want to be part of an orgy of destruction. Those who say they worship the founders must wonder whether they can tolerate daily violations of the constitution, as Trumpworks to impound fundsapproved by Congress (for research, among other things).Self-declared free speech defenders must question why they would support an administration inspired more by Mao than by Madison. And those who just want to hold on to basic decency must ask whether they can accept a proposition along the lines of: “We’ll prevent cures for cancer, as long as Harvard doesn’t hire mediocre conservatives.” As my colleague David Bellhas recently put it, if this proposition becomes acceptable, it will be the triumph of malignancy in more than one sense.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton University.Explore more on these topicsHarvard UniversityOpinionTrump administrationHigher educationUS educationUS universitiesUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet Mexico bucked both trends. Its governing party, Morena, not only retained the presidency but – along with itspartnersin the Sigamos Haciendo Historia coalition – gained a two-thirds supermajority in the chamber of deputies, the lower house, while the far right failed to even run a candidate. That a self-described leftwing party could have such success by fixing on Mexico’s chasmic inequality has drawn attention from hopeful progressives worldwide. But Morena’s programme has some not-so-progressive elements too. It is not necessarily one others could – or would want to – copy in its entirety.Morena first notched a historic result in 2018, when Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an old face of the left who ran for president twice before founding the party, won a record 55% of the vote during the general elections. Mexico’s constitution limits presidents to a single term. But this time, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of López Obrador’s,won 60%of the vote. Her victory was reminiscent of the heyday of Latin America’s “pink tide”, when leftist leaders like Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales were reelected for a second term with more votes than their initial victories.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images / Reuters / Guardian DesignMeanwhile, the far right didn’t even get on the ballot. Eduardo Verástegui, an actor turned activist who producedSound of Freedom, the surprise box office hit about a US federal agent busting a child-trafficking ring in Colombia, sought to bring Trumpian politics to Mexico but failed to collect the signatures required to run as an independent. Rather than developing a Mexican brand of far-right politics, Verástegui tried to transplant a distinctly American flavour that was heavy with God, guns and individualism. It didn’t take root.Morena’s success in building a leftwing movement stemmed from the party’s focus on socioeconomic justice. López Obrador developed a simple and powerful populist narrative, arguing that the country had been captured by corrupt elites, including the old political parties and their national and transnational business partners. This resonates for people in Mexico, a palpably unequal country in which roughly 27% of incomeaccrues to the richest 1%.López Obrador promised to change that. His charisma and his long track record inMexicomade him a convincing vehicle for the message, which he hammered home in trips to every corner of the country and daily press conferences known as themañaneras. In these, he touted his government’s achievements and lambasted its critics, shaping the media agenda. Morena’s message was amplified through state and social media, creating a kind of personality cult around López Obrador.And he delivered. López Obrador’s government doubled the minimum wage in real terms, while expanding social programmes and cash transfers for pensioners and the young, among others. Itclamped downon the practice of outsourcing workers to avoid paying benefits and legislated that union contracts be put todemocratic votes. And it focused infrastructure projects on the historically marginalised south, building trains and a new oil refinery. From 2018 to 2022, the percentage of the population living in poverty fell from roughly 42% to 36%.More from this seriesLoading...By putting inequality at the centre of his discourse, López Obrador created a committed base of supporters who were willing to overlook theshortcomings of his government.Although he came to power promising to improve corruption, insecurity and impunity, he achieved none of these things. His government had its owncorruption scandals, and Mexico’s homicide rate remained high, with about 30,000 murders a year. In some ways, the situation worsened: extortion is now rampant. Despite this, large parts of the population felt increasingly confident in democracy. By 2023, 61% of Mexicanssaid they had faithin their national government, compared with 29% when he took office.Mexico’s bloody cartel war rages as myth of the ‘good narco’ wears thinRead moreBut progressives elsewhere shouldn’t be too sanguine about the prospect of copying Morena’s model. While doing all the above,López Obrador also made expedient moves to the right. He cut deals with big business and swerved on tax reform. He kept fiscal austerity, meaning boosted social spending was funded with cuts elsewhere. Hecracked down on US-bound migrantsfor political capital in Washington, and he refused to take a position ongay marriageorabortion, presumably to avoid limiting Morena’s appeal. And heembraced Mexico’s military, a popular but opaque institution with a record ofhuman rights abuses, relying on them todeliver his programme. And although López Obrador set up several commissions to investigate historical abuses by the army,he later abandoned them.Criticisms came from across the political spectrum, but López Obrador brushed them off – and often insinuated they came from actors in hock to the corrupt elites of his narrative. By the end of his government, he had lost support from somefeminists,environmentalistsandvictims of violence, to name a few. Yet his base continued to grow. He left power with approval ratings of about 70%.Once it became clear that Morena was on the up, politicians of all stripes, including some dubious characters, sought to join. Morena welcomed them, diluting principle with pragmatism. This shortcut to electoral success came at the cost of internal tensions. Still, Morena maintains a membership and grassroots activity that no other party can match. It has2.3 millionregistered members, and wants to make that10 million. Sheinbaumhas commandedthe party’s activists to get out to every part of the country. (It is an article of faith in the party that López Obrador’s success was born of visiting each of Mexico’s nearly 2,500 municipalities.) All of this no doubt helps ground Morena in local realities – in contrast to the fledgling far right.The party’s connection to local contexts limitshow much progressives outside Mexico can draw from Morena’s example. Mexico is marked by its colonial history, and was under one-party rule for most of the 20th century before it transitioned to democracy in the 1990s. Today, organised crime exerts immense influence through violence and corruption,while Mexico’s economic dependence on the US is extreme. This sharp sense of injustice is a mobilising political sentiment.It would be tempting to frame Mexico’s political landscape as a story about the left successfully resisting the right. Butprogressives elsewhere must ask themselves how much they would want to draw from Morena. The focus on socioeconomic justice, the narrative control and the party organisation were tied up with some uglier aspects of populism, and an expedient adoption of rightwing positions. It’s hard to say whether the latter were necessary for Morena’s electoral success. But there is dissent on the Mexican left, where some, having weighed the results against their values, are no longer on board with the party.Thomas Graham is a freelance journalist based in Mexico City"

Reform is in league with big business in a way that Labour is notFri 18 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 13.05 EDTShareMost reviews ofGet In, the recently published history of Keir Starmer’s Labour by the Times journalists Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, focused on its exposure of the prime minister’s unease with the rough and tumble of politics, and his consequent reliance on Morgan McSweeney, now his chief of staff. A spectacular what-might-have-been moment in the book concerns another Downing Street svengali figure, however; one rumoured to beplotting Nigel Farage’s path to powerat the next election.At the beginning of 2019, it turns out, Dominic Cummingsattempted to convinceaides to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour should vote for Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal agreement, thereby prompting a split in the Conservative party and a swift election. Labour could then fight and win that contest on its own natural territory of funding the NHS and public services. As Cummings put it in a text to Corbyn’s spokesperson: “You get Brexit through, [People’s Vote] fucked … high chance of Govt collapse … Tory civil war guaranteed for years in any scenario.”Plausible? Corbyn’s sharpest political ally, John McDonnell, was among those who didn’t buy it, fearing that Labour would be deserted by millions of middle-class remainers crying betrayal. Instead, under Starmer’s direction as shadow Brexit secretary, the other fork in the road was chosen. The party backed a second referendum, and was subsequently routed in the“get Brexit done” electionat the end of the year.Viewed in hindsight, the politics of that moment look just as invidious as they did then. But as May’s local elections approach, and Faragepromises to parkReform UK’s tanks “on the lawns of the red wall”, the anecdote is of far more than historical interest. Cummings – in bracingly ecumenical fashion – understood the social democratic potential in the disruptions of the 2010s, as the blue-collar vote asserted itself in unpredictable ways. Does Labour, even now?As a now familiar pattern of extreme political turbulence continues domestically and abroad, Labour’s massive but shallow victory last July seems almost a trick of the electoral light. Polls indicate that support is being lost to the right, the left and the centre. Front and centre in the north of England and Midlands, though, is thegathering momentumof Farageism. The Runcorn and Helsby byelection on 1 May will be a knife-edge affair – one that many Labour loyalistsbelieve Reform will win.A Farage triumph, in the first Westminster contest since the heady days of last summer, would underline that the resentments and aspirations for which Brexit was a vehicle have not gone away. As the government continues to box itself in by sticking to self-defeating fiscal rules, it may already be too late to avoid a Runcorn outcome that will trigger painful memories of December 2019. But between now and the next election, ifLabouris to avoid the strategic mistakes of the recent past it will need to think in more imaginative, ambitious and generous terms about who the Reform-facing or Reform-curious actually are, and what they are trying to say.A report in Marchby the polling group More in Common delivered one suggestive nugget that might help. Collating responses according to its own range of voter types across the political spectrum, the report’s authors noted an unusual overlap. “Loyal nationals” and “progressive activists” were both more likely than other groups to think “the government should act to limit the damage done by business”.Interesting. According toMore in Common’s typology, progressive activists will have gone deep into further education, live in cities, support Labour or the Greens, care about inequality and like the Guardian. Loyal nationals often read the Mail or the Sun, feel looked down upon by the certificated, are anxious about external threats and believe the nation should come together in defence of the collective self-interest.Is this a partial snapshot, then, of Labour’s old, fractured voting coalition finally in agreement? In asubsequent dispatchpublished in the Guardian, More in Common’s director, Luke Tryl, recorded similar sentiments in the towns of Merthyr Tydfil and Dudley, where Reform has been on the march for months. Alongside the now familiar distrust, bordering on contempt, for politicians, Tryl noted that “big business was seen as just as bad. Energy companies and supermarkets profiteering from the cost of living crisis, Amazon not paying its fair share of tax, tech companies damaging young minds, were all raised across the two days as examples of rampant corporate greed.”Though it talks a good game in the regions, and sees the potential in some judicious“old Labour”-style positioning, Reform generally aspires to satisfy corporate greed rather than challenge it. Itsgeneral election manifestopledged to slash corporation tax as well as inheritance tax rates, and drastically raise the threshold for paying the higher rate of income tax. Loyal national types are wooed by mining of the darker seams of communitarian angst: “small boats” rhetoric, thepromise to take Britain outof the European court of human rights and boilerplate attacks on “diversity”.Depressingly, it appears that Starmer and McSweeney’s Labour continues to view blue-collar voters primarily the same way – to be courted throughcrackdowns on immigrationand ahigh-profile focuson crime and policing. It is fatuous politics to play down the importance of either issue in Reform-friendly constituencies and beyond. But this remains a desperately narrow, limited interpretation of working-class values and preoccupations.Cummings’ insight throughout the Brexit period was that in regions such as South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear, there is a hankering for – and a memory of – a more collectivist politics than the exploitative rentier capitalism presided over by both the main parties for decades. The notorious£350m NHS pledgeon the side of the Brexit bus worked for a reason. However cynically it was conceived, it stood for a reassertion of popular priorities and control over everyday lives, and the classical blue-collar (and Labour) values of mutuality and solidarity.As Labour has belatedlybegun to realisein relation to the potential demise of the British steel industry, standing up for the public good against powerful but remote interests can be popular with “progressives” and “patriots”. This principle, rather than a technocratic obsession with growth, can be the cornerstone of a future Labour voting coalition that calls Reform’s bluff and injects some much-needed idealism into the nation’s politics.Such an approach would mean prosecuting a critique of the way contemporary capitalism works far more radical than the government has dared or wished to contemplate. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump is undertaking his own quixotic version of this. Is it too much to hope that modern Labour, eventually, can respond with resources already present within its own traditions?Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerReform UKNigel FarageDominic CummingscommentShareReuse this content"

Coaches transformed dusty clearings into arenas of possibility, honing not only my athletic skills but my confidence.Yet over the past decade, lively streets, once filled with youth clubs, community football pitches and spaces where friendships blossomed over shared interests, have gradually been transformed into a landscape that feels neglected, even forsaken. The laughter that once echoed through sports halls has faded. Talking to younger relatives and peers reveals a clear picture: the opportunities that once defined our childhoods are vanishing at an astonishing rate.Since 2010, local authorities in England have experienced an18% budget cutin real terms per person, and some1,243 youth clubsclosed in England and Wales during that time. A plan was put out last October by Birmingham city council to downsize its youth service to just23 staff, with most of its 16 youth centres expected to close. It came after councillors voted in March last year to slash children and families services funding bymore than £52min 2024-25 and by a further £63m the following year. And it’s not just youth clubs that have been lost. Sports pitches andlibrariesare affected too, leaving fewer safe spaces for young people to spend their time. Spring Hill library is an obvious example of neglect by the council – the library has beenshut downand no effort or money has gone into reopening it for everyone to use.Europe’s youngest city, where nearly 40% of people are aged under 25, is failing its youth. The consequences of this have been dire. In neighbourhoods where youth clubs have shut down, the evidence showstangible negative impacts: teenagers’ exam scores have fallen by an estimated 4%, while the likelihood of criminal behaviour among young people aged 10 to 17 has risen by 14%. Cutting youth clubs didn’t save money – it cost more. For every £1 saved, nearly £3 is lost in increased crime and reduced educational outcomes.View image in fullscreenAndy Street, the former West Midlands mayor, visits the Urban Heard youth centre in Solihull, Birmingham, 13 July 2023.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianA 2021 Censuswide study reveals the emerging mental health crisis: 52% of British young people reportlosing confidence in themselves, a decline that has coincided with reduced social spaces and diminished community support. Yet instead of acting, the government is retreating. To an already isolated generation, this is not merely neglect; it’s an act of sabotage.This isn’t about some abstract nostalgia for football clubs or Friday-night youth groups. It’s about the lifelines that can keep marginalised children afloat. Not every parent can drive their kids to and from paid-for activities, or badger them into mixing with others. For many kids, these free, accessible spaces were the only respite from a turbulent home life, or the pressure to perform academically. I’ve seen withdrawn teenagers become team captains and isolated kids make friends over the pool table. Without these outlets, where will they go?There are answers, but they require political courage. First, stop the cuts. Birmingham city council’s budgetary slashing of youth services to “save” money is tantamount to refusing to water the garden – you will save time now, but everything dies later. The long-term costs – mental health crises, rising crime, lost potential – will dwarf whatever short-term savings are made.Second, repurpose underused infrastructure. Our libraries operate at limited capacity, derelict buildings tarnish our neighbourhoods and our high streets are full of empty shops. So why not convert these into sponsored youth “third spaces”, with supervised sports, arts programmes, or even coding hubs? The Gap community centre in Sutton Coldfield, an all-inclusive hub that offers free activities and counselling, is already helping steer younger people away from gangs, crime and antisocial behaviour. It’s a success story in the making – police are reportingfewer antisocial incidentsin the town.A third solution could be to partner with schools as community anchors. Many already run after-school clubs, but with additional funding, they could expand into weekend mentorship or parent-youth counselling run by trained youth workers and social care volunteers.Young people in Birmingham aren’t begging for privileges. They just need space to breathe, to connect, to grow. Those are the things that gave me my confidence. I only wish that kids could have these same chances today.Ibraheem Mockbel is the winner of The Guardian Foundation’s2025 Emerging Voices Awards(16-18 age category) recognising young talent in political opinion writingDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For the past couple of decades, Paul* had a classic Nokiabrick-style phone. He could make calls – even send the odd text if we were lucky. But, a few years ago, he got a smartphone. At first, nothing changed much. He was reconnecting with friends, discovering emojis – there were no concerns. It has only been recently that the phone has become a problem, and that’s because he has stumbled across social media. And he is on it constantly.What do we know about Paul? He has time on his hands and, having grown up in an era when encyclopedias were the main source of knowledge, he has little media literacy when it comes to analysing sources and figuring out which ones he should trust. I can see why he probably takes it for granted that what he reads on his phone is true.According to people who’ve known him a while, Paul went from talking about birdwatching to sharing interviews featuring Tommy Robinson, to saying that migrants are taking our jobs, to embracing fake history and conspiracy theories found on YouTube. By this point, if Paul watched a video that claimed Stonehenge was a portal to another dimension and built by giants, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him engage in an online war to defend it.The Online Safety Actis now partly enforceable. Paul might make you think a bit harder about it. Understandably, much of the conversation surrounding it has been focused on protecting children, but there is a glaring hole in this legislation regarding the protection of adults. Despite a2022 reportfor the Ministry of Justice finding that the role of the internet in radicalisation pathways “was most evident for older rather than younger individuals”, the Tory governmentbacked out from provisionsthat would have prevented adults from seeing “legal but harmful” content online over fears about freedom of speech. But, if the2024 UK riotstaught us anything, it is how quickly adults can be roused to extremist mobilisation – even bymisleading poststhat may have been shared in all innocence.Ofcom reportsthat misinformation, including content that discriminates on the grounds of a protected characteristic, is the most likely form of potential harm adults will encounter online. With 52% of adultsusing social mediaas a form of news consumption, the risk of falling down a far-right rabbit hole is only going to increase. And Mark Zuckerberg’s decisionto remove independent factcheckingfrom Meta platforms will only make social media more of a breeding ground for fake news. In the UK, 77% of those aged 65 and overdescribe Facebookas their main form of social media – and as research carried out by Dr Sara Wilford, a lead researcher on the EU-funded research projectSmidge(Social Media Narratives: Addressing Extremism in Middle Age), suggests,it is older userswho are most vulnerable to this change. As they are not “digital natives”, everything they have learned online has been self-taught, so they tend to trust content at face value and are reluctant to factcheck. With the Online Safety Act neglecting them, they are (literally) left to their own devices.Making matters worse, everyone’s favourite billionaire, Elon Musk, the owner of X, is spreading his own misinformation about his newfound obsession: Britain. Nearly two million people saw Musk’sretweet of a fake Telegraph articlethat claimed the prime minister was planning on sending far-right rioters to “emergency detainment camps” in the Falklands. Most people saw the post for what it was – and Musk deleted it when it was shown to be total nonsense – but it looked real. So how can someone who is computer illiterate, who wouldn’t even twig if a bot were messaging him on Facebook marketplace wanting to exchange his used VHS tapes for a handful of beans, understand the need to be cautious when someone such as Musk – rich, powerful, chronically online – spreads fake news? And what is infuriating is that these tech bros seeminglydon’t care: Musk and Zuckerberg appear to be too busy fighting over who gets to go to Donald Trump’s birthday party to have a second thought about their users.It is such a shame. By all accounts, Paul had always been tolerant and open-minded. Over time, with what he read and absorbed, he became so angry. And he’s not that unusual.About one in fiveinternet users are unaware that apps and websites use algorithms to tailor what they are being shown. Many people do not recognise that what they are consuming online is diluted and biased; there are older people just like Paul who cannot get out of this cycle because they truly don’t know they are in it. It is troubling how many algorithms are nowpushing more extreme content. I have noticed on my own X account an increase in explicit photos of women and pro-Trump views – even people I have blocked, such as Laurence Fox, have somehow been popping up on my feed.I don’t blame older people, or think they’re stupid, for being taken in by what is often very sophisticated content. I am in my early 20s – a digital native – and I sometimes fall for fake content, too. I was totally fooled by the AI-generated image ofKaty Perry at the 2024 Met Gala(and so, apparently, was her mum). Sometimes my friends and I can’t tell if an image or video is deepfaked. If we don’t take precautions now, what will it be like when this technology becomes even more advanced?This Labour government has been so preoccupied by the threat of the left that it has left the door wide open for the far right. Until something is done, and encoded in legislation, we run the risk of more riots, more attacks, more lies. The government must review the Online Safety Act to make sure that everyone, regardless of age, is protected from fake news and far-right propaganda online – before fact becomes completely indistinguishable from fiction.April O’Neill is the winner of The Guardian Foundation’s2025 Emerging Voices Awards(19-25 age category) recognising young talent in political opinion writing*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleOpinionInternetFar rightSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

There is a skills gap though – and they must be brave enough to fill itFri 18 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 10.06 EDTShareAmid the shock of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)halvingits growth forecast last month, one remarkable finding gets too little attention. Itpredictshousebuilding will rise to its highest level in 40 years, adding 0.2% growth or £6.8bn by 2029-30, potentially rising to more than 0.4% by 2034-35. The government has said that housingscoresthe biggest positive growth effect from a “zero-cost policy” the OBR has ever forecast.This is especially remarkable given that 2024 saw thefewest planning permissionsgranted for new homes for a decade, and the worst on record, according tothe Home Builders Federation (HBF). Planning applicationsplummetedwhen the last governmentscrappedcouncils’ mandatory housing targets, but since Labour reimposed a national planning policy framework, applications in the works have risen bymore than 160%.The OBR expects Angela Rayner to reach1.3m of her 1.5m new homes target, but that’s without taking into account the planning act now going through parliament, clearing obstacles in its path. Nor does the OBR include last month’s£2bn of new investmentto support the “biggest boost in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation”, including up to 18,000 new social and affordable homes, a “down payment” ahead of more long-term investment promised later this year.Also uncounted was the “new homes accelerator” scheme sending planning experts to speed up delivery by unblocking thousands of new homes, including onseven new sitesannounced earlier this year. Nor did the OBR count in GDP growth from new towns:more than100 proposalsare with the new towns taskforce, reporting this summer. All these, the government says, should see the 1.5 new homes target reached.The planning bill can’t come soon enough: reform was proposed by Conservative governments but stymied by Tory MPs fearful of developments in their patch. Take the frustrations of just one social housing provider, Stonewater. It aims to build 1,000 social homes a year, havingsecured £200m investmentin 2023 and£250m in 2021, and currently manages 40,000 homes. But many developments are stuck in council planning departments: the law demands a response within 13 weeks – but without fines they can delay for years. Stonewater, they tell me, had one held up for two and half years in Frome; another for 62 homes in Worcester took almost as long. Right now they await permission for 72 homes in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on land they bought back in October 2021. The final hitch is with the county council’s highways – they say, when I ask, that it will be resolved “soon”, but it’s still not signed.In Terrington St Clement, near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, Stonewater bought land for 87 homes in 2023 – there is outline agreement for building but still no permit. “Private developers can afford to wait,” says Jonathan Layzell of Stonewater. “When they build, they sell and get their money back fast – but we rely on long-term income from social rents while paying a mortgage. Missing years of rent in planning delays means we build less.” Isn’t it easier to get permission for social housing, especially in the rural areas where Stonewater builds? He laughs: “That’s what I had thought, but it’s harder. There’s social stigma: ‘We don’t want those people here.’ We argue back: ‘Who’s going to work in your schools, shops, pubs, local services?’ But the answer is often: ‘Over there, not here.’”Time and again council planning committees override the advice of professional planning departments, even when planners warn them the applicant will undoubtedly appeal and win, costing the council about £100,000. But the planners say councillors want to prove to their ward “I tried to stop it”, even when they knew they couldn’t block a site within an agreed local plan. That’s why the new billtakes awaymuch power from council planning committees. All but major decisions will be made by professional planners, council committees will be smaller and – here’s a novelty – councillors on that committee will have to be trained in planning, with a certificate to prove it. (Somewhat ironic when ministers controlling billions scoot through revolving doors between departments of which they know nearly nothing with no hint of training.)All that is good news. But big blockages remain, especially the lack of experienced planners lost in the Tory years. Take the district council ofKing’s Lynn and West Norfolk, where Stonewater has been waiting since 2021 for its 87 homes. They’ve had bigger things on their plate, such as three years of due process before finallyrejecting plansfor a pig and chicken factory megafarm this month.The council had no local plan, butLabournow demands one, so it has had to double housing sites to nearly 1,000 a year. Drawing it up took “in excess of 175,000 officer hours of research, analysis, planning and more”, independent councillor Jim Moriarty, cabinet member for planning, says. He welcomes Labour’s planning bill, but public comments suggest local outrage at more housing. As ever: “Yes, but not here.”UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEORead moreMoriatry managed to hire two planners last week, but he’s still two short. It’s a country-wide problem, says the HBF, whose reportPlanning on Emptyshows the worst-hit councils short of 40-50% planners. The Royal Town Planning Institute (RITP) tells me the crisis is not in recruits but in retaining the experienced: 25% leave for the private sector. The government promises300 more planners, but the HBF says it needs 7,000. Less stress and higher pay is a strong draw to private work, so the new bill allows councils to raise planning fees to cover a department’s costs, including paying planners more, so long as there’s no suggestion of councils selling permissions for profit.Lack of seasoned planners is only one obstacle. The government is accelerating construction training, but the HBF says every 10,000 additional new homes need 30,000 new recruits. Here’s Labour’s dilemma: do Home Office immigration numbers matter more than meeting the housing target with migrant workers? Ask the public and they back visas for construction workers by 38% to 16% against. Anti-migrant sentiment will always be a winner for the right. But success in building the most homes in 40 years would surely become one of Labour’s flagship boasts.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionCommunitiesLabourOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomicsEconomic policySocial housingcommentShareReuse this content"

Because he’s a lefty politician who gets things doneAndy BeckettNot since Tony Benn has a Labour minister been so assailed – and not just by the Tory press, but also by his own colleaguesFri 18 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 12.07 EDTShareWhy exactly does Ed Miliband make so many people so angry? At 55, 20 years into his parliamentary career, with rare ministerial experience under both NewLabourand Keir Starmer, and a reputation around Westminster and Whitehall as one of politics’ nicer, more knowledgeable characters, he could be a respected figure in a generally inexperienced government. Instead, he’s this unpopular administration’s most controversial member.“An eco-zealot”, “a net-zero fanatic”, a “nauseating” hypocrite, “a cackling madman”, an “eco-Marxist”, “out of control”, “trashing Britain”, “a recruiting sergeant for the opposition”, the “most dangerous man in Britain” – Miliband provokes rightwing journalists and voters like no other minister. Possibly not since the onslaught in the 1970s on the socialist disruptor Tony Benn, whom Miliband later worked for as a teenager, has a Labour minister been so relentlessly targeted. Even the long-running and complex crisis in Britain’s steel industry has become an opportunityto blame him, despite him being secretary of state for energy security and net zero for fewer than 10 months.Like Benn, Miliband is also undermined by his own side. Anonymous briefings are constantly given to journalists that he is a political liability and about to be demoted or fired. In January, a typical Labour “colleague”told the Sunday Times: “The only minister who really knows how to work the system and get officials delivering what he wants is Ed Miliband … And Ed is the one minister we don’t want to be a success if we want to win the next election.”The government has forced Miliband into real or perceived retreats onairport expansion,electric vehicles, the nationalisation of energy companies and the scale of Labour’sgreen investment. To the disappointment of some environmentalists, he has had to spend much of his ministerial time trying to justify the government’s climate compromises, willingly or otherwise. To critics on all sides, the question is when he will resign – orwhy he hasn’t already.Yet neither his divisiveness nor his survival should come as a surprise. His determinedly upbeat 2021 bookGo Big: 20 Bold Solutions to Fix Our Worldincludes a quote from Machiavelli: “The reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order.” As any rational climate policy unavoidably focuses more and more on restricting big carbon-emitting interests – motorists, airlines, fossil fuel companies – so the policy’s designers and implementers inevitably become the hated or, more subtly, obstructed removers of commercial and personal freedoms. And unlike most Labour ministers, Miliband appears to enjoy upsetting the established order. His speeches are increasingly combative. In interviews, he challenges the assumptions behind hostile questions.Because he was an underwhelming Labour leader in whatseems a distant era, the relatively calm first half of the 2010s, it’s been forgotten by many voters – but not by some of his enemies – that he was a sporadic troublemaker even then:attacking the Murdoch pressover phone hacking, andcorporate “predators”for feasting on the British economy. Despite his old “Red Ed” nickname, his politics are hardly revolutionary: no more than centre-left by postwar Labour standards. But unlike with many centrists, his beliefs are both stubbornly held and open to radicalisation, as has happened in recent years as he has perceived capitalism and the climate developing in increasingly catastrophic directions.Years of being slagged off has also hardened him. He no longer has any illusions that the rightwing media will ever tolerate him. He is often portrayed as alien – a “zealot” – to the supposedly sensible traditions of our politics. Despite the pro-Israel rhetoric now obligatory on the right, this othering still has a hint of the antisemitism that shadowed his leadership, with its endlessly reprinted photo of Labour’s first Jewish leader struggling with a bacon sandwich.Miliband is also an earnest north Londoner who believes in the state, defeated his more rightwing and media-favoured brother, David, in a leadership contest, and then lost what was widely seen as a winnable general election. Even if he was running a less contentious ministry, which may be his eventual fate, plenty of people would find reasons to dislike him.Although, strikingly, that dislike does not extend to the Labour membership. A recent survey for the website LabourList found thatMiliband was their favourite minister, far ahead of rightwingers such as Wes Streeting and Rachel Reeves, and of Starmer himself. That popularity is probably one reason Miliband hasn’t been sacked. But it also generates tensions, reminding the Labour right that its party purge is not yet complete, and highlighting Starmer’s limited rapport with the members. Anti-Miliband feelings are also generated by his ability to work the Whitehall machine. For all the British right’s disdain for socialist dreamers, what it really dislikes is a lefty who get things done.Largely driven by Miliband, trying to maximise his impact while he can,Labour has ended the de facto ban ononshore wind turbines, announced a largeexpansion of solar power, begun legislating to create the state-owned clean power company GB Energy, andstopped grantingexploration licences for new North Sea oil and gas fields. Meanwhile, some of his defeats on climate policy may be more apparent than real. The expansion of Heathrow, for example, will have to meet so many environmental conditions that many observers believe it will never happen.Miliband and Starmer remain quite close. As leader, Miliband cleared the way for him to become an MP. As a minister, Miliband helps him believe he is still leading a progressive government. But those who predict Miliband’s imminent demise point out Starmer’s ruthlessness towards close colleagues when he thinks they have become a problem. In 2021, he removed Miliband’s shadow ministerial responsibility for business. Then, as now, Miliband was winding up powerful people.Yet the world has changed since then. Theclimate crisishas worsened faster than expected. Labour has found being back in office harder than it anticipated. Along with Reform UK and the Lib Dems, the Greens are eroding its support. As the failure of his policies to stop the latter process shows, Miliband is hardly a perfect politician. But being angry or disappointed with him is really a displacement activity. It’s much easier to think about the end of Miliband than the end of the world.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionClimate crisisSolar powerWind powerRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

Compassion and leadership are really needed nowFri 18 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 03.18 EDTShareSo this is how a clock turns backwards. With the hands still spinning even now, it’s hard to know yet exactly how far back in time we will land. ButWednesday’s supreme court rulingthat for the purposes of equality law, “woman” means “biological woman” – basically the chromosomes you were born with, regardless of what legal hoops you have since jumped through – is nonetheless a watershed moment.We are going back to a time before “trans women are women”, full stop, no debate: and if it’s handled well, accepting that sometimes life genuinely is more complicated than that could ultimately be healthy. But if handled badly, we could be heading back to a far darker time, when trans existence was shrouded in fear and shame and bigots had carte blanche.By stressing that their ruling did not remove trans people’s protection from discrimination, the five supreme court judges signalled clearly that they did not mean to go back that far. Instead, they seemingly want the time machine to stop in 2010, the year an incoming Tory-Lib Dem coalition pushed through an Equality Act drawn up by the outgoing Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman, which their ruling sought to interpret. As Harman has said, that act reflected a hard-won, sensitively negotiated consensus between Stonewall and women’s rights groups that is frankly hard to imagine today.The deal done recognised that nobody should face prejudice or harassment for being trans, any more than for being black or gay, but that in practice some limited exceptions were needed (just as women’s rights under sex discrimination law have loopholes). It allowed for trans people to be excluded from women’s spaces where that was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim – ensuring vulnerable women weren’t frightened off using a service like rape counselling, say, or protecting safety and dignity. That consensus eventually shattered after Stonewallproposed scrapping the exemptions, before thinking better of it, but in 2010 there was still a shared sense that having rights of your own does not magically exempt you from having to consider other people’s rights and feelings; that no person is an island, there is more than one way to be vulnerable, and compromise is required. When the judges warned against Wednesday’s ruling being considered a victory for either side, that spirit is surely the one they meant to invoke.This is a very tough day for trans people – with a long legal road ahead to right this wrong | Robin Moira WhiteRead moreSome hope. On one side, activists objecting to trans people not being heard in a case “that only affects trans people” are still not grasping the lesson of the last 15 years: that one person’s rightsdoaffect another’s, just as the Equality Act anticipated, and insisting they don’t simply destroys credibility.On the other, some gender-critical feminists who have endured years of death threats, ostracisation and attempts to get them fired for views now vindicated in court are clearly in no mood to be magnanimous. Some are publicly arguing that the ruling makes it compulsory to exclude trans women from all women’s spaces, as if all protections were now gone and it is a crime to accept someone into your wild swimming group.For trans people and those who love them, this is a frightening and uncertain moment. What happens if you’re halfway through treatment in hospital? Will the gym that always felt so friendly and welcoming turn hostile? And where does all of this leave trans men?Small, well-meaning organisations that can’t afford fancy lawyers – grassroots women’s sports teams, small business owners unsure what to do about the staff loos – will be as bewildered as their customers about what should happen now. Even large ones like the NHS face judgments of Solomon as they endeavour to treat both trans and non-trans patients with compassion. This moment requires leadership, but this Labour government seems fearful of providing it, perhaps because the evidence suggests public opinion is, if anything, hardening: YouGovfinds rising hostilityto everything from trans women’s participation in female sport to hormone treatment on the NHS for adults. Bizarrely, polling records slightly higher opposition to trans women using female toilets and public changing rooms (55% and 58%) than domestic violence refuges (52%). Do people really think a woman traumatised by male violence, who suffers flashbacks triggered by anything that reminds her of her abuser and who has gone into a refuge to escape all that, islessvulnerable than a woman getting changed in a locked cubicle at the local lido? Or are they simply more worried about spaces that they can easily see themselves using, suggesting the argument is no longer being driven simply by safety concerns?That leaves the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is drawing up statutory guidance on how to interpret the act in practice. Yet far from invoking the spirit of 2010, its chair, Kishwer Falkner – who has fought her own personally bruising battles inside the organisation on this issue – is signalling thatsheintends totake a hard line. The NHS should stop accommodating trans patients according to their preferred gender,she toldBBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that trans women shouldn’t be using women’s loos and changing rooms, either: when asked where they were supposed to go instead, she retorted that they should be “using their powers of advocacy to ask for those third spaces”. But if that’s her conclusion, then her organisation should be leading the charge to ensure neutral spaces are actually provided, if we are not to simply spiral back to the days of trans people being afraid to go out in public.What this ruling ultimately means is that no matter how much surgery she has, how well she “passes” or who she feels herself to be, in the eyes of the law a trans woman cannot quite be awoman in the same way as someone born with XX chromosomes. There’s no glossing over the fact that for some, that will seem shockingly cruel, and for others, more like common sense. But though it inevitably puts a degree of separation between trans and biological women, how far that separation goes is not yet set in stone. It will be for parliament to decide in principle and for people to decide in practice how exactly we all live alongside one another, what social norms we set and how far the clock goes back. It’s not too late to try to do that with care and compassion, rather than indulging in score-settling. The supreme court clearly intended to give us another chance, as a society, to get this right. The crime would be to waste it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Surely unstructured time with friends is betterFri 18 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 12.49 EDTShareThere’s a black and white image of the photographer and war correspondentLee Millerand her friend Tanja Ramm. The two are having breakfast in bed at Miller’s studio in Paris, casually reading newspapers. Their faces are framed by untamed hair and they’re dressed in cotton shirts, with coffee cups in front of them. The image, captured in 1931, is quiet and intimate. They share a blanket, their arms touch. There’s no rush, no urgency. It’s a scene about love but, above all, it’s about friendship.When was the last time I lay in bed with a friend like that? For most of us, it was probably during school or university, when staying over or crashing at someone’s house was a regular occurrence – sometimes a necessity, but mostly just part of our routines. It kept us close. Staying in a friend’s room or apartment felt like being on an island – safe, cosy and fun. It was about whispering, giggling and sharing secrets. And sometimes it was about nothing at all except being together.As an adult whose usual habitat is a large European city, when I meet friends now, it starts with a text that goes something like: “Hey, how are you? Would love to see you. Maybe we can grab dinner or drinks?”Then the struggle begins to find a date. It’s a messy process, especially in Berlin. Days pass. Sometimes, weeks. Finally, if we are lucky, the day arrives and we meet – at a restaurant or a bar, somewhere public, where we’re expected to behave, sit properly and engage in “polite” chat. We update each other on our projects, gossip a little, sigh, complain about circumstances at home or work and then we part ways.Sometimes, a few hours later, or the next morning, I’ll send or receive a message: “I’d missed you. It was so good to see you. We should do this more often.” An honest message, but an empty one at the same time. Because we won’t do it more often. We’ll continue rushing through our daily lives and responsibilities, fitting each other in where we can.How close can you really be to someone you only see for a couple of hours every now and then? What can you actually share? In these meetups, we present condensed versions of ourselves. So much of who we really are stays in the dark. We talk. And talking is the only way to feel connected and to bond.It was simpler as kids and teenagers. After school, back in Leipzig, I’d ask a friend, “Do you want to come over to play?” or I’d just knock on their door. At university in Berlin, we’d spend all day together on campus or meet after class at one of our homes. Getting together was easy. And it wasn’t just about talking. It wasn’t sitting across from each other, throwing words back and forth. We’d sit on sofas or the bed or on the floor, watch TV, play games, draw, flip through magazines, do sports, or listen to the latest music. We’d try things for the first time – a cigarette, a drug. We’d dream. We’d sometimes be silent together. It was sweet.Do we even know how tojustbe? To sit beside someone in silence, without needing to entertain or update or explain ourselves? I miss that.Friendshipdoesn’t always need a plot.In her diaries, Brigitte Reimann (1933-1973), one of the icons of East German literature, vividly describes idyllic scenes of friends simply hanging out together. When she was living in Neubrandenburg in her late 30s, one friend – the writer Christa Wolf – would visit spontaneously to check in and just be with her. There was also Juergen Schulz, a young journalist at the local radio station who was 10 years her junior. The two of them would stay up all night listening to jazz records and dancing. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the typical toast back then was “auf die Freundschaft”(“to friendship”).But times have changed. As mature, 21st-century adults, nearly everything has to be scheduled in advance. We meet when we’re well composed. If we’re not feeling up to it, we cancel. No one knocks on anyone’s door spontaneously any more. That would be crazy. Insane, even. We no longer play or fool around. We don’t hang out for hours without a plan.Maybe that’s also why some friendships just fade away, and others turn weird. One of the quietest heartbreaks of adulthood is realising that a friend has become indifferent, or no longer wants the best for you. The hardest part is knowing when it’s time to let go – especially when you’ve shared years.No one knocks on anyone’s door spontaneously. That would be crazy.But friendship can’t be based only on memories. It’s also about energy. And in trying to hold on to old friendships, we often forget how fragile new connections can be. They happen, but it’s rare. It’s not often that you meet someone new and think, yes, I want to see you again. I want to spend a whole day doing nothing with you.Mostly, it’s coffee once or twice, maybe an invitation to a birthday gathering if we manage to overcome the polite distance. People’s diaries are already full – with families, work and the handful of old friends they barely manage to keep. There’s just not much room left, not emotionally, not practically. So we stick to the friends we already have, even when the contours of those friendships keep changing.I wonder why I’m thinking about all this now. Perhaps it’s because I don’t have children or any family structures forcing me into a regulated daily life. I could hang out. I could see friends more often. When the American writer and film-maker Nora Ephroncompiled her listof things she would and wouldn’t miss at the end of her life, she named her friends twice in the list of things she would.Ephron was also the person who said: “It’s hard when you don’t like someone a friend marries. First of all, it means you pretty much have to confine your friendship to lunch, and I hate lunch.”I hate lunch too. There’s a clear beginning and a clear end. It’s a set scenario and my least favourite meeting opportunity of all because there is no room for surprises: you eat, then go back to work. I believe this downgrading to lunch happens not only when a friend marries someone you don’t like, but also when a friend has children. Let’s be honest: you lose that friend and mourn them. We’re supposed to be adults and handle what life throws at us with generosity, empathy and understanding. But it’s hard.And even if you like the person your friend marries, you still have to do lunch because otherwise, you’ll never see them again alone. Suddenly, it’s always “dates as couples”, where you have to behave even more properly. And there’s also this: if you’re a woman and your friend is a man, it’s very likely that his girlfriend or wife won’t love you two spending time alone.I’ve always found it difficult to imagine long-term, deep friendships between men and women. There is almost always a moment – spoken or unspoken – when one of you wonders: what if? That doesn’t mean anything will happen. But the question will hang in the air. And that changes the dynamic, no matter how much we pretend it doesn’t.Is that already toxic? We’re so good now at identifying red flags, drawing boundaries, spotting “bad, dangerous vibes”. But are we also too quick to call someone toxic just because they’re going through something we can’t quite deal with?I’ve seen friendships fall apart as a result of this and I know it’s difficult, but there is beauty in loyalty, when someone still shows up – not for a perfect version of you, but for you just as you are. That’s gold. Too often, we confuse support with advice, or think texting back is enough. Real solidarity is quieter. It lives in presence, not performance.OK, I do remember the last time I lounged in bed with a friend – it was two weeks ago. Maybe that was why I started to think about adult friendships again.My close friend of 15 years and I were invited to a literary awards ceremony in Cologne. She lives in Berlin and Rome, which means we don’t see each other a lot. The organisers of the awards had booked hotel rooms for us – mine on the fourth floor, hers on the first. At the end of the night, we said goodbye in the lift, then paused for a second. “Shall I come and sleep in your room?” I asked. “Yes please,” she replied immediately.I went to my room, put on my pyjamas and waddled through the corridors to her room. We brushed our teeth, made funny faces in the mirror and chatted in bed until our eyes closed. The next morning, we woke up smiling. We had both slept blissfully. I felt safe with her. The room was our island. We stayed in bed talking under the thick, white sheets until I almost missed my train to Berlin.In the afternoon, I received a text from her: “It was so cosy in bed this morning. This is how life should be.” Yes. Exactly that. Not lunch.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

I want the world to love her as much as I do – just notmorethan thatThu 17 Apr 2025 20.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 10.07 EDTShareI’m not what you would call a “dog person”. I love my 15-month-old border collie more than some blood relatives, but that love does not extend to dogs in general. I appreciate dogs, but won’t stop to pat a stranger’s dog, for instance, unless I’m trying to manufacture a version of myself who has an easy relationship with the world and affinity with all its creatures.Personality-wise I’m closer to a cat than a dog. I can be standoffish, self-serving and strategic. If a stranger tries to hug me my body will involuntarily contort to get away from them. I got a dog because I wanted to believe in something better. I thought Roxie would teach me the kind of presence and open-heartedness the world is crying out for.Dog people want to engage with Roxie. They present their hands to her nostrils before tickling her chin or running both hands along her chest and belly. Occasionally they have pre-prepared dog treats in their pockets and a tender memory of Bruno or Murray to share.Emotional support animals may be a thing, but seven tigers? Sorry, this fad has gone far enough | Elle HuntRead moreThey don’t mind when Roxie smells like creek sludge or slobbers on their clothing. I’ve watched spellbound as a woman allowed her to chew a substantial hole in her cardigan sleeve. “It’s completely fine”, the woman said, beaming. “She’s just learning to use her little puppy teeth!”I don’t recall either of my children receiving the same level of attention, unless one of them started crying at the supermarket and multiple people suggested it “might be past their nap time” between the freezer aisle and the car.I’m new to being a dog owner. I’m working out the boundaries of familiarity. Mostly I like it when people pat Roxie and tell her she’s a good girl. I’m endlessly entertained by their baby voices they use to talk to her, which can transform waiting for coffee into a surrealist play where Jennifer Tilly is trapped inside the body of a 50-year-old electrician. I thank people who praise Roxie as if I’m in some way responsible for her floppy ears and gentle nature. I’m proud of her and all her good girlness. I want the world to love her as much as I do, just notmorethan that.I don’t blame Roxie for what happened. She’s sensory seeking. She enjoys textures and smells and flavours. They help her understand the world. When I tell her sweet nothings she sniffs the air around my words like she is making them part of her.A man at the dog park had some sweet nothings to share with Roxie. He waved eagerly from across the off-leash area, a large dog bounding beside him. I waved back, which is dog park speak for “my dog also has energy to burn”.As the man and his dog came closer I noticed two things: the dog was enormous and the man had a goatee which was every colour of the cream yellow colour palette.“Wow, big dog,” I said. “70kg of love,” the man said laughing.He praised Roxie’s playfulness and shiny coat. I commended his dog for not accidentally crushing Roxie while they played. (There was an impossible grace to him! Like a rhinoceros making tea). I gave the gentle giant a pat on the head and we looked at each other and I felt as if we were simply friends.When sadness strikes I remember I’m not alone in loving the wild boundless beauty of the living world | Georgina WoodsRead moreThe man squatted so his knees were either side of Roxie, scruffing her head and neck with both hands, his speech becoming lower and growlier, as if the closer he got to her the more dog-like he became. As the goatee lowered, Roxie, licking her lips, seized the opportunity to eat it like a 1990s breakfast buffet.“They love the goatee,” the man growled, tilting his head as Roxie continued on to his moustache and gum line.I watched with a mixture of horror and amazement, fully present, aware of every bird call and blade of grass.Who’s they? I wondered. Did he mean other dogs loved his goatee? Or did the love extend to all species? Did his goatee attract local wildlife? A possum or two? A cockatoo? All goatees had a story.Roxie switched her focus to a dead bird in the bushes and the man and I went back to chatting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.I’ll likely avoid that dog park on Wednesdays from now on, but I’m grateful for the lessons learned. Here was a man with an easy relationship with the world and an affinity with all its creatures. He was trusting and open-hearted, bounding towards the next opportunity for connection. He was a dog person in the truest sense; part dog, part person.I think I’d rather be a person with a dog.Ashe Davenport is a writer and authorExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionPetsAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Illustration: Maxomatic/The GuardianSince its 2010 release, Robyn’s downbeat hit has influenced Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, soundtracked films and TV shows, and been yelled in unison at club nights. What’s the secret of its longevity?ByHannah J DaviesFri 18 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareAs the flirtation first begins to build between CEO Romy (Nicole Kidman) and her twentysomething intern Samuel (Harris Dickinson) in the recent erotic thrillerBabygirl, the two find themselves at opposite ends of a dancefloor. Romy pulls away from her husband and stares – pouting – at Samuel, who embraces anotherwoman, a familiar staccato beat pulsing out around them. “I’m in the corner, watching you kiss her,” the lyrics narrate. “I’m right over here, why can’t you see me?”It’s the perfect needle drop, conveying Romy’s desire but also her sense of alienation. Gladly for her, their torrid affair begins nonetheless, and soon the pair are throwing shapes at a sweaty techno rave.The song that plays is, of course, Dancing on My Own by Robyn, from her Body Talk Pt 1 album, a tune so familiar by now that I felt a Pavlovian urge to start caterwauling along in the cinema. Fifteen years on from itsoriginal release in April 2010, the track has established itself as pop’s great modern “sad banger”, in the vein of classics such as Donna Summer’s Last Dance and I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. Like those tracks it is a song that gets you up and moving, while breaking your heart into several tiny pieces.In the years directly after its release, Dancing on My Own was featured on major TV shows such as Lena Dunham’s Girls, and grew in popularity thanks toCalum Scott’s stripped back, Love Island-worthy cover, which peaked at No 2 in the UK charts. These days you can hear it in films, on arena tours (Robyn joined Charli xcx on stage to perform the song during the latter’sBrat tourlast year), and on TV (at Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary in February, David Byrne and Robynshared a stagein matching boxy suits for a rendition). It currently ranks at No 20 in Rolling Stone’slistof the 500 greatest songs of all time, sandwiched between Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit and Imagine by John Lennon.A lot of songs have staying power but Dancing on My Own stands head and shoulders above so many others from the 2010s (Babygirl would have been aslightlydifferent film had they been dancing to Sexy Bitch by David Guetta). Part of that appeal, says US-based culture podcaster Sam Sanders, is that the song is “the perfect bait and switch”, fusing euphoric music with desolate themes à la disco. “It’s so up-tempo. The percussion is so driving, it sounds like a happy song. And then you hear the lyrics, and it’s not happy at all. It’s really depressing.” The song’s simplicity and repetition, says Sanders, make it “go down easy … you can memorise it right away. By the end of the song, you’re already singing along with the chorus.”Sanders chose Dancing on My Own as his “American anthem” fora series on NPRback in 2019. As part of his research, he spoke to a musicologist, who informed him that the song’s 117 BPM was almost exactly in line with the average human walking speed. “[Robyn] is doing this in a tempo that is pretty close to the human heartbeat,” Sanders explains. “It’s programmed to burrow into your bones, to get into your body and make you move. It’s inescapable.” While the song wasn’t a smash hit at the time – it didn’t dent the US Top 40, and reached No 8 in the UK – it has become a slow-burn word-of-mouth megahit over the months and years since.Last September, ittopped a pollof Swedish music industry bods’ favourite songs, ahead of tracks by Madonna, Prince and even Abba. Tina Mehrafzoon is a Swedish music journalist who works for P3, the country’s equivalent to Radio 1 and the station responsible for that poll. The song comes with a wider context, says Mehrafzoon: it was from the era directly after Robyn’s departure from Jive Records to form her own label, Konichiwa (at the outset of her career, she had been marketed as a proto-Britney, working with mega-producers such as Max Martin). By this point, Robyn was no longer looking to “conform to some of the ideals that were put on a pop star, while still being the ultimate pop star. She was sort of rewriting what you should look like, what you should sound like. She changed the rulebook, just by being.”View image in fullscreenOne for the heads … Robyn performing the song with David Byrne this February.Photograph: Peacock/Todd Owyoung/Getty ImagesFrom Lorde’s Melodrama to Taylor Swift’s Reputation via xx member Romy’s melancholy brand of four-on-the-floor, Charli xcx’s direct lyricism, and even Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry lopping their locks into pixie cuts, the charts have seemed impregnated with Robyn’s DNA ever since. For her part, Lorde once wrote that Dancing on My Own is “happy and sad, fiery and independent but vulnerable and small, joyous even when a heart is breaking”. As for the song’s popularity, Mehrafzoon thinks it edged ahead of other singles because of the “credibility” of featuring in US shows such as Girls and Gossip Girl, which have been watched around the world.In Girls, the song plays when Hannah – played by Dunham – finds out that her boyfriend Elijah is gay. The song fits her situation, and his too; Dancing on My Own has become something of a queer anthem in the years since, with Calum Scotttelling the BBCin 2020 that he had first fallen in love with the song while figuring out his sexuality. Ina list of LGBTQ+ anthemspublished online by Billboard, the caption for Dancing on My Own (No 16) reads: “Any gay guy who says he hasn’t related to this synthy jam shouldn’t be trusted.” There is something about watching from afar – the lack of agency or even visibility – that speaks to the queer experience. “I mean, who understands the pain of rejection more than queer people?” says Sanders. “This is all about rejection and dancing through it – that is the queerest reality ever.” He also cites the song’s ambiguous pronouns. “She’s playing with gender. It’s really subtle, but I think where people get that, we saw it and felt it.”There’s also something in the idea of delayed adolescence playing out on a dancefloor; the American academic Jack Halberstam writes that “queer time is the dark nightclub, the perverse turn away from the narrative coherence of adolescence-early-adulthood-marriage-reproduction-death”.Robyn has a sort of Swedish way of writing lyrics … she’s very good at actually saying it as it isI wondered whether the people who made Dancing on My Own – Robyn, of course, alongside songwriter and producer Patrik Berger, and Niklas Flyckt, who mixed the song – had known they had a hit on their hands at the time. What became clear from speaking to Berger was that this seemingly simple song had, in fact, been a labour of love. “We took weeks on the lyrics, just to really make sure that we nailed every line,” says Berger, who – as well as working with pop stars such as Robyn, Charli and Taylor Swift, also releases experimental instrumentals as Hög Sjö. “We would write, digest, and then be like: ‘Is this really what it feels like when you’re in this situation?’ And then we compressed it to have as much impact in every line [as possible].” Berger says his and Robyn’s Scandi roots shines through, too. Robyn, he says, has “a sort of Swedish way of writing lyrics … she’s very good at actually saying it as it is. We were talking about the fact that – especially if an American artist is singing about a breakup – most of the time, it’s about empowerment: you’re worth better and you’re strong. We were both like: that’s not what it feels like at all! You feel like a loser and an idiot.

It’s a song about being all by yourself, but it’s a communal experience. It’s a song that Robyn’s fanssing backto her on stage when the music cuts; that fans have gathered to sing ontrain platformsafter shows; that choirs and a cappella groups now cover in epic new arrangements. For Berger, feeling like we’re alone “is probably the most uniting thing that we have as humans: it is something that we all understand, but that we don’t really talk about all the time.” Being alone together comforts people, he says, but he still hasn’t got used to seeing it at scale. “When [Robyn] performs live and she strips down the music and the whole arena sings … it’s mind-boggling to me. I’m like: wow, everybody can relate to this thing. I feel very emotional.” Perhaps it speaks to the current moment. We’re more connected than ever but, in many ways, more distant; a piece published by the Atlantic earlier this year called this “the antisocial century”.Whatever it is about this song that makes people stop what they’re doing and sing along, it doesn’t seem as if it’s going away any time soon. Berger says he hears the track more and more, stuffed into acoustic open-mic sets in bars next to the likes of the Beatles. Robyn has gone on to release another excellent album,Honey, in the intervening years, but there’s something about her “sad banger” that just won’t fade away. Says Sanders: “You could hear the song on the dancefloor in 2050 and folks would be like: ‘I want to dance.’”Explore more on these topicsRobynDance musicElectronic musicDiscoPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Insiders discuss how YouTube became the TV of tomorrowAmelia TaitFri 18 Apr 2025 08.01 EDTShareWhat’s the difference betweenYouTubeand TV? Two decades ago, that would have been a very easy question to answer. TV was the stuff that was on – you guessed it – television, with its budgets, scripts, multiple camera angles and lights. The first video ever uploaded to YouTube, meanwhile, could never have been mistaken for it. “All right, so here we are in front of the, uh, elephants,” a pixelated young man told the camera. “The cool thing about these guys is that … is that they have really, really, really long, um, trunks.” The video was uploaded on 23 April 2005 and marked the true launch of the video-sharing site.This February, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan declared: “YouTube is the new television.” He was referring to the fact that more and more people watch YouTube videos on the big screen: apparently, users play 1bn hours of YouTube on their smart TVs a day. But at the same time, more and more people are watching TV on YouTube: Disney uploaded the first three episodes of its Star Wars spin-offAndorto the site in March, while ITV has been sharing its shows on YouTube since December.Today, TV is on YouTube and YouTube is on TV – some YouTubers have even struck deals with streamers, creating their own shows for the box.Beast Games, a reality competition created by the world’s most-subscribed YouTuber, MrBeast, debuted on Prime Video last December and quickly became the platform’s most-watched unscripted series of all time, generating $100m in profit. So what’s the difference between YouTube and TV? Increasingly, less and less. How did we get here? And where are we going to end up?“I woke up to a cold email from an employee at Netflix, and then woke up to another cold email from another streaming platform, and then they kind of started trickling in,” says Victor Bengtsson, managing director of Sidemen Entertainment. The Sidemen are seven YouTubers who have accumulated 146 million subscribers with their skits, challenges and reaction videos over various channels. In 2024, they created their own reality competition on YouTube, Inside, earning more than 50m views – that year, the finale of Love Island All Stars attracted just 1.3 million viewers. No wonder, then, that Netflix acquired season two of Inside, which premiered on the platform in March.View image in fullscreenBro money … The Sidemen.Photograph: PRThis is far from the first collaboration between YouTubers and the mainstream media, even if it did take traditional broadcasters almost a decade to notice the appeal of online celebs. In 2015, the BBC invited beauty vlogger Zoella to take part in The Great Comic Relief Bake Off, while her brother Joe Sugg starred in Strictly Come Dancing three years later. Meanwhile, across the pond, YouTubers were offered their very own shows. In 2016, Netflix releasedHaters Back Off,a series created by online musical comedian Colleen Ballinger. NBC gave Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh a short-lived talkshow in 2019, though she herself joked about its unappealing 1.30am slot before it was cancelled two years later.The trouble with some of these shows is that you can’t just copy and paste a YouTuber and expect them to fit inside a different box; guerrilla content can lose its appeal when it’s moulded into telly’s pre-existing formats. But at a time of crisis in television – senior producers are nowtaking shelf-stacking jobsdue to lack of work – it seems broadcasters are more and more willing to yield to YouTubers’ ways. Bengtsson says the Sidemen feel “respected” by Netflix and is encouraged that “they’re not trying to change what we do. They’re not trying to change who we are.”Inside’s first season was shot over seven days, edited in nine, and debuted a day later. Working with Netflix for season two meant the team had a lot more breathing room and Bengtsson believes the final product was more polished, but still creatively free. “You put people from their platform in the same room as us and it’s like two worlds colliding, it’s two tsunami waves just crashing in,” he says.One issue that arose was the length of the content – the first episode of Inside season one was two hours long, while Netflix told Bengtsson its reality shows typically last 45 minutes. As a compromise, Inside season two has hour-long episodes. Netflix also agreed to drop new episodes daily – like Sidemen viewers were used to – instead of all at once. “This super-successful streaming platform and the Sidemen are merged into one, trying to get what the future of reality TV could look like.”View image in fullscreenA seat at the table … YouTuber turned NBC talkshow host Lilly Singh.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesBut are execs conceding too much to YouTube talent, who are often used to working with fewer constraints? Beast Games has been branded a “dystopian nightmare” – five of its contestants are suing MrBeast for allegedly “unsafe” conditions during filming. Even if you ignore the lawsuit, the show’s contents have proved troubling. The Guardian’s own Stuart Heritage wrote, “There is a cruel ruthlessness to Beast Games that is truly unpalatable … There is endless pleading and crying and full-blown adult tantrums.” Are broadcasters in a race to the bottom?MrBeast’s degrading game show is a dystopian nightmare – perfect for America in 2025Read more“We have a key rule here: it’s not art, it’s entertainment,” says Bengtsson. “Don’t disrespect the format of easy-to-engage content … There is incredible pride in being able to create something that is funny, clever and commercialised.” He adds that the money the Sidemen generate for streamers could “be redistributed to real artists who have real projects”. Of course, the terms “YouTuber” and “artist” are not mutually exclusive: comedian Bo Burnham got his start on YouTube and won three Emmys for his 2021 Covid-themed Netflix special.While broadcasters increasingly attract YouTubers, YouTube is also increasingly attracting broadcasters – the relationship seems to be more symbiotic than ever before. “There are a lot of platforms that can help you with awareness and reach, but I think YouTube is relatively uniquely positioned in being able to generate revenue,” says Neil Price, a UK partner manager at YouTube who helps traditional broadcasters understand how their content can work on the site. Like any other YouTuber, broadcasters can earn money from ads that are displayed around their content.Price says that in recent years, broadcasters have gone from posting small clips of their shows on YouTube to episodes wholesale, as well as creating new content for digital audiences. Between 2023 and 2024, Channel 4 tripled its YouTube views by uploading long-standing shows such as Hollyoaks to its “Channel 4.0” while also launching new online-only prank series and gameshows. “It’ll be interesting to see how production entities continue to evolve their thinking,” Price says. “I think the entire industry deserves real credit for what can feel uncomfortable … for being open to the possibility of exploring new things.”View image in fullscreenA safe bête … MrBeast AKA Jimmy Donaldson.Photograph: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockBut is YouTube having its cake and eating it – competing with broadcasters by hosting their content, not creating its own? Between 2016 and 2022, the site did try its hand at becoming a more traditional media company, launching YouTube Originals, a division that created new shows and films for paying subscribers. Entertainment executive Susanne Daniels was brought on to head the initiative – she previously helped develop shows such as Dawson’s Creek and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.“Original content allows a company to have a voice,” Daniels says – she is especially proud of an Emmy-winning YouTube special she helped create, Recipe for Change: Standing Up to Antisemitism. But does YouTube want a voice? Ultimately, the company chose to be a platform rather than a publisher; CEO Mohan said the Originals division shut because YouTubers were already producing successful content, “so that eliminated the need for us to do anything.” Daniels left the company in 2022. “YouTube is run by engineers and product executives like Neil Mohan who are focused primarily on their distribution capabilities and have little appreciation for the power of premium content,” she says.In the US, more people now watch YouTube on their TVs than watch Disney+, Prime Video and Netflix. No wonder Netflix is rumoured to currently be in talks with YouTubers Dude Perfect and Mark Rober, and Disney is apparently searching for family-friendly creators. But Daniels believes that while “YouTube is definitely a competitor in terms of watch time and eyeballs”, it isn’t a competitor in quality. “Is YouTube the democratisation of content? Yes, arguably it is, in that everyone can make their own YouTube show, but everyone can’t make The Crown or The Sopranos.”Even before they had their own Netflix show, the Sidemen were being watched on TV: more than 45% of the group’s watch time comes from smart TVs. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of YouTube views on TV screens increased more than 130%. This means that while YouTubers may not be making The Sopranos, YouTube videos are becoming more televisual – with bigger budgets, longer watch times and greater production values to fit the big screen. A single MrBeast YouTube video can now cost £3m to make.Viewers would be forgiven for not being able to tell the difference between YouTube and traditional TV. YouTube is becoming more like TV, while TV is becoming more like YouTube. The differences between the two mediums are eroding, and it is unlikely they will ever be distinct again.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now a new exhibition at Ditchling, where he lived, is giving survivors a sayJoanna MoorheadFri 18 Apr 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 16.12 EDTShareAyoung girl kneels on her bedroom floor, hands pressed together, as another figure towers over her, one arm raised. This watercolour, made byEric Gill, is titled Annunciation – but for the abuse survivors currently working on a show of his work that will open in the town where he lived, this scene is far from holy. For them, it is loaded with disturbing overtones.“What I see isn’t the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel. It’s a scared little girl in a room where she ought to feel safe, with a terrifying figure looming over her, blocking the exit,” says Vivien Almond, one of the survivors involved in the project. “There’s no way out – even the window behind her is tiny.” The image, says Almond, is “all about power – the power that figure has over that young girl invading her space, threatening her. And that’s what Eric Gill was all about.”Eric Gill: can we separate the artist from the abuser?Read moreAlmond knows what she’s talking about: as a child, she was sexually abused by her own father over many years, just as Gill’s two elder daughters Betty and Petra were – a fact that didn’t come to light until a biography by Fiona MacCarthy was published in 1989, the author having found evidence of the crimes in Gill’s own previously unseen diaries.Since then the world has grappled with how to treat the artist’s work. Some galleries have quietly removed it from view. Last week, one of his most famous pieces, a sculpture of Prospero and Ariel from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, was returned to public view at BBC Broadcasting House in London, albeitbehind a protective screen, following an incident in whichit was damaged. A QR code nearby now links to details of Gill’s crimes.View image in fullscreenBack on display … Gill’s Prospero and Ariel at BBC Broadcasting House.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe BBC said it had taken “expert advice”, although it isn’t clear if that was from survivors. This new show is believed to be the first time survivors of abuse have been directly involved in deciding whether and what to show of Gill’s work and how to interpret it. It is being put together atDitchling Museum of Art + Craft, the institution most strongly associated with his story. The museum is in the Sussex village that was home for six years to Gill and the artistic community he founded, which continued to be based there after he and his family moved to Wales in the 1920s.Since Gill’s crimes became known, the museum, says its director Steph Fuller, has never sought to hide from the reprehensible elements of his story. Astatement on its websitecondemns his abuse, but adds that his “importance to art and design history in the UK and across the world is impossible to ignore”.The voices missing are those of the daughters who were subjected to the abuseYet Fuller thinks more needs to be said. “I’ve felt for a while,” she says, “that the voices missing in our interpretation are the voices of the daughters who were subjected to the abuse.” Those daughters are now dead, but one day two years ago, Fuller found herself talking to Ann Sumner, chair of theMethodist Modern Art Collection(MMAC) in London. Sumner was wondering what to do with a Gill painting owned by the MMAC. From that conversation grew the idea of a new exhibition, which will lead in time to a re-imagining of the Ditchling collection overall, curated with four abuse survivors, members of the Methodist Survivors Advisory Group.One thing the survivors were clear about, says Fuller, was the importance of showing Gill’s work and not sweeping it under the carpet. “They said hiding things and not talking about them is the culture in which abuse flourishes. There are lots of very difficult and emotive issues to discuss here. But if the survivors can do it, then the rest of us certainly can.”Almond adds: “If you don’t show his work, you’re not telling the story of this man. My view is it needs to be seen, but included alongside it needs to be the story of what this man did, how he abused his daughters. It’s been said what he did didn’t affect these women much. But that’s rubbish. If you suffer abuse, it stays with you, it’s a pain you never get rid of, and it changes everything else that happens to you.”View image in fullscreen‘He wanted the world to see how clever he’d been, hiding it all from everyone’ … Gill, third from right, with his family in the mid-1920s.Photograph: FMC photo archiveThe new display will be part of an exhibition at Ditchling entitled It Takes a Village, to open in early July. It will include both Annunciation, the work that so struck Almond, and other pieces including Gill drawings of Betty and Petra, among them a nude of Betty when she was 16. “That was drawn at the point when the abuse was happening,” says Fuller.Fiona, another survivor involved in the Ditchling project, says she’s been surprised by how little museums and art galleries have consulted survivors when making decisions around Gill’s work. “Art has a tendency to be self-congratulatory and pretentious.Arthistorians think they know things, but actually all they know about is art. They don’t know what it’s like to survive abuse.”One issue for her is monetary value. “When someone is a name, their work is worth more. It’s to do with someone’s reputation, but it shouldn’t be only their artistic reputation – because with Gill you’ve got someone who was much revered, but we now know he was a very unpleasant character: sleazy, a paedophile. So his value should reflect that reputation as well.”View image in fullscreenAlso on show … Divine Lovers (Icon), 1922, by Eric Gill.Photograph: Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft collectionFiona testified against her abuser, a man who lodged in her family home when she was a child, decades after his crimes took place, and he was convicted and imprisoned. “I wanted to hold him to account, and I want to hold Gill to account. He was a smug and arrogant man and in writing about his abuse in his diaries, I think perhaps he wanted it all to come out eventually – he wanted the world to see how clever he’d been, hiding it all from everyone, making people think he was so saintly.”Now in her 70s, Fiona says the attitude to abuse has changed for survivors over the years. “It used to be hushed up, and people would say it doesn’t do any real harm. But now it’s being more talked about that view has changed – so getting more people to speak about it is the way forward.”Childhood books made by the Gill daughters and the 1922 sculpture Divine Lovers (Icon) – showing Christ embracing a figure representing the church – will also be included in the display, which will be in a separate room at the museum. “We’re very mindful of visitors who might have been victims of abuse,” says Fuller. “There will be a notice explaining the content before people go into the room.”Survivors’ sensitivities have tended to be more around works that home in on intimate situations in the home, rather than with pieces that are sexually explicit, says Fuller. “We’ve been talking a lot about abuse holistically, how it happens and the family dynamics around it. Also, because the survivors are from a Christian group, and Gill was a Catholic, they’ve been interested in how he depicted spiritual and divine subjects in a sexualised way.”It Takes a Village is atDitchling Museum of Art + Craft, East Sussex, in July.In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

In Charles Crichton’s A Fish Called Wanda (1988), John Cleese’s character is called Archie Leach. Leach is, of course, the real name ofCary Grant– a very goofy and unglamorous sounding name compared with the sonorous “Cary Grant” – and a rare example of Hollywood alluding to the open secret of rebranding its stars and effacing the bland ordinariness of their origins.Peter BradshawUn oeuf is enough: have we had our fill of movie Easter eggs?Read moreA tribute to TechnobladeMy children dragged me toA Minecraft Movierecently. Packed screening. Loads of kids. A little way into the film, a pig crossed the screen wearing a crown, and a collective “Awww” rose from the audience. For the life of me I couldn’t understand why, and then my 10-year-old leaned over and explained it. The pig was the profile picture of Technoblade, a wildly influential Minecraft YouTuber who died in 2022. It was a sweet touch, both acknowledging Technoblade and the importance of the wider YouTube community to the game’s success. Didn’t like the film, but it was a nice touch.Stuart HeritageArnie does the BardI’m a sucker for a fake trailer – the most delectable of ways the movie industry can disappear up its own fundament. So while the ones for the ecclesiastical Brokeback Mountain, AKASatan’s Alley, from Tropic Thunder and Edgar Wright’s faux Britsploitation horrorDon’t, from Grindhouse, occasionally pop up in my head, it’sArnold Schwarzenegger’s Hamletfrom 1993’s Last Action Hero that lives there rent-free. As 90s Hollywood was getting hip to postmodernism, this is a perfectly executed mashup of high and low culture, with the meathead as an Uzi-toting sweet prince, his payoff lines burning as bright as his stogie tip: “Not to be!” And now surely the time is right for Arnie’s Lear: “As flies to wanton badasses are we to the gods / They kill us for their sport!”Phil HoadArnie does KurosawaLast Action Hero is a parody of the action genre so crammed with indiscriminate references to other films it’s virtually one Easter egg after another. Mainstream audiences would have recognised nods to Basic Instinct, Amadeus, The Seventh Seal (already parodied in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey) et al, but are less likely to have clocked the screenwriters’ homage to Akira Kurosawa’s High and Low (1963). Alas,Arnold Schwarzeneggerspotting the telltale pink smoke produced by incinerated banknotes somehow lacks the impact of Kurosawa’s burning briefcases sending pink smoke into a grey sky, the only touch of colour in an otherwise black and white film.Anne BillsonA history lesson from PixarMy childhood spanned the golden Pixar era: I was six when Toy Story came out and 20 by Up. I knew their films were different from other kids’ fare because my grownup relatives loved them (Toy Story was my grandpa’s favourite film). An ITV documentary on the making of 2001’s Monsters, Inc. taught me why. It introduced me to the concept of Easter eggs: how the studio loved to reference itself and, moreover, cinema history. The rotund green monster Mike Wazowski and his snake-haired girlfriend Celia Mae go on a date to the restaurant Harryhausen’s, which the doc revealed was named after Jason and the Argonauts animatorRay Harryhausen– something I knew nothing about aged 12. When you’re young, films feel like closed worlds designed just for you. The realisation that they were actually part of a vast history, and that they contained layers below the surface, made me gawp, and I’m certain it stoked the interest in learning how things are made that I now get to pursue for a living.Laura SnapesView image in fullscreenA giant in the field … Ray Harryhausen’s special effects in Jason and the Argonauts.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyIdina Menzel channels Broadway in WickedI adored last year’s film adaptation ofWicked– to the bafflement of a number of my friends and colleagues, who had found the film long, confusing and generally “a bit much”. Which I get. Because if you weren’t a musicals-obsessed seven-year-old when the original production became the latest Broadway sensation, I appreciate that the film might not have hit in quite the same way. But Wicked was unapologetically a film for the fans, and the breathless excitement of my seven-year-old self was awakened when Broadway’s original Elphaba, every 00s theatre kid’s icon Idina Menzel, sings the famous “ah-ah-ah-ah” run of notes from Defying Gravity in her cameo appearance. It’s testament to Cynthia Erivo’s talent that when at the end of the film she sings them again, in their proper place, they’re just as arresting.Lucy KnightAlien meets Predator – for the first timePredator 2 – Stephen Hopkins’ urban sequel to John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s arboreal shoot-em-up – is a far more interesting film than it’s often given credit for. It isn’t a patch on the peerless original, of course, and only the maniacal would claim otherwise. But Danny Glover’s haggard and really quite terrified detective is a far more interesting protagonist than an invincible bodybuilder brandishing a gun the size of his own leg, and the film is content, for better and worse, to do its own thing, critics be damned. One of its finest diversions from the first movie comes at the climax, when Glover’s Lieutenant Harrigan finds himself aboard the extraterrestrial game hunter’s spaceship. There, he discovers a wall festooned with trophies from the beast’s previous hunts, and given centre stage is the ossified, banana-like skull of a xenomorph, the acid-blooded chief biters of the Alien franchise. This brief nod implied a vast, shared cinematic universe before such things were drearily commonplace, and suggested that one day we would see these two enthusiasts of gory space violence face off. Sadly, that dream was infinitely preferable to the reality of the two Alien vs. Predator films that resulted, which are only slightly less unpleasant than slamming your fingers in a door. But let’s just forget about those.Luke HollandView image in fullscreenCritics be damned … Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator and Danny Glover as Lieutenant Mike Harrigan in Predator 2.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarObjects may be closer than they appearMy favourite Spielberg Easter egg is in virtually every summer film of his, from Duel through Jurassic Park: his monster-in-the-rearview-mirror shot. You may remember it best from Close Encounters: Richard Dreyfuss waves on the lights he sees in his rearview mirror only for them to go up and over his truck. Dreyfuss said he could hear the audience react when he read that in the script. But ideally the two bodies, pursuer and pushed, are in motion: Indy using his rvm to spy a Nazi climbing along the side of his truck in Raiders, Dennis Weaver doing the same for the monster truck in Duel, or Bob Peck spying a T rex catching up with his 4x4 in Jurassic Park. Spielberg even includes the warning “objects may be closer than they appear”. The visceral intent of every chase scene of his in just seven words.Tom ShoneDarcy resurrectedAdmittedly, “what a clever nod to Colin Firth/Mark Darcy” wasn’t my first reaction when Leo Woodall emerged from the pool in a soaking wet white shirt inBridget Jones 4. But I did appreciate the nostalgia for fans who have loved Bridge for 25 years. It wasn’t the only thing that brought back the best memories with our favourite spinster: blue string soup cocktails, awful dinner parties with smug marrieds, Bridget’s newfound knowledge of Chechnya, the massive knickers and a snowy end-of-film snog. The most special, though, was Darcy’s son wearing his dad’s reindeer jumper.Hollie RichardsonThe boy in Death in Venice ages into a human sacrificeOne moment you are youthful beauty personified. The next, you are white-bearded and crinkled, and your once-worshipped visage is being staved in with a mallet. Björn Andrésen was 15 when he played the sailor-suited twink in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 adaptation of Death in Venice, and 63 when he stepped off a cliff as a human sacrifice in Ari Aster’s sunlit horrorMidsommar. (The jump didn’t finish him off: hence the mallet.) His cameo represents a highpoint in the tradition of the casting Easter egg. Andrésen, whose life was ruined by Death in Venice and the ensuing adoration, must have relished destroying the face that started it all.Ryan GilbeyZombie bike messenger delivers the goodsView image in fullscreenBlink and you’ll miss it … Michael Smiley as a zombified Tyres (yellow cap) in Shaun of the Dead.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarMy favourite series as a slightly nerdy teen was Spaced, Channel 4’s homage-heavy flatshare sitcom, so I felt bereft when it was announced that the show would end after just two series. But there was a mega consolation prize on offer: a big-screen outing for Spaced’s creator and cast, in the form of Shaun of the Dead. In the main, while I enjoyed Shaun, it didn’t quite live up to its predecessor – marauding zombies weren’t as funny as bickering Robot Wars contestants or a man dressed as a vacuum doing performance art – but I did appreciate a blink-and-you’ll-miss it Spaced Easter egg at the film’s climax: there, among a horde of the undead, was a zombified version of Tyres, the sitcom’s wild-eyed bike messenger raver, still wearing his little yellow cycling cap and listening to thumping techno through his wraparound headphones.Gwilym MumfordLego Alfred gives a Bat-biographySome Easter eggs are sly nods, others lazy studio cross-promotion, but The Lego Batman Movie (2017) dropped one so audacious it deserves its own Bat-signal. In a gloriously meta montage,Alfred dryly recalls his master’s “weird phases”, including 1966’s dance-happy caper and the infamous Bat-nipple debacle, effectively canonising every previous cinematic dark knight as just chaotic footnotes in this Lego loner’s emotional scrapbook. Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney – all downgraded to painful fashion faux pas in the life of one emotionally constipated minifig. Which means Batman & Robin wasn’t a cinematic travesty - it was Lego Batman’s rebellious club-kid phase, complete with rubber codpiece and lashes of neon regret.Ben ChildExplore more on these topicsFilmSteven SpielbergArnold SchwarzeneggerCary GrantPixarIdina MenzelBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its fictionalised portrayal of de Beauvoir’s childhood friendship with Elisabeth Lacoin – a foundational relationship that informed plenty of her writing, and perhaps as much of her philosophy – was too much for the writer’s partner, Jean-Paul Sartre, who “held his nose” at it.But the yearning intensity of Sylvie (Ayesha Ostler) for her new BFF Andrée (Lara Manela) is a painfully lovely thing in this adaptation by Grace Joy Howarth. “Life without her would be death,” Sylvie proclaims, and instantly fantasises about falling down dead beside her. Andrée reads Horace, plays violin and can do the splits. What little French girl wouldn’t be smitten?It takes until the second half – when the women enter young adulthood – for the story to come into focus. The twin pressures of faith and society exert an unbearable toll on the charismatic but dutiful Andrée: Caroline Trowbridge plays her exacting mother, while Alexandre Costet-Barmada is wonderfully infuriating as Pascal, the earnestly religious student she falls for.View image in fullscreenLara Manela and Alexandre Costet-Barmada in The Inseparables.Photograph: AJ Halsey/Melanie SilvaIt’s probably the fault of the uneven narrative that despite it all I left with more feeling for Sylvie, de Beauvoir’s alter ego. Her father’s reversal of fortunes, which requires her to work, sets her free from convention. And it’s Ostler’s compassionate performance – mixing an evolving feminism with her impassioned defence of her friend – that captivates through the impressionistic parade of balls, cafes, picnics and university halls (neatly designed by Hazel Poole Zane).De Beauvoir herself agreed with Sartre’s criticisms of her book: “The story seemed to have no inner necessity and failed to hold the reader’s interest,” she wrote. In play version, it simply takes too long for a sequence of Left Bank conversations to find their dramatic purpose, while some elements remain frustratingly opaque: Sylvie’s atheism, and the idea that she is a “corrupting influence”, in particular.But director Anastasia Bunce keeps the scenes moving, and breathing and delivers a production that’s testament to a special friendship. “One day,” says Sylvie of Andrée, “I swore people would write novels about her.” De Beauvoir has certainly kept Elisabeth’s spirit alive.AtFinborough theatre, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreSimone de BeauvoirreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is one of the themes – and indeed the mechanics – ofLost Records, a narrative adventure about four teenage girls who develop an intense friendship in rural Michigan during the summer of 1995. In the first instalment, they form a band, discover an old shack in the woods to use as a clubhouse, and encounter a supernatural force emanating from a deep hole they discover nearby. But as autumn draws in and the girls plan a climactic rock gig, tragic secrets are uncovered.Cleverly, the story is told mostly in flashback, as the characters meet again, decades later, in their long-abandoned home town – they’re older, wiser and with new perspectives on what happened to them as teenagers. Lead character Swann, a keen photographer whose video camera provides a key game interface in the first episode, is living a solitary life, while Autumn is still filled with anxiety and Nora is now an influencer. Missing is Kat whose terminal cancer diagnosis obliterates their world at the close of part one.View image in fullscreenIncredibly poignant … Lost Records: Bloom & Rage (Tape Two).Photograph: Don’t NodWhile the first instalment focused on the excitement and hubris of the teenage characters, this is a much darker story concentrating on the adults as they pick apart their lives. Through dialogue trees and interactive memory segments you help Swann navigate the meeting, as well as moments from the past. There is less of the video camera this time. In the first part, there were multiple occasions where you had to film certain scenes, creating a nicely personal bank of footage which could be edited and reshot. There is also much less actual gameplay: an early scene where you have to pack a box and a later stealth sequence where you sneak into Kat’s bedroom are the only real moments of ludic challenge. I missed taking more of an active role.What you get instead, are some incredibly poignant narrative scenes, as the girls battle with the reality of Kat’s diagnosis and the raw ambiguity of their feelings for each other. Two moments stand out especially: Swann and Nora meeting alone one afternoon, talking and exchanging gifts, every word, every gesture, communicating a mass of unspoken feelings. Then, Swann sneaking into Kat’s bedroom and helping her cut her hair before chemotherapy takes it. This is some of the most profound, sensitively structured and emotionally resonant writing about the teenage experience of love and loss I have ever encountered in a video game.Tape Two ends on an ambiguous note, though I think this is utterly true to the experience of playing. The mysterious hole in the woods, which the characters call “the abyss”, can be interpreted as entirely symbolic, as can all the supernatural events in the game, and this is a brave, credible narrative decision. Sometimes, there are no answers, and sometimes the magic we perceived around us when we were young turns out to have been something else entirely – perhaps just friendship or imagination, or the yearning to be something in the world.The effect is like Stranger Things directed by Kelly Reichardt – a realist fantasy in which silence and ambiguity come to the fore. Lost Records is ultimately a game about love, grief and self-recrimination, and the different intensities of those forces as we age. By the end you miss the optimism and verve of those girls in the woods, as though you were one of them – and quite possibly, in a lot of ways, you were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Devotees have variously decoded its lyric and “big red lips” metaphor as a repudiation of a neighbourhood gossip, a commentary on anti-Black racism or an anthem for female empowerment. Stretched out to a righteous 12-minute call-and-response in Puerto Rico, she recast the song as a cry of anguish over her exile from her homeland, adding lines like “Yo como el pájaro quiero / mi libertad recobrar” (“Like the bird / I want to regain my freedom”) that channelled the pain of the dispossessed.Whether exiles themselves or simply economic migrants, many in the concert audience – just like many in her fanbase across the Latin American diaspora – sensed the sadness beneath her words, the vulnerability within the strength. They crowned her the Queen of Salsa. “Celia had power in a male-dominated world, she changed the game,” says Cuban singer Daymé Arocena. “She had no interest in the comfort zone.”View image in fullscreenOn stage at the Kennedy Center in 2021.Photograph: KMazur/WireImageCruz’s influence is still keenly felt today in contemporary stars such as Cardi B, who saluted her in the video forI Like Itand arrived at last year’s Met Gala dressed like her; UK dance star Barry Can’t Swim rewired Cruz’s 1974 song Quimbara for his own 2024mega-banger Kimbara. And salsa, the music Cruz helped pioneer, is enjoying a renaissance, in the form of smash hits such as Bad Bunny’sBaile Inolvidableand Rauw Alejandro’sTú con Él.Cruz was perhaps the greatest Latin American icon of her era, dominating the Latin music charts, decorating her walls with gold records, three US Grammys and four Latin Grammys – alongside prizes from Billboard, the Smithsonian Institution and more – and receiving the keys to New York, Los Angeles, Miami and many other US cities. “I have lots of keys,” she later lamented, “but they don’t open any doors.” Last year, Cruz also became the first Afro-Latina to appear on the US 25-cent coin, with Ventris Gibson, then director of the US Mint, declaring the singer “a trailblazer in music and civil rights”. Cruz’s centenary will be celebrated this year with a series of reissues, alongside events and exhibitions across the US.Cruz had never planned on being a performer; her childhood ambitions were to be “a mother, a teacher, a housewife”, she once said. Nevertheless, she triumphed at talent shows, thrived at Havana’s National Conservatory of Music and, in 1950, joined La Sonora Matancera, a long-running band that specialised insoncubano,guaguancóand chá-chá-chá, the rhythms that later coalesced into salsa. Over the next decade, they became leading lights of the golden age of Cuban music.Then Castro took power. Keenly understanding the power of radio, Castro removed the dance music La Sonora Matancera specialised in from the airwaves, replacing it with propaganda messages. He admired Cruz, however – he would clean his gun to her song Burundanga in the days before the revolution – but these feelings were not reciprocated. Castro would send agents to her house, requesting she perform at his official events; Cruz hid in a closet, sending her brother to say she wasn’t home.View image in fullscreenCruz after winning best salsa album at the 2002 Latin Grammys.Photograph: Adrees Latif/ReutersAs work for La Sonora Matancera dwindled under Cuba’s new regime, in June 1960 they left Havana for a gig in Mexico; en route, bandleader Rogelio Martinez told his musicians: “This is a one-way flight.” They never returned, resettling in the US in 1961; Pedro Knight, the band’s trumpeter and later Cruz’s husband, reasoned that if they had remained in Cuba, “we would have ended up like some of our compatriots who have no way of getting out”. But exile wore heavily upon Cruz, who never saw her parents again. “I don’t have a mother, a father, I don’t have a country,” she mourned 25 years after fleeing Havana. “I only have Pedro.” Outwardly, however, she generally chose to radiate joy: “My message is alwaysfelicidad– happiness.”In 1965, now living in New York, Cruz went solo, backed by the orchestra of Spanish Harlem’s Tito Puente. She became ever more successful, though the ingrained racism in the US was a culture-shock for this proud Afro-Cuban. “Celia celebrated her African roots,” saysAngélique Kidjo, the Benin-born singer, five-time Grammy winner and a friend and superfan of Cruz. “She grew up singing Yoruba songs – her phrasing is embedded in the African tradition. But the white Cubans did not want her to succeed, nor to be associated with her. And her answer to that was: ‘Azúcar!’”Cruz first coined the catchphrase when a waiter in Miami asked if she wanted sugar in her black coffee. Explains Kidjo: “She was saying [to white Cubans]: ‘You may not like it, but you are able to drink coffee due to my ancestors, with the sugar you add. I’m the one who brings flavour to everything you do.’”By the 1970s, Latin music was thriving in the US in the form of salsa, championed by the fledgling Fania Records. “Salsa was this melting pot of Afro-Cuban music, mixed with Puerto Rican and other roots rhythms,” says Bruce McIntosh, vice-president at Craft Latino, the label putting out the centenary reissues. “It was basically created in New York by Fania and its musicians.” The label cultivated a loyal following of listeners who, McIntosh says, “longed for the homeland, and this music, like Latin food and culture, fed that longing”.Fania’s initial audience was overwhelmingly male, however. “Salsa was the street music of its time – it was hip-hop before hip-hop, full of urban folklore and very male-oriented,” McIntosh says.But Johnny Pacheco, the composer and bandleader who founded the label, was in love with Cruz’s voice and her spirit, and signed her. “Celia had been a star since the 50s, and she brought a bit of professionalism to Fania,” says McIntosh. “She also brought a whole new demographic, broadening the scope. When she arrived, there were basically no other women singing salsa. After Celia, women were more drawn to it.”And Cruz was more than able to hold her own against Fania’s young bucks. On Quimbara from 1974’s Celia & Johnny, her first smash-hit collaboration with Pacheco, Kidjo says “her voice was like a percussive instrument, giving you the beat so you can dance salsa”. In 1974, Cruz accompanied the Fania All-Stars when they performed a festival in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to coincide with Muhammad Ali and George Foreman’s Rumble in the Jungle bout.“Salsa was huge in Africa, especially west Africa,” says Kidjo, who saw Cruz perform in Benin in her teens. “If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed a woman could lead a salsa band. The musicians were performing for this woman – she conducted them without even raising a finger. It was a defining moment for me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It solidified Queen Celia’s reign, which continued until her death in 2003. “She had hits in the 90s and the 00s,” marvels McIntosh. “She was an ambassador for the music and the culture worldwide.”Back in Cuba, however, her music was banned, with Cruz heading an unofficial (but effective) blacklist of artists who had spoken out against Castro’s regime or left the island after he took power.The ban was not overturned until 2012, four years before Castro’s death, and this was done quietly and never officially acknowledged. “I’d never heard of Celia until I arrived in the US and NPR said I sounded like her,” says Daymé Arocena. “We weren’t allowed to listen to her music.” When she researched Cruz, however, Arocena realised she had grown up mere blocks from her childhood home, and drew inspiration from her music. “Bemba Colorá has become an empowering song for me. They tell Black women not to wear red lipstick, that it makes our lips look bigger, and it’s a way of oppressing us. So every time I wear red lipstick on stage, I think of that song.”Everybody salsa! Fania, the ramshackle New York label that sent Latin rhythms globalRead moreAymée Nuviola, another Cuban singer, also knew nothing of Cruz when she heard the comparison while touring abroad. “People would tell me I was a bad Cuban for not knowing Celia!” she laughs. When she finally heard Cruz’s records, she recognised the melodies frompregóns– songs sung by street vendors in Cuba – that she had heard as a child. Castro’s ban couldn’t erase Cruz from Cuba’s folk-memory. Nuviola finally saw Cruz perform in Mexico, late in her career. “She only had to say, ‘Azúcar!’ and everyone screamed and I began to cry. She was magical.”In 2015, Nuviola was cast as Cruz in the Colombian TV drama Celia, which she describes as “a great honour. I absorbed how she moved her hands, how she walked, how she sang.” She struggled with Cruz’s trademark long fingernails – “I’m a pianist!” – but Nuviola understood the central tragedy of Cruz’s life, having also left Cuba early in her career. “Celia had to fight so hard for her life – she had to leave Cuba, and she loved Cuba so, so much.” Later this year, Nuviola will release a duet, adding her vocals to Cruz’s original trackRíe y Llora(Laugh and Cry). “It’s from Celia’s final album,” says Nuviola, “a very emotional album called Regalo del Alma. The title means ‘a gift from my soul’. She gave so much.”View image in fullscreenCruz and Johnny Pacheco, shooting the cover for their 1974 album Celia and Johnny.Photograph: Fania RecordsKidjo, meanwhile, befriended Cruz in her later years, and remembers “sitting together at the Grammys, cracking up with laughter – she called me ‘hermana Africana’, her sister from Africa.” Kidjo later recorded Afrobeat interpretations of Cruz’s music for her 2019 album Celia, celebrating the star whose example had been so foundational.“When I saw her perform when I was a teenager, she became everything I wanted to be,” she says. “This ball of smiling and joy and happiness on stage, like, ‘Nothing’s gonna stop me, this is where I want to be. This is what I have to give to the world.’ Celia didn’t choose to be born in Cuba, she didn’t ask to be a descendant of slaves. But African music and spirit has survived through her determination to become whoever she wanted to be.”Reissues of Son Con Guaguancó, Tremendo Cache and Only They Could Have Made This Album are out now.

Here, ex-Navy Seal Mendoza, who was one of the soldiers, discusses how the movie was made with his troupe of actorsFri 18 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 00.20 EDTShareFive actors and one director are seated around a table in a London hotel room, when there is a knock at the door. The room service attendant enters, bearing a tray of dainty glasses filled with a custard-coloured tipple. It’s not even noon, but cut these people some slack: they’ve been through something traumatic.Ray Mendoza, the 45-year-old Iraq war veteran turned film-maker, has just co-directed Warfare, which restages in distressing, claustrophobic visuals and concussive sound the terrifying ordeal he underwent in November 2006 as part of a group of US Navy Seals who were trapped, along with two Iraqi scouts and two marines, under fire from al-Qaida forces in a crumbling apartment building in Ramadi, 70 miles (110km) west of Baghdad. Mendoza and his fellow soldiers had to care for their wounded comrades, after an improvised explosive device blew up the armoured vehicle that was trying to facilitate their escape, all the while holding off their attackers and hanging tight for a second batch of rescuers.Now, he andAlex Garland, who became close when Mendoza was an adviser on Garland’s explosive thriller Civil War, have recreated that experience. Just as Stanley Kubrick brought the Vietnam war to an east London gasworks for Full Metal Jacket, Garland and Mendoza’s crew built an exact replica of the Ramadi street on an airfield in Buckinghamshire for Warfare.View image in fullscreenWarfare, from left, Joseph Quinn, Michael Gandolfini, Joe Macaulay, Henrique Zaga, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Will Poulter, Kit Connor, Noah Centineo, Taylor John Smith, Adain Bradley, Cosmo Jarvis and Charles Melton.Photograph: A24/Real Time SituationThe actors still look mildly shell-shocked from the production, which was preceded by a three-and-a-half-week bootcamp, led by Mendoza. Three of them are Britons, kitted out today in sober black or grey suits. At 35, Cosmo Jarvis, the grizzled hero oflast year’s Shōgun, is the elder statesman of the cast members present; opposite him is Will Poulter, 32, who has form with harrowing movie experiences, having starred in The Revenant, Detroit and Midsommar; and next to Poulter is Kit Connor, the Heartstopper heart-throb, 21, and with a face as soft as bubble bath. Michael Gandolfini, 25, who played the young Tony Soprano, the character immortalised by his late father, James, in The Many Saints of Newark, is dressed, like Mendoza, in a mushroom-coloured sweatshirt. The most dapper of the group, in an emerald green shirt and chocolate-brown corduroy suit, is 23-year-old D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, the Canadian star of Taika Waititi’s Reservation Dogs. He says little today, scowling handsomely as though smiling is taxed.And the beverage? Something bracing that harks back to those wild nights letting off steam after long days at boot camp? Not quite. “Ginger shots,” says Connor cheerfully. They all down theirs except Mendoza, whose drink sits untouched in front of him for the next hour.View image in fullscreenRay Mendoza, left, on set with co-director and co-writer Alex Garland.Photograph: Courtesy of A24It was his idea to make the film. But why tell this story among all the others he must have at his disposal? “It’s true there are others that resonate,” he says. “The battle of Falluja. Haditha Dam. I could go on. The difference with this one, though, is Elliott Miller.” Miller, played in the film by Jarvis, is a close friend of Mendoza, and was severely wounded that day in Ramadi.“He still does not remember what happened. When he first woke up in hospital, he wanted us to tell him everything. The more we explained, the more questions he had. It seemed we could never solve the issue of him lacking that core memory.” As Mendoza began working in the film industry – early jobs included adviser roles on Lone Survivor and Jurassic World – he realised that he had the opportunity toshowMiller what they had all gone through together, rather than simply telling him. “I felt I was ready. I felt it was time.” What was Miller’s response when he revealed his plan? “This is a direct quote: ‘Fuck yeah!’”There was a simple rule that if it happened, it went in, and if it didn’t, it was outMichael GandolfiniThe film was pieced together from the memories of those who were there. “There was a simple rule that if it happened, it went in, and if it didn’t, it was out,” says Gandolfini. “Our function was more to recreate. What was most fundamental was, um, the pursuit of truth.” Chuckles ripple around the table. It quickly becomes clear that Gandolfini has uttered today’s booby-trapped phrase: say “the pursuit of truth” and you earn the gentle mockery of your cast-mates. “There should be some sort of prize,” smiles Poulter. “Or punishment.”It’s understandable that they might need such distractions to keep themselves interested. There is laughter again, for instance, when Woon-A-Tai’s answer to one of my questions begins: “I don’t know if anyone said this already, because I kinda zoned out a little bit back there, but ….” After all, they have been asked umpteen times about what boot camp was like, and how they shaved one another’s heads as a bonding exercise, and how they all got matching tattoos once filming was over. The words “Call on me”, taken from the Eric Prydz banger heard in Warfare’s opening scene, were intended to convey in ink the sense of brotherhood instilled in them by the making of the movie.View image in fullscreenD’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Joseph Quinn and Will Poulter in Warfare.Photograph: Murray Close/A24/Real Time SituationGandolfini describes the atmosphere on set: “There was a roaming camera so it was filmed much more as a play. Everyone was 100% on, all the time.” Poulter jumps in: “Typically in film-making, you’re finding what’s most entertaining. The MO here was completely different. We were making sure we were aligned with the memories of the gentlemen who experienced this.” Didn’t that inhibit their choices as actors? “It might in the traditional context,” Poulter says. “But it empowered us in what we were trying to do. Which was to tell the truth.”The film becomes a protracted sensory experience akin to watching the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan stretched out to 90 minutesJarvis adds his thoughts: “Even though it might seem you’re existing within the confines of a memory, the memories themselves aren’t actually confining. They serve instead as a very clear outline.” “There was such an attention to detail,” says Connor in confirmation. “We did two read-throughs that were basically four hours long because we went through everything with a fine-toothed comb.” Woon-A-Tai had it slightly easier, perhaps, since he was playing Mendoza. “Any small detail, I had Ray there to check,” he says. “After every take, I asked if I did it right. I studied him and tried to steer away from adding my own two cents.” Mendoza gives an approving nod.Once the attack commences in Warfare, the film becomes a protracted sensory experience akin to watching the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan stretched out to 90 minutes. There is close to no information about who the characters are, and audiences will learn nothing about the war itself, or the enemy, who are described at one point by Miller as “getting their jihad on”.View image in fullscreenShot from all sides … a still from Warfare.Photograph: Murray Close/A24/Real Time SituationAs gripping and technically accomplished as the film is, there must be anxiety among the A24 marketing team about how to get Warfare seen. Hence the preponderance of red-carpet hijinks and social-media malarkey that is being used to promote it, and the plentiful references online to the film’s cast of “internet boyfriends”. One advertorial in a men’s style magazine promotes Warfare via the array of expensive watches worn by the actors off-screen: a watch with its “slinky stainless steel case” is compared to “a Navy Seal on a surveillance mission”. There is wordplay around “ammo” and “firepower”. The article stops short of describing the timepieces as “weapons of mass attraction” – but only just.Beyond this hoopla seems to lurk the question: will anyone want to see Warfare more than once? Will anyone want to see itat all? “I’ve seen it six times,” says Woon-A-Tai.But there’s no way around it: Warfare is a necessarily gruelling experience. I’m interested, then, to know what sort of language the cast members have been using to encourage their friends to see the film. How do they sell a movie that is so intense?“I’ve been trying not to say ‘intense’,” says Poulter. “Just because everybody says that.” Oops. My bad.I would tell people it’s probably one of the most immersive war films that I’ve ever seen in my lifeD’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai“Someone called it an action movie,” says Jarvis, shaking his head in dismay. “And yeah, people say ‘intense’. I understand why. But I just try to reiterate the clarity of the original objective. Sometimes, films don’t even seem tohavea direction. Alex and Ray had rules, artistic rules, which informed the process.” He sighs. “I just want people to witness the film without having to pick words to describe it to them.”But describe it we must. Or else how will audiences know whether to buy a ticket? I put the same question to Woon-A-Tai: how isheselling it? “I would tell people it’s probably one of the most immersive war films that I’ve ever seen in my life,” he says gravely. “And honestly, I think that is a pretty good selling-point.” His comrades concur.Gandolfini leans in. “This movie feels highly necessary,” he says. “These are human beings. This is something that happened, and that continues to happen. It’s interesting when people say, ‘It’s such an uncomfortable experience, why didn’t we get a break?’ It’s like, what? This is what happened to these guys:theydidn’t get a break. This is what happens.’”“And it is happeningright now,” says Poulter, furrowing his brow. “Modern warfare is not obsolete.” Silence weighs heavily in the room. Somebody’s chair creaks. Connor stares at his empty shot glass.Iraq veteran and film-maker Ray Mendoza: ‘Writing Warfare with Alex Garland was like going to a therapist’Read moreThen Mendoza sits back from the table. “These are my closing remarks,” he announces, as if wrapping up a meeting. “I’m not worried about how the film is received so much as seeing it as a moment in time for me and my friends that’s gone. Maybe this will only be special to them. But it’s going to resonate with veterans. And there is love between them. It is about love.”He lets that thought hang in the air. “If you can’t watch this movie, if you’re trying to put it in a box of, like, ‘There are all these wars going on, and what’s the context, and what’s your opinion on war?’… Well then, I feel bad for you because you’re missing something. It’s about sacrifices that can only be made through a deep understanding of love. These guys were willing to put their lives on the line and go through hell to save a group of other guys. Maybe you wanna go see what that kind of sacrifice is like, and ask yourself, ‘What haveIdone that’s like that?’ If you can’t see that in this movie then you’re doing it through a different lens and … I dunno. I wish you would see it this way. I feel sorry if you can’t experience it that way and if you have to put it in some kind of political box.”Mendoza turns his attention to the actors, two or three of whom are now staring solemnly into their laps. “I’ll keep saying it: I’m proud of all you guys,” he tells them, garnering grunts of reciprocation. “Go on and do great things.”Warfare is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmIraqAl-QaidaAlex GarlandAction and adventure filmsWar filmsMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Certified paedophile,” Lamar’s track was one of a number of diss tracks issued by the rappers against each other in spring 2024. Not Like Us became the most commercially successful, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and it also won Lamar five Grammy awards including record and song of the year.In JanuaryDrake sued UMG, the label that he and Lamar share, over the song, alleging UMG “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track” that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”. UMG argued the case was “utterly without merit” and called for it to be dismissed.Drake’s legal team have now amended the lawsuit with new allegations, claiming that the Super Bowl performance, which was the most-watched half-time show ever, “further solidified the public’s belief in the truth of the allegations against Drake … Not only did streams of the recording increase significantly following these two mega-cultural events, but threats against Drake and his family did as well.”Lamar omitted the words “certified paedophile” from the performance, but included the “I hear you like ’em young” line, delivered while staring into the camera in a moment that was widely shared on social media. The omission was made, the lawsuit claims, because “everyone understands that it is defamatory to falsely brand someone a ‘certified paedophile’”. Lamar is not being sued by Drake, only UMG.UMG responded to the amendments by saying: “Drake, unquestionably one of the world’s most accomplished artists and with whom we’ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another.”Drake secured a small victory in the ongoing case earlier this month, when a judge allowed his team to access certain UMG documents as they built their case, a process known as “discovery” which UMG had attempted to block.Alongside their statement about the amendments, UMG addressed that decision, saying: “Drake will personally be subject to discovery as well. As the old saying goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’.”Drake’s team then responded in kind, saying: “Drake knows exactly what he asked for: the truth and accountability.”Elsewhere at the Super Bowl show, Serena Williams – who reportedly once dated Drake – danced on stage to Not Like Us, an appearance which was perceived by some viewers as mocking Drake. Asked by Time magazine this week whether that was the case, Williams said: “Absolutely not. I would never do that. And that was sad, that anyone would ever think that.

They’re made to look the way they want them to look. There’s no thought put into the human being. So what happens is that you just start sweating … So in that thing, you’d just be pouring water, because you have that cowl over it. Like, there’s one thing to wear the suit, but once you cover your head, I guess that’s where all your heat kind of escapes and you feel it.”Affleck said that even highly trained stunt performers found it difficult to wear the suit for long periods. “They could do that for about like 45, 50 minutes and then they’re like gonna get heatstroke. So you had to come out of it.”It doesn’t make you feel very heroic, because you’re instantly exhausted and sweatyHe added: “It just made it difficult to make the movie, because you’re so hot. It also does not make you feel very heroic, because you’re instantly exhausted and really sweaty.”Affleck played Batman in two features directed by Zack Snyder:Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justicein 2016 andJustice Leaguein 2017 (with the latter re-edited and released in 2021 asZack Snyder’s Justice League), as well as cameos inSuicide SquadandThe Flash. Affleck was originally attached to star in, direct and co-write subsequent standalone filmThe Batman, but wasultimately replaced in the role by Robert Pattinsonafter the disappointing commercial performance of Batman v Superman and Justice League.From mech-suit to Batnipples: the best and worst Batman suits of all timeRead moreAffleck’s Batsuit, designed by Oscar-nominated costume designer Michael Wilkinson andbuilt by Jose Fernandez and Ironhead Studio, was reportedly made from multiple layers of Lycra and foam, taking Affleck around 25 minutes to get into it, with up to six costume assistants helping. In 2015, Wilkinson described the cowl as “incredible engineering”, saying that previous Batsuits had not allowed actors to turn their heads, and that the costume as designed was “comfortable and very flexible” and allow Affleck to perform in “a very natural and forceful way”.Affleck’s Batsuit is not the first to attract criticism, with the“nipple suit” George Clooney worefor Batman & Robin in 1997 often cited as one of the reasons for the film’s poor performance.Explore more on these topicsFilmBen AffleckBatmanBatman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeJustice LeagueZack SnydernewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday 7 April, an 11-year-old boy reported that a man attempted to film him in a restroom of a fast food restaurant, and on Wednesday 9 April, police officers received another report from the restaurant, that a man was “entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males at the business”.Officers arrested Seiders at the scene, and secured search warrants for his home, vehicle and phone: “Evidence was located implicating him in the two reported incidents, along with additional crimes, including possessing child pornography,” the statement reads. He was also charged with annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy, and attempted invasion of privacy.Seiders is being held in jail with bail set at $1m, and is due in court on 22 April.The New Pornographers responded with a statement reading: “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified, and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders – and we have immediately severed all ties with him. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.”Fronted by AC Newman and the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Neko Case, the band are an enduring presence in North American indie, with a catalogue dating back to 2000 debut album Mass Romantic. One of their former members isDan Bejar, AKA Destroyer. Their biggest chart success came with 2014 album Brill Bruisers, which reached No 13 in the US charts, after which their long-time drummer Kurt Dahle left and was replaced by Seiders.As well as touring with the band, Seiders performed on their three most recent studio albums. He has also backed Case as well as artists including John Oates, Juliana Hatfield and Gary Jules, and previously played in the group Beat Club.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The right-hand melody of Fauré’s Pavane was so smooth it might have been glued together. Descant lines tinkled like a tiny music box. His left hand was heavyweight throughout, as if he had decided to turn up the bass.Such oddity was nothing compared to his take on Schumann’s Kreisleriana – a set of eight self-consciously eccentric miniatures. Lang Lang launched himself on to the keyboard for the first, driving hard and loud, his hands flying theatrically at the end. For contrast: more of that hushed music-box tone and passages of precious, gossamer delicacy before instantaneous switches back into muscular rollicking dissonance. A more-is-more approach to the sustaining pedal turned some moments into spectacular slush. Just occasionally, there was a magical, quiet sense of storytelling and the penultimate movement was suddenly, playfully dry (pedal briefly abandoned) until yet another gear change into a passage smashed out so quickly it blurred. In the final movement Lang’s ever-dominant left hand treated Schumann like Rachmaninov.View image in fullscreen‘Passages of precious, gossamer delicacy before instantaneous switches back into muscular rollicking dissonance.’ Lang Lang at the Barbican Hall on 17 April 2025.Photograph: Mark AllanWith barely a break between most movements, it was a disorientating listen, the audience helped along only by Lang’s repertoire of physical cues: face lifted upwards, eyes closed; body hunched intensely over the keys; arms whirling away from the piano as if it was scorching.The second half was mainly Chopin Mazurkas. Once again, Lang allowed few gaps between individual numbers. Once again, there were crystalline quiet moments, loudly galumphing moments (accompanied periodically by stamping) and moments that hauled Chopin monumentally into the world of late Romanticism. Yet Lang’s rhythmic freedom was astonishing, his sense of producing each number as an improvisation utterly captivating. In his hands, this familiar music became quite alien.By partway through the mazurka-fest, wriggling and coughing were constant. But if defamiliarisation wasn’t what some audience members had hoped for, their reward was Chopin’s Polonaise in F sharp minor played as a vigorous romp, which precipitated an explosive ovation barely calmed by two encores – “Chopin” from Schumann’s Carnaval and Debussy’s Clair de Lune – the latter so exquisitely quiet it seemed to emanate from elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLang LangreviewsShareReuse this content"

On this second album, experimental Bristol four-piece Quade make a virtue of the slow build; Barney Matthews’ bassy, cryptic vocals are buried beneath shivering cymbals, gut-rumbling bass and blasts of static, with most of the lyricism left to multi-instrumentalist Tom Connolly’s twisting, agonised, beatific violin.View image in fullscreenQuade: The Foel TowerLike their label matesMoinwho describe themselves as “post-whatever”, Quade discard the classic band format for a more organic, intuitive approach. Canada Geese starts with a simple, strummed acoustic guitar and close-quarters detail: distant birdsong, the soft rattle of what could be a washing machine. This intimacy dissolves into grand, threatening post-rock when Matt Griffith’s electronics and Leo Fini’s echoing, distant drums build muscle. “Kill them all,” Matthews mumbles, barely discernible, as Connolly’s strings writhe.Drawing from folk, jazz, ambient and doom, and inspired by tensions between industry and nature, the album was made in Wales’ Elan Valley (mid-album instrumental highlight Nannerth Ganol judders like a low-flying helicopter) and titled after a building on the Garreg Ddu reservoir, which sends its water on a long journey to Birmingham. There are literary references (Le Guin, Yeats, Thomas) buried in the murk, and mystifying media samples (possibly from meditation app Headspace, and an unnamed actor) to pick apart – but The Foel Tower is no concept album. Its six tracks are searching and emotional, led by heart rather than head. Satisfyingly indecipherable, Quade make music that speaks first to your body, then to your imagination.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their final compilation, now repressed, jerks from folk to punk to ambient – with moments worthy of great kids’ TVSafi BugelFri 18 Apr 2025 04.01 EDTShareIn 1980, a group of friends in Japan started DD Records, a platform for amateur musicians to share bizarre homespun recordings across their network. The label released an impressive 222 cassettes and a handful of vinyl records in five years, then disbanded and faded into relative obscurity. Their last known release, the compilation Disk Musik – a multi-genre compilation bringing together 13 Japanese artists – is so rare that even the prolific music catalogue database Discogs bears little trace of it.View image in fullscreenDisk Musik: A DD Records CompilationFour decades on, it’s been re-pressed – and it still sounds as mind-warping as it probably did to its small circle of listeners back in 1985. The opening track by trio Circadian Rhythm may as well be three songs in one, drifting haphazardly from stray humming vocals to wistful coda, by way of a tangle of clatter (toybox percussion, a phone ringing) in just five minutes. It sets the tone for a compilation that runs on little cohesion and maximum frenzy as it hops between folk, scrappy punk-ish jams, ambient soundscapes and pummelling noise.That’s not to say there are no earworms here. With their makeshift electronics, peppy melodies and janky tuning, Summer Initiation by Y Tabata and Egg by Young Hormones are so kitsch and fun they could be mistaken for music from a kids’ TV show, in the best way. But then, at a moment’s notice, the record might jackknife into a storm of whirring feedback, or a collage of yelping vocals and stuttering video game effects. Between the two extremes, there are quietly wonky examples of early Midi minimalism, including a gorgeous, woozy closer by co-founder K Usami. It’s a reminder that the DD Records crew could have made “nice” music if they wanted to, but – wonderfully – that’s not what they were about.Also out this monthIn the latest edition of herTimbre of Guitars album series(Musicmine/Sublime Records), Tokyo-based classical guitaristAyane Shinoreinterprets the glitchy electronic music of the late Rei Harakami through her own medium. Lush, fluttering strings replace Harakami’s signature Roland synth in this intimate tribute record, which – just like Harakami’s productions – is sometimes sprightly, sometimes melancholy, but always soothing. Another collection of spacious, meditative compositions comes viaMusic Belongs to the Universe(Leaving Records), the new LP by California keyboard playerNico Georis. Layering twinkling melodies over gently percolating backdrops, it’s a lovely, light soundtrack for spring mornings.The Rising Wave(AD 93) is the first outing of vocalist Marlene Ribeiro and electronic producer Shackleton asLight-Space Modulator. Over the album’s eight tracks, the pair warp dreamy, harmonising vocals and atmospheric synths into something more disorientating than easy listening, through trickling percussion, deep low-end frequencies and swathes of echo.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

This series does a similar (present-day) job with ballet. It follows twin companies in Paris and New York as they struggle to balance artistic and commercial sustainability while managing a high-maintenance crew of dancers headed by the cartoonishly volatile Cheyenne (Lou de Laâge). It’s full of backstabbing, bad behaviour and waspish wit but the snark is undercut by moments of sincerity as long stretches of performance showcase the artistry that make all the backstage machinations worthwhile. Charlotte Gainsbourg, Luke Kirby and Simon Callow also star.Prime Video, from Thursday 24 AprilTeacupView image in fullscreenBack at the ranch … Teacup.Photograph: Peacock/Mark HillA slow-burning horror series set on a ranch in Georgia and inspired by Robert McCammon’s novel Stinger. For a while, the nature of the threat faced by the ranchers is intriguingly ambiguous – there’s a suggestion that the danger might be psychological with internal tensions. But soon Teacup plunges into more traditional and less satisfying sci-fi chiller territory: there’s a spooky kid who seems able to predict the future and everything is unpacked neatly. It’s impressively gory in places so not without thrills, even if they’re slightly cheap ones.Paramount+, out nowSecrets of the PenguinsView image in fullscreenGoing swimmingly … Secrets of the Penguins.Photograph: National Geographic/PAWhile all nature documentary fans will know that penguins are among the most extraordinary creatures on Earth, this three-part series suggests we didn’t know the half of it. Narrated byBlake Lively, it follows colonies of penguins from the Arctic realms with which they’re most associated and finds that increasingly these birds can now be found in towns, too. Sadly, this is yet another consequence of the climate crisis, but even though humanity is making life tough for penguins, this show is testament to their extraordinary adaptability and powers of endurance.Disney+, from Monday 21 AprilAndorView image in fullscreenForce majeure … Andor.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdWhile devotees of the Star Wars universe already know exactly where Cassian Andor ends up at the conclusion ofthis prequel series– they’ve all seen Rogue One: A Star Wars Story after all – it has been fun mapping the route. This is one of the most accomplished additions to the canon in years, bringing humour and humanity to the world-building and boasting a fine cast that includes Diego Luna, Genevieve O’Reilly and Adria Arjona. This series is both more personal and more widely political –what turns a cynical, detached man such as Andor into a rebel?Disney+, from Wednesday 23 Aprilskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Expect to see a bunch of people you very vaguely recognise from shows such as The Mole,Too Hot to Handleand Squid Game: The Challenge competing in various physical challenges. There are shades of Takeshi’s Castle, Celebrity Bear Hunt and even It’s a Knockout in some of the games, but for all the silliness there’s also big money on the table, with $250k waiting for the winner.Netflix, from Wednesday 23 AprilYouView image in fullscreenPsycho killer … You.Photograph: Clifton Prescod/NetflixYou has never been a subtle show but any nuance goes out of the window for the final season asthis psycho-dramaexits in a blaze of glory. Penn Badgley’s murderous smoothie Joe is back in New York; he’s found a measure of fame as the husband of philanthropist Kate (Charlotte Ritchie). However, journalists have dug out a deadly story about Kate’s past – and they’re not going to be silenced easily. Almost everything about You is absurd and it remains problematic in terms of perspective, essentially asking viewers to root for a serial killer. And yet, it remains a weirdly watchable guilty pleasure to the last.Netflix, from Thursday 24 AprilWondlaView image in fullscreenNice and worm … Wondla.Photograph: AppleA second season for this wholesome sci-fi animation starring Jeanine Mason as Eva, a teenage girl who was raised by a robot after an apocalyptic event on Earth.

This time, she’s found some, chancing upon an enclosed city state called New Attica, which resembles a giant mall (even so, it must be a relief to Eva). But it’s soon obvious that New Attica isn’t all it seems.Apple TV+, from Friday 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re the remnants of a landbridge between the Prom and Tasmania’s Freycinet, a link easily seen in the areas’ shared beauty: fine white sand, rough granite and bright orange lichen contrasting with a startlingly blue sea. It’s the nature, the beauty and the walking that brought us here, as well as a sense of unfinished business.A local’s guide to Narooma: ‘People are amazed at how turquoise the water is’Read moreMy husband and I had been coming to Wilsons Prom for decades, for day walks and multi-day hikes. But we’d never made it to the lighthouse, or stayed in the cottages converted to walkers’ accommodation. To tackle the trip, we booked two bunkrooms and roped in the Schultz family. It would be the first time either of our families – four adults and five kids aged nine to 15 – had attempted a four-day walk, but there was a reward waiting at the end. After 30km of trekking around the Prom, on the last night we’d have luxuries: the cottages’ hot showers and comfy beds.View image in fullscreenThe Prom’s beloved boulders.Photograph: Megan HolbeckTime has brought minimal obvious changes to the 50,000-hectare national park. The past is everywhere: in the bush, geology and Indigenous history. The area sits atop a granite batholith, a huge mass of cooled magma that forms the Prom’s boulders and mountains, as well as the nearby islands.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe Bunurong and Gunaikurnai people have lived in the area for thousands of years, maintaining strong connections to the place they call “Wamoon” or “Yiruk”. Wilsons Promontory appears in many dreamtime stories, with shellfish middens dotting its western coast.Names such as Sealers Cove hint at the area’s colonial history, as do mining and cattle-grazing relics, while the lightstation has safeguarded ships for more than 150 years. The buildings of Tidal River betray the settlement’s origins as a commando training centre in the second world war.View image in fullscreenThe first day was short: an 8km walk to the campsite.Photograph: Megan HolbeckOur walk starts and ends at Tidal River, which is now the park’s main hub, with a shop, campsite and tourist information.The first day was short, an 8km walk to our campsite at Oberon Bay – perfect for adjusting to packs. Under low clouds and strong headwinds, we walked through the tall tangle of tea-tree to Norman Beach where surfers shared the water with a darting seal. On the horizon the Glennie islands showed the boundary of Victoria’s largest marine national park.A smattering of walkers followed the track to Little Oberon Beach, where they formed drifts of people sheltering from the wind. We followed the coast round to Norman Point lookout, which had views to our white sand destination. We picked our way across Growler Creek, admiring tangled piles of driftwood and boulders painted in orange lichen.The campsites at the wide beach’s southern end are in tunnels of tea-tree, perfect for hide and seek. We set up tents while the kids played, until the sight of a dozy tiger snake made us pause the game. We switched to cards and took freezing swims and examined shells and massive cuttlefish bones, until a red sun set over the ocean.Floods in 2021 destroyed some of the track to Sealers Cove, so we couldn’t walk the classic four-day circuit. This route is scheduled to reopen sometime in 2025. Instead, our second day’s route cut across the Prom from west to east, over dry heathland and tea-tree swamps, past looming boulders, to hit Waterloo Bay’s squeaky white sand and clear sea just after lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wombats wandered through the short grass while superb fairy wrens darted about, their blue heads a similar shade to the nearby ocean. We spent the afternoon swimming again in the freezing sea, exploring the beach and the surrounding rock shelves.The next day I woke to the sound of waves and the thought of hot showers. On this leg, the track climbed steeply through tea-tree and eucalypt forest dotted with wildflowers. Glimpses over the previous day’s route looked like scenes from the Whitsundays, only colder and further south. As we climbed we saw the lightstation ahead, a point decorated with tiny white buildings. After ups and downs and a thigh-burning final climb, we reached its lush lawn, kept trim by marsupials and divided by drystone walls, crowned by the granite lighthouse.We were met by ranger Bailey, who showed us our home for the night, a historic lightstation keeper’s house with four bedrooms, a snug lounge, central kitchen with a long table; and the veranda with uninterrupted sea views. Then we raced for the showers.View image in fullscreenThe lighthouse keeps quarters.Photograph: Christian Pearson/Parks VictoriaLater, Bailey took us up the tower and explained its history. Built in 1859, the light originally burned oil. Its running was overseen by a team of four, their families forming a remote community. In a museum at the lightstation’s base, illustrations clipped from newspapers showed terrified women being hoisted ashore and a handwritten story told of the year supply ships ran late and Christmas dinner was delivered by a nine-year-old jumping on a Cape Barron goose.Now the lighthouse is automated, with LED lights and self-changing bulbs. Ranger Bailey told us the fog can get so thick, buildings become invisible at five metres. But that day was clear. From the balcony we were treated to a sea of “whale soup” as humpbacks leapt and cavorted on their way down south.View image in fullscreenA beacon for curious minds, the lighthouse has a museum at its base.Photograph: Nick Esser/Parks VictoriaAfterwards, we lay on the grass, watching wombats, wallabies and whales, until the sun disappeared behind South Point, the southern-most point of mainland Australia.Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal parkRead moreOur final day was the longest – 20-odd kilometres down the middle of the Prom. The sun baked and our sore bits ached, but two things kept spirits high: a generous supply of lolly snakes and the promise of ice-creams when we reached Tidal River. As we sat out the front of the Tidal River shop, we made a toast: to a great family adventure, and many more to come.Food and accommodationWalkers need to be entirely self-sufficient.Bookingsare needed for all campsites and lighthouse accommodation.The Parks Victoriasite gives further information, including about track closures and water availability.Transport and logisticsThe walk starts and finishes at Tidal River, and you’ll need your own transport to get there.

Several shipping containers with the wow factor of the sea-view side being totally glass create a sheltered eating space. Outside there are picnic tables and repurposed wooden rowing boats, cut in half, upturned and fitted with a seat. Freshly prepared dishes include an all-day brunch menu (a highlight is the spinach tortilla with smoked salmon and lemon creme fraiche, £10.50) or the lunch menu (starting from smoked haddock chowder at £8).

The younger of these two informed me she brought her companion, who was suffering with Alzheimer’s, to the cafe every week because she enjoyed the social interactions with other customers. All the regulars knew each other by name and immediately introduced themselves. Several other conversations ensued over the length of my visit and I was encouraged to “Come again soon.” Popular with locals (and their dogs) and tourists, the cafe not only serves a decent bacon bun but surrounds you with a sense of wellbeing.SueThis article was amended on 18 April 2025 to show a view of Hest Bank, replacing an earlier image of the more central beach area at Morecambe.View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysReaders' travel tipsFood and drinkTop 10sDay tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This glam new Ukrainian spot serves big portions of filling carbsGrace DentFri 18 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Apr 2025 07.34 EDTShareTatar Bunar, a new Ukrainian restaurant in Shoreditch, east London, is styled as quaintly and charmingly rustic: wooden-fronted, with sage curtains, glass-panelled doors and stacks of higgledy-piggledy plates artfully arranged on shelves. Then there’s the food: sprats, potato latkes,varenyky, borscht and an abundance of wild mushrooms, and all of it influenced by chef Alex Cooper’s home town of Tatarbunary in southern Ukraine.It’s no mean feat to take on a corner of Curtain Road just yards from the shrieking neon ballpit that is theBallie Ballersoncocktail bar and aSimmonds“fun pub”, and somehow create Tatar Bunar’s nigh-rural ambience, or the odd sense that it’s been here since for ever. But then, Tatar Bunar is Ukrainian, so in recent years Cooper and his co-owner, Anna Andriienko, have faced down far bigger problems than tricky interior design.View image in fullscreenThere is nothing ‘measly’ about Tatar Bunar’s ‘big, plump’ mushroomvarenyk.Their new restaurant, the owners say, is an attempt to open up Ukrainian cuisine to a British audience. During the build and launch, Cooper remained in his homeland, where he uses the pair’s original restaurant as a food distribution point, while Andriienko was based in London. The result – featuring Ukrainian ceramics and materials from the Carpathian region in the country’s southwest, as well as putting the cooking in the very capable hands of Kate Tkachuk – certainly feels like a mini satellite version of their successful mothership,Tatar Bunar inOdesa.What Tatar Bunar certainly doesnotfeel like, however, is “a humble little restaurant run by proud people from a war-blighted country to keep their hope alive, etc”, or any other such patronising nonsense. This is a confident, expertly staged, rather sexy dining spot with flattering, soft peachy lighting, Bessarabian wagyu on the grill andBlack Seayafe nagarby the glass. In fact, it’s all rather glam: servers are clad in floor-length, rust-coloured gowns and the bill arrives with a postcard of a Ukrainian shepherd at twilight.View image in fullscreen‘It’s all rather glam’: Tatar Bunar’s borscht course.The crowd, when I visited, were in the main tall, sharp cheek-boned, model-esque types speaking Slavic languages, and within minutes of entering I muttered to myself: “This is going to be a terribly hard place to get into within a fortnight.” For a start, at a time when the London restaurant scene is awash with pricey European small plates that send you home hungry and angry, Tatar Bunar dishes up whopping great portions of sating carbs, cream and potatoes. Take the potato latkes with creamy wild mushrooms, which for £12 is a satisfying bowl of earthy joy. Or the £13 sprats “starter”, featuring roughly 10 fish, all boned, flattened, salted and served with a bowl of buttered boiled potatoes and a mound of pickled red onion. Or the truly delicious Bunar tartare: a semi-cooked lamb/beef tartare, if such a contradiction even exists, with a hunk of grilled bread. Similarly, there is nothing slinky or measly about thevarenyky, or dumplings, offering. A varenyk, I have learned, is akin to a Polish pierogi that, aesthetically, verges on a Jamaican patty. They are big, plump and here stuffed with minced meat or cabbage, or more mushroom and peppery potato.View image in fullscreenTatar Bunar’s generous starter portion of sprats comes with separate bowls of pickled red onion and buttery boiled potatoes.By the time we had finished those “small” plates and were moving on to mains, we were already well aware that we had chronically over-ordered. But who could blame us? I’ve spent 12 months being sold four small artichokes alone on a plate for £22. In modern London, no one actually expects to befedany more; these days, it’s more about the experience. Then along comes Tatar Bunar and its luscious lamb chops with show-stopping spicy pickled tomatoes. Oh, those tomatoes … so sweet, so powerful. And chunks of grilled cod with soft flakes, crisp skin and a generous pile of buttered samphire. No faff, no fuss, no lecture with each course, no long-winded explanation as to the cooking techniques involved, and no hovering or unwelcome input at all. Just dinner, and lots of it.Regardless of the lack of tableside lectures, I picked up a lot about Ukrainian cookery during the course of our meal, or at least Cooper and Tkachuk’s interpretation of it. Does the crisp-topped, generous, two-person portion of creme brulee strictly need to have an unexpected layer of pleasingly stodgy dumplings in the base of the dish? Well, yes, I rather think it does. And the crepes – short, fatly stuffed and folded, one filled with cheese, one with berries and a third with rich, black, fragrant poppy seed sauce – came in a bowl of glorious custard. Tatar Bunar is indulgent, delicious and a breath of fresh air. And it’s already most definitely a highlight of 2025.Tatar Bunar152 Curtain Road, London EC2, 07771 013190 Open dinner only, Tues-Sun, 6-10.30pm (10pm Sun).

You know, when you buy something you think is a good deal, because you’re comparing it with something that’s infinitely more expensive, so it just feels as if you’re saving money. Buying Baylis & Harding hand soap because Aesop is £33. Renting a small room in London for more than £1,000 a month because at least you’re not paying £2,000 for a place to yourself. A few months ago, people tried to coin this school of thought as “girl math”’, but we are all equally guilty of this specific kind of economic reasoning.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

I’m not going to get it, of course, but I can certainly spend what little money I have on something that’s close enough.Enter aligoté. It’s the second most-planted white grape variety in Burgundy, and a cross between pinot noir and gouais blanc. Historically, aligoté has been less valued than chardonnay, the iconic white burgundy, so it’s been less widely planted or rooted out altogether to make way for the latter. It was popular on the Côte d’Or pre-phylloxera, but when new vines were grafted on to American rootstocks afterwards, aligoté became even less of a priority. And low demand meant growers gave it even less attention, resulting in unripe, thin wines that until recently tarnished its good name. Aligoté is also casually accepted as the original second ingredient in a kir, alongside creme de cassis, which were mixed together by the mayor of Dijon, Félix Kir, after the second world war to create a drink that showcased the region’s produce.If aligoté has always played second fiddle to something, it’s now slowly edging nearer the spotlight (with me behind it, shoving furiously), not least because it comes from a similar climate and similar soil to Burgundian chardonnay but, instead of costing in the £100s, it tends to rest around the £15 mark. Quite often, a producer’s aligoté is grown only a stone’s throw from their esteemed chardonnay plots, so if you’ve been priced out of your favourite white burgundy, this might well be the place to look. After all, it’s all about relative value.There’s even a group,Les Aligoteurs, of some 75 winegrowers, mostly from Burgundy, that is dedicated to proving the ambition and promise of this underdog grape. And, last year, in celebration of its 150th birthday,the Wine Societyimagined the future of wine by developing 10 cuvées with its winemakers, and an aligoté made the grade, not least because it’s a late-ripening variety, so is expected to thrive in a constantly warming environment. There’s more than one good reason this grape may well stick around.Four aligotés to take your fancyDomaine desCôteaux du Val Lamartinien Bourgogne Aligoté 2022£11.55 Vinatis, 12.5%.

But, in fact, it’s probably one of the easiest desserts you can make, and there are so many ways to infuse it with different flavours. Recently, I’ve been ditching individual moulds and serving it in large, sharing-style dishes, which means you can make it with a softer, silkier consistency, because it doesn’t need to hold its shape. Instead, you can just scoop and serve.Earl grey and lemon panna cotta with almond tuilesPrep5 minCook45 minChill2 hr+Serves6-82½ gelatine sheets200ml milk500ml double cream100g caster sugar3 earl grey tea bagsFor the tuiles35g unsalted butter35gicingsugar40g egg whites45g plain flour70g flaked almondsFor the lemon syrup1 large lemon3 tbsp caster sugarPut the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and leave it to sit for five minutes, until softened.Meanwhile, put the milk, cream, sugar and tea bags in a saucepan and heat gently, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is hot to the touch. Leave the tea bags to steep for five minutes, then lift out and discard.Squeeze the excess water from the soaked gelatine, add the softened sheets to the milk pan and stir until they’ve completely dissolved. Pour the lot into a 20cm wide serving dish, then chill in the fridge for two to three hours, or until set.For the tuiles, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Beat the butter and sugar in a bowl until smooth, then whisk in the egg whites. Beat in the flour to make a smooth, thick paste. Stir in most of the almonds, then spread out the batter as thinly as you can on the lined tray. Sprinkle the remaining almonds on top, then bake for 15-18 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove and leave to cool completely, then break into rough shards.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.To make the syrup, use a vegetable peeler to shave the zest of the lemon into wide strips. Slice each strip into smaller, thinner pieces, then put them in a small saucepan and add the lemon juice, sugar and 80ml water. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for three to five minutes, until the peel is softened and syrupy. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely.To serve, spoon the syrup over the panna cotta and serve with the tuiles alongside.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodTeaBakingBiscuitsItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
