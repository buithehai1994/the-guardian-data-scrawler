It may be set in a galaxy far far away, but it is in an entirely different universe to any other Star Wars production. No lightsabers; no magic space wizards; barely a stormtrooper in sight – until the grim and horrifying mid-season climax. Who knew committee meetings and wedding parties could be so gripping? It’s as though George Lucas placed the keys to his kingdom in the hands of John le Carré instead of Disney. Remember that fizz of excitement you got as an eight-year-old heading in to see A New Hope? Andor makes this 55-year-old feel the same way.Russell Jones, CheshireMobLandView image in fullscreenSharp and succinct … Helen Mirren as Maeve Harrigan and Pierce Brosnan as Conrad Harrigan in MobLand.Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/Paramount+(Paramount+) I loveMobLand. It’s Tom Hardy doing what Tom Hardy does best: playing the quiet and measured yet still highly intimidating and pretty scary fixer for an Irish mob family. The pacing is sharp and succinct without being breakneck; very on-brand Guy Ritchie, in the best way.Clare Kleinedler, Sierra Madre, CaliforniaCommon Side EffectsView image in fullscreenSuperb … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Channel 4) The animated series Common Side Effects is not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life. Why? The writing. The plot is superb: opposite to The Last of Us, it’s about the discovery of a fungus that appears to heal all illnesses – but everything else about the show is grounded in the real world. The characters are nuanced and compelling. To sum up its virtues in a single sentence, it respects its audience. The fact that the show even managed to get made at all in today’s political environment boggles the mind.Jude Kirkham, Williams Lake, British Columbia, CanadaSeveranceView image in fullscreenChilling … Severance finale.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV+) I’m always years behind everyone else these days and I only foundSeveranceafter I’d run out of Slow Horses episodes. Severance offers a chilling theme of corporate control taken to the max, and features some brilliantly understated performances. There are echoes of The Matrix, of course, and – unexpectedly – Franz Kafka, but its originality shines through. A very good series indeed!Malcolm Armstrong, GatesheadThe best TV of 2025 in the UK so farRead moreDept. Q(Netflix)Dept. Qis an English language adaptation of the first in a series of Danish crime novels by Jussi Adler-Olsen with labyrinthine plots and characters straight out of noir central casting. This adaptation moves the setting to Scotland, but loses none of the bleakness and despair with a small group of investigators trying to solve cold cases. Bring on season two!Niall, DublinThe Horne Section TV ShowView image in fullscreenBonkers … The Horne Section TV Show.Photograph: Channel 4 / Jack Barnes(Channel 4)It’s bonkers. It’s weird.It’s a really mind-boggling mirror that Alex Horne has held up to himself and what may, or may not be, his own insecurities. Why does he write himself to be this pathetic? Why does his real life best friend play both himself and an evil hypnotherapist-cum-estate agent who can’t stand to look at him? How are a bunch of middle aged men mucking around with instruments in a shed, taking dad jokes to the next level, this charming? It makes no sense on any of the many levels it operates on.Amanda Jeffrey, BirminghamThe Narrow Road to the Deep North(Prime Video)The Narrow Road to the Deep Northis a brilliant adaptation of a brilliant Booker prize winning novel by Richard Flanagan.

I did not know much about Argentinian cultural works, outside Ariel Ramírez’s composition Misa Criolla (part of which is used here with electrifying effect) and this series made me want to know more about the country, its people and their struggles in the last century. They say that science fiction is an examination of the time it is written and this story, originally published in the 1950s, has been brought into the 21st century in a thought-provoking way.Viv Blagden, SomersetThe Wheel of TimeView image in fullscreenCriminally underwatched … Sophie Okonedo in The Wheel of Time.Photograph: Courtesy of Prime(Prime Video) Criminally unwatched by the masses, finally, this show has come of age, and the flashback episode (Rand’s journey through Rhuidean) is hands down one of the best fantasy episodes ever. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled last month, just as it was finding its footing. At least we will always have the Rhuidean episode to comfort ourselves with.Stephen, DublinShrinking(Apple TV+)Shrinkingfeatures an incredible ensemble cast and a stellar performance by Harrison Ford who plays a grieving therapist who decides to tell his clients what he really thinks.

The phone rang in the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem. Benjamin Netanyahu stretched out an arm to take the call.“Yes.”“Hi Bibi, it’s Ali.”“Ali who?”“Ayatollah Ali Khamenei … I just wondered whether you had heard the latest –Keir Starmerhas made an intervention.”“Not THE Keir Starmer?”“The very same. The prime minister of the United Kingdom. He has called on both of us to de-escalate hostilities. To look for a diplomatic solution. Not just that, but the British foreign secretary will be making a statement to the British parliament later on today to demand restraint. To bring the Middle East back from the edge.”“Wow,” said Bibi. “That rather changes everything. When Keir speaks the world listens.”Or maybe that’s not quite the way international diplomacy works in the Middle-East. Right now, it doesn’t appear that Israel or Iran are listening to anyone. Not even the US. Then again, it’s quite hard to follow what Donald Trump has to say about the conflict as he regularly contradicts himself.Yet Starmer continues to call for de-escalation. Mainly to make himself feel better. We all know that the UK has no real influence, but Keir feels he has to say something and he can’t very well say he’s not that bothered. A prime minister has to be prime ministerial. A united front and all that.Besides, if Israel and Iran do take a step back, he can always claim that his intervention was the one that made the difference. And maybe it might have been.Still. One person to whom Netanyahu and Khamenei most definitely won’t be listening is Emma Reynolds, the economic secretary to the Treasury, who was sent out by the government on the morning media round.Which is just as well for Emma and the UK because, fair to say, she took the word useless to dizzying new heights during her interview with Nick Ferrari onLBC. On this performance, you wouldn’t have trusted her to locate Israel or Iran on a map.Emma’s solution to the conflict was to hope for the best. Which was the same approach she took to her own performance. Only it didn’t pay off. Ferrari appeared to confuse her by asking about the thing – strengthening 3,000 bridges – that she had been sent out to talk about. I guess she hadn’t seen that one coming. She began by talking about the Dartmouth Tunnel. Thereby locating the Thames somewhere on the south Devon coast.Suspecting he might be dealing with a halfwit, Ferrari checked if she knew where the new crossing near Dartford might be. Emma hadn’t a clue. Nick filled her in: Gravesend and Tilbury.OK, he said. Do you know how much this was going to cost? Still no clue. By now Emma was getting panicky – £3bn? Er, no, said Ferrari. It’s £10bn. It said so in her own department’s press release, which she hadn’t read. Let’s move on to Hammersmith Bridge. Let’s not, sobbed Emma. She didn’t know anything about that bridge either. Two down, 2,998 to go.Over in the Commons, Yvette Cooper was giving a statement on the publication of Louise Casey’s report into grooming gangs. No one came out of it well. Not the Tories, not Labour, not the police, not the local authorities. The girls had been let down by everyone.The home secretary at least tried to take some responsibility. Some. She laid out a clear trail of failure and neglect over the past 15 years. Abusers operating in plain sight. Seemingly given a free pass.She made an apology on behalf of the British state to all the victims. What she couldn’t bring herself to do was to admit the government could have established a national statutory inquiry six months ago. Yet again, a minister failing to say sorry for something she could have done better. Instead she tried to claim that the new inquiry was just a seamless continuation of the last one.Normally it would have been Chris Philp to reply for the opposition. Instead we gotKemi Badenoch. Whether the Philpster would have been any better is open to question, but he couldn’t have been any worse. Kemi’s response was one of the most shabby and ill-judged I can remember.This was all about her, not the victims. Turning a national scandal into party politics. Claiming that everything had been just fine under the 14 years of the Tories and that the greatest injustice had been Labour’s failure to implement an inquiry sooner. Failing to acknowledge that she had been in a position to act as minister for children. Failing to pay attention to Casey’s comments that successive governments had failed to keep children safe for 15 years.Failure even to say sorry on behalf of her party to the victims. She couldn’t even manage that. A grim afternoon in Westminster had just got a shade grimmer.Explore more on these topicsUK newsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochLBCcommentShareReuse this content"

Illustrated by Rebecca Cobb, 2012’s The Paper Dolls has an irresistible sense of childlike wonder, following a string of cut-out dolls as they explore a house while trying to avoid scissors.Key lineThey were Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie and Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PR14Tabby McTatThe festive BBC adaptations of Donaldson’s work are so beloved that it’s easy to overlook how some stories work much better as films than others. Tabby McTat – in which a cat becomes separated from his busker friend – is one of the best. There’s a real sense of melancholy to some of the sequences, before the happy ending – exactly what you want at Christmas.Key lineThe sun went down and the sky grew black. The stars came out, but he didn’t come back.View image in fullscreen13TiddlerTiddler is a small fish with a big imagination, always coming up with wild excuses for his behaviour. But is there any merit to them? This is Donaldson and Scheffler in pure entertainment mode, and – at least anecdotally – one of the stories that children respond best to.Key line“Sorry I’m late, Miss. I set off really early but on the way to school I was captured by a squid.”View image in fullscreen12The Smeds and the SmoosDonaldson has written hundreds of books in her career, but none felt quite as timely as 2019’s The Smeds and the Smoos. A Romeo and Juliet story about two aliens whose families hate each other, it’s hard to see this as anything other than Donaldson’s Brexit book. Scheffler’s dedication – “To all the children of Europe” – makes the link even more explicit.Typical line“Never, never marry a Smed. My dearest child, are you off your head?”View image in fullscreen11Chocolate Mousse for Greedy GooseNick Sharratt provides the illustrations for this sweetly simple book for very young readers. Not a great deal happens here – some animals have a dinner party and none of them behaves very well – but the whole thing is perfectly executed.Key line“Don’t just grab it,” says angryRabbit. “I’ll lickthe bowl,” saysfurry Mole.View image in fullscreen10Room on the BroomDonaldson is at her best when she leans into gothic fairytale darkness. Room on the Broom, where a kind witch and her animal hitchhikers fend off a dragon, is a perfect example of this. Completists might like to know that the book has also been adapted into a Chessington World of Adventures attraction that is about 5% too scary for its intended audience.Key line“I am a dragon, as mean as can be,and I’m planning to have WITCH AND CHIPS for my tea!”View image in fullscreen9Princess Mirror-BelleAlthough she’s best known for her picture books, Donaldson has also written a number of early years stories, designed to be the first thing that children read alone. Of these, Princess Mirror-Belle – about a girl’s reflection that comes to life and causes havoc – is the most irresistible. Perfect for kids who are just about ready to finally outgrow The Gruffalo.Key lineBy this stage they had reached the escalator. Mirror-Belle hopped on to it. “This is fun,” she said. “Does it go down to the dungeons?” “No,” said Ellen, riding down beside her. “It goes down to the food department.”View image in fullscreen8Jonty Gentoo: The Adventures of a PenguinDonaldson and Scheffler’s most recent book may cover old ground (like Stick Man, it’s a journey story, only this time about a penguin who escapes from the zoo), but it’s told with flair and has a pristine rhyming scheme. Plus, who doesn’t like penguins?Key lineHis aunts said,“Grow up!”,“Eat your fish!” and“Talk sense!”, but Jonty had noticed a gap in the fence.View image in fullscreen7The Smartest Giant in TownA bit of an outlier for a Donaldson/Scheffler book, in that it only intermittently rhymes. Nevertheless, the message of the story – that it’s better to be kind than nicely dressed – is as perfectly pitched as anything Donaldson has ever written.Key line“Cheer up!” said George, and he took off one of his shiny shoes.“It was giving me blisters anyway.”View image in fullscreen6A Squash and a SqueezeDonaldson’s first book was initially a lilting reggae song, performed by Floella Benjamin and Derek Griffiths on the children’s TV showPlay Schoolin the 1970s. But the story – about a woman who learns to live within her means after filling her house with farm animals – works far better as a book, especially when paired with Scheffler’s beautifully manic illustrations.Key lineThe little old lady cried “Stop, I implore! It was titchy for three and it’s teeny for four.”View image in fullscreen5What the Ladybird HeardLydia Monks provides vivid illustrations to this story, about a ladybird who uses her size and silence to thwart a farmyard robbery. Structurally, What the Ladybird Heard is a gem, first carefully laying out the robbers’ plan (twice, with a blueprint) only to hilariously subvert it at the climax.Key lineThe duck on the pond said“MOO MOO MOO!”“Two more steps to go!” said Hugh.View image in fullscreen4The Highway RatDonaldson was a songwriter before she became an author, and this is the secret to her success – you don’t need to read many of her books to see that they often have choruses. The chorus of The Highway Rat (a story about a greedy rat who learns the error of his ways) is the best of the lot. It’s a tricky metre for parents to enter into blind, but it absolutely rewards the effort.Key line“I am theRat of the highway – the highway – the highway – Yes, I am theRat of the highway, and I fancy a duck for tea!”View image in fullscreen3The Snail and the WhaleOne of her very best. This is in part down to Donaldson’s Lear-style rhyme scheme, but mainly because it is completely impossible to separate the text from the images. The story constantly draws the reader’s attention to the illustrations (“This is a rock”, “This is the sea”, “This is the teacher”) and, given the extremes of scale that Scheffler has to work with, it ranks as some of his best work. Quite frankly, the whole thing reads like a love letter between them.Key lineThese are the waves that arched and crashed, that foamed and frolicked and sprayed and splashed.View image in fullscreen2The GruffaloAn all-time classic. Donaldson’s third book was based on the Chinese folktale The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger, and revolves around a blazingly clever structure. First, a mouse fends off advances from three hungry animals by describing an invented terrifying monster to them. Then, when he realises that the monster is real, he retraces his steps and outwits everyone in the process. But you knew that, of course, because you’ve read it a million times.Key line“Oh help! Oh no! It’s a Gruffalo!”View image in fullscreen1Stick ManOstensibly a sequel to The Gruffalo’s Child (which features a toy stick man), this is just about as epic as picture books get. A stick loses his family, and has to make an Odyssean journey home. There are real stakes here; the moment when Stick Man awaits what seems like certain death would be impressive in any story, but the fact that this is a book for toddlers makes it doubly so.Key lineStick Lady’s lonely. The children are sad. It won’t feel like Christmas without their Stick Dad.To explore any of the books featured, visitguardianbookshop.com.

What took it so long?Zoe WilliamsFrom politics to business, the determination to exclude women is purely emotional – a fact that remains as unspoken as it is obviousMon 16 Jun 2025 11.35 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareMI6 has never had a female head in its 116-year history – until now. How fitting that the first woman should be calledBlaise Metreweli. That forename has it all: derring-do (courtesy ofModesty Blaise), onomatopoeia, modernity.Metreweli will take over in the autumn as C, the real-life version of M from James Bond. She currently runs Q branch, MI6’s technology division, which apparently is named after the Bond quartermaster. No fictional Q has ever been female, but in real life at least two women, including Metreweli, are thought to have held the role. M can be male or female, except now they succeed or fail by how much they resemble Judi Dench, so all of them, including the incumbent, Ralph Fiennes, are de facto female.In other words, while there is a strong cultural presumption that the computers bro is indeed a bro, there is no ambient fictional expectation that the head of the Secret Intelligence Service should be male. If it has taken the agency more than a century to tick this particular diversity box, it has only itself to blame.If you squint at it, it could be precisely because of Ian Fleming, via his cinematic legacy, that the real MI6 has been so slow. M is a hard-to-please-parent archetype – Bond seeks M’s approval, yet at some critical juncture he always has to disobey M in order to self-actualise, creating a heady cocktail of vexation and admiration that M, being ultimately a smart and patriotic character, manages to choke down in the interests of her majesty (well, his majesty now, but we don’t have time for whether or not heads of state are better off male or female).The screen far prefers it when this stern but loving authority figure is a woman – Dench was recently joined by Kristin Scott Thomas, the head of MI5 in Slow Horses, two bookends representing the full range of everyone by whom a spy would want to be told off. In real life, though, it seems an executive decision was made and never revisited until this year:secret agents can’t work for their proxy mum; they can accept censure only from their pretend dad.Blaise Metreweli named as first woman to lead UK intelligence service MI6Read moreIf you look at the professions from which women are typically excluded at the highest levels, the grounds for exclusion are never the same twice – it’s almost as if there is no fixed conception of femininity. Tech is notably male-dominated, on the assumption that women aren’t going to get it because it’s too hard, yet will ruin things by being too serious-minded. Yes, it’s hard to square, but it’s helpfully distilled inMountainhead, Jesse Armstrong’s latest satire, which features a retreat that abides by the rule “no meals, no deals, no heels”. Nutrition, commerce and gender diversity would kill the vibe.In politics, wherever it’s impossible for a woman to be elected – in the US, it’s the top job; in the UK, it’s the Labour party – it’s usually because she is too “schoolmarmish”. This is always delivered as a personal critique of an individual woman, as if Hillary Clinton or Harriet Harman had been born under an unlucky star, too close to the blackboard or the severe hairline. The real objection – the MI6-adjacent “I love women and some of my best friends are women, I just don’t like it when they have authority over me” – must remain as unspoken as it is obvious.In boardrooms, women are considered an impediment for the opposite traits: not enough authority, too much amiability, not enough killer instinct, too much human sympathy.Research has shownrepeatedly that gender diversity on boards is linked to higher profits, so the determination to exclude women is purely emotional, which is a cute irony, given that it’s supposed to be women who mess everything up by being too emotional.I would have way less of a problem with gender-exclusionary workplaces if they would pick a lane and establish exactly what the issue is, between women being too serious and not serious enough, too authoritative and too flaky. Metreweli doubtless rose to the top by ignoring such silliness and powering through; good luck to her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The president of the United States was posing for the world’s media against a backdrop of five different models of Tesla, peddling the electric vehicles with the alacrity of a salesman on commission.“I love the product, it’s beautiful,”Donald Trumpsaid as he sank into the driver’s seat of a scarlet Model Y. With the Tesla CEO,Elon Musk, beside him, he went on to enlighten the American people that some Tesla models retail for as little as $299 a month, “which is pretty low”.That same day, within hours of the White House’s makeover into aTeslashowroom, theNew York Timesrevealed that Musk had decided to invest $100m in political groups working for Trump. The massive injection of capital would enhance the nearly $300m Musk had already spent getting Trump elected.A week after the commercial on the South Lawn, on 19 March, Trump’s commerce secretary, the billionaire investment banker Howard Lutnick, went onFox Newsand exhorted viewers to “buy Tesla”. “Who wouldn’t invest in Elon Musk’s stock?” he gushed. “He is probably the best person to bet on I’ve ever met.”At the time Lutnick made those remarks, he had yet to divest himself from Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm he had led for 35 years. He was talking up stock in which he still had a vested interest – Cantor held $300m in Tesla shares, a stake that has since soared to$555m. And the commerce secretary was also bigging up his friend Musk, whose SpaceX and Starlink businesses are regulated by the commerce department that Lutnick now controlled.Eight days in March, three friendly billionaires, one of them the world’s most powerful person, another the world’s richest person. Doing what friends do: scratching each other’s backs. Even though Musk later fell out with Trump – in a shocking social media spat that roiledUS politics– the imagery remains powerful and highly symbolic of Trump’s second term in the White House.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk talk near a Tesla Cybertruck outside the White House on 11 March 2025.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesBetween them they committed in those eight days acts that, had they occurred during any previous presidency – including Trump’s own first administration – would have provoked howls of protest concerning quid pro quo. Yet those eight days represent just a tiny slice of the graft and possible misconduct that is unfolding.The gift by the Qatari government of a $400m luxury jetliner to be repurposed as Air Force One has become the paradigm of the blitz of ethical dilemmas unleashed by Trump. The Pentagon last monthaccepted possessionof the plane, which will be transferred to Trump’s presidential library once he leaves office.That Trump doggedly accepted the Qatari “palace in the sky” despite widespread condemnation speaks volumes about how indomitable he feels at this moment. He has shrugged aside the rebukes even of devoted Trump supporters, including the rightwing commentatorBen Shapiro, who bridled at the transfer’s grubby appearance, calling it “skeezy stuff”.It also shows Trump’s disdain for the US constitution, given the emoluments clause’s clear prohibition. Presidents are not allowed to accept high-value gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent.Yet the luxury jumbo jet is also just the thinnest edge of a very fat wedge. There has been so much more that has flown, if not under the radar, then partially obscured from sight amid the ethical blizzard of corruption and influence.There have been multimillion-dollar TV packages, real estate deals in Arab petrostates, dinners with the president going for $5m a pop, plum job offers for contributors to Trump’s inaugural fund, cryptocurrency ventures attracting lucre from secret foreign investors, “drill, baby, drill” enticements for oil and energy donations – the list goes on, and on … and on.View image in fullscreenA Qatari Boeing 747 sits on the tarmac of the Palm Beach international airport after Donald Trump toured the aircraft on 15 February 2025.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump and his team of billionaires have led the US on a dizzying journey into the moral twilight that has left public sector watchdogs struggling to keep up. Which is precisely the intention, said Kathleen Clark, a government ethics lawyer and law professor at Washington University in Saint Louis.“They have mastered the technique of flooding the zone – doing so much so fast that they are overwhelming the ability of ethics groups and institutions to respond.”Chris Murphy, the Democratic US senator from Connecticut, has delivered two long speeches on the floor of his chamber in which he has itemised Trump and Co’s most controversial transactions. The record already stretches to scores of entries, chronicling what Murphy calls Trump’s “efforts to steal from the American people to enrich himself and his friends”.In an interview with the Guardian, the senator said that Trump’s was a “pay-for-play administration. That’s the underlying theme. You payDonald Trumpmoney, he does favors for you. That’s old-fashioned corruption.”Clark’s analysis is even more pointed. “People talk about ‘guardrails’ and ‘norms’ and ‘conflict of interest’, which is all very relevant,” she said. “But this is theft and destruction. This is the looting of America.”Trump signaled that he would be a president like no other at the start of his first term, when he became the only occupant of the Oval Office in modern times to refuse to divest his assets by putting them into a blind trust. Though presidents are not bound by conflict of interest laws applying to other elected officials, the norm has been for incumbents to set themselves high standards, the archetype being Jimmy Carter’s sale of his peanut farm.Trump, by contrast, put his assets in a trust that remained under the control of his family, with him as its sole beneficiary. He incurred numerous accusations of first-term conflicts of interest, as foreign officials from20 countriesdescended on his hotels, whileSecret Service agentsin Trump’s security detail were made to pay premium rates, pouring at least $10m into his bank account.Such unprecedented disregard for time-honored ethical boundaries was shocking at the time. Now it looks merely quaint.“In the firstTrump administrationthere were ethical lapses,” said Danielle Caputo, senior legal counsel for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center watchdog organization. “With this new administration, there’s not just a disregard for ethics rules, there’s contempt.”The conversion of political power into cash began even before Trump re-entered the White House. Weeks before the inauguration, Melania Trump sealed a $40m deal withJeff Bezosfor an Amazon Prime “behind-the-scenes” documentary on her life.Trump banked millions of dollars of his own by leveraging his status as president-electto browbeattech companies. He settled disputes over the freezing of his then Twitter and Facebook accounts in the wake of the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, prising $10m out of his friend Musk, and $25m from Meta.View image in fullscreenMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend Trump’s inauguration on 20 January 2025.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APTrump used the months leading up to November’s election to test-run what, as Murphy noted, has become a theme of his second presidency – pay-to-play. He invited oil executives to Mar-a-Lago and, as theWashington Postrevealed, offered them a “deal” in which they would donate $1bn to his campaign and in return he would tear up profit-limiting environmental regulations once he was back in the White House.He kept his promise: on day one of his new administrationhe dischargeda barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions.Donors to his record-breaking $239m inaugural fund have also found Trump to be a grateful benefactor. Warren Stephens, an investment banker who gave $4m, was rewarded with the role of US ambassador to the UK; Jared Issacman, a billionaire pilot and close associate of Musk’s, gave $2m to the fund and was tapped to lead Nasa (he was abruptly yanked from the appointment last month after he wasreportedly discoveredto have been been donating to Democrats).It’s over the line, unlawful, corrupt and unethical. It is un-AmericanNorman Eisen of the Brookings InstitutionThe pattern has continued into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Three months into the administration, Trump’s eldest son, Don Jr, launched an elite private members’ club namedExecutive Branchwhich commands a sign-in fee of a cool $500,000.Its attraction? Access to cabinet members and top Trump advisers.Not to be outdone by his own son, Trump himself has followed the same playbook at his Mar-a-Lago resort. In March, he began inviting business leaders to dine with him in group settings at$1m a seat.Prefer something more intimate? No problem. One-on-one meetings are also available,yours for $5m.For a seasoned observer such as Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution, the sheer mass of problematic transactions puts the administration beyond the pale. “It’s over the line, unlawful, corrupt and unethical. It is un-American.”Eisen has experience dealing with knotty ethical issues. He was special counsel for ethics during Barack Obama’s first year in the White House.Obama notes in his autobiography, A Promised Land, that Eisen earned himself the title of Dr No, so strict was his approach to conflicts of interest. He would tell White House officials hoping to attend outside events that “if it sounds fun, you can’t go”.View image in fullscreenNorman Eisen testifies during a House judiciary committee hearing in Washington DC on 13 June 2024.Photograph: Tierney L Cross/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEisen told the Guardian that he prevented Obama from refinancing his family home in Chicago. “He was regulating the banking industry at the time, in the midst of the Great Recession.”The contrast between such almost pedantic strictures and the free-for-all in today’s White House astonishes and dismays Eisen. “If my somewhat tongue in cheek motto for Obama was ‘If it’s fun, you can’t do it,’ then the motto of the Trump White House seems to be ‘If you can make a buck, grab it.’”Exhibit one of such conduct, Eisen suggests, is the Trump family’s dive into the world of crypto. Shortly before the inauguration, they launched personal lines of meme coins, $Trump and $Melania.Then they issued a new cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar, known as a stablecoin. Taken together, Eisen believes that the two crypto ventures from the family of a sitting president amount to “one of the worst and most shocking conflicts of interest in our nation’s history”.Trump bragged on the campaign trail that he would turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet”. He was more circumspect in front of his faithful followers about the big plans his sons were simultaneously developing to cash in on the currency.Since his election victory, Trump has used his presidential status and executive power to boost not only the general standing of crypto but also his personal stake within it. One of his earlyexecutive orderscreated a “strategic bitcoin reserve” designed to bolster the industry.At the same time, he eviscerated basic regulatory controls, halted federal crypto-related lawsuits and disbanded a taskforce trained to hunt down crypto criminals. “We have a president whose net worth now includes very substantial investments in cryptocurrency who at the same time is loosening regulations on the crypto industry,” Eisen said.We’ve been pretty successful in this country rooting out corruption, or at least pushing it into the shadows. Now it happens out in the openDemocratic senator Chris MurphyThe unrivalled magnetism of the US presidency helped Trump to blast his nascent meme coin, a currency almost entirely reliant on hype, into the stratosphere. It rocketed from $6.50 on inauguration day to a peak of $73.Then, when it predictably plummeted back down to below $10, he used his presidential allure brazenly once again to boost the coin. This time he announced a“private intimate dinner”for the top 220 $Trump investors, followed by an exclusive White House tour for the top 25.The ensuing scramble for a seat at the presidential dining table reportedly earned the Trump family $148m.The $Trump meme coin is an ethics regulator’s waking nightmare. There is little transparency around who is channelling money into it, and even less around the potentially nefarious motives of investors.The same might be said about the Trumps’ other big crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, which was launched last September by Trump’s sons. The president himselfis listedby the company as its “chief crypto advocate”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet there is nothing to prevent outside interests with connections to foreign governments engaging with World Liberty and its new product, the USD1 stablecoin.One of its biggest backers is the Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun (best known for paying $6.2m at a New York art sale for a banana taped to a wall,then eating it). Before the inauguration, Sun pumped $75m into World Liberty. A few weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused aninvestigationinto him for alleged securities fraud.View image in fullscreenJustin Sun eats the $6.2m banana in Hong Kong on 29 November 2024.Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty ImagesUSD1 is currently valued at $2.3bn, the lion’s share of which comes from a $2bn transaction by MGX, a firm which happens to be chaired by the intelligence chief of theUnited Arab Emirates. That a company with ties to the government of an Arab petrostate should be able to make such a giant investment in a crypto venture generating profit for the sitting US president and his family goes against the grain of decades of robust accountability work countering conflicts of interest.“We’ve been pretty successful in this country rooting out corruption, or at least pushing it into the shadows,” Murphy, the US senator, told the Guardian. “Now it happens out in the open.”And it doesn’t stop there. Over the past few months Trump’s second son, Eric, has been frenetically traveling the globe in search of real estate deals, throwing to the winds the pledge Trump made in his first administration to eschew any foreign business transactions.In his second administration, Trump has made no such promise. All he has conceded this time, ina documentreleased by his lawyers in January, is that the Trump Organization will avoid cutting business deals with foreign governments.Even that boundary has been pushed close to breaking point. Eric Trump sealed his first deal since Trump re-entered the White House in April.It involves the construction of the Trump International Golf Club & Villas outside the Qatari capital, Doha, as part of a $5bn luxury beachside resort. The company managing the development, Qatari Diar, is owned by the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari government.Two weeks after the Trump Organization announced the deal, the president himself arrived in Doha as part of his three-country tour of the Middle East. He declared the trip a huge success, having drummed up trillions of dollars of business and investments for the US.The Guardian invited the White House to comment on complaints that the president has blurred his public duties with his family’s personal profit-making activities to a degree never before seen in the US. A White House spokesperson replied with a statement which they asked us to print in its entirety, so here goes:“There are no conflicts of interest. President Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children. It is shameful that the Guardian is ignoring the GOOD deals President Trump has secured for the American people, not for himself, to push a false narrative. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public – which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”The argument that there is no conflict of interest because Trump’s business is handled by his children, specifically his sons – Don Jr leading on crypto and his social media empire, Eric on real estate – is an interesting one. Sons seem to be de rigueur, to the extent that members of Trump’s inner circle who lack them might feel the need to borrow one.View image in fullscreenEric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr attend the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on 28 May.Photograph: John Locher/APTake other key figures in Trump’s cabinet, which is packed with so many banking and energy billionaires that it ranks as therichest presidential cabinetin modern history. Lutnick, the commerce secretary, who has a personal fortune of about $2.2bn, has been involved in various accusations of conflict of interest since he encouraged Fox News viewers to “buy Tesla”.At the start of this year Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm Lutnick led for almost four decades, increased its investment in Strategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world. Cantor’s stake rose by several hundred million dollars to $1.3bn, research by the watchdogAccountable.UShas found.At the same time, Lutnick was actively helping Trump create his strategic bitcoin reserve, a move that greatly strengthened the cryptocurrency.Last month, Lutnick divested himself of his Cantor stake, but he did so by transferring his ownership to his two sons. Cantor isnow controlledby Brandon Lutnick, 27, and Kyle Lutnick, 28.Or take Robert F Kennedy Jr, the vaccine-skeptic health secretary. Under intense pressure from Democratic senators, he agreed to divest his 10% stake in any payout from an ongoing lawsuit in which he is engaged against Merck over its HPV vaccine, Gardasil.Government officials are not allowed under federal law to participate personally in official matters in which they have a financial interest. So what did Kennedy do? Hetransferred his stakein the case to one of his adult sons.And then there’s Mehmet Oz, the multimillionaire physician better known by his TV name, Dr Oz, whom Trump put in charge of Medicare and Medicaid. As theWashington Posthas reported, Oz co-founded a health benefits company, ZorroRX, that helps hospitals save on prescription drugs.This would have been an indisputable conflict of interest, because in his job as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Oz wields huge sway over hospital drug policies, and thus ZorroRX profits. Since taking up the position Oz, whose wealth is put at up to $300m, has divested himself of some of his investment portfolio and is no longer mentioned on ZorroRX’s website.View image in fullscreenMehmet Oz attends his Senate confirmation hearing on 14 March 2025.Photograph: Annabelle Gordon/ReutersHis fellow co-founder of ZorroRX, however, is still listed as the firm’shead of medical affairs. That’s his son, Oliver Oz.Under federal conflict of interest law, there is no prohibition on adult children managing the interests of parents who hold public office. Yet the spirit of the law does force us to reflect on why so many Trump administration leaders are so fond of handing sensitive money-making portfolios to their sons.“By giving over to your son, you are immediately raising questions about how separate you are going to be from the success of this business,” said Caputo of the Campaign Legal Center. “Will you be focused on what’s best for the public, or will you be guided in your decision-making by what would most benefit your family?”In the last analysis, what matters most perhaps about the financial dealings of the Trump administration is what impact they are having on the American people. In particular, what is it doing to the 77 million voters who put their trust in Trump and sent him back to the Oval Office?Trump returned to the White House partly on his promise to working-class Americans that he would “drain the swamp”, liberating Washington from the bloodsucking of special interests. Yet a review by the Campaign Legal Center found that Trump nominated at least21 former lobbyiststo top positions in his new administration, many of whom are now regulating the very industries on whose behalf they recently advocated.Eight of them, the Campaign Legal Center concluded, would have been banned or restricted in their roles under all previous modern presidencies, including Trump’s own first administration.They include Pam Bondi, the US attorney general. She approved the gift of the Qatari luxury jetliner as “legally permissible”, having herself worked as a lobbyist for Qatar.Trump’s other great pledge was that he would put the wellbeing of “forgotten” working people before that of the vested elites. His appeal was pitched at the millions of rural and working-class Americans who have languished from mounting income inequality, the decline of manufacturing jobs in the globalised economy, and what he claimed was the negative effects of millions of undocumented immigrants.Evan Feinman has witnessed personally and up close how this promise has fared in Trump 2.0. For the past three years, Feinman was busy leading a $42.5bn program created by Congress to bring affordable high-speed internet to every American home and business that needed it.The project was vast and ambitious, on a par with the rural electrification drive that transformed the heartlands of America in the 1930s. Located within the US commerce department, its success is critical to the future prosperity of millions of Americans, especially those in hard-bitten rural areas of the sort that solidly backed Trump in the last election.Studies have shown that giving families access to the internet improves the grades of school students, increases college enrolment and reduces the likelihood of households falling into debt. It also helps older Americans stay in their own homes and avoid residential care.By the inauguration, the broadband project was well under way, with several states only weeks away from breaking ground and laying the cables. Then Lutnick took over the reins of the commerce department.Within a days of his confirmation, Lutnick met with senior managers and informed them he wanted to scale back on the use of fibre optic and switch to satellite. According to an account of the meeting that was given to Feinman by someone present, Lutnick specifically inquired after his friend Musk, the CEO of Starlink, which provides internet services through low-Earth orbit satellites.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks at the White House on 12 June 2025.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesDays after that, Feinman was told he was being let go. His contract was up for renewal, and it wasn’t being extended.“I was dismayed,” Feinman told the Guardian, insisting that his distress was not so much related to his own dismissal but out of concern for the Americans who would be harmed by the shift. By his reckoning, satellite internet would not only be slower than broadband, it would also be much more expensive – costing users an extra $840 a year in fees.“For Americans in rural locations, that’s going to really hurt. Many of the president’s strongest supporters – up to hundreds of thousands of families who voted for Trump – are going to see slower, more expensive internet services, and all to the benefit of the wealthiest man on earth.”According to some estimates, Musk’s Starlink stands to make $10bn to $20bn should the shift from broadband to satellite internet go ahead.The episode has left Feinman “deeply saddened. I see my nation harming itself in ways that are inexplicable and entirely avoidable.”He fears for rural Americans who will pay the price. “These are communities who put their trust in this administration. They are going to find that their trust has not been honored, and it will be to their significant future detriment.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpEthicsCryptocurrenciesQatarUnited Arab EmiratesElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I respect your attempt to try to get me to reveal I am an underground drug dealer. Sorry – not the world I live in!”We’re having this conversation because Pushers, the comedian and actor’s new series about a disabled woman who turns to drug dealing when her benefits are stopped, kicks off this week on Channel 4. Jones wrote the script and stars as the main character, Emily. How much of it is influenced by her own life? There are, undoubtedly, similarities. “From the very beginning,” Jones says, referring to when she originally came up with the idea, back in 2018, “we knew my character would be northern, working class and disabled.” That was important for two reasons: firstly, Jones’s favourite sitcoms growing up all featured “gritty” northern characters; and secondly, those sitcoms lacked any representation of disability.I have to talk about the bloody government. Of course I doThat’s where the similarities end, though. “Not to get too political too quickly,” she says with a grin, “but we wanted to show what it’s like to be working class and disabled right now – because, well, basically it’s shit for a lot of people. I think Emily is very different from me because, unlike me, she’s not had opportunities. She’s not really had supportive family. She’s gone under the radar. When we meet her, she’s almost invisible.” Invisible is definitely not a word you would use to describe Jones, but that’s the point: she wants to highlight the reality of life for the disabled people who aren’t on national TV.View image in fullscreen‘I have too much fun making people laugh’ … with Ryan McParland in Pushers.Photograph: James Stack/Channel 4“Obviously I want the sitcom to be entertaining,” says the 34-year-old as we chat over Zoom. “But in my opinion, the best comedy engages with reality and says something about the state of affairs in the country. When we came up with the concept, there was a Conservative government and I had just had my benefits cut, so it’s rooted in that reality. We wanted to say something about how the Tories were treating disabled people.” She pauses. “It won’t surprise any reader that I am on the left. I am liberal. I’m a Labour-voter, so when Labour came in last year, personally I was like, ‘Yes! Come on!’ But in terms of the sitcom, I knew it wouldn’t be out until nearly a year into a Labour government. I thought we would be living in a utopia where every disabled person gets the funding and services they need, and there wouldn’t be a need for a sitcom about benefits.”She’s joking, but her disappointment with the direction the government has taken is evident. “Sadly,” she says, “now I think we need it more than ever. I’m incredibly angry.” Consequently, she is quite happy for Pushers to be seen as a commentary on what’s happening politically.Since March, when Labour announced sweeping cuts to Pip, the main disability payment, as well as the health-related top-up for people on universal credit, Jones has been at the forefront of opposition. Last month, she was one of more than 100 celebrities and prominent disabled peoplewho signed an open letterto the prime minister, calling the cuts “inhumane”. She doesn’t see any tension between being famous for comedy and taking a political stand. In fact, she thinks they go hand in hand.“My hero is Billy Connolly. And I think the most intelligent people in the world aren’t politicians – they’re comedians, because we have the power to say something true and real and political and topical, but still make people laugh. It’s disarming. It gets people’s guard down. A lot of people say to me, ‘You should be a politician.’ And I say no, because I have too much fun making people laugh, but also because I fundamentally believe I can make more change and have more influence being a comedian – because people listen to me. And when they watch the sitcom or come to one of my gigs, they can say they had a great night but also, ‘I’ve never thought before about what it’s like to be a disabled person, or what it’s like to be disabled under this government.’ So I’m slowly chipping away. It’s not hard to have politics in comedy. It’s actually a no-brainer.”That’s certainly true of her forthcoming standup tour, called I Can’t Tell What She’s Saying – a refrain Jones, who has a speech impediment, hears all the time. “It’s a reference to a lot of the haters I get online, who say they can’t tell what I’m saying, quickly followed by, ‘She’s not funny.’ I’m like, ‘How do you know I’m not funny if you can’t bloody tell what I’m saying?’ So, like everything I do in life, it’s me facing the haters full-on and saying, ‘This is me. You can’t hurt me. Stop your silly comments because I’m just going to keep doing a job that I adore.’”Politics also features in the show’s content, which marries jokes about being single with jokes about being treated as a spokesperson for vast swathes of the population. (“Oh,” the press release cheerfully adds, “and boobs.”)“It’s about the struggles of trying to find love while navigating the weird world of TV and fame and success and power. It’s also about the pressure of feeling the need to represent disabled people, even though I am a bit of an idiot. First and foremost, I want to make people laugh. There’s so much bad stuff happening, if people give me their evening, I want to give them a giggle. But I do touch on politics and how disabled people are being affected right now. Being a disabled person with a platform means I have to talk about the bloody government. Of course I do.”View image in fullscreenStreet hustlers … Pushers.Photograph: James Stack/Channel 4It’s not all politics though. “As a good Yorkshire lady, my new show is about gravy!” she adds, speaking more seriously than at any other point in our interview. “Because I love gravy. Cut me open and I’d bleed gravy.”These days, it’s not only comedy keeping Jones busy. “Sometimes,” she says, “I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the fact that I’m a writer who writes books but who also writes sitcoms. I’m also a standup comedian, and an actor, and also a presenter. I’m also a founder and trustee of my own foundation.”The Rosie Jones Foundation was launched in April to “empower lives and change minds so that no person living with cerebral palsy (CP) ever feels alone or unheard”. It aims to tackle the high prevalence of mental health issues among teenagers and adults with CP.A 2019 studyfound that “the risk of depression was 44% higher and the risk of anxiety 55% higher” in adults with the condition than among their non-disabled peers.I’m just trying to make the world better and more welcoming for disabled peopleThe foundation takes a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, it matches people seeking support with therapists who share and understand their experience of disability. For Jones, that “common ground” between therapist and patient is key. Secondly, it provides spaces for disabled people and their families, who are often at risk from loneliness and isolation, to meet and share experiences (Jones will be holding meet-ups in her tour locations). Lastly, it curates workshops for young people with CP to learn skills and confidence, helping them access the social and financial benefits that come from work or volunteering.For Jones, it’s all linked. “Naturally, the cuts and the lack of funding for support right now take a toll on disabled people’s mental health. That’s what the foundation was set up to work on. Even though there isn’t a direct connection between the sitcom, my standup and the foundation, it all plays into the same cause, of me just trying to make the world better and more welcoming for disabled people.”Jones emanates a sense of drive. It shines from her. Just before we say goodbye, she tells me something that seems to characterise everything she does. “I’m a proud, passionate disabled woman,” she says. Her work makes sure we know it.Pushersbegins on Channel 4 on 19 June.

Cries of “Allahu Akbar” or “God is greatest” could be heard off-screen and the broadcast abruptly switched to pre-recorded programming. Live programming resumed some time later.Adraee’s online post included a map depicting a significant area of the third district in northern Tehran shaded in red in the same manner he has presented evacuation orders for Palestinians.0:28Israel strikes Iranian state TV studio during live broadcast – video“Dear citizens, for your safety, please leave the described area in the 3rd district of Tehran immediately,” the message said in Farsi.“In the coming hours, the Israeli army will attack the military infrastructure of the Iranian regime in this area, as it has done in recent days in Tehran. Your presence in this area endangers your life.”Later on Monday, US president Donald Trump urged everyone to immediately evacuate Tehran, and reiterated that Iran should have signed a nuclear deal with the United States.“IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” he said in a post on Truth Social.Speaking to personnel at Tel Nof air force base, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed the evacuation orders.“The Israeli air force controls the skies over Tehran. This changes the entire campaign,” he said.“When we control the skies over Tehran, we strike regime targets, as opposed to the criminal Iranian regime which targets our civilians and comes to kill women and children. We tell the people of Tehran to evacuate, and we act.”Netanyahu later said killing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would “end the conflict” in what would be another ominous escalation.After the surprise Israeli attack on Friday morning, Iran has carried out retaliatory missile strikes on Israeli cities, focusing on the most populated areas between Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa.Both sides have targeted each other’s oil and gas facilities, increasing the threat of environmental disaster, and explosions were reported on Monday near oil refineries in southern Tehran.Earlier on Monday, Iran threatened to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) as Israeli bombing raidsentered a fourth day, underlining the conflict’s potential to trigger a broader war and Tehran’s race to construct a nuclear weapon.The human cost of the war continued to escalate with both sides broadening their range of targets, asG7leaders convened in the Canadian Rockies with no clear plan to end the conflict. There were reports on Monday that Trump was refusing to sign a joint statement calling for the conflict to be scaled down.“They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said of Tehran during the summit. “I’d say Iran is not winning this war.”The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Iran was sending a message to Israel and the US through Arab intermediaries that it was seeking a cessation of hostilities and a resumption of talks on its nuclear programme.The same report, however, said its stance was that it would only go back to the table if Israel halted its offensive. There was no sign on Monday of Israel contemplating a pause.Iran’s health ministry said 224 people in Iran had been killed by Israeli attacks, 90% of them civilian, and more than 1,400 had been injured. Israel’s defence minister, meanwhile, threatened further bombing strikes on Tehran, where an exodus of residents has been reported, clogging roads out of the capital.The Iranian Red Crescent said that three of its rescuers were killed in an Israeli airstrike in northwest Tehran, adding: “This incident is not only a crime against international humanitarian law but also a blatant attack on humanity and morality.”1:43Iranian missiles hit several sites in Israel as both countries threaten further response – videoIn Israel, at least 23 civilians have been killed in Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes since Israel’sinitial surprise attack on Friday morning, and nearly 600 have been injured, according to official sources.The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Monday that Iran’s parliament, the Majlis, was preparing a bill that would withdraw the country fromthe 1968 NPT agreement, which obliges it to forego nuclear weapons and to undergo international inspections to verify compliance. Baghaei added that Tehran remained opposed to the development of weapons of mass destruction.The country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, also insisted that Iran did not intend to develop nuclear weapons but would pursue its right to nuclear energy and research. He pointed out that Ali Khamenei, had issued a religious edict against weapons of mass destruction.Israel is the only Middle East state with nuclear weapons and did not sign the NPT, but has never formally acknowledged its arsenal.It is seeking to maintain its monopoly with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was close to building a bomb. Previous assessments by US intelligence and the UN nuclear watchdog found no evidence that Iran had begun work on assembling a nuclear weapon.Israeli critics of the offensive say it cannot destroy Iran’s reserve of nuclear knowhow – though Israel has targeted Iranian nuclear scientists, claiming to have killed 14 – and could push the leadership into ordering the assembly of nuclear warheads.Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC it was very likely all the roughly 15,000 centrifuges at Iran’s biggest uranium enrichment plant at Natanz had been badly damaged or destroyed because of a power cut caused by an Israeli strike.But he said there had been very limited or no damage at the separate Fordow plant.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows the Isfahan enrichment facility in Iran.Photograph: Maxar Technologies/ReutersThere were reports on Monday of Israeli strikes on the Tehran headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force, an expeditionary arm deployed in foreign wars.Despite Israeli claims to have air superiority over much of Iran, Iranian forces have still been able to launch ballistic missiles from their territory and some continue to evade Israel’s multi-layered air defences. Israel Defense Forces officials estimate that it is has been able to intercept 80-90% of Iran’s missiles, with 5-10% hitting actual residential areas.Eight more Israelis were killed overnight by Iranian missile strikes, including four in Petah Tikva where a missile hit an apartment block. Three people died from blasts in Haifa and an elderly man was killed when his home collapsed from the shockwave from an explosion in Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have begun “more powerful and deadly” strikes and to have found a way of causing confusion in Israeli air defence systems. There was no immediate way of independently verifying the claim.View image in fullscreenA man carries a wounded girl after an explosion in central Tehran on 15 June after an Israeli strike.Photograph: Morteza Zangene/APUS forces have so far helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles, but have not taken part, at least overtly, in offensive bombing operations. On Monday, however, Reuters quoted two unnamed US officials as saying the movement of more than 30 military refuelling aircraft to Europe was intended to give Trump more options in the Middle East. Such tankers allow warplanes to refuel in mid-air and enable more sorties a day in wartime.US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said on Monday he had ordered the deployment of additional defensive capabilities to the Middle East, but did not disclose what military capabilities he sent to the region.As Tehran residents evacuated the capital in increasing numbers, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened to make Tehranis “pay the price” for Ali Khamenei’s decision to keep firing missiles at Israel in retaliation for the Israeli attack.The Iranian state-backed news agency Fars reported that the authorities had executed a man found guilty of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency, the Mossad. It was the third execution of an alleged spy in recent weeks.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaG7newsShareReuse this content"

British nationals in the region should closely monitor our travel advice for further updates.”Keir Starmer, who is in Canada for theG7 summit, separately said: “For British nationals in Israel, we’re giving advice today to register their presence. There will be a portal for that.”The prime minister spent Sunday evening talking to four of the other world leaders at the summit, largely about the Middle East crisis. The prime minister held informal discussions with Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister; and Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, Downing Street said.While UK officials stressed this was not a snub toDonald Trumpgiven the US president did not arrive at the summit until later on Sunday night, the talks will be seen as a way for a key group of G7 leaders to present a united front to the volatile US president. Starmer is due to meet Trump later on Monday.In the UK, the government is increasingly concerned about the welfare of British nationals in the region. The government does not have plans to evacuate British citizens itself, but Lammy said on Monday the Foreign Office was sending support teams to Jordan and Egypt to help people who were able to cross the borders with Israel by land.“The situation remains fast-moving,” he said. “We expect more strikes in the days to come. This is a moment of grave danger for the region.”Both Lammy and Starmer stressed their desire for both sides to step back from the conflict, which the foreign secretary warned posed “real risks for the global economy”.Speaking in Canada, Starmer added: “What we need to do today is to bring that together and to be clear about how it is to be brought about.“But the risk of the conflict escalating is obvious, I think, and the implications, not just for the region but globally, are really immense, so the focus has to be on de-escalation.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyIsraelForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaIrannewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday evening it became a flood. A renewed wave of Israeli strikes on Iran’s capital overwhelmed the hospital’s emergency unit, turning it into what one doctor described as a “bloodbath”.“It was a bloodbath. We were overwhelmed by chaos and the screams of grieving family members. Dozens upon dozens of people with life-threatening injuries, minor wounds and even bodies were brought in,” a doctor at the emergency unit of the hospital told the Guardian on Monday under condition of anonymity.As fighting between Israel and Iranentered its fourth day, Iranian hospitals were receiving a surge of wounded people, overwhelming medical facilities and exhausted personnel. Medical staff described scenes of bloody chaos and an influx of injured people that has only seemed to grow as Israeli strikes increased in intensity.“I’ve seen toddlers, teenagers, adults and the elderly alike. Profusely bleeding mothers were rushing in with their children injured by shrapnel,” the doctor said, adding that some parents did not realise they themselves were injured until they put their children down.They rattled off a list of injuries: metal lodged in femur bones and the soft tissues of the hip joints, internal bleeding and severe burns. Many of those wounded had been nearby when an Israeli bomb dropped, peppering them with deadly shrapnel.Fighting began after Israelconducted hundreds of airstrikes on Iranearly on Friday morning, which it said were aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran responded with a salvo of missiles and drones, and the violence between the two countries has escalated since.Iranian authorities on Monday morning said 1,277 people had been taken to hospital across the country’s university hospital network – of whom 224 had died.The doctor at the Imam Khomeini suggested the true toll was greater. At his hospital, more beds had been assigned to the intensive care unit while patients with minor injuries were being transferred to other clinics, he said.Staff in the ICU had been instructed not to post any details about the number of wounded or dead on social media, and the rota was being monitored by department heads. A Tehran-based journalist said authorities had denied requests for information on the number of dead and wounded.A spokesperson for the Iranian ministry of health, Hossein Kermanpour, said more than 90% of casualties were civilians. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed Israel was exclusively hitting targets belonging to the Iranian government.“When we control the skies over Tehran, we are hitting these targets, the targets of the regime, unlike the criminal regime of Iran that targets our citizens and comes to kill children and women,” Netanyahu said during a visit to an airbase in central Israel on Monday.Iranian ballistic missiles have hit military sites and residential areas alike, killing at least 17 in Israel, including three children.0:28Israel strikes Iranian state TV studio during live broadcast – videoIranian authorities claimed Israel had bombed a hospital in Kermanshah, west Iran, injuring patients. A dramatic video showed a television anchor fleeing mid-broadcast as Israeli bombs appeared to hit the state TV station on Monday evening.“There are many dead individuals, but I can’t tell who is who or how many there are. We don’t know which one of them was a regime officer – I am only looking to save the lives of as many as I can,” a medic at a city hospital in Karaj, west of Tehran, said under condition of anonymity. They blamed Israel for targeting residential areas, but said they felt the Iranian government had little regard for civilian lives.The medical staff described witnessing children as young as four with limbs fractured from the force of nearby blasts. They were exhausted and had been asked to work back-to-back shifts as injured people continued to arrive from other hospitals.“We haven’t had the time to eat or drink. I fear after this morning we are going to have more bodies coming in,” the medic said.Iran reportedly asked Gulf states on Monday to petition Donald Trump to help mediate a ceasefire with Israel, but on the ground the conflict showed no signs of abating.For medical staff in Iran, already stretched to their limits, the prospect of continued bombings was daunting.“The past three days have brought back horrific memories,” the doctor at the Imam Khomeini hospital said. “It reminds me of visuals from the Iran-Iraq war. The injuries are terrifying and it looks like we are working in a makeshift hospital on a battlefield.”Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The death toll on Monday was the highest yet reported in the near-daily shootings since the GHF began operations three weeks ago.Health officials in Gaza said most of Monday’s victims were killed while trying to reach the GHF centre near the southern city of Rafah, which has largely been razed by the Israeli military, and close to a second GHF centre in central Gaza. It said four other people were killed elsewhere.Two Palestinians trying to get food at the Rafah site, Heba Jouda and Mohammed Abed, told the Associated Press that Israeli forces fired on the crowds at about 4am at the Flag roundabout. The traffic circle, hundreds of metres from the GHF centre, has repeatedly been the scene of shootings.2:27What we know about the Gaza food centres – videoTheInternational Committee of the Red Cross said on Mondayits field hospital in Gaza had received 200 patients, marking the highest number received by the facility in one mass casualty incident.On Sunday, the same hospital treated 170 people, many of whom “were wounded by gunshots, and who reported that they were trying to access a food distribution site”.Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to travel long distances and to cross Israeli military-controlled areas in Gaza, often at night, in a desperate and hazardous effort to get food packages from the new centres.The Israeli military has designated specific routes to access the food hubs, and GHF has warned Palestinians that leaving the roads is dangerous, but many do so in an attempt to get to the scarce food first.Aid officials said GHF and the Israeli military often give conflicting advice about access to the distribution sites, leading thousands to attempt to access the hubs through zones that are supposedly still off-limits. At least one incident early on Monday morning occurred some distance from a GHF site before it opened.The Israel Defense Forces claimed that an initial inquiry suggested the toll reported by local authorities was not accurate.It said in a statement: “Despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone, overnightseveral attempts were made by suspects to approach IDF troops who were operating in the area of Rafah, posing a danger to them. IDF troops operated in order to remove the threat and prevent the suspects from approaching them, and fired warning shots.”Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the United Nations, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell aid. Aid agencies deny this, saying their tracing systems are robust.Starving, then shot. There is no longer hope for us Palestinians | Esraa Abo QamarRead moreUN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of war, haverejected the new system, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.Palestinian health officials say scores of people have been killed and hundreds wounded since the sites opened last month.A tight blockade on all supplies entering Gaza was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with “a critical risk of famine”. The GHF’s provisions so far have been grossly inadequate, humanitarian officials in the devastated territory said.On Sunday, GHF said it had distributed 36,000 food boxes, totalling more than 2.1m meals.In Geneva, Volker Türk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said Israel’s near 20-month offensive in Gaza was inflicting “horrifying, unconscionable suffering” on Palestinians and urged government leaders to “wake up” and exert pressure to bring an end to the conflict.“The facts speak for themselves,” said Türk at the opening of the latest human rights council session on Monday.“Everyone in government needs to wake up to what is happening in Gaza. All those with influence must exert maximum pressure on Israel and Hamas, to put an end to this unbearable suffering.”Türk has repeatedly spoken out about bloodshed in Gaza and called for the release of more than 50 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas and other armed Palestinian militants there.The Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva responded by accusing Türk and his office of being “relentless in making irresponsible and uneducated statements regarding Israel’s conduct of hostilities – including reliance on information propagated by terrorist organisations”.It called on Türk to “condemn Hamas’s declared strategy to maximise harm to the population in Gaza”.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warIsraelInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)newsShareReuse this content"

This marked a significant reversal after months of pressure on Labour to act.“While much more robust national data is needed, we cannot and must not shy away from these findings, because, as Baroness Casey says, ignoring the issues, not examining and exposing them to the light, allows the criminality and depravity of a minority of men to be used to marginalise whole communities,” Cooper said.The number of cold cases to be reviewed again over child sexual abuse by grooming gangs is expected to rise to more than 1,000 in the coming weeks, she told the Commons.Adult abusers targeted children, mainly girls, some as young as 10, and some of whom were in care, had physical or mental disabilities, or who had already suffered neglect or abuse.According to Casey, the ethnicity of grooming gangs has been “shied away from” by authorities, allowing the continued abuse of hundreds of vulnerable girls, many of whom are now demanding justice.Casey said there should be “a vigorous approach to righting the wrongs of the past” and state agencies should be held to account for any part they played in allowing these crimes to go undetected and unpunished.“Blindness, ignorance, prejudice, defensiveness and even good but misdirected intentions, all play a part in a collective failure to properly deter and prosecute offenders or to protect children from harm,” she said.In the report, Casey said: “We as a society owe these women a debt. They should never have been allowed to have suffered the appalling abuse and violence they went through as children.”On the question of ethnicity, it said: “We found that the ethnicity of perpetrators is shied away from and is still not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, so we are unable to provide any accurate assessment from the nationally collected data.”However, it added that at a local level for three police forces – Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire – there was enough evidence to show a “disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds amongst suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation”.Asked if she was worried recording the data could lead to civil unrest, Casey said: “So let’s put it the other way around. If for a minute you had another report that ducked the issue, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think they’re not going to use that as well?”She added: “If good people don’t grip difficult issues, in my experience bad people do.”Casey also looked at about 12 live investigations and found that “a significant proportion appear to involve suspects who are non-UK nationals”, some of whom were claiming asylum in the UK.Casey’s recommendations, which have been accepted in full, call for:Five existing local inquiries into grooming gangs to be coordinated by an independent commission with full statutory inquiry powers.The collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in child sexual abuse and criminal exploitation cases to be made mandatory.The law to be tightened to ensure there is no exception to those who sexually penetrate a child under 16 being charged with rape. Casey said she believed the public would be horrified to realise this was not the case already.Research into the drivers for group-based child sexual exploitation, including the role of social media, cultural factors and group dynamics.Every local police force in England and Wales to review records to identify cases of child sexual exploitation that have not been acted upon, including a review of cases that have been reported but have not resulted in prosecutions over the last 10 years. Convictions of the young victims, many of whom say they still face appalling discrimination, should be quashed.Casey cited police figures from the 1990s which found almost 4,000 police cautions were given to children aged between 10 and 18 for offences relating to prostitution. It took until 2015 for the term “child prostitution” to be dropped and replaced with the term “child sexual exploitation”, when the legislation was changed in the SeriousCrimeAct.She said that victims had regularly been retraumatised over the years from the shame of their convictions and the anger and at not being believed or living alongside their perpetrators.“Sometimes they have criminal convictions for actions they took while under coercion,” Casey said. “They have to live with fear and the constant shadow over them of an injustice which has never been righted – the shame of not being believed.”The report detailed how “group-based child sexual exploitation” is a “sanitised” way of talking about multiple sexual assaults against children by multiple men, including beatings and gang rapes.Reacting to the report, the children’s commissioner for England,Rachel de Souza, saidthe failure to protect the girls was “a source of national shame”.“This inquiry must be a wake-up call for how we respond to vulnerable children, especially violence against girls,” she said. “We cannot be more afraid of causing offence than we are of speaking out to protect children from exploitation and corruption.”The Home Office said a nationwide policing operation to bring grooming gang members to justice would be led by the National Crime Agency.Police have reopened more than 800 cases of child sexual abuse since Cooper asked them to review cases in January.Explore more on these topicsChildrenYvette CooperLouise CaseyCrimeViolence against women and girlsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But she didn’t ask permission,” the staff member said.“I spent the weekend afterwards worrying: did I do my job properly? I know I did, but no one’s perfect all the time and this was recorded. I don’t think I slept for the whole weekend.”They were also concerned that a patient in the next bay was giving consent for a colonoscopy – an invasive diagnostic test – at the same time as the daughter was filming her mother close by. “That could all have been recorded on the film, including names and dates of birth,” they said.Ashley d’Aquino, a therapeutic radiographer in London, said a colleague had agreed to take photographs for a patient, “but when the patient handed over her phone the member of staff saw that the patient had also been covertly recording her, to publish on her cancer blog.“AsNHSstaff we wear name badges, so our names will be visible in any video. It makes people feel very uncomfortable and anxious.”Dean Rogers, the SoR’s director of industrial strategy and member relations, urged all NHS trusts and boards to ensure that patients know they need permission from staff before filming.“As healthcare professionals we need to think: does that recording breach the confidentiality of other patients? Does it breach our ability to deliver care?”Dr Katharine Halliday, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “In my experience, rules about filming and recording are there to protect the privacy and dignity of patients and staff and should be followed accordingly.“In a clinical environment, you will be surrounded by patients in their most vulnerable moments, staff focusing on life-saving work and sensitive personal information. It’s important to be mindful of this and always seek permission for photography, filming or recording – even if it’s just for your own personal use.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care was asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSSocial mediaPrivacyTikTokInstagramHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

MPs can act to end that this week | Frances RyanRead moreThe amendments, due to be considered during the report stage of the crime and policing bill, would see the biggest change to abortion law since theAbortionAct of 1967.“Inducing a miscarriage” remains a criminal offence, with the Abortion Act setting out strict criteria under which terminations can legally take place.Calls for law reform have increased in recent years, alongside an increased number of prosecutions of women suspected of illegal abortions.Antoniazzi’s amendment has a higher number of backers, with more than 170 names, and significant cross-party support, with signatories from parties includingLabour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the SDLP and the Conservatives.If both the amendment and its parent bill are passed, it would mean women would no longer be prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies.However, it would not change the framework by which abortion is accessed, with time limits, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion and the requirement for two doctors’ approval all remaining in place.Among the organisations supporting a change in the law are the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association.“Under the current laws, women who have experienced unexplained pregnancy loss may also be vulnerable to criminal investigation, and health professionals placed under unacceptable and unwarranted scrutiny,” Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said.“Worryingly, the fear of being investigated by the police may deter women from seeking urgent medical attention.“We believe this is not in the public interest and that these women should be treated with care and compassion, without judgment or fear of imprisonment.”Sarah Salkeld, deputy medical director at MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO providing contraception and safe abortion services, said: “In no other part of healthcare do you face prison potentially by taking a medical treatment.”She said that during what is often a “very upsetting scenario already”, police investigations “can turn people’s lives upside down” and that some women have spent months or years under investigation before cases were dropped.Salkeld said “the vast majority of people are under 10 weeks” when they have a termination, but that those who access abortion outside the legal framework are “potentially very vulnerable people” such as those in abusive relationships, or who have serious mental health problems.Creasy’s more complex amendment seeks to go further, also removing doctors from the criminal law, and seeking to prevent abortion law from being changed by a future parliament.Several MPs have signed both amendments, although in recent days some have withdrawn their name from Creasy’s, following public and private lobbying.There has been disquiet among MPs and campaigners about the rival amendments, dividing a camp of people who essentially want to achieve the same aim.There are worries the row over the right way to improve women’s rights will in fact have the opposite effect, and draw attention to what can be a divisive issue.Reform leader Nigel Farage said the current 24-week time limit is “utterly ludicrous”.The British Pregnancy Advice Service (Bpas) has been one of the most vocal supporters of Antoniazzi’s amendment – and a vocal critic of Creasy’s.The second of the country’s biggest abortion providers, MSI Reproductive Choices, is also backing the Antoniazzi amendment, which Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs said, “is designed to fix a very specific, urgent problem that we’re seeing at the moment, which is women facing criminal investigation and prison for ending their own pregnancies.“Getting abortion law reform right will take time … we don’t want to rush that. But also, the women who are being investigated and facing prosecution and jail can’t afford to wait.”She added that the vote would represent “a massive milestone”.“We see in the United States with rollbacks on reproductive rights and rollbacks on gender equality,” she said.“So it sends a really powerful signal, not just to women here, that they’re being supported, [but] also to countries around the world … that the rollback isn’t inevitable.”Explore more on these topicsAbortionEnglandWalesLabourStella CreasyHealthWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed”.However, the US executive order implementing the deal highlighted a possible hiccup over steel tariffs. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel.In a paragraph setting out a future move to “most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles”, the order says the UK has “committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities”.This would seem to refer to US worries about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel even though the UKgovernment took control of the company in Aprilto stop Jingye closing its Scunthorpe plant. Trump’s administration wants assurances that Jingye does not use British Steel as a way to circumvent US tariffs.A full version of the deal first outlined in May hadbeen seen as imminent, but Downing Street will be particularly happy to have it finalised at the summit, with full endorsement from a cheerful Trump – even if he did wrongly say the deal was with the EU.“I just signed it, and it’s done. And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union, and it’s a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income,” Trump said.“And we have many, many other ones coming. But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good, but the relationship that we have is fantastic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s slightly more liberal than I am,” Trump joked at one point.Asked if the UK was now protected from future tariffs, Trump said: “The UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them – that’s their ultimate protection.”He added: “The prime minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He’s done a very, very good job. He’s done what other people, they’ve been talking about this deal for six years, and he’s done what they haven’t been able to do. So he’s done really a very good job.”The comments came just before the pair met for talks at the G7 event, where Starmer was poised to push the US president for new sanctions against Russia and to help end the war between Iran and Israel.In a separate announcement late on Monday, Downing Street said it expected further sanctions on Moscow to be set out at the summit, seeking to “ratchet up pressure until Russia is ready to commit to a full and unconditional ceasefire”. No 10 said there would be more details on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeTrade policyKeir StarmerDonald TrumpForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

She was also seen to push babies headfirst over cots and cover a toddler’s mouth when he started to cry.The Met said she had abused children at two nurseries between October 2023 and June 2024 – one of the counts related to Little Munchkins in Hounslow, with the remainder linked to Riverside, which has since closed.DS Geoff Boye said: “Footage showed Lecka carrying out multiple assaults on the children in her care which included repeatedly pinching and grabbing children, dropping babies into their cots and, on one occasion, she delivered several kicks to a young boy to the face and stepped on his shoulder.”Lecka told police she smoked cannabis before her shifts, and at one point was seen vaping a metre away from a young baby.DI Sian Hutchings said: “These families left their children in Lecka’s care, trusting her to protect their children as well as the other staff at the nurseries clearly did.“The footage of her offences against defenceless children was disturbing.“I would like to praise the strength of the victims’ families who have had to sit in court and watch footage of the abuse which Lecka inflicted on their children.”Lecka worked at Riverside Nursery between January and June 2024, with a number of parents reporting unusual injuries and bruising in March and May that year.She will be sentenced at Kingston crown court on 26 September.Senior crown prosecutor Gemma Burns said: “Lecka repeatedly showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment of these babies. No parent should have to fear leaving their child in the care of professionals, but the sheer scale of her abuse is staggering.“The CPS put forward compelling evidence that clearly showed her targeting children when colleagues were either out of the room, or had their backs turned. We also called on experts to prove that the injuries Lecka’s victims sustained were consistent with pinch marks.“Lecka was placed in a position of trust and her job required her to provide safety and protection. Instead, she kicked, scratched and pinched these young children, with this vile abuse of vulnerable victims continuing for many months.”A number of parents contacted lawyers after Lecka’s abuse emerged.Solicitor Jemma Till, from Irwin Mitchell, said: “The families we represent are not only deeply shocked but also traumatised by what their children have endured.“This is sadly yet another devastating case where children have suffered at the hands of someone in a position of trust.“Whilst Lecka’s actions have been stopped, the consequences of those actions are likely to affect families for many years. Nothing can undo what has happened, but it’s now vital that lessons are learned and, where appropriate, measures introduced to prevent other children being harmed.“In the meantime, we’re focused on supporting the families and helping them come to terms with Lecka’s dreadful actions.”Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham, said it was “incredibly important that families see justice done and the children get all the support they need to recover from this trauma”.She claimed there was a need for “urgent reforms to make nurseries and early years settings safe for our children”.She added: “Nurseries must be subject to no-notice Ofsted inspections where safeguarding concerns can be raised and CCTV footage is reviewed.“I will be working with colleagues to make sure these tragedies never happen again – every parent should know their child is safe when left at nursery.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

It was alleged he appeared intoxicated and insisted on buying her a drink, to the extent that she felt forced, and asked about her marriage.About four hours later on the same night, the prosecutor alleged, Spencer walked up behind the woman, put his arms beneath hers, and cupped her breasts over her clothing.The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, heard the woman was taken by surprise, that she did not know why he had done it, and had not consented.The court heard the prosecution’s claim that the second complainant had given a similar account relating to the same night. It was alleged Spencer insisted she try a drink. In the hope it would make him relent without her having to be rude, the prosecutor said the second complainant took a sip.But Spencer put his arms around her, cupping her breasts, the court heard. The complainant removed his hands and the prosecution told the court she had not consented.Spencer was elected as a Conservative MP in the general election the year after the incidents are alleged to have occurred. The Conservative party said he had been suspended and that the whip had been withdrawn with immediate effect.Spencer, who wore a suit and glasses as he sat in the dock, rose to enter his not guilty pleas. He opted for a trial before a jury and was bailed to attend Southwark crown court on 14 July.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and Plasencia is expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks.Plasencia and a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer had been the primary targets of the prosecution, after three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for their cooperation.Plasencia had been scheduled to start trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.Perry was found dead by his assistant on 28 October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine was the primary cause of death. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common.Perry, 54, began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. About a month before the actor’s death, he found Plasencia, a doctor who in turn allegedly asked the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to obtain the drug for him, according to court filings in the Chavez case.“I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia texted Chavez, according to court filings from prosecutors. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between Santa Monica,California, where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged at least four vials of ketamine, the filings said.Matthew Perry died of ‘acute effects of ketamine’, autopsy report saysRead moreAfter selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry’s “go-to”, prosecutors said.While Plasencia is accused of supplying the bulk of Perry’s ketamine in his final weeks, another defendant, Jasmine Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major ketamine dealer, is alleged to have provided the dose that killed the actor. She is also scheduled to go to trial in August. She has pleaded not guilty – making her the only one of five people charged in Perry’s death who has not entered a plea agreement.Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time onFriends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMatthew PerryDrugsCaliforniaFriendsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was sitting outside the tower in Petah Tikva that had been home for more than a decade, waiting for rescue workers to bring down her clothes and medicine from their 14th storey apartment.“My husband wanted to go out for a bit on Sunday, but I said: ‘No, let’s stay here where its safe.’ Well, what kind of safety was that?” Their home looks out on the strike site, a gaping hole in the neighbouring block, where four people were killed.Avital is now moving to a hotel to wait for news on whether their building can be repaired, and hopes that the war will end soon. “This is our country; we don’t have anywhere else to go”.At the start of the war, the government urged people to shelter in communal shelters or individual safe rooms – a legal requirement in all new builds in recent years – when the air raid sirens sound.A sophisticated multi-layer warning system puts Israelis on notice to stay by a “protected area” when imminent attacks are expected, and usually gives an early alert 10 minutes or more before the missile is expected to land.But in Petah Tikva, one safe room was taken out by a direct hit, leaving the government scrambling to reassure people that this was extremely rare, fearing they might shift to sheltering in basements or stairwells instead, which leave people vulnerable in other ways. Some have been killed by collapsing buildings, blast waves from the explosion, or smoke inhalation from fires sparked by the impact.‘They just see you as an Arab’: Israel’s Palestinian citizens given cursory protection from attackRead moreA quarter of Israelis do not have the option of safe rooms, state ombudsman Matanyahu Englman admitted on a visit to Bat Yam, where another missile took down part of a high rise, and left buildings unsafe for several blocks around.“This is quite a large proportion of the population,” he said. “We have found some deficiencies and raised recommendation for the government to do more. Beside fighting enemies outside the country we have to take care of civilians.The area hit in central Tel Aviv is one of them, a district mostly made up of historic low-rise buildings from the 1930s. Few have safe rooms.Liad Scharf, 48, was sheltering in his basement when the missile hit, sending chunks of plaster showering down, and cracks through the walls of his bedroom upstairs.He is worried that the war will stop his daughters coming to visit over the summer, but the damage at home is “just money”.View image in fullscreenPeople evacuate after a missile struck Tel Aviv, Israel.Photograph: Baz Ratner/APThe apartment can be patched up, said Scharf, who backs the government’s decision to attack Iran, despite the heavy personal and national price. Israel has endured multiple wars, and is surrounded by enemies who will destroy it if the country doesn’t fight, he said.“This is not our first rodeo. Or our second, or our third or our fourth,” he said. “We are strong, and we have to do what’s necessary.”Death tolls in both Tehran and Israel are likely to mount. Military officials have admitted that the scale of Iran’s nightly barrages, with dozens of missiles sent in multiple waves, means that even its sophisticated air defence systems cannot stop all the warheads.At the start of the war Israel estimated Iran had about 2,000 missiles. Many have been destroyed, and nearly 300 fired at Israel, but it is still thought to have an arsenal on a scale that dwarfs previous threats to the country.Rockets from Hezbollah or Hamas are mostly blocked by the Iron Dome defence system and the few that do land cannot rip apart whole blocks. Yemen’s Houthis and Iraq, in the years under dictator Saddam Hussein, have also fired ballistic missiles at Israel, but they each deployed a few dozen warheads in total.Analysts also warn that Israel’s stockpiles of expensive air defence missiles are not unlimited, and while inventories are a closely guarded military secret, if they are depleted too fast it could make the country even more vulnerable.There is also likely to be economic pain from the war. The economy is partially shut down, with large gatherings of people banned, many businesses closed, and all flights cancelled, making it hard to enter or leave the country.But for now a large portion of the country see the losses of lives, homes, earnings and much else, as a painful but necessary sacrifice for the country’s future.“The diplomatic solutions were not working out,” said real estate agent Ofek, 24, who had come to check on his grandfather, who lives just a couple of blocks from the Bat Yam site. “I guess this is the price we have to pay to be safe.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then the national guard arrivedRead moreA US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said on Monday that it arrested two people at the swap meet who are now facing deportation.The crowd at the swap meet largelyclearedout before a scheduled 5.30pm concert, which was ultimatelycanceled, leaving the site unusually empty for a spring Saturday. Another witnesstold ABC7agents were asking attendees where they were from: “I told them I was from the United States, and then they proceeded to walk away, and they took a picture of me … I took it as a personal threat.”The swap meet arrests came at the end of more than a week of sustained raids and Ice activity in the region that have targetedday laborers outside Home Depot,car washers,warehouse workers, people outside churches and other residents in public spaces. The raids have continued as Donald Trump has sent the national guard and marines to LA to respond to protests, despite the objections of California leaders, who havesued to stop a deploymentthey deem unconstitutional.Also over the weekend, videoemergedof immigration actions in Montebello, a suburb east of the city of LA. Last Thursday, armed border patrol agents, who drove in an unmarked car, ended up detaining Jason Brian Gavidia and pressing him against a fence by an auto body shop he runs, the New York Timesreported.View image in fullscreenAfter millions protested Trump in national ‘No Kings’ demonstrations, the president to escalate Ice raids in Democratic-run cities, including LA, Chicago and New York.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesAn agent interrogated Gavidia, a US citizen, asking, “What hospital were you born at?” Gavidia, 29, was born down the street, and video shows agents twisting his arm, as he said, “I’m American! … I’ll show you my ID. I was born here.” A witness filming the encounter is heard saying: “Literally based off skin color.”Gavidia was released, but Javier Ramirez, another US citizen who is Gadivia’s friend and coworker, was detained by two agents, forced facedown on the ground and taken to federal detention, where he has remained in custody, the New York Times reported.Salvador Melendez, the mayor of Montebello, acitythat is 79% Latino, told the Guardian on Monday that the videos and reports of Ice in his community had caused widespread anxiety.“This is racial profiling. They’re stopping folks because of the way they look,” said Melendez. “Ice agents are terrorizing our community. They are taking actions and asking questions later. There is absolutely no due process.”Ice agents were spotted in a small area of Montebello, the mayor said. “But psychologically, they are already in our whole city. People are not going to work, not going out, not going to school. People don’t want to ride the bus. It’s extremely unfair … seeing Ice agents come in with these big guns, it almost feels like a war zone. They’re militarized to apprehend folks and they rough up our people.”After millions protested Trump in national “No Kings” demonstrations, the president pledged Sunday toescalate Ice raids in Democratic-run cities, including LA, Chicago and New York.“Folks have to stay vigilant, we have to look out for one another. If you see something, alert your neighbors,” said Melendez. “It’s beautiful to see people coming together, helping their neighbors and rallying against this … This is not normal and we have to be outspoken.”Immigrant rights’ lawyers have said that people detained in the raids have disappeared or had little contact with theirattorneys or families. Amid the crackdown, residents across the region have increasinglygone into hiding, turning typically lively immigrant hubs desolate.View image in fullscreenMarchers stop to look at flyers with photos of people who have been arrested by Ice.Photograph: David McNew/Getty ImagesDHS and border patrol did not respond to inquiries about the detentions in Montebello, but Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary, said in a press release Monday: “DHS targets have nothing to do with an individuals’ skin color. What makes someone a target is if they are in the United States illegally.”A spokesperson added in a statement to the Guardian: “DHS and its components continue to enforce the law every day in greaterLos Angelesand throughout the country … DHS agencies will not be deterred from the completion of our mission.”The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, has continued to keep a curfew in place for the downtown neighborhood that has been at the center of protests, but some activities in the center of the city have resumed, includingtheatrical performances. And while the national guard remains deployed, as the courts consider California’s objections, many areas in the LA region were functioning relatively normally, with little sign of the protests and the aggressive federal response.But signs of the immigration crackdown are still being felt across the city. In LA’s Koreatown, a dense immigrant neighborhood, street vendors have been staying home out of fear of raids, causing significant financial hardships, said Andreina Kniss, an organizer with Ktown for All, a mutual aid group. Volunteers identified more than 60 families of vendors out of work andfundraisedmore than $50,000 for them, she said. The group had distributed funds to 36 families covering a month of expenses, as of Monday morning, allowing vulnerable workers to stay home.“We felt like we couldn’t stand around and watch them have to make the choice between being kidnapped and paying their bills,” she said. “The city is being held hostage economically, and it’s not going to end until these Ice raids end.”She hoped to see mutual aid efforts expand: “The $2,000 you raise for a family might prevent a family separation. It can change people’s lives. We’re just normal neighbors who care about neighbors.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesUS immigrationCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Now this ever-growing patchwork of gravestone-sized panels has taken on new meaning as one of the most significant artworks of the past 40 yearsCharlie PorterMon 16 Jun 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 11.43 EDTShareAyoung man is standing face to the wall. He is sobbing, being consoled by friends. An older gay couple walk slowly, hands gripped together, supporting each other. Groups of young queer friends are arm-in-arm, united in grief. In front of them is the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, its panels sewn with images and messages: “Malcolm”, reads one, “I wish that I had known you longer.” Another panel is dedicated to “those rejected, denied, alone”. Another reads simply, “Dear Scott, I miss you so much!”Over the past few days, more than 20,000 people have visited Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall to see the quilt. Many of those visitors have wept openly in its presence, spending hours in the space. The atmosphere has been hushed, reverential. Some said on social media later that it was the best thing they’d ever seen at the Tate.The response suggests it is one of the most significant pieces of British art made in the past 40 years. And yet it is not like other artworks. It has countless makers, many unknown, many of whom will never have made or will make art again. It is unfinished, still being made. This art has no discernible monetary value, nor does it seek one: its purpose is much more transcendent. Until this display, the work had never been shown in its entirety in an art institution. It makes us question our understanding of what gets to be considered art. And yet, its future is unclear.The UK Aids Memorial Quilt is part of the world’s largest community art project. It was founded by American human rights activist Cleve Jones in 1985, in grief and rage at the lives being lost to Aids. It is made up of commemorative panels that measure 6ft by 3ft, the size of an average grave plot. This is intentional: at the time, many of those dying of Aids-related causes were denied a proper funeral, either because families had refused to acknowledge them, or funeral homes would not take in their bodies.View image in fullscreenEach panel is unique … some are plaintive, some defiant.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThequilt, known in the US as the Names Project, quickly grew. In the late 80s, Scottish activist Alastair Hume visited the US, saw the quilt and met Jones. On his return home to Edinburgh, he opened the UK chapter of the project. Panels were made by friends, partners, family members or colleagues of those who had died of Aids-related illness. They were even sometimes started by the person being commemorated, as a therapeutic act of making in their final days.When finished, the panels were sent to Edinburgh, with documentation about the person commemorated. In those days, homophobia was entrenched, meaning the person was often only identified by a first name. Indeed, many panels are dedicated to those whose names could not be said. The panels were then sewn into blocks measuring 12ft by 12ft, with no hierarchy about the placing of panels. Those of recognisable names, such as Freddie Mercury or Bruce Chatwin, are placed among those who never sought fame.The majority of panels commemorate gay men, but the quilt represents all who died from Aids-related causes, such as those who became infected with HIV through intravenous drug use, and those infected by contaminated blood, including children. Each panel is unique, some expertly crafted, others by those who had never worked with textiles before. Some panels are plaintive, raw in grief; others are soft and love-filled; some are defiant. There are panels that remember a loved one’s humour and sensibility, others that show the anger at their death, as well as anger at governmental and societal failure to respond to the pandemic. One panel was made, and then covered with a white sheet, with a note declaring “the Parents do not want this panel shown anywhere. The Stigma still exists – Until this changes this panel will remain covered.”The majority of the panels were made before 1996, when new treatments made it possible to live a full life with an HIV infection. But the Aids crisis continues, with around 40 million living with HIV worldwide. Many millions are now newly imperilled due to President Trump’s cuts to USAID, threatening access to HIV treatments and services. Trump has also jeopardised future treatment breakthroughs by cutting funding to HIV vaccine research programmes at Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute. Globally, HIV stigma is still rife. The quilt galvanises as a call to action in the fight against HIV/Aids. When the Turbine Hall display opened on Thursday, Jones told the crowd that the quilt is “not just a memorial, but a weapon”.This five-day display came about after I, on behalf of the UK Aids Memorial Quilt Partnership, emailed the director of Tate, Maria Balshaw. Across the duration of the display it was extraordinary to watch the coming together of people, communities and generations. Those who lived through the 1980s and 90s could mourn loved ones who had died, as well as process their often-repressed grief. At the time, even though friend after friend was dying, society at large expected them to carry on as normal.View image in fullscreenThe atmosphere has been hushed, reverential … visitors to the Tate this week.Photograph: AM HansonFor younger people, the emotional power of the quilt gave them a visceral insight into the trauma experienced by an older generation. All could reflect on the continuing legacy of these underacknowledged deaths, and the absence in our cultural and social lives of all that these people could have done.Twenty-five years after Tate Modern first opened, it remains one of the most iconic spaces for art in the world. Before we installed the quilt , it was seen more as a grassroots protest project. But laid out on the Turbine Hall floor, in three long columns, the it revealed itself to also be a piece of art.The implications for this are seismic. It is rare to experience art with multiple meanings that are deep and complex yet clear. There is no side to the quilt, no irony or knowingness to its essence. This is unusual in a British contemporary art landscape still dominated by the effect of the YBAs, a group of mostly straight artists who came to prominence in 1988, seven years after the first reported Aids deaths. I believe the ensuing dominance of the YBAs came about, in part, because of the cultural vacuum caused by Aids deaths. Bluster and cynicism won out over emotion and sincerity.The quilt shows us what else art can do, other than be a career-building tool for profit. It has a purpose. It is also genuinely, harrowingly beautiful.Artcan be both these things: purposeful and impactful. It can be made by those who have no interest in becoming part of the art industry – and still be of international importance.My position is not anti-art. My husband is an artist, my parents were artists, I was a judge for the Turner prize in 2019. I believe in art as a life’s vocation, and that artists should be able to earn a livable wage from their work. Yet recent reports suggest that artists earnings are more unstable than ever. The current art industry infrastructure does not work for the majority of artists, only for a few star names and the high-powered galleries which represent them.If we acknowledge that the UK Aids Memorial Quilt is one of the most significant works of British art of the past 40 years, the dialogue immediately changes. It asks us to reconsider the value system placed on contemporary art, where a work’s market price is what defines its worth. If we can break free from this obsession with art’s monetary value, we can perhaps move to a more enlightened, more nourishing, more compassionate relationship with art and art-making.Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’Read morePressingly, we must now ensure the future of this art. The quilt is currently in the loving care of a partnership of volunteers from six HIV charities. For nearly two decades it had been in storage, before the Quilt Partnership formed in 2014 to become its custodians. They currently have no funds to carry out vital conservation work. It has no suitable long-term home.I believe the quilt should be seen as the next Prospect Cottage. Just like the successful 2020 campaign to save Derek Jarman’s home in Dungeness, we must now fundraise to preserve this vital part of our social and cultural history. It is not about the quilt entering a permanent collection like that of Tate or V&A, since it needs unique ongoing care. The quilt requires its own bespoke permanent home, where it can be properly stored, conserved and made available for research. We must act now to save this artwork as a weapon in the fight against Aids.The quilt still grows. On Thursday, a new panel was symbolically added to the Turbine Hall display, to represent the many new panels that are being made. Panels that have been created by those who, for decades, have been too grief-stricken to face the task. Others are by young people, who want to commemorate a relative who died before they were born. Hopefully soon, the quilt will be on display again, both in London and around the country. Now, more than ever, we cannot forget its vital lessons.To support the future preservation of the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, please visitaidsquiltuk.orgExplore more on these topicsTate ModernAids and HIVTextile artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are alwaystedious.Go and cry about it in your man cave, you manspreading mansplainer.See? It’sa cheap andlazy rhetorical device.Yes, but mankeeping is a real thing: men don’t mankeep; women mankeep.How so?Increasingly, the dynamic in a heterosexual relationship seems to be that a woman is tasked with coaching her partner through his problems.I don’t understand.A whole generation of men don’t feel comfortable opening up to their male friends, which means some of them dump their worries on their female partner. It’s an extension of emotional labour – remembering birthdays, organising social calendars – but effectively it requires the partner to act as an unpaid therapist.Why?TheStanford researcherswho coined the term think it’s a result of the so-calledmale loneliness epidemic. As the social circle of men continues to shrink, their partners bear the brunt of everything that has historically been shared among friends, colleagues and acquaintances.It’s sweet that you think this is a new phenomenon.OK, fine, some men have always been lousy at this sort of thing. But this is the first time that women are starting to unionise against it.How?Many of them have stopped dating. In the US, only 38% of single women are on the dating market, compared with 61% of single men, according to thePew Research Center.But that will just make men more lonely, which will only exacerbate the problem.Right. The only way to solve this problem is to make women have sex with undesirable men.Way to go, Gilead.So, what, men should work on themselves instead?Bingo.

So I’m proud the album is an outsider classic – but feel depressed these songs are still relevant’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 16 Jun 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareJon King, singer, songwriterI grew up in a really boring village in Kent, so moving to Leeds as a student was thrilling. It was an A-list place to see gigs. On the other hand, the buildings were as black as soot, the Yorkshire Ripper was around and you could feel the tension between the National Front and the south Asian community. I saw swastikas on walls and on an anti-NF march I was hit with a truncheon by a mounted police officer. So I gradually came up with the modest ambition to change the world.I had knownAndy Gill, our guitarist, since primary school. We were like brothers but also chalk and cheese. Musically, the four of us in the band never let each other off the hook – which sometimes resulted in actual fights. That tension fed the music. Andy wasn’t a trained guitarist but had this genius way of flicking his fingers and stabbing at the instrument like it was his personal enemy, which would become hugely influential. We’d started as a knock-off Dr Feelgood, but once we came up with Love Like Anthrax we realised we had to dump all the other songs and write more like that. Then Damaged Goods opened the floodgates – we brought funk to punk.We lived on a houseboat and would get pissed with UK Subs. I’m still amazed nobody drownedThe songs on our debut album Entertainment! took a microscope to society. 5.45 – on which I sing, “How can I sit and eat my tea with all that blood flowing from the television?” – was about the evening news. Every household had been sent a “Protect and survive” pamphlet because of the threat of nuclear war: Guns Before Butter tapped into that paranoia. At Home He’s a Tourist came from the Jean-Paul Sartre-type idea that the defining sensation of modern life is to feel uncomfortable. Then our bandmates Dave Allen and Hugo Burnham had the hilarious idea of making it a disco song, because we all loved Chic. It charted at No 58, but because we refused to change the word “rubbers” (or condoms) to “rubbish”, the BBC wouldn’t allow us on Top of the Pops.Entertainment! was recorded with no effects, so at the playback the record company thought it was a demo. But over the years it has inspired so many musicians, from Kurt Cobain and REM to Run the Jewels and Frank Ocean. Whenever we play the songs now, I’m almost depressed that they’re still relevant, but I’m proud that Entertainment! has become an outsider classic. Nobody makes a record like that for the money.Hugo Burnham, drumsI was an English literature and theatre student playing in the rugby team but I realised I was never going to meet girls standing on tables singing songs with my trousers round my ankles. I gravitated to university clubs such as the Funk Society and met cooler people like Jon and Andy, who weren’t wearing flares. Dave had moved to Leeds from Cumbria to find a band. He was the only real musician among us.We fought about everything from the music to the price of Mars bars but laughed about everything else. We started off rehearsing in a smelly basement in a Victorian building surrounded by mannequins. ThenGang of Four, the Mekons and Delta 5 became a collective who shared rehearsal space and drank together in the Fenton pub. Buzzcocks let us support them and took us on tour in Europe, so we became a spectacular performing band, bashing into each other on stage. All the labels were desperate to sign their version of the Clash but we signed to EMI for the least money because they gave us full creative control.View image in fullscreen‘We fought about everything’ … the band in 1979.Photograph: Virginia Turbett/RedfernsAndy Gill: genius guitarist who burned a route out of punk | Alexis PetridisRead moreWe recorded Entertainment! in Workhouse studio in London, where Ian Dury had recorded New Boots and Panties!!, which we’d all loved. Between sessions we lived on a houseboat and would get pissedwith a churn of people including Charlie Harper from UK Subs. I’m still amazed nobody drowned. We recorded without click tracks and didn’t do many overdubs. The studio engineer hated us and every time Dave or I made a mistake, he made us do it all again, but the finished album sounds gritty and raw, simple but funky.

Here was my chance to have all my symptoms blitzed by the best cures medical science andTikTokhad to offer. Sadly, it didn’t quite work like that.For starters, I had to give up my daily pill (second-generation antihistamineAllevia, which works fairly well) to test supposed alternatives (such as local honey, which did not work for me). I wanted to give each purported panacea a fair shot, so I had to go in with eyes streaming and nose a-blazing.Walks in the woodsView image in fullscreenA Hepa filter mask did little to stop the sneezes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIt got messy. I would always rather be in the woods, as I insist on stating at the end of all my articles, and I wasn’t about to let my break from Allevia put me off. Off I went each morning, my body’s histamine system ready to leap into completely OTT defence against deadly threats such as, oh, the common hazel tree. Hazel, of course, is not deadly. My body’s reaction to its pollen is like a chihuahua losing its furry little mind at the postman. Both overreactions are very real, very annoying and potentially physically debilitating.For one woodland walk, I wore a thickHepa filter maskthat I expected to be one of the most effective products in my test. I promptly sneezed into it. Long, soggy seconds passed as I untangled its Velcro fastenings from my hair and got the thing off my face so I could blow my nose. I won’t be donating that oneto charity.Perhaps good old (like, really old) first-generation antihistamines would be more effective? Diphenhydramine was developed in the 1940s to treat allergies and motion sickness, and today it’s the active ingredient in Nytol. Down the hatch it went, and down went my mood and energy. The zombie afternoons didn’t translate into well-slept nights. I’d wake up coughing, my throat dry from breathing through my mouth because my nose was inflamed (please do not try to picture this). Different anti-allergy drugs have different effects on different people, but Nytol won’t be going on my shopping list again.Highfalutin hayfever remediesView image in fullscreenThe MeacoClean air purifier proved a revelation.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianEven the best remedies brought their own problems. My bedroom became a bombsite of nasal sprays, eye drops, eucalyptus patches, special bedding, highfalutin vacuum cleaners and assorted air purifiers. I’d raised an eyebrow at the idea of an air purifier (great, another magic gadget), but theMeacoCleanproved a revelation, humming away quietly and helping to rid the air of allergens. It andHayMax barrier balmwere the two products that made me wonder whether I should bother going back to Allevia.Well, I did – not least because an air purifier isn’t much use in the woods. I really didn’t want to put “take a pill” at the top of my remedy league, and it’s probably not what the honey influencers andstinging nettle advocateswant you to hear. And hey, maybe they’ll work for you. But for me, a second-generation antihistamine remains the least bad symptom suppressant of the lot. Achoo.This week’s picksScared of shorts?

The priority should be the best palliative careMon 16 Jun 2025 12.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 12.45 EDTShareAs MPs prepare for the final decisive votes this Friday on one of the most consequential laws of our generation, an act that could determine a person’s right to live or die, they should take time to consider the fundamental flaws in the bill that have been exposed during the debates of recent months.For it has become clear that whatever views people hold on the principle, passing theterminally ill adults (end of life) billinto law would privilege the legal right to assisted dying without guaranteeing anything approaching an equivalent right to high-quality palliative care for those close to death.I understand the often-cited case for assisted dying – that we should not deny terminally ill people the freedom to choose. But there is no effective freedom to choose if the alternative option, the freedom to draw on high-quality end-of-life care, is not available. Neither is there real freedom to choose if, as many fear, patients will feel under pressure to relieve their relatives of the burden of caring for them, a form of coercion that prioritising good end-of-life care would diminish.Every year, more than600,000 peopledie in the UK. It is estimated that between 75% and 90% of them should have thebenefit of palliative care, and that100,000 terminally ill peopledo not receive the palliative care that they need. The charity Cecily Saunders International estimates that demand for this type of care isexpected to rise by 42%by 2040.Access to such care is perhaps the country’s worst and least defensible “postcode lottery”, a person’s fate depending on whether there is hospice help nearby and whether places or home care are available.Delaying legislating until the recommendations of the recentcommission on end-of-life care– drawn up by MPs, doctors and charities, who propose guaranteeing new rights to and resources for those seeking palliative support – are incorporated into our NHS would begin to end the imbalance between the right to assistance in dying over the right of the dying to assistance in living. For at one and the same time, the bill removes the need forfinal judicial approvalfor legalised dying, while it contains no equivalent measures to make it easier for hard-pressed hospices to obtain the resources that would guarantee high-quality care. In fact, inpolling carried outin November last year by Focaldata for the campaign group Care not Killing, a big majority – 66% – of respondents agreed that “the government shouldsort out palliative and social care first before considering legalising assisted suicide”.Better end-of-life care is surely the priority. Last year Hospice UK, which represents more than 200 hospices, said thatone in fivewere warning of cuts to services, and this year the position seems worse. Just last month, for example, theKirkwood hospice in Huddersfieldannounced it has been forced to cut its beds from 16 to 12, as well as reducing home support, with the result it will serve 800 fewer patients each year. This is now a pattern – fromSt Giles in Lichfield,St Catherine’s in Crawley, toBirmingham HospiceandHospiscare in Exeter. Late last year, Hospice UK estimated that300 beds in England are out of usebecause of insufficient funding. And with integrated care boards required to manage their expenditure within funding constraints set nationally, only about60% of NHShospitals provide seven-day on-site specialist palliative care, and only athird of localitieshave out-of-hours access.We don’t yet know whether, and for whom, the government will be prepared to cover 100% of the costs of assisted dying. What we do know, however, is that, on average, a hospice patient ispublicly funded for barely a thirdof his or her costs. And so MPs are being asked to pass a bill in the full knowledge that, whenever it is implemented, the services available to all those who would prefer assisted living to assisted dying are inadequate. “The lack of a cohesive national strategy for effective palliative care delivery has resulted in fragmentation of specialist palliative care services,” said therecently publishedcommission on end-of-life care, “with inequity of provision, confusion over who takes responsibility for each patient, and lack of advice and support to the public and to staff in all services.”If the bill were to go through, anyone who was terminally ill might be faced with a dilemma: they could exercise the right to apply to die under the legislation by referring to two doctors and an expert panel, but they might continue to find it difficult to exercise their right to access quality end-of-life care. While I could apply directly to the proposed new panel to enforce my right to die, the process if denied quality palliative care is difficult and complex. I would first have to file a complaint with the healthcare provider – for example to the patient advice and liaison service for hospitals, or a localised complaint process for primary care. Once this process was exhausted, I would then have to ask my MP to make an application to theparliamentary and health service ombudsman(PHSO), whose website says that the current waiting time is seven months – and that would be before a caseworker was assigned, which also takes months, delaying still further the time before what should be an urgent judgment could be made.I understand the pressure on MPs from those who are in desperate pain, and who want relief that is not currently available to them. But as the palliative and end-of-life care commission’srecently publishedreport tells us, pain relief is becoming possible for almost every terminal illness and the government should make it a medical imperative to ensure this will continue to improve.I also understand that MPs will be advised by many that the sum of their responsibilities is the avoidance of unnecessary harm. But irrespective of whether you see life as a gift, and notwithstanding any religious convictions or the lack of them, an MP’s personal preferences cannot be separated off from the duties they have as members of a community to ensure that the way we treat the dying reflects the values of a decent, compassionate country. That should mean upholding the role of the medical professions as care-givers, and exclusively care-givers; avoiding the possibility of private profiteering by legal-medical consortiums which might well commercialise assisted dying as a lucrative business; safeguarding vulnerable people about whose fate the royal medical colleges have all expressed concern; preventing unacceptable coercive pressures that can be brought to bear on disabled people, and those who are incapacitated or mentally stressed; and thus showing that as a society we value life above death.These concerns can be best addressed by speedily implementing the report of the end-of-life care commission. For none of our obligations to each other are well served if our laws focus on the few who wish for assisted dying and do too little to support the majority of those facing their final days who want – and deserve – access to the best of palliative care.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just don’t call it menswearMon 16 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 14.55 EDTShareIt’s a month until my wedding, and my suit has arrived in the post, unceremoniously crammed into a plastic postage bag. I wasn’t expecting it to come from China, but China is of course where things come from. Unbagging the crinkled jacket and trousers for my supposed Big Day felt a little deflating.Although I’m not sure what Ididhave in mind. I’ve never fantasised about getting married. As a gay woman, this wasn’t even an option for me until 2013. In fact, the closest I ever came to daydreaming about this occasion was when I was around four and I’d inferred from Disney movies that “getting married” was the act of a prince ballroom dancing with a princess. The dancing was neither here nor there, but I knew I wanted to be the prince.There wasn’t a single a-ha moment when I twigged that feminine clothes made me feel like the world’s most reluctant drag queen (a drag peasant?), but gradually I embraced being butch. Andcasualbutch I can do – wearingCarhartt, Finisterre, even M&S menswear for that middle-aged dad look.Then it comes to formalwear. Not that “formal” was what I had in mind aesthetically for the wedding (so far it’s looking more like a very slightly upmarket children’s birthday party). But turning up on the day dressed like a contractor feels like a tantrum, and there’s no small part of me that wants to look nice, whatever that means. I settled on the idea of a suit: something classic and well tailored.In women’s sections of high-street shops, lurid blazers with flouncy embellishments seem to whisper to each other about me, like a pack of vicious teen girls who only found out what a lesbian is by watching a controversial episode of their favourite soap. After several trips like this, I hadn’t tried anything on, and bespoke women’s suits from some of the beautiful female tailors of Savile Row are financially out of the question.It’s surprising to me how stressed I’ve become about looking good on my wedding day. But weddings get to you. No matter how much of a non-wedding wedding you think you’re having, it’s still … a wedding. While doing my utmost to queer the term “bridezilla”, I’m just a woman looking for a suit that doesn’t make me look like a member of the shadow cabinet.When the desperation hit after another three hours’ Googling variations on “women’s suit wedding androgynous”, I finally submitted to the eerie siren song of a site claiming to make affordable bespoke suits. With its slick UX and promise to solve an issue that had now been consuming me for months, I was sold. I designed my perfect suit – dark navy, streamlined and flattering without any frills – added it to my cart and entered my card details in a trance.A month later my AI-generated, SEO-advertised, Shein-era bag of “what did youthinkyou were getting?” flew in from Shanghai. I’d thought I was ordering it from a Europe-based company, but the item had been “dropshipped”, sent directly from the manufacturer rather than the e-commerce retailer I bought it from. The jacket was at least five inches longer than what I thought I’d ordered, and putting it on felt a little bit like trying on one of my dad’s blazers as a kid.The suit looked better after having been left to hang for 24 hours, but marriage material it is not. After a brief identity crisis in which I wondered whether my gender expression might be “scam victim”, I managed to override a lifetime’s worth of social conditioning and enter a full-on menswear store. I’d been drawn to the brand, Percival, since it released a Seinfeld-inspired collection. Even if I’m waymore of a Georgethan a Kramer. The moment I walked through the door, I also managed to find a near-perfect outfit. Which turned out to be a green linen suit – exactly the same one that was worn bySadiq Khanlast year. My partner tried to console me on this matter by reminding me that “wedidvote for him”.Yes, I’ll be taking my Sadiq suit to a tailor to shorten the arms and bring in the shoulders. No drastic alterations, though. Even if you have boobs, I’ve learned, the term “menswear” should be consigned to the past, along with bathroom carpeting and lobotomies. While we’re at it, bring on the grooms in white dresses.Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and DivaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When it’s convenient – when the whole world is pulsing with revulsion, for example – they begin to reveal flavors of the truth.TheBiden administrationlied more than most, its public-facing members particularly. Its policy in Palestine was to embrace the Israelis in a “bear hug” – to smother them with love. And there’s thin cover for a genocide beyond lies.Now, Matthew Miller, the former state department spokesperson, is speaking out. It appears he has a new job – one that seems to require public-facing work, which may explain his decision to sit for a Sky Newsinterview. You take your lumps and get it over with. Only I’m not sure it’s over for Miller.I call on the UK to join the world majority – and recognise the state of Palestine | Husam ZomlotRead moreIn the interview, the former spokesman shared his personal view that it is “without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes”. Asked why he had not said this when he was employed by the government, he replied: “When you’re at the podium, you’re not expressing your personal opinion. You’re expressing the conclusions of the United States government.”Miller isn’t alone. The Biden-era spokespeople for the genocide included the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, and the deputy state department spokesperson Vedant Patel, as well as Jake Sullivan, a primarypolicymakerfor an addled president, who represented the actual center of power along with John Kirby, a former admiral, and Antony Blinken, the former secretary of state. The group spent the period from October 2023 to January 2025 lying to an anguished public. They lied scornfully (Jean-Pierre) or gleefully (Miller), mawkishly (Kirby and Blinken), or blandly (Patel and Sullivan). And they did it every day, for 15 months.They told extravagant lies: Hamasbeheaded40 babies. They told savageliesabout “command and control” centers under al-Shifa hospital – they told us not to believe what we’d seen and to believe what theycouldn’tshow us. They lied about Israeliinvestigationsand Biden’shumanity, his capacity for “empathy”. Every lie they told was consequential, about infants inincubators; about the execution ofHind Rajab, a child; and about thewayin which their pierwas usedto facilitate an Israeli massacre.They lied about the things that matter most. They lied to obscure a genocide, spinning whorls of confusion.In the Sky News interview, Miller twitched visibly just before he made the remarks about war crimes. Watching him, I wondered what had happened to his confidence, the brazen and unembarrassed way in which he skipped, lightly, through so much human carnage, whistling past Gaza’s profusion of mass graves.And yet, despite himself, the former spokesperson continues to lie. He claims to not know if what the Biden administration has orchestrated in Gaza is a genocide, perhaps to shield himself from the worst of the moral reckoning. The tactic he’s taken is a tired one, and the interview is self-indulgent.But at least Miller is braver than the others. In avideorecorded at Harvard’s Kennedy School, which is where both Brett McGurk, who also helpedorchestratethe genocide, and Jake Sullivan have taken jobs, Sullivan meekly, dishonestly describes “the choices the president made”.The choices the president made.It all brings to mind the former secretary of defense Robert McNamara’s book, In Retrospect, a self-exculpatory account of his participation in the Vietnam war. Two million civilians were killed in that conflict, which achieved nothing, and was fought for nothing. And yet, McNamara waited 20 years to publish that account, long after many of his victims had died.So with that retrospective, we may encourage Sullivan, Miller, McGurk, Jean-Pierre, Blinken, Patel and all the others to come forward. If they do, they will be pilloried and mocked and verbally abused for what they’ve done.But they should do it anyway, because they owe their victims so much. Not least the truth.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceThis article was amended on 16 June 2025. An earlier version included a quote from Matthew Miller on the role of political spokespeople that had been given in a more general context, rather than directly in response to being asked about alleged war crimes. In the latter response, now quoted from the same interview, he went on to say that “the United States government had not concluded that [Israel] committed war crimes [and] still have not concluded [that].”Explore more on these topicsBiden administrationOpinionIsrael-Gaza warGazaJoe BidenUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

For authoritarians, they have long been used as a tool to distract from or launder stains of human rights violations and corruption – a practice called “sportswashing”. Russia, which has atrack recordof violent repression and Qatar, notorious forlabor rights violations, each paidmillions in bribesto be able to host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022 respectively. “This is a new image of Russia that we now have,” Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, said after the tournament there.This summer, theFifa Club World Cuphas come to the United States – the event includes 32 of the most prominent soccer clubs in the world, and is a much-anticipated precursor to next year’s World Cup, hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada. The Trump administration, however, is not using the opportunity to manufacture a positive image of the country, but instead is using the events as a platform to amplify its emerging authoritarianism.In a now deleted post on X, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced that it would be “suited and booted” to attend the group stage matches in Miami. Even as CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) later clarified that they would be there as part of the event’s security team, a role they have played at similar events, Ice told NBC news that non-citizens attending shouldcarry their immigration papers. The declaration followed JD Vance joking that people are welcome to come to the 2026 World Cup, but “when time is up they’ll have to go home” or “talk to Kristi Noem”, the secretary of homeland security. The choice to stoke fear of raids at an international soccer event, a sport that is hugely popular among immigrants in the US, is part and parcel of this administration’s desire to brand itself as so powerful that it is accountable to no one.Borrowed culture and a plasticine burger – welcome to the Club World Cup and almost-football | Barney RonayRead moreThis intimidating language comes as the country is witnessing an escalation in raids, detentions and deportations conducted under Noem.

It comes asracial profiling is rampant, meaning that every person who looks like an immigrant to an Ice officer, every person of color regardless of citizenship, is subject to scrutiny.This is consistent with the US’s other actions on the world stage, including itswithdrawal fromthe United Nations human rights council, itssanctioningof the international criminal court for issuing arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, its participation in the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and itsposting of bizarre AI reelsto visualize turning the strip into a beach resort. This administration is one that flaunts its white supremacy, ending its refugee and asylum program for everyone except forwhite Afrikaaners. It seems to relish the opportunity for belligerent violations of human rights whether that’s arresting a mayorat an immigration detention center,forcibly removing and handcuffinga senator at a homeland security press conference, or refusing toreleaseMahmoud Khalil, despite a judge’s order.Last month, the leading human rights organization Human Rights Watch urged Fifa toreconsiderallowing the United States to host the World Cup citing “grave concerns” over the treatment of immigrants. Soon thereafter, a travel ban was ordered, denying entry to citizens of 12 largely Black and Muslim countries in the world, and restricting others – with an exception made for World Cup players.Fifa,notorious for turning a blind eye to authoritarians, made no attempt to hold this administration accountable. Trump’s anti-immigrant policies were known to Infantino when hehailed their “great friendship”, even adopting Trump’s pet phrase to “make the world great again” because “football – or soccer – unites the world.” When asked about the fears around Ice presence at the Club World Cup matches, Infantino said he had “no concerns about anything” except security.But ticket sales are slow, and there have been banks of empty seats at most matches so far. Just days before the kick-off of the opening match featuring Inter Miami’s own Lionel Messi, one of the biggest superstars in the world, students at local colleges were beingoffered ticketsfor as little as $20, buy one get four free. Perhaps some of this can be owed to the format of the event, which is new, or maybe even to soccer’s still growing popularity in the US. Intimidation, however, does not help ticket sales. Tourism nationwide isdown 9%, at a projected cost of over $8.6bn.Authoritarianism is only as powerful as our acquiescence. People within the country are beginning to mobilize. The Club World Cup began on the same weekend thatmillions of peopletook to the streets to participate in a “No Kings” rally. It follows powerful grassroots protests in Los Angeles to fight Ice’s kidnappings there.To hold these bullies accountable, we need the world to stand with us. No country should send their team to play when the citizens of 12 among them are banned. No person is safe when agents roam the country and its stadiums masked, asking people to show their papers based on the color of their skin. If what we’re witnessing is a precursor to the World Cup, then it has never been clearer that aboycott is necessary.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupcommentShareReuse this content"

One is that the response to 7 October 2023 was a break from the past. The attack by Hamas triggered an Israeli response so vengeful that it has been impossible to fit within the boundaries set by international laws or contain geographically – the genocide in Gaza, theinvasion of southern Lebanon, theoccupation of the buffer zonein southwestern Syria and airstrikes across that country, and now its attacks against Iran.Then there is the explanation that these events are part of a historical continuum. Regional peace was the result of a volatile status quo that was always vulnerable to disruption. It only looked tenable because it relied on a variety of factors that, working together, looked like a settlement. This fine balance has been tipped by an Israeli government that is now fixated on pursuing its own agenda, singlehandedly rewriting the future of the region in ways that it is unable to explain and unwilling to control.One of the elements of this brittle peace was the presence of the Gulf powers as mediators. Gulf rapprochement with Iran was not motivated by trade or fellow feeling, but rather the pragmatic need for stability. Some Gulf states also crossed a historic red line and either recognised Israel with thesigning of the Abraham accordsor began aprocess of normalisation. Now these countries find themselves caught between two feuding sides and at risk of alienating Israel’s main ally, the US, with whom it has close military and economic ties.The status quo also relied on suppressing Palestinian rights to a degree that everyone was happy with; everyone except the Palestinians, of course. In a sense, the Palestinian problem had also been neutralised. When the assault onGazabegan, it exposed Israel’s views and intentions to the world, raising the spectre of a new Nakba. It also brought Iran and its proxies, Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen, into play as defenders of Palestinian rights. Once Iran entered the frame, and Israel felt empowered to act without break or censure, there was no going back.Trump, Netanyahu and Khamenei – three angry old men who could get us all killed | Simon TisdallRead moreSomething else has snapped – justification for Israel’s actions has been stretched beyond plausibility. With the safety of Jewish people as the rationale for unbridled support, and Israel’s importance as a close partner in a strategic region, the US and other allies have provided carte blanche for the country to defend itself. But this relies on Israel responding to any threats in a proportional way, so as not to create further instability. Israel has not only responded inappropriately to threats, it has weaponised them to such an extent that it has become a primary factor in its own insecurity, and that of the rest of the region.Backing from allies also relies on transparency between the camps. The colossal military, economic and political cover is provided on the understanding that whoever is in charge of the Israeli government has no other motives for engaging in conflict other than securing safety for its citizens. Trust has been broken by the current prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, who is using the war to bolster public support for his own political career. He is not only making Israelis less safe, but further capitalising on that insecurity as he plays the role of protector.Relations with key allies were being put to the test over Gaza as public pressure from within western countries grew, fed by constant images of starving children, charred hospitals and row after row of body bags. By opening a new front and engaging another enemy, the Israeli government has a chance at both restoring the terms ofits pact with its sponsors, and the historical narrative that it is the victim, acting in irreproachable good faith. Here it is, once again in need of support, suffering strikes and civilian casualties at the hands of a belligerent neighbour.Stories of people dying of starvation in Gaza or of the hungry being killed while queueing for food, have fallen away from the headlines. The relentless assault on the West Bank and theexpansion of illegal settlementshas receded from view. The pressurethat was beginning to buildon Israel to let in more aid and honour a ceasefire has been replaced with thesame mealy-mouthed defencesthat we saw in the early days of the war in Gaza, plus the same pabulum of urging “restraint”. The clock is reset.Regarding the strikes on Iran, Israel appears to have drawn upon the lessons of the Iraq war, claiming it has acted in defence on the basis of intelligence that the world has to take on trust. How imminent was the threat? Who has the right to decide when a “pre-emptive strike” is justified? And who has the right to respond to an illegal unilateral attack? What we do know so far is that global politics is run on the basis of exceptions and different benchmarks of sovereignty. Yes, Iran hasviolated its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, but Israelrefused to sign up to them altogether.These distinctions in the past could be more easily smoothed over, because Israel and the US were “the good guys”, andIranwas part of an “axis of evil”. But the erosion of Israel’s and the US’s credibility as honest interlocutors, wise in their security considerations and compliant with international law, has made these campaigns less straightforward.Here is the real war that Israel is fighting. Iran still retains a measure of political will and military capability that is too high for comfort for Israel. And so as the window of Israeli credibility closes, it becomes more necessary for it to diminish Iran’s political credibility and military capabilities. But what is the endgame? Does Israel envisage a close-ended campaign, after which it retreats, satisfied with the results? Or is that not a plausible scenario, considering the counterstrikes it has provoked. It’s all looking very Gaza-like: escalation with no end; or regime change with no plan.Both Israel’s campaigns – the propaganda one and the one on the ground – share one thing: they regard the Middle East as a theatre for domestic politics, reputation management and experimentation in bringing about “safety” on yet-to-be-defined terms. But the region is not just Israel’s back yard. It is other people’s homes and they have their own politics, histories, populations and security needs that, increasingly, are subject to a country that has decided that only its own agenda matters.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.Explore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionIranGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

It was a disappointing, sad affairMoira DoneganThe uniformed soldiers marched irregularly, slightly off beat; the turnout was small and the crowd seemed defeatedMon 16 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 15.11 EDTShareIn one version of the story, you can blame the French. Evidently it was in France, watching the 2017 Bastille Day military parade alongside Emmanuel Macron at the outset of his first term, that Donald Trump initially got the idea to stage an armed spectacle in Washington DC in honor of himself. Back then, the military said no. In a now-famous anecdote, Gen Paul Selva, who grew up in Portugal under its integralist regime, told Trump that such parades are “what dictators do”. James Mattis, his then-secretary of defense, reportedly revolted against the idea, saying he would “rather swallow acid”. Trump never got his parade.Until now. Restored to power after an interregnum in which all American institutions failed to hold him accountable for his crimes and abuses, Trump has now set about a second term in which he is pursuing vengeance against his perceived enemies, using his office to enrich himself, and indulging all the impulses that were checked by his staffers and advisers back when anyone serious still worked for him.Having stuffed the military and defense department leadership exclusively with sycophants and incompetents, Trump is now surrounded exclusively by the kind of people he likes best: people who can’t see any reason not to give him whatever he wants. On Saturday, they gave him a military parade for his birthday, complete with tanks, missiles, airplanes overhead and parachutists. A band sang Happy Birthday. The spectacle was mostly paid for by taxpayers, but there were corporate sponsorships, too – among them the Thiel-backed venture Palantir, and the crypto exchange Coinbase.If Trump was expecting a display of pomp and pride that rivaled his own egotism, he may have been disappointed. The parade, as it turned out, was something of a disappointing affair. The uniformed soldiers marched irregularly, slightly off beat; the turnout was small and the crowd seemed defeated, low-energy, a bit wilted and unenthused after spending hours in DC’s brutal summer humidity. It rained. It was all a great contrast to the large-scale protests that had exploded across the country earlier that day, with millions taking to the streets in jubilant displays under the banner “No Kings”.1:50Tens of thousands rally against Trump across the US - videoIn one, big crowds expressed opposition to Trump’s vision of America, and offered instead a colorful hope for equality and the dignity of self-government. In the other, a desultory group of soldiers trooped through what looked like a mostly empty city – DC had been largely blocked off, in no small part to prevent the protesters from clashing with the military parade and possibly creating a Tiananmen Square-style visual. The soldiers popped up from their tanks and waved wearily to a smattering of onlookers. Once in a while, the bored-looking president roused himself to his feet and delivered a flaccid salute.Trump coveted a military spectacle but his parade proved underwhelming: ‘Just kind of lame’Read moreThis wasn’t what Trump was hoping for. Nominally, the event was meant to mark the US army’s 250th anniversary. But no one really believes that that was the reason for the parade. Instead, the event marked Trump’s 79th birthday, and was meant both to celebrate his seizure of power and underscore his determination to quash dissent. The armed forces were used as an ornament to his ego and a threat to his enemies.As Trump has illegally seized control of the California national guard, deployed the marines to Los Angeles, disappeared dissidents, crammed migrants into internment camps with atrocious conditions, and had his underlings rough up opposition leaders, the military parade was meant to celebrate his successful pursuit of his dictatorial ambitions, to emphasize the solidity and fearsomeness of his rule, and to remind onlookers that those who oppose him can be met with violence.All of Trump’s fearsome power and ambition, however, was complicated, in the scenes from the parade, by how obscenely on the nose it all was. Trump clearly wants to be a dictator, and major forces in American politics are helping him become one. But more than wanting to simply be a dictator, Trump also wants to play a dictator on TV.He is playing to type now, with his military parade, and the type is authoritarianTrump has always reinforced his politics with an aesthetic: his gilded Trump Tower apartment signifying his wealth, his bouffantish combover and long red ties signifying his winking vulgarity, his love of fast food signifying a declasse self-indulgence.He is playing to type now, with his military parade, and the type is authoritarian. With his display of power and authority – with the military used as a prop to demonstrate his love of violence and indifference to the constitution – Trump is imitating himself, seeming to cast one eye to the viewer for their reaction. He seems to imagine, always, what his next line would be in the sitcom – a bit like the mobsters on The Sopranos, who modeled themselves self-consciously off of characters in The Godfather and Goodfellas. He’s thinking less of what he wants to do, less of what his true interests or impulses are, and more of what someone like him, a dictator, should be doing.In this way, though it has become easy to fear and hate Trump, it has always remained a bit hard to take him seriously: he is a simulacrum of a strongman dictator, doing the things he has seen strongmen dictators do on TV. It can feel buffoonish, this self-referentiality; it implies a lack of spontaneity, a sense that perhaps, if he needs to prove his own power so badly, Trump might not actually believe in it. But perhaps this is another lesson of our age, the one in which irony and sincerity have collapsed, and in which the dictator tries, with evident effort, to hit his marks on the screen: just because he’s faking it, doesn’t mean it’s not the real thing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

All child sexual abuse is horrifying. But the extreme sexual violence and financial incentives involved in gang-based offending demand special scrutiny. So do the institutional failures by police and councils, particularly in northern England, where numerous gangs operated.Past inquiries have exposed these institutional breakdowns. They have also shown that a reluctance to inflame racial tensions played a role in the way that some complaints were mishandled. That doesn’t excuse the inaction – nor justify turning a public safety issue into a culture war.It is arguable that the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse was too broad, while implementation of its recommendations has been too slow. Given such deficiencies, it was right that the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, apologised to victims on Monday. The National Crime Agency’s new role in investigating CSE gangs, known as grooming gangs, is a positive step. But the hundreds of convictions already secured by local police – including acase that concluded in Manchesterlast week – must not be overlooked.Sir Keir Starmer may struggle to live down his assertion that calls for an inquiry emanated from a “far‑right bandwagon”. But he is right that far-right voices exploit this issue. In the context ofmob violence in Ballymena, and last year’s English riots following the Southport murders, it is not wrong to be anxious about community cohesion.Group-based child sexual abuse is a small fraction of child sexual abuse overall (5.4% of the total number of contact offences in 2023). The CSE gangs that the new inquiry will look at are one subset of that – along with familial and institutional groups. In 2023,83% of recorded group-based offenceswere committed by white men. While Lady Casey’s report noted thatPakistani-heritage men were overrepresented in some areas, it also said more robust data was needed at a national level.Elon Musk’s sudden interest in the subject propelled these gangs into news headlines at the start of this year. But social media platforms such as Mr Musk’s are themselves increasingly implicated in the abuse of women and girls. The making and sharing of pornographic images have been a factor in grooming gang cases, while the risks fromAI and virtual-reality spacesare rapidly growing. Along with the new inquiry, ministers must be pushed to crack down on these new threats.Labour’s manifesto pledge toreduce violence against women and girls by 50%was based on an understanding that this is an area of chronic failure. Along with online harms, the situation in the courts is dire after deep cuts to justice budgets. And while years of underinvestment cannot be rectified overnight, it is dismaying that this pledge appears to be a low priority. Apart from a fewpilot schemes, the government has little to show for its first year in office. An updated strategy has not been published, and last week’s spending review announcements do not give the Home Office much room to innovate.The new child sexual exploitation inquiry should deliver meaningful findings, particularly if an overly drawn-out process is avoided, as Lady Casey recommends. But a Labour government ought to take a more comprehensive approach to the safety of women and girls.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Mr Trump backed down after the generalwarnedthat attacking Iran would start a war, with the risk of US officials being “tried as war criminals in The Hague”.Five years on, Israel’s prime minister has thefight with Tehranthat he has spent decades preparing for, bolstered by Mr Trump’s claims thatinternational lawno longer applies. After all, why worry about red lines when The Hague’s already got a warrant out for you and your alliespretendnot to notice? It helps when the US treats the international criminal court like a rogue actor. Mr Trump has even gone after the court’sjudgesand prosecutor for daring to scrutinise “our close ally” Israel over Gaza. Legal norms? Apparently, those are for enemies, not friends.As the UN charter is typically interpreted, the use of force is allowed against an actual or imminent attack in self-defence – but it must be necessary and proportionate. With Mr Netanyahu’s expanding aims –regime change, strikes onenergyinfrastructure and bombingresidentialareas – the action no longer even pretends to be self-defence. In response, Iran has launched10 wavesof ballistic missiles, killing Israeli civilians and targeting its oil and gas facilities.Israel justifies its actions by saying Tehran ispreparingto build a nuclear bomb. If true, Israel knows more than both theUS and the UN’s nuclear watchdog. The International Atomic Energy Agency’sfindingof a safeguards breach has political weight, but no legal bite. YetIsrael– still the region’s only nuclear power, undeclared and outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – is bombing Iran to stop it from doing what it never admitted to doing itself.Mr Netanyahu lacks thebunker-busting bombsand bombers needed to seriously damage Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites. So the strategy may be to hit hard enough to force Iran into submission – or to provoke abacklashbig enough to drag Mr Trump in. Either way, it’s a strategy that relies less on deterrence than on provocation.Israel’s impunity sets a dangerous precedent, where the strong act as they please and the weak suffer the consequences – convention and law be damned. But Mr Netanyahu may have felt his options were narrowing. Troublingly for him, Iran had signalled unprecedentedconcessionsduring talks with Mr Trump. Whether from weakness or calculation, that opening was real. The prospect of an Iran-US nuclear deal that permitted Tehranlimited uranium enrichmentunder strict monitoring may have been too much for Mr Netanyahu.Ever the opportunist, the Israeli prime minister seized the moment. Tehran’s allyHezbollahwas neutralised, Iran’s air defences crippled and Iran’s partner Bashar al-Assad had fled Syria – opening a “corridor” for airstrikes. With UScoordination secured, Israel’s military struck. The bonus for Mr Netanyahu was that he received a political domestic boost just as his coalition threatened tounravel.If the fighting escalates, things could spiral out of control, perhaps with civil war in Iran or aglobal economic shock. Better to trade words than missiles,thinks Tehran. If the US and Iran pursue realistic goals, a verifiable non-proliferationdealis within reach. As ever, jaw‑jaw is better than war-war.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Mercedes-Benz Stadium can hold crowds of 75,000 but staging this match at 3pm on a Monday afternoon was probably not the wisest scheduling move.Chelsea 2-0 LAFC: Club World Cup – as it happenedRead moreVast sections were empty, the upper tiers were shut and Enzo Maresca probably summed it up best by noting that it was not easy forChelseato play in such a “strange environment”.It is embarrassing for Fifa given that Atlanta is not a place where football usually suffers from a lack of attention. This is the self-styled epicentre of soccer in the US, so much so that the new national training centre is being built on a 200-acre site near the city, but few locals seemed aware that this game was taking place.News of ticket prices tumbling in the hours before kick-off said a lot. After all Atlanta United, who play their Major League Soccer fixtures here, averaged attendances close to 45,000 last season; Chelsea also pulled in over 70,000 fans when they played Newcastle United in a pre-season friendly here two years ago.But perhaps the lack of interest was not a surprise. Chelsea versus Newcastle is one thing; Chelsea versus limited MLS opposition from the other side of the country does not quite have the same appeal. LAFC had familiar faces in Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud but Steve Cherundolo’s side were only taking part because of Club León being kicked out due to a breach of Fifa’s multi-club regulations.View image in fullscreenThere were plenty of empty seats at a ground that can hold 75,000.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesChelsea, on the other hand, will play in the Champions League next season, have the advantage of Premier League riches and are full of confidence afterwinning the Uefa Conference Leaguelast month. They have spent big and have added competition for places in attack after signing Delap from Ipswich for the bargain price of £30m. Delap has shown that he means business by taking the No 9 shirt. The 22-year-old has been signed to score goals but he can also make them.He was in bustling form after being thrown on midway through the second half and earned an assist when he crossed for another Chelsea substitute, Enzo Fernández, to kill off LAFC’s slim hopes of snatching a point with 11 minutes left. It was encouraging for Maresca to see his strikers gearing up for a battle to earn a starting spot.It was clear that Nicolas Jackson needed more support last season. Chelsea were not the same side when Jackson was unavailable and should think twice if they have any plans to sell the Senegal forward, whose blend of pace, power and intelligent link-up play proved far too much for LAFC’s to handle during a lopsided first half.True, the 23-year-old’s finishing can be frustrating. Yet while Jackson missed a good headed chance in the second half, he still managed to catch the eye by dropping deep to set up Chelsea’s opener by spraying a reverse pass down the right for Pedro Neto to cut inside, move on to his left foot and slam a low shot inside Lloris’s near post.“I am quite curious to see how Nico deals with competition,” Maresca said. “Hopefully both strikers can score goals and assist. We had two or three months last season without Nico and Marc Guiu. It is a nice feeling for a manager to have two strikers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reece James and Roméo Lavia need to be managed carefully and were replaced by Fernández and Malo Gusto at half-time.Chelsea, who face Flamengo in Philadelphia on Friday, improved when Delap came on. He troubled LAFC with his powerful running, barrelling down the right and almost finding Fernández. Neto then set up Cole Palmer, who shot wastefully over.It was over when Delap picked out a late run from Fernández, who converted from close range. There was concern when Moisés Caicedo went down with cramp. Perhaps the fact that clubs can pocket $2m (£1.47m) through group-stage victories will make the pain easier to ignore.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupChelseaLos Angeles FCmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They were also major TV stars in Norway thanks to the docuseries Team Ingebrigtsen, where they appeared alongside their coach and father, Gjert.Jakob Ingebrigtsen’s father found guilty of hitting his daughter but cleared of abusing Olympic championRead moreGjert, whose manner could make an army drill sergeant sound touchy-feely, outlined his philosophy early in series one. “I don’t want to be an angry man, I want to be a father,” he said. “But if being an angry man brings them their dreams I will tolerate what I am missing.”But on that day in 2022, Gjert’s anger went too far. It led to him striking his daughter with a wet towel, his sons to ditch and denounce him, and to a courthouse in Sandnes, Norway where he stood trial for physically and mentally abusing Jakob and Ingrid.Amid tense court scenes in March this year, Gjert explained what he felt had happened. “She’s really angry and says: ‘I fucking don’t want to be in this prison of yours any more,’ while holding her index finger at me.“I pull the towel against her finger twice in quick succession. She then says: ‘What the hell are you doing, are you hitting me?’ To which I reply: ‘I didn’t hit you.’”Ingrid’s testimony, though, told a different story.“I had been so depressed and ignored for several months, I simply felt bullied,” she said. “I pushed his finger away. He had a small towel that he had been sweating in, so it was wet. He whipped it at my face. First once without hitting. Then he did it once more, and then he hit me on the cheek.”After a month of deliberations, the courtissued its 31-page verdicton Monday. And when it came to the wet-towel incident it was unequivocal. “There is no doubt that the defendant acted intentionally.”The court noted that Ingrid had fled to her brother Henrik’s home and that his wife, Liva, had taken a photograph of a red mark across Ingrid’s face.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in court during his father’s trial.Photograph: Lise Åserud/EPA“Ingrid’s explanation is significantly strengthened by other evidence,” the court said. “She left the house and moved out. The defendant, in turn, sent her a message the next day in which he strongly regretted the incident, emphasising that he needed help and that he wanted to see a doctor and psychologist.“The court therefore assumes as proven beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant hit Ingrid in the face with a blow with a small and damp towel.”As a result of his actions, Gjert received a 15-day suspended sentence and was ordered to pay his daughter £744. Yet when the verdict was announced on Monday his reaction was one of “relief”, according to one of his attorneys, Heidi Reisvang.Why? Because when it came to every other allegation against him, the prosecution was unable to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.The court accepted that Jakob and Ingrid’s evidence had often been “credible”. However, it said that in many instances it was impossible to know the truth when Gjert, his wife, Tone, or one brother, Martin, had one view of an incident – while Jakob, Ingrid and the other siblings had another.Jakob, for instance, told the court that he had been punched “many times” by his father when he was eight, after receiving a negative report about his behaviour from school.The incident was confirmed by Filip, who was said to have observed it from an adjacent room. However, Martin said that his father had only grabbed Jakob and held him against the wall while he yelled. According to the ruling, memories could have been distorted by time – and antipathy.Jakob Ingebrigtsen tells court of father’s physical abuse in testimonyRead moreSome of the allegations, though, were dismissed by the court. It ruled that Jakob’s claims to have been knocked off his scooter and kicked in the stomach by his father in front of witnesses were “incomprehensible”, suggesting that someone would have surely reacted to a little boy being attacked.It also dismissed prosecutors’ claims the Ingebrigtsen household had been “characterised by continuous insecurity and fear of violence” between 2008 and 2018. While it acknowledged Gjert was sometimes angry, it said it was “difficult to reconcile” the allegation with testimony from family friends, athletes and TV crews.The court also pointed to a heated 30-minute argument between Gjert and Jakob at a training camp in St Moritz in 2019, which was recorded by Henrik without his father’s consent and later played in court, as evidence that Jakob was no shrinking violet.The judges described it as “loud and rather pointless”, but added: “It must be emphasised that Jakob shows no sign of fear or submission towards the defendant. He stands his ground and retaliates against the defendant’s verbal abuse.”So what might happen now? Speaking after the verdict, Reisvang held out hope that this great schism could be mended. “As Gjert said during the trial, he wants to reconcile with his family, and he hopes that he will have a relationship with them at some point,” she said. “That hasn’t changed.”Jakob’s reaction to the ruling came only via an Instagram post of a picture of his daughter, Filippa, which appeared to suggest hell might freeze over first.“I will always be there for her if she needs a hug,” he wrote. “I will cheer for her, whatever choice she makes (except if she steals my 911 GT3 RS). I will give her space if space is what she asks for. And I will love and respect her unconditionally (even if she steals my 911 GT3 RS)!”It was a promise that was touching and pointed. But while it spoke of looking to the future, you suspect there are scars here that will never disappear.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old Ekitike has scored 19 goals in 47 Bundesliga appearances for Frankfurt, having initially been loaned to the German club in February 2024. The Frenchman subsequently signed a five-year deal for around £14m last April. The France Under-21 international has a total of 50 strikes in 151 career games.Tottenham seal Mathys Tel move permanent with £30m transfer feeRead moreBournemouth have signed the France left-backAdrien Truffertfrom Rennes on a five-year contract. The 23-year-old’s arrival paves the way forMilos Kerkez,a Liverpool target, to leave.Truffert, who captained Rennes, told Bournemouth’s website: “It’s a dream for any player to play in the Premier League. It’s one of the best and most competitive leagues in the world. I’m looking forward to testing myself at this level, facing top players every week and helping the team achieve great things.”Truffert, born in Belgium, won his sole France cap as a substitute in a2-0 Nations League defeat by Denmarkin September 2022. He played for France’s Under-23 team at the 2024 Olympics, helping them finish as runners-up, and scored nine goals in 191 appearances for Rennes. The deal was announced on the day the transfer window reopened after an earlierClub World Cup‑relatedopportunity to make signings. The window will close on Monday 1 September.Leeds fear thatJaka Bijol’s mooted move to Elland Road could be hijacked. The 26-year-old Udinese and Slovenia centre-half is very close to signing for Daniel Farke’s promoted team but late interest from other clubs, notably Newcastle and Milan, may place that £17m deal in peril.Bijol, though predominantly right-sided, is two-footed and has the sort of high-calibre passing range that betrays his origins as a defensive midfielder. Throw in his aerial ability and controlled aggression and it is easy to understand why the former CSKA Moscow player, who faced England at Euro 2024, is so admired by Farke.View image in fullscreenSlovenia defender Jaka Bijol is a target for Leeds and Newcastle.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APEddie Howe, Newcastle’s manager, is also seeking a right‑sided, ball-playing central defender to compete for that berth with Fabian Schär.

The champagne is on ice, a variety of crustaceans have been plucked from the seabed and transported to Berkshire and the famous grey horses that lead the royal procession are ready to be harnessed. The most valuable, historic and glamorous show on turf is good to go.So it was a little jarring, to say the least, to spend an hour on Monday lunchtime in the company of assorted heavy-hitters from the racing industry and a pair of racing-friendly MPs from either side of the House, hearing warnings of a “triple whammy of challenges” that, according to a report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Racing and Bloodstock which was published on Monday, “present no less than an existential threat to the sport”.Hollie Doyle: ‘I just want to be the best jockey – I don’t compare myself to female riders’Read moreJohn Gosden, who will saddle the hot favourite Field Of Gold in Tuesday’s St James’s Palace Stakes, the feature event on Royal Ascot’s opening day, was among them. There were almost certainly things he would rather have been doing on the eve of the biggest meeting of the year, but he was keen to voice his support for the findings of the report, entitled Securing Racing’s Future: The Threat to British Horseracing.“We are liable to be actually brought down by this,” Gosden said. “Here, we have a gene pool of the thoroughbred that is by far superior to anything else in the world, and yet, we are going to blow it down the river. [And] what makes me beyond angry is that it’s never grasped how important we are internationally.”The report was co-produced by Dan Carden, the Labour MP for Liverpool Walton, and Nick Timothy, a Conservative whose West Suffolk constituency includes Newmarket, the joint-chairs of the APPG, but claims cross-party support for its concerns from both Liberal Democrat and Reform MPs.In addition to a Treasury proposal to equalise the rate of duty payable on betting on sport with what is currently a higher rate for casino-style gaming products – which could reduce racing’s attractiveness as a betting medium for both operators and punters – the MPs’ report highlights the issue of “financial risk” checks on gamblers and an ongoing impasse over reform to the Levy system, which returns money to racing from off-course gambling, as the other components of its “triple whammy”.“The government needs to carefully consider the unintended consequences of its decision in all of these areas,” the report warns. “It is no exaggeration to say that the future of Britain’s biggest sport is on the line.”It was a sobering way to start Ascot week, but the report will form the basis of the British Horseracing Authority’s response to the Treasury’s proposals in a consultation process which is due to end on 21 July. And the serene self-confidence of the Royal meeting, with everything in its allotted place and, for the most part,just as it was two centuries agowill offer at least some reassurance as worries about what the future might bring are parked for the next five days for a celebration of the best of British racing.View image in fullscreenThe King and Queen will be in attendance for most or all of the days this week.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe Breeders’ Cup in America has more Grade One races. Arc weekend at Longchamp has the richest event of the season and half a dozen Group Ones on a single afternoon.But neither can boast the variety or depth of quality that comes as standard at Royal Ascot, where the daily feature events at 4.20pm are joined by historic handicaps like the Wokingham and Royal Hunt Cup, where fields of up to 30 horses charge down the straight mile. Cheltenham’s festival in March is often seen as a more competitive meeting overall, but the average SP of the winners has been higher at Ascot in recent seasons.It is a meeting that sets its stall out from the start, with a Group One at the top of the opening day card and two more in quick succession, and does not, by any reasonable assessment, have a single afternoon that ranks as either superior or inferior to the rest. Contrary to popular belief, in fact, Ladies’ Day on Thursday – when the Gold Cup, first run in 1807, is the feature event – has never been marketed as such by the track itself. And while other tracks struggle to shift tickets for their main events, Ascot is trying to find space to accommodate nearly 400 visiting executives from tracks around the world, eager to find out for themselves how Britain’s top racecourse seemingly goes from strength to strength.Without the grassroots industry to support it, of course, the top of the pyramid would soon topple. So this week’s Royal meeting, with the King and Queen in attendance for most or all of the days and horses drawn from around the world to compete, is a timely reminder that there are still some things that Britain does quite well and also, perhaps, that you do not know what you’ve got till it’s gone.Henri Matisse can take shine off GoldIt adds an extra dimension to the St James’s Palace Stakes when the three major Guineas winners from Newmarket, the Curragh and Longchamp are in the field and Epsom’s loss is very much Royal Ascot’s gain following the late scratching of Ruling Court, the 2,000 Guineas winner, from the Derby 10 days ago.Ruling Court was half a length in front of Field Of Gold at Newmarket but John & Thady Gosden’s colt was finishing best of all after allowing Ruling Court to get first run, and subsequently trounced his field in the Irish equivalent at the Curragh.The market for Tuesday’s feature race on day one at Royal Ascot very much takes the view that Field Of Gold was unlucky at Newmarket, and he is odds-on to reverse the form with Ruling Court.Aidan O’Brien’sHenri Matisse(4.20), meanwhile, is third-favourite among the principals, despite having won the French 2,000 Guineas – around a right-handed bend on good-to-firm ground – with something to spare.O’Brien has two stable companions in the field to ensure a strong pace, the race should set up ideally for Ryan Moore’s mount as a result and a price of around 7-2 looks more than fair for Henri Matisse to give his trainer a record-extending 10th win in the race.Royal Ascot 2.30The first four home in the Lockinge Stakes renew rivalry in the traditional opener to the meeting andNotable Speech,fourth at Newbury but less than three lengths behind the winner, could find the most improvement back on a fast surface.Royal Ascot 3.05Twelve of the 21 declared runners for the Coventry Stakes arrive here unbeaten, andAmerican Gulf, who was well backed before a decisive debut win at Windsor, could spring a minor surprise at around 10-1.Royal Ascot 3.40Last year’s winner,Asfoora,arrives without a prep run this time around and is blinkered for the first time but she has won off a break in the past and is an obvious pick on last year’s form.Royal Ascot 5.00All the focus is on Willie Mullins’s Reaching High in the royal colours, but his stable companionPoniros,the 100-1 Triumph Hurdle winner in March, is potentially very well handicapped returning to the Flat and the booking of William Buick suggests he is far from just a second-string.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowStratford2.05 Market House 2.40 Duel Au Soleil 3.13 Alshadian 3.50 Carigeen Kampala 4.30 A Dublin Job 5.10 FillyfudgeThirsk2.15 Royal Fixation 2.50 Ghaiyya 3.23 Blue Anthem 4.00 Captain Vallo 4.40 Blue Rc 5.20 Golden Rainbow 5.50 Jojo RabbitRoyal Ascot2.30 Notable Speech (nb) 3.05 American Gulf 3.40 Asfoora 4.20 Henri Matisse 5.00 Poniros 5.35 Ecureuil Secret (nap) 6.10 CharlusSouthwell5.25 Frostmagic 5.55 Keldeo 6.30 Your Love 7.00 Irish Dancer 7.30 Panelli 8.00 Time Allowed 8.30 Petra Celera 9.00 Loch LevenBeverley6.15 Command The Stars 6.45 Forest Caper 7.15 Dumfries 7.45 Freddy Robinson 8.15 Little Ted 8.45 Triple ForceWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Royal Ascot 5.35This is a significant step up forEcureuil Secretafter a convincing handicap success at Epsom’s Derby meeting but he already looks like a much-improved performer after being gelded over the winter.Royal Ascot 6.10Willie Mullins is going for a hat-trick in this 14-furlong handicap and while the lightly racedCharluswas beaten out of sight on his latest start in the Triumph Hurdle, he showed distinct promise in four starts on the Flat for Jean-Claude Rouget in France.Explore more on these topicsRoyal AscotTalking HorsesHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We recognised that and we thought that was wrong, so we began to run girls’ football programmes in schools, after the school day and during holidays, and what we found was that those girls were as talented as the boys, and that was with huge barriers and challenges around them and without any football role models they could look up to.”The decision to engage further with those girls grew from this. “If they wanted to model a football technique or a skill, they’d have to look to professional men players and that just didn’t sit right with the football club,” Hudson says. “So we took those girls’ football programmes and the passion, commitment, togetherness, belonging and loyalty that those girls were showing, which was just so powerful, and took a big leap of faith. We developed a youth training scheme for 16- to-18-year-olds with the aim of mirroring what the boys had in terms of a pathway.View image in fullscreenAn Arsenal in the Community girls’ session takes place at Haverstock School.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“There was no route into professional football for women but at least we could get to the point where they had a YTS scheme as an option. So they were full-time with us from 16 to 18 and were paid for by a government training scheme. The bulk of their time they were being coached as players, but then they gained lots of sports qualifications and gained experience in the JVC Centre at Arsenal in a sort of leisure centre environment. So we were equipping them with work skills and more. That was just such a powerful programme and all of a sudden that attracted players like Rachel Yankey.”The club would help senior players find jobs in the club too, Alex Scott famously washing the men’s team kits in her early days there.The landscape is very different today but Arsenal are still doing that base-level community work. One of the coaches working with the girls at Haverstock School, Abby Webster, is a former pupil. “As soon as I hit 18 I was able to get a job in the community,” she says. “I’ve been out to other places to get some more experience but then I’ve always come back here; this has always been where my heart stays.”Bella, Myah, Kayla and Stevie step away from the session, faces red, to talk about its impact. “We’re closer now,” says Bella. Abby, says Stevie, is “less like a coach and more like a person that you can go and talk to. She’s more like a cool, younger person, like a cousin or something.”All four have been taking part since the sessions began, having previously had only the inter-form cup available for matches. They love the sessions and have loved being taken on trips too, including to the Arsenal Hub, the centre of Arsenal in the Community. “We’ve met Declan [Rice],” says Myah. “We got signed shirts, the new shirts,” Kayla says.When Arsenal in the Community was launched in 1985, it was a way to give back to locals facing disruption on match days and engage with a generation of young people “that we felt they weren’t being listened to”, says Hudson, who was awarded an MBE last Friday for services to Arsenal’s community. “Unemployment was high, there was some racial tension in the city and we wanted to engage those young people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unemployment is still a real challenge for certain young people that haven’t had any decent role modelling around education and work pathways.”View image in fullscreenFreddie Hudson was awarded an MBE last Friday for services to Arsenal’s community.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe community programme has also enabled Arsenal to assist local authorities with issues such as teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, school attendance and punctuality, Hudson says. “The beauty of the football club, though, is it’s nimble. It’s not a local authority, it’s not an NHS, where there’s levels of signoff you have to go through. We can be really responsive and with a bit of creativity and nimbleness and passion and commitment, all of a sudden you could be facing a challenge one day and the workforce could be out there with partners delivering on those challenges within a couple of weeks.”Arsenal want to ensure a route remains from their community work into the women’s and girls’ teams, alongside their talent ID programme and academy. “We are also aware of barriers that are there for local girls to come through and have plans to reduce those,” Wheatley says. Those plans include moving some training to Londonand helping with the financial burdens that come with being a part of a team.Improving the diversity of the senior side is also an important driver behind the work done further down the chain. Wheatley is proud of Arsenal’s diversity in the academy and says: “We have strengthened the pathway between the academy and first team just to ensure that there is that progress.”The success of the first team and of individual players provides what Hudson describes as “a golden opportunity that we can’t let pass” at community level. “All the success we’ve had in the 2022 Euros, with all the success that Arsenal Women have had with 62 trophies, it’s phenomenal,” he says. “And we’ve got a great window to drive some female-focused messages, supporting those young girls through pinch points of anxiety in their lives, but not just with women and girls. We’ve got a great opportunity to take some of those conversations, some of that education, some of that awareness, to a male audience, and that’s what we’re doing too.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Spaun, not so long ago a journeyman professional, played out his dream by holing out from 65ft on the final green at Oakmont.Spaun is a prime example of how the penny can drop for golfers at different stages. Now 34, he is in the form of his life and bound for the Ryder Cup. When he talked later of being awake at three o’clock on Sunday morning because his young daughter was vomiting, his relatability only grew. Everybody loves an underdog.JJ Spaun completes fairytale with monster final putt on wet and wild day at US OpenRead moreSpaun’s heroics on that 72nd green did the United StatesGolfAssociation a huge favour. It provided an upbeat tournament reference point. Until then, the US Open had been defined by chaos and carnage.Plenty of people like their sport that way. A chunk of the golfing audience think it is magnificent that cosseted players endure one week a year where par is king. There is a counter point, one which says Argentina taking on Spain in a World Cup final where the grass was knee high and goals were wonky might be riveting for a while but would hardly determine sporting excellence. Why not make the courts smaller during the opening rounds at Wimbledon? So long as everyone played by the same rules, where is the problem? The 125th US Open came dangerously close to crazy golf territory.There are surely only so many times you can watch professionalsbarely move a ball from dense roughbefore turning over to the Antiques Roadshow. And this is all US Open competitors could do; there was no concept of imagination, creativity or great skill when the ball bounded through slick greens or off sloping fairways. Oakmont provided a wonderful test of attitude, of that there is no question. Beyond that? Hmm.View image in fullscreenAdam Scott’s challenge at the US Open faltered on the back nine on Sunday, with the rough behind him one reason why so many players struggled.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesThere is a key background theme when it relates to the US Open and course setup. This one has nothing to do with ego or the desire of officials to torture players in a manner nobody else can. Instead, it should be remembered that the USGA is front and centre when it comes to rolling back the golf ball for elite players from 2028. It believes hitting distances are out of control, leading to historic venues – such as Oakmont – potentially becoming obsolete. The argument is perfectly fair, albeit the USGA and its chums at the R&A have been painfully slow to address an issue where the horse bolted long before studies were commissioned.The USGA and R&A have opposition from umpteen other elements of the golf establishment. Last Wednesday, the USGA made plain it will not be delaying rollback plans. By Thursday, 156 players were chopping their way through Oakmont’s foliage. This felt no coincidence, instead a means of the USGA telling the world this is its only way to protect a course while scope to butcher it with 350-yard drives exists. Add in pin positions on slopes and golf’s playing aristocracy look silly. Every one of them did in this US Open.The difficulty comes when pondering whether luck became far too influential in the outcome. Tyrrell Hatton will spend days if not weeks bemoaning breaks on the last two days of the tournament. The Englishman has a point; both on Saturday and Sunday his ball finished in thick rough on slopes leading in to bunkers. Hatton had no proper shot to play on either occasion. This bunker protection was not needed – the sand traps themselves were penal enough – with their implementation only adding an element of freakishness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The margin for error was so small. This was amplified in the crucial stages, a rain deluge limiting the ability of players to control their ball to an even greater extent than before. Adam Scott, not one for outspoken comment, labelled the course “borderline unplayable”. The guddle in the puddle. Golfers live charmed lives and it was telling, beyond Scott and Matt Fitzpatrick, they refused to bemoan the Oakmont situation. Privately, though, there were plenty of questions raised about fairness.Rory McIlroy has his own challenges after achieving his lifetime dream at the Masters. Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler somehow ended up in the top 10 of the US Open. Yet at no stage was this an illustrious leaderboard, one which gave the sense of marquee names jousting for a trophy on Sunday. Spaun has no cause to care but there must be some responsibility on majors to let the cream rise to the top. Far too many A-listers departed Oakmont at halfway than was healthy.Spaun’s glorywas built on resilience. This relates to a career that was not going anywhere fast only a year ago and a US Open final round which included a front half of 40. He can celebrate as wildly as he likes. Big‑picture terms just determine this was a forgettable major.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenGolfPGA TourUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 35‑year‑old scaled as high as No 21 less than two years ago but he now sits at No 199 in the ATP rankings. He received a wildcard to competeat Queen’s Cluband he will also need a wildcard in order to compete in the main draw at Wimbledon in two weeks’ time.“It’s always amazing to play here,” Evans said. “I didn’t know he was in the top 20, if I’m honest with you. I knew he was very good. I was really just trying to focus on playing some good tennis because this year it’s been few and far between.“Days like today, whatever happens this week, is why I’ve been carrying on; to get out here and put my game on the court and enjoy it.”Last month, Evans’s ranking of No 215 marked his lowest position since 2018. He has spent most of the past 10 months competing on the ATP Challenger tour and has reached just one quarter-final during this period. As he has struggled to build any momentum, even losing against multiple players ranked outside the top 350, his difficulties have naturally generated ample doubts about his future in the sport.“It has been a pretty long year so far, I’ve been playing the lower tournaments and, let’s be honest, this is why I’m still hanging around to get back on the grass and try and get some wins,” he said.Evans put together a spectacular match on Monday on the grass, a surface to which his distinct game remains so well suited. He bamboozled his American opponent throughout the match with his backhand slice, struck his forehand brilliantly and served well in the decisive moments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cameron Norrie, meanwhile, endured a difficult defeat against the 19-year-old eighth seed Jakub Mensik, losing 7-6 (6), 1-6, 6-1. “We played every tough game except for the last one and he won all of them,” Norrie said. “A good first match on the grass, and he served unbelievably well.

In our faith and religion [Islam], it’s very important that the funeral gets done as soon as possible. It’s a part of the grieving process to bury and honour them, to return them as soon as possible and grieve them.”The family members are urging the government to immediately deploy a full crisis team at the hospital, including consular, medical, and forensic science officers, as well as implementing a British-run identification unit to assist with DNA testing and speed up the release of remains.They want to receive hourly written briefings in the UK and India, as well as financial support for next-of-kin to cover urgent travel, accommodation, and repatriation costs, and for an independent inquiry into the handling of the crisis to be considered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Half said they sourced news from the once all-powerful TV networks.The accelerating global shift towards social media and video platforms is laid bare in a major study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which surveyed almost 100,000 news consumers worldwide.It reveals a further diminishing of the influence of traditional news organisations, with more people heading to podcasters, YouTubers and TikTokers. The authors warned it is allowing populist politicians such as Trump and Argentina’s Javier Milei to bypass the scrutiny of the transitional media in favour of new, online networks.The role of news influencers, who use their personal brand to win an online following, is growing, led by the extraordinary impact of thepodcaster Joe Rogan during last year’s US presidential election.One-fifth (22%) of those contacted in the US said they came across news or commentary from Rogan in the week after the presidential inauguration, including a disproportionate number of young men, a group traditional media struggles to reach.News influencers on YouTube, Instagram andTikTokare also finding large audiences in India, Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand, which have younger populations that are heavy social media users.Meanwhile,Elon Musk’s Xhas seen a major shift to the right among its users, according to the analysis. Musk’s takeover of the site has been followed by a 50% increase among right-leaning users, from 10% of the group in 2021 to 15% this year. There has been a corresponding fall in left-leaning users, from 17% to 14% over the same period, asliberals have abandoned the platform.The findings confirm the huge changes taking place in news consumption worldwide. “The rise of social video and personality-driven news represents another significant challenge for traditional publishers that are struggling to adapt their content and tone to these very different environments,” said Nic Newman, a founding member of the BBC News website and the study’s lead author.“Online video may be a good way to engage younger audiences, but there is very little commercial upside for publishers, with most news consumption taking place via platforms rather than owned and operated news websites. Publishers also face a loss of influence, with populist politicians increasingly looking to bypass scrutiny by working with sympathetic influencers instead.”View image in fullscreenThe report highlights the diminishing influence of traditional news organisations, whose scrutiny is also being bypassed.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesA decade ago, just two online networks were delivering news content to more than 10% of the report’s global sample. That has now grown to six.Facebookreaches more than a third (36%), whileYouTubeis not far behind (30%). Instagram and WhatsApp are used by around a fifth for news content, while 16% turn to TikTok and 12% still receive news from X.There are concerns that truth will suffer. Overall, 58% of the populations studied remain worried about their ability to tell what is true from what is false online. Concern is highest in Africa (73%) and the US (73%).Thephenomenon of news avoidance continues to riseas users restrict the amount they consume, complaining about feeling overwhelmed by a gloomy news agenda. Four in 10 people in the study’s global sample said they sometimes or often avoid the news – up from 29% in 2017 – the joint highest figure ever recorded.The UK has one of the highest proportions of news avoiders, where 46% say they sometimes or often avoid the news.In another major change on the horizon, young people are already turning to artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini for news. It poses a serious risk to news companies as users may receive all the information they need through a chatbot without ever visiting the original source of the story.The numbers using chatbots for news are still relatively small overall, but are higher with under-35s at 12% of the group. Across all the countries involved in the study, people expect AI will make the news cheaper and more up-to-date but less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYouTubeTikTokXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

An MDC could now be established in early 2026, including representation from the council, which even now under Labour control has opposed the scheme.Cllr Adam Hug, the leader of the council, said: “While the mayor’s formal decision today was not the council’s preferred outcome, it is far from unexpected, and it is now important for Oxford Street’s future to move forward together.”He added that since 2022 the street had “roared back to life after the pandemic” and said the council would work with Khan to see it “reimagined” in a way that worked for visitors, shoppers and residents.Oxford Street is already largely restricted to general traffic but is a key route for London buses and taxis. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the LTDA, which represents black-cab drivers, thought the plans would worsencongestion in the capital. “Putting this traffic down surrounding streets will cause chaos – we’re already Europe’s most congested city, maybe we’ll now get the world title,” he said.Detailed traffic proposals to reroute buses and ban all traffic will be released and consulted on later this year.Khan added: “We want to rejuvenate Oxford Street; establish it as a global leader for shopping, leisure and outdoor events with a world-class, accessible, pedestrianised avenue. This will help to attract more international visitors, and act as a magnet for new investment and job creation, driving growth and economic prosperity for decades to come.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chief executive of Ikea Uk and Ireland, Peter Jelkeby, said the pedestrianisation plan was a positive step that would “create a more welcoming and accessible space – bringing wide-ranging benefits to visitors, shoppers, businesses and the wider community”.The executive director of Selfridges, Meave Wall, said the department store was “hugely energised by the renewed commitment to make this area more enticing and attractive for locals and visitors from around the world”.The New West End Company, which represents 600 businesses around the area, said the consultation results were an important step forward.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryPedestrianisationSadiq KhanLondonPlanning policyShops and shoppingnewsShareReuse this content"

USAID had pledged $29.5m (£22m) over five years to the project, which was designed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats in westernTanzania.Launched in November 2023, the project is intended to protect endangered chimpanzees through reforestation and “community-led methodology” in order to conserve biodiversity conservation and improve local livelihoods.Its work is built upon Jane Goodall’s research.She “redefined species conservation” byhighlighting the importanceof cooperation between local people and the natural environment to protect chimpanzees from extinction.According to JGI figures, chimpanzees have become extinct in three African countries, and overall population numbers have fallen from millions to below 340,000.Goodallcriticised Trump during his first term in officewhen he signed an executive order dismantling Barack Obama’s clean power plan. She called Trump’s climate agenda “immensely depressing”.In collaboration with JGI Austria, Ecosia – a Berlin-based search engine that donates 100% of its profits to climate action – has offered $100,000 over the next three years to further TGI Tanzania’s Gombe reforestation project. The donation far from covers the original funding amount, but it is intended to pay for the planting of 360,000 seedlings, work put at risk after the project was defunded.The director of JGI Austria, Diana Leizinger, said: “We refuse to abandon people and nature. Where hope could have been destroyed, we are helping it grow again.”An analysis in April by Refugees International found that 98% of USAID’s awards related to the climate had been discontinued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In a recent meeting with the FBI and CIA, he claimed that Assad – who was ousted in December and has since fled to Moscow – ordered Tice’s execution, according to the New York Times and the BBC, which first reported the allegation. Each media organization cited sources familiar with the matter. Hassan’s claims remain unverified.Tice, a former marine who had done freelance journalism for the Washington Post and CBS, among other outlets, was abducted at a Damascus checkpoint in August 2012 when he was 31 years old. He briefly escaped but was recaptured and reportedly held in a detention center under Hassan’s control.US officials have long suspected Hassan’s involvement in Tice’s imprisonment. Hassan is also seen as a valuable source on other US intelligence interests, including Syria’s chemical weapons program and Iranian activity in the region.Over the years conflicting reports have surfaced regarding whether Tice is still alive. In response to Hassan’s account, the Tice family issued a statement to theNew York Times, saying they were disappointed it had been published and doubted it was true.Hassan wassanctioned by the USin 2014 for arms procurement and is wanted by French judges for allegedly helping coordinate sarin gas attacks in 2013. He reportedly maintained close ties with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Syria.In December 2024, after rebel forces seized Damascus, Hassan fled to Iran with Iranian assistance. He later traveled voluntarily to Lebanon. Since April, US investigators have interviewed Hassan multiple times, though the extent of his cooperation remains unclear.Tice’s whereabouts had long been a subject of mystery. After his abduction footage was released showing him blindfolded and surrounded by armed, masked men, but US officials believed it was staged in an attempt to frame militants for the kidnapping. Diplomatic efforts and a CIA-led taskforce tried unsuccessfully to find him, even offering rewards. But the fall of Assad’s regime had raised hopes of resolving the case and Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, has pledged to assist the search.Earlier this month,BBC Newsobtained intelligence files reportedly confirming Tice had been imprisoned in Damascus. In a rare admission, the former Syrian general Safwan Bahloul said he personally interrogated Tice, marking the first time a Syrian official has acknowledged direct contact.Debra Tice, his mother, toldthe Guardianin January that the family was not giving up hope in the search for her son.“Austin, if you can somehow hear this, I love you. I know you’re not giving up and neither am I,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSyriaJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Extreme weather and rising input prices have increased financial pressures on the sector, which has meant that a cut to the budget could have serious impacts.Ministers have also indicated that larger farmscould be ineligiblefor the nature-friendly farming fund in future. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was recently forced toU-turnon a freeze to new applicants for the fund after the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) threatened legal action.Previous researchby the RSPB has found that a £100m a year cut would lead to 239,000 fewer hectares (590,580 acres) of nature-friendly farmland.Defra said the funding paid to farmers under of environment land management schemes (Elms) would “skyrocket” from £800m in 2023-24 to £2bn in 2028-29. However, the NFU has called this “misleading” because afterBrexit, farmers were promised that their subsidies would be the same as they were under the EU and were promised a figure of £2.4bn a year.The Elms programme was devised by the conservatives after Brexit: the goal was that rather than being paid per acre, farmers should be paid for improving nature. While the programme was being put in place,the acreage payments known as basic payments schemes (BPS) were kept, and cut each year as Elms increased. BPS is due to be phased out entirely by 2028. Farmers currently get the £2.4bn a year in the two streams as well as a smaller amount of money in grants for things such as robotics trials.Going forward, the government has promised an average of £2.3bn a year up to 2028-29 for the farming budget. By the end of the spending period the budget will shrink to £2.25bn, with £2bn allocated for Elms and the rest paid in productivity grants.Sanjay Dhanda, the NFU’s senior economist, has said Defra has been “misleading” in its claims.He said: “A key pillar of Defra’s budget is the continued investment in Elms, with funding set to rise to £2bn by 2028-29, compared with the £1.8bn earmarked in the autumn 2024 budget. While the government has framed this as a significant uplift from the £800m spent in 2023-24, this comparison is misleading as Elms was not fully operational at that point, and delinked payments [BPS] absorbed a large share of funding.”However, Defra sources pointed out that although the previous government allocated £2.4bn a year for Elms, the Tories in factunderspent itby about £100m a year. That government had, however, promised that by the end of the spending period, which was cut short by the general election, the full fund was ringfenced and would be allocated to farmers.Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said: “While the Defra secretary of state has listened and managed to maintain the overall funding for farming and nature recovery, from what we can see so far, the £100m cut to farming means farmers and growers will need to do more with less.”Mark Spencer, a former farming minister who was in charge of issuing the farming budget, said the amount spent on Elms would have been higher than £2bn at the end of the spending period, under the Tories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It was always our intention and emphasis to reduce BPS and pour the money into Elms and for the vast majority of it to go to Elms,” he said.Reacting to the cut, Spencer added: “A part of me is angry, a part of me is just so sad. We made such huge progress and now it is in jeopardy.”Nature groups have credited Steve Reed, the environment secretary, for protecting most of the budget.Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, said the chancellor Rachel Reeves had maintained the budget for nature-friendly farming, adding: “Steve Reed deserves credit for securing this budget in challenging financial circumstances.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Contrary to media reports that the farming budget would be slashed by £1.2bn over the next three years, the government is investing a record £5.9bn into nature friendly farming schemes.”Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025FarmingLabourWildlifeTrade unionsBiodiversityBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

The initial portfolio of loans is likely to be about $500m to £1bn.Several private and public sector experts said Persaud’s ideas could have a big impact.Mattia Romani, a senior partner at Systemiq, a consultancy that is working with Cop30 on climate finance, said: “It is a very powerful initiative, both pragmatic and innovative. Given the constraints we will inevitably face in the coming years, securitisation is one of the few realistic tools to reach [the sums needed].“This initiative is designed to unlock institutional capital by leveraging the balance sheets of domestic commercial banks – securitising their loans so that they can meet the fiduciary needs of institutional investors, and turning them into engines for transition finance. What’s new is the direct engagement with local banks – we are starting with a pilot in Latin America.”Explore more on these topicsClimate financeGreen politicsCop30Climate crisisOil and gas companiesOil (Environment)Oil (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

Two systems were involved, prompting orange weather warnings: the first came from the west via Brittany and hit the north of the country, and the second arrived via Spain and affected south-west France.More than 30,000 lightning strikes were recorded between midnight on Friday and early Saturday. Eure, north of Paris, was worst hit with 4,326 strikes. Strong winds lashed Normandy – Rouen recorded a 76mph (123km)/h) gust that broke the 64mph record set in 2019. Hail affected several areas, leading to infrastructure and crop damage.There were further storms over central and north-west France on Saturday night, many with very large hailstones. The largest, found in Orly, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, measured 85mm.Several factors led to the severe weather. A key component was a phenomenon known asgoutte froide, in which an isolated, upper-air cold pool detached from the overall circulation, creating significant atmospheric instability.Athalweg d’altitude(upper-air trough) provided the lift necessary by favouring air ascent. Warm, moist air flowed into the trough and was forced upwards. As the air rose, it started to cool and water vapour began to condense, forming clouds. As this clouds swelled, they created severe thunderstorms.As air flowed into the trough from every direction, it enabled supercells to develop by introducing the element of spin. Supercells are large-scale, highly organised storms with a rotating updraft that can sustain themselves for several hours and travel hundreds of miles – one of which swept through northern France on Friday.A recent heat dome over the country helped intensify the storms by providing a greater gradient between the surface and the upper air, and by bringing a greater source of moisture. A heat dome occurs when high pressure persists over a region, trapping warm air and allowing temperatures to rise several degrees above the seasonal average.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerFranceEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Headley, from Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murder and rape.In the prosecution’s opening, Anna Vigars KC said police had never given up finding the killer.She said: “What we are talking about is the murder of an elderly and vulnerable lady in her own home. She was in no state to defend herself.“Whether it happened 58 years ago or 58 days ago, the murder of any person is a matter of concern to the rest of us. The fact that time has passed doesn’t make the killing of any one of us any less significant.”The jury heard that soon after the murder, Headley moved to Suffolk, where in 1977 he raped two women, threatening to strangle or smother them if they did not follow his orders.View image in fullscreenCourt artist’s drawing of 92-year-old Ryland Headley appearing via video link at Bristol magistrates court last November.Photograph: Elizabeth Cook/PAVigars said Dunne had been born in May 1892, when Queen Victoria was on the UK throne and by 1967 was living alone in Britannia Road, Easton, Bristol. She had been married twice, to a city alderman and to a nightwatchman, but both had died.Neighbours knew her as “a local fixture”, always out on her doorstep, watching the world go by.On 28 June 1967, a number of local women became worried about Dunne after noticing that one of her windows was open. A neighbour, Violet Allen, climbed in and found her dead.A postmortem was performed. Dunne was 5ft 3in tall and weighed less than seven stone (45kg). She was wearing three cardigans and a blue skirt.She had abrasions to her face and bruises to the back of the head and her right thigh. The pathologist concluded a hand had been forcibly held over her mouth, and that a bruise across the back of her neck had been caused by a scarf found under her body having been violently tightened. A vaginal swab taken from her tested positive for semen.Police found a palm print on a window at the back of the house and over the following weeks took thousands of prints from men and boys but could not find a match.Vigars told the jury that though semen had been found, DNA examination was “not a technique in the armoury” of the police at that time.The material gathered in the investigation was boxed and preserved, latterly at the major crime archives at Avon and Somerset police headquarters. The case was looked at from time to time and in 2024 items including the blue skirt Dunne had been wearing were sent off for forensic examination.Vigars said: “Although the items had been in police possession for almost 60 years, they had never before been examined scientifically like this.”The jury was told forensic scientist Andrew Parry discovered that Dunne’s skirt contained “a large quantity of semen”.Vigars said: “By 2024, scientists were able to do what was impossible nearly 60 years earlier and examine that semen for DNA. Mr Parry discovered that the semen matched Mr Headley’s DNA with a match ratio that meant it was a billion times more likely to be Mr Headley’s DNA than anybody else’s.”Police found voters’ records from the late 1960s showing that Headley and his wife lived in Picton Street, Bristol, about a mile and a half from Dunne’s home. Vigars said: “Picton Street fell outside the ring of homes where men had been asked to provide a palm print.”The jury heard that in 1977 Headley raped two women, one aged 84, one 79, in Suffolk, where he had moved soon after Dunne’s death, after breaking into their homes.He threatened to strangle the 84-year-old if she did not do what he ordered, the court heard. Headley told the 79-year-old he had a gun and warned her that, if she did not follow his instructions: “I’ll put a pillow over your face and smother you.”He admitted both rapes and asked for a further 10 offences of overnight burglaries of homes where his fingerprints had been found between 1973 and 1978 to be taken into consideration.After his arrest for Dunne’s murder and rape, his palm print was taken – and experts said it matched the one taken at her home in 1967.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They really don’t need to make such vast executive payouts and could better reflect the values they project in TV adverts by doing things differently.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Including the newly added Virgin Money workforce, the bonus pot totalled £132m.A Nationwide spokesperson said: “Nationwide has become the second largest provider of mortgages and retail deposits, and remains first for customer satisfaction, because it can attract, retain and motivate talented leaders to run a business of this scale and prioritise member value.”Explore more on these topicsNationwideBanks and building societiesExecutive pay and bonusesFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

We have seen examples of this in London as well as more recently worldwide, such as in California and South Korea.”Pugsley said he had written last month to the chief executives of each London local authority, “outlining some key measures they can take, such as to create fire breaks, and to welcome the work that councils are already undertaking”.A drought was declared by the Environment Agency across Yorkshire last week while the north-west of England entered drought status last month.Warnings are also being issued about the risk to people with health vulnerabilities that may be exacerbated by the heat. The UK Health Security Agency issued its first yellow heat-health alert of the year last week to remind health and social care services to prepare.The director ofAge UK, Caroline Abrahams, said many older people were looking forward to some warm weather, but that they needed to take extra care as temperatures rose, especially if they have long-term health conditions. She suggested they take simple precautions such as staying out of direct sunlight and keeping hydrated.“It is also worth doing any daily activities, such as going for a walk, shopping or gardening before or after the hottest part of the day which is between 11am and 3pm. Most of our homes aren’t really designed to cope with scorching weather, so it’s a good idea to do all we can to keep the cool air in and hot air out,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherWildfiresEnglandWalesLondonManchesterNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

Concerns over ‘excessive’ surveillance in smart devicesRead moreIt is demanding that manufacturers and data handlers ensure data security, are transparent with consumers and ensure the regular deletion of collected information.Stephen Almond, the executive director for regulatory risk at the ICO, said: “Smart products know a lot about us: who we live with, what music we like, what medication we are taking and much more.“They are designed to make our lives easier, but that doesn’t mean they should be collecting an excessive amount of information … we shouldn’t have to choose between enjoying the benefits of smart products and our own privacy.“We all rightly have a greater expectation of privacy in our own homes, so we must be able to trust smart products are respecting our privacy, using our personal information responsibly and only in ways we would expect.”The new guidance cites a wide range of devices that are broadly known as part of the “internet of things”, which collect data that needs to be carefully handled. These include smart fertility trackers that record the dates of their users’ periods and body temperature, send it back to the manufacturer’s servers and make an inference about fertile days based on this information.Smart speakers that listen in not only to their owner but also to other members of their family and visitors to their home should be designed so users can configure product settings to minimise the personal information they collect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re learning more about their behavior and life history, and their non-native range here in southFlorida, which is leading to more removals and hopefully innovation and novel strategies going forward.“Progress is being made. Anecdotally we’re seeing some demographic shifts, and regionally, we’re seeing less larger size-class pythons in certain areas. That’s a direct result of our management efforts, and our partners’ management efforts.”Kirkland, and other experts, say it is impossible to know how many pythons are swimming in the waters of the greater Everglades region, making it difficult to accurately gauge the impact of the removal efforts. Most estimates settle attens of thousands, originating from a handful of snakes believed to have been dumped by pet owners in the 1990s when they grew too big.Females can lay dozens of eggs, sometimes up to 100 annually, and although many hatchlings do not survive to adulthood, some still fear that pythons are reproducing faster than they can be caught.“There’s also imprecision about what the goal is because people may implicitly assume that it’s complete eradication of pythons in Florida, which is probably not realistic given what we know about invasive species elsewhere,” saidAndrew Durso, a herpetologist at Florida Gulf Coast University.View image in fullscreen700 pounds of python at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida invasive species lab in Naples.Photograph: Conservancy of Southwest Florida“[But] if you can take out one female, it’s not just that single python, but all of her current and future reproduction, that’s thousands of eggs that will never be laid.”Biologists at the conservancy, a privately funded environmental organization headquartered in Naples, focus efforts on finding and removing females during the November to April breeding season, tracking tagged male “scout” snakes with radio telemetry.“There’s very good evidence that the scout snake program is our most effective and least biased method. It doesn’t just limit us to targeting human accessible areas and it’s super targeted toward those reproductive females,” said Durso, who is not connected with the conservancy’s removal program.“But it’s expensive to radio-track these males into remote parts of the Everglades where you can’t go very easily. You need air support from a helicopter, which ups the price per python removed. It’s all a balance sheet of how do we want to spend money?”Ian Bartoszek, the conservancy’s science project manager and chief wildlife scientist, said tracking and removing the snakes – 6,300lb since November in a 200 sq mile area of south-west Florida – was “a heavy lifting assignment”, but that the refinement of the tracking technology in particular had led to increasing success.“Through years of research we’ve developed science-based methods to track this apex predator more effectively and mitigate its damage to our native wildlife population,” he said, adding that his team’s efforts had prevented about 20,000 eggs from hatching since beginning its work in 2013.“Burmese pythons are impressive creatures that are here from no fault of their own. As wildlife biologists, we have tremendous respect for all snake species. However, we understand the impact invasive pythons are having on the biodiversity in our area and we humanely remove them from the ecosystem.”View image in fullscreenConservation biologists Ian Bartoszek (center), Ian Easterling (left), and Jason Edelkind (right) each with a 17ft, 140lb female Burmese python captured in February 2025 while tracking radio tagged male scout snakes in southwestern Florida.Photograph: Conservancy of Southwest FloridaKirkland said that harnessing public fascination with pythons has been a significant tool aiding efforts to remove them. YouTube videos showingfights in the Evergladesbetween pythons and alligators have amassed millions of views, and Kirkland said he gets up to 100 letters a week from hunters seeking to join the 50 freelance “removal agents” contracted by his agency’spython elimination program.Additionally, the highly popular Florida python challenge attracts hundreds of hunters every summer seeking cash prizes. Kirkland hopes next month’s 10-day event will surpass 2024, when 895 participantscaptured 195 snakes.“Education helps get people involved and helps maintain support for our management efforts,” Kirkland said.“Programs like the conservancy telemetry program, and similar projects with the University of Florida and US Geological Survey, they all help increase our understanding of the behavior of the species in their non-native range.”Ultimately, he said, that “village” of eager participants leaves him more optimistic than he has ever been.“As with most environmental issues, a multi-pronged strategy of different efforts working in concert with one another is really the best path forward,” he said. “In the future I see the python population being greatly reduced, and to a point where we can begin to see a robust return of our native animal populations, which is why we’re doing all this to begin with.“I’m confident we’re going to be able to manage this species to the point where we’re seeing our deer populations, our foxes, our possums, our raccoons and so on, restored to the Everglades.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaSnakesAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

That photo was later shown in court.“Ingrid’s explanation is significantly strengthened by other evidence,” the court said in its ruling. “She left the house and moved out. The defendant, in turn, sent her a message the next day in which he strongly regretted the incident, emphasising that he needed help and that he wanted to see a doctor and psychologist.“The court also considers Ingrid’s explanation to be credible. It is difficult to see that she would have been motivated to make false accusations against her father. The court therefore assumes as proven beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant hit Ingrid in the face with a blow with a small and damp towel.”Ingrid, who left the family home at 15 years old after being struck with the towel by her father, was awarded compensation of 10,000 kroner (£744).However the court said that the prosecution’sother allegations could not be proven. They included an incident in 2008 where Jakob claimed his father had punched him in the head “many times” when he was eight – with one brother agreeing with Jakob but another saying Gjert had pulled him against a wall and yelled at him.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in court during the case against his father.Photograph: Lise Åserud/EPA-EFEProsecutors had called for Gjert to be jailed for two and a half years for what they told the court was a “regime of physical and verbal abuse” towards Jakob and Ingrid, which spanned a decade.In court Gjert accepted that he had sometimes been demanding while coaching his three sons, Jakob, Henrik and Filip, to major international titles. The 59-year-old also acknowledged that he had thrown the family PlayStation out of a window after a row. However, he denied any abuse.In its ruling on Monday the court said that the evidence from school friends, athletes and TV crews indicated that there had not been a longstanding culture of fear in the house.“Although Jakob and his brothers and spouses have given credible statements, the overall weight of the statements and other evidence that has been reviewed means that the court must conclude that there is reasonable doubt about the defendant’s guilt,” it said.In a statement, Gjert’s lawyer, John Christian Elden, said that the case had put an enormous burden on his client. “The decisive factor in the court’s conclusion was that there was no evidence that Gjert Ingebrigtsen created a continuous fear in his children. The court has particularly emphasised that several close family members and outside witnesses have not seen or experienced abuse.“This case has no winners, and today’s verdict shows that all those affected have been exposed to an enormous burden that should have been avoided.”Mette Yvonne Larsen, the legal counsel for Jakob, said her client found the decision “very strange” but was keen to move on. “He was surprised, but he was prepared for it. We talked about this last night, that it was a possible outcome,” she added. “Both the little sister and Jakob are considered to be so credible, and that is positive.”Both parties have 14 days to appeal.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

People are in absolute raptures’: how mysterious masked rockers Sleep Token took over metalThey just headlined Download festival and their latest album went to No 1 in the US and UK – so why is Britain’s biggest metal band in a generation so hated by some?Alexis PetridisMon 16 Jun 2025 09.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTShareOn Saturday, Sleep Token headlined Download festival in Leicestershire. Topping the bill at the festival is something of a rite of passage for artists of a certain musical bent, proof that you are now among the biggest bands in metal and hard rock: Metallica, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Guns N’ Roses are all former headliners. Last month, Sleep Token’s fourth album, Even in Arcadia, debuted at the top of both the British and American charts. Their most recent UK tour took in the biggest venues in the country: the same is true of their forthcoming US tour. In 2025, Sleep Token could reasonably claim to be the biggest British rock band in the world.But they wouldn’t, because Sleep Token operate behind a veil of anonymity. They have given virtually no interviews over the course of their career. The band’s frontman and chief songwriter is known only as Vessel; the other members are referred to as II, III and IV. They perform live wearing masks, hoods and body paint to conceal their identities and promote a fictional mythology: it’s too sprawling and complex to explain here – one fan has apparently produced a 35,000-word thesis on the subject – but it involves the band being a mouthpiece for a deity called Sleep. Their gigs are referred to as Rituals, their albums as Offerings, their social media posts frequently open with the word “Behold” and end with the word “Worship”. Like Hogwarts pupils, their fans are divided into “houses”: one is called Feathered Host, the other House Viridian.It’s not an approach entirely without precedent – the 70s progressive rock band Magma developed a mythology about a planet called Kobaïa, even singing in its “language”, Kobaïan – but it’s hard to think of anyone who has turned it to such commercial advantage. “No one saw this coming – it’s all fan-driven, it wasn’t pushed by anyone else,” says Luke Morton, editor of hard rock magazine Kerrang!. “I think it was during the pandemic when they really hit their stride – there was an escapist element, this world you could lose yourself in. TikTok had a large part to play in it – they just found this new audience that are so fully into it. I saw them in 2022 at Hammersmith Apollo, and there were people in floods of tears, in absolute raptures, just losing themselves in this world.”Of course, it takes seconds of Googling to discover Vessel’s real name, and indeed a video of him aged 18, offering his services as an online piano tutor. But the striking thing about Sleep Token’s fans is that they don’t seem to want to know, or at least want to pretend they don’t. Their online forums are governed by rules forbidding “providing information that leads to identifying members”. “Stop trying to break the spell,” counselled one fan on Instagram recently. “Just love it the way it is or leave it.”Whatever you make of all this, it’s at least an intriguing corrective to the idea that 21st-century music fans want artists to be relatable – as like themselves as possible – and that they essentially view music itself as a gossipy extension of artists’ lives, always scanning lyrics for clues to feuds with fellow stars or coded vitriol aimed at former partners. Instead, Sleep Token’s success seems to key into a supposedly old-fashioned, rather Bowie-esque idea that pop stars should be distant, remote, fantastical figures, their music a portal into a world very different from your own.View image in fullscreenSleep Token’s Vessel performing at Download.Photograph: Matt Higgs/Download festivalAnd yet, Sleep Token’s success has proved controversial. Even in Arcadia attracted some scathing reviews – Pitchfork called it “sanitized pop-rap with all the sexed-up verve of Droopy the dog” and their fans “dumb as hell”; The Needle Drop deemed it “plain and uninspired” and “metal for Disney adults”.To which any hard rock fan might shrug: so what? Ever since the debut album by heavy metal’s founding fathers Black Sabbath was dismissed by Rolling Stone as “claptrap” and “a shuck”, the kind of artists that play at Download and feature in Kerrang! have traditionally struggled to attract praise from the mainstream music press. But Sleep Token have attracted opprobrium from inside the hard rock community, too. Their initial success was adjacent to the progressive metal subgenre, a world of complex rhythms, lengthy songs and impressive technical proficiency: they are big on a sound called djent, which essentially means tricky riffs played on muted, low-pitch guitars. They always boasted a melodic sensibility, but it has become gradually more pronounced over their career: on Even in Arcadia, djent and what Morton calls “big, crushing breakdowns” are outweighed by the influence of R&B, hip-hop, dance music and straightforward pop. Some voices have started questioning whether they really deserve to be called a hard rock band at all, among them – unexpectedly – TV presenter and author Richard Osman: “It’s not hard rock,” he protested. “It’s the least metal thing I’ve ever heard.”Indeed, so much criticism has flown Sleep Token’s way that Doc Coyle, of US metal bands God Forbid, Trivium and Lamb of God among others, recently felt impelled to take to the internet in their defence, penning an article decrying “pretentious gatekeeping” and “a toxic heavy metal culture”: it’s perhaps worth noting that Sleep Token’s fanbase skews young.View image in fullscreenSleep Token with the Download festival crowd last weekend.Photograph: Adam Ross Williams/Download festivalFor his part, Morton thinks their success is evidence that “tribalism is a thing of the past”: as he points out, elsewhere at this year’s Download, McFly – a manufactured 00s pop band with a vaguely punk-ish lilt – are headlining a stage, which would have been unthinkable at the height of their fame. “There’s a backlash among metal elitists, but elitism always exists in heavy music, it has done since grunge happened. There’s a backlash to any sort of band that gets popular,” he says. “Nu-metal happened and people moaned, emo happened and people moaned. What I’ve seen more of is a quiet adoration for how big this all is: a ‘rising tide lifts all ships’ thing. If you don’t like it, fine.”But amid the mythology and lore, it’s hard not to notice that some of the lyrics on Even in Arcadia imply a certain weariness on the part of Sleep Token’s leader. “I swear it’s getting harder even to exhale … I try not to talk about how it’s harder now,” offers its most-streamed song,Caramel, adding “this stage is a prison, a beautiful nightmare”.Perhaps the real existential threat to the band’s continued success might not be the criticism they’ve attracted, but Sleep Token themselves, whoever they are.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps on a Greek island, a long way from home with a good book or two.That’s where Ruth Miller is right now, although there’s a twist to the usual tale.Nine years ago, the Londoner decided to volunteer for a month at a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. Today, she spends most of her time as the librarian of Mavrovouni camp.Miller, 71, a former civil servant who worked on simplifying communication in government written materials, has transferred her literacy skills.“It’s not quite what I had in mind entering my eighth decade but it’s a new challenge and I’m loving it – most of the time, although some days it’s exhausting,” she says.She volunteers for the NGO Eurorelief and was the driver behind converting a shed covered in metal cladding, a former bike repair workshop, into an oasis of books in 15 different languages.It contains 2,500 books, many in English, although Miller is always trying to source more books in Farsi, Arabic, Turkish for adults. Many of the refugees speak Arabic and Farsi, but also know Turkish because they have spent extended periods living in Turkey before crossing the Aegean Sea toGreece.Popular loans include Freud and Dostoevsky in Turkish and George Orwell’s Animal Farm in Farsi. Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are also frequently borrowed. Young refugees are keen on books about famous footballers.Miller teaches children in the camp the geography of London using the locations of different football teams“One little boy comes every second day asking for the book on [Virgil] Van Dijk – it went out on loan and hasn’t come back yet. He’s finished [Harry] Kane and [Luis] Suárez,” says Miller.She is a lifelong Spurs fan and has managed to secure a team kit for some of the children from her beloved club. Some of the children proudly walk around the camp in their Spurs shirts while others wear rival Arsenal’s red shirts.She teaches children in the camp the geography of London using the locations of different football teams around the capital.The small shed, stiflingly hot in the summer, is adorned with artwork created by the refugees passing through, including a striking creation by a young refugee artist of a Simurgh bird – known as the king of birds in Persian mythology. For the youngest non-readers, there are ample piles of Lego.The library opened in March 2024 and has proved popular with a traumatised group of people, many of whom have fled conflict zones in countries like Syria and Afghanistan and have made dangerous sea journeys from Turkey to Greece.Miller cites US emeritus professor Mason Cooley to describe the joy of having access to books: “Reading gives us someplace to go when we have to stay where we are.”The library is centrally located within the camp, sandwiched between the units of the Greek cleaning team and Drop in the Ocean, an NGO that provides a laundry service. It has the support of Dimitrios Kantemnidis the managing director of the Lesbos camp.“In the heart of a refugee camp, a library is not just a room with books, it is a sanctuary of hope and healing,” he says. “It stands as a powerful symbol of what connects us across cultures: the transformative power of stories.”Sham, 17, a Syrian refugee, is in the camp with her family. She speaks good English and says her favourite books are Michelle Paver’s Chronicles of Ancient Darkness.“A refugee is a horrible thing to be but this library makes it easier when I’m feeling down. I will never stop reading,” she says.Her dream is to continue her education and become a children’s social worker. A sign inside the library says: “Today a reader, tomorrow a leader.”Miller grew up on Hackney council estate and every Saturday morning walked to the local library with her father. Every week they each chose four books to take home.“For me growing up the library was a special place,” she says, “and I wanted to create a similarly special place for the children in the camp.”Explore more on these topicsLibrariesGreecefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the horrific details are totally prioritised over the motives and the victim. Why are we still gawking at true-crime horrors?Hannah J DaviesMon 16 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn August 2023, delivery driver Aurman Singh was viciously attacked and killed by a group of eight men in Shrewsbury, suffering a traumatic head injury that led to his death. He had been struck with weapons including a golf club and an axe, before his mask-wearing assailants fled in two cars. One eyewitness – whose doorbell camera footage is analysed by police – says Singh’s eyes were “fixed open … it was like someone just pressed stop”.Singh’s killing – dubbed “The DPD Murder” by the programme-makers – was unusually callous and brutal, making for what lead investigator DCI Mark Bellamy describes as a “beast of a job”. It also makes for compelling television, although you may well wonder whether you should be watching it all, in such harsh detail. As its title suggests, Murder 24/7 is wall-to-wall, hour-by-hour death, its six episodes a sobering experience, during which – in spite of the care it affords its cases – you can’t help but feel voyeuristic.The first series – broadcast in 2020 – followed Essex police. This time we’re embedded with West Mercia law enforcement, as they investigate cases including Singh’s murder, which unfolds over two and a half episodes of this six-part series. By the end of the first, there are four men in custody, but only one – Arshdeep Singh (no relation to the deceased) – gives an account of the events leading up to Aurman’s death. There is, of course, footage of their respective police questionings. But, the real selling point is that we also see DS Alex Sullivan – an interview specialist – watching remotely, working out what and when to tell the suspects. In this case, that means figuring out when to tell Arshdeep that they’ve got him bang to rights, as they have a video of him disposing of one of the murder weapons in a wheelie bin.The work that Bellamy and his 45-strong team do is long, painful, and clearly takes a toll (his face in particular is fixed in a permanent frown, and I am happy to learn online that he has since retired from the force). But it is also necessary; in episode two (which airs tomorrow, followed by episode three on Wednesday), a discovery by a member of the public, coupled with that relentless policing, leads to a big breakthrough in the Aurman Singh case. Still, it’s wearying work: looking into Arshdeep’s phone records alone leads to 141,000 pages of calls and messages (a decision is quickly made to just home in on messages from the days leading up to the attack). On the phone of another suspect, more critical evidence is found (or as one officer puts it: “Jagdeep’s in a bit of bother there, in’t he?”)However, while investigating murders is clearly an onerous job, I’m not sure we ever move past the surface of the investigations. Despite dedicating two-and-a-half hours to the Aurman Singh case, we don’t ever get a sense of his killers’ motivations; nor do we get a portrait of Aurman, the 23-year-old at the centre of it all. It’s easy to call crime documentaries voyeuristic, but when you have such a strong sense of how somebody was killed – complete with 3D reconstructions of where the various murder weapons struck their skull – but no idea who they were, it’s difficult to ignore. It’s a criticism you can level at other cases in the series, too, such as that of an elderly man, Ivan, suspected of trying to kill himself and his son after his wife’s death. We see the emotional price paid by Ivan, and by DC Tracy Ruff, who treats his case with rigour but also compassion. But we don’t get a picture of the other two people involved: Ivan’s wife, Maureen, or his son, Gavin. Keeping them off-camera makes sense: Maureen is dead, and Gavin is severely disabled and – we later learn – now in the care of social services. But, with that in mind, is this a story we need to bear witness to at all? Meanwhile, watching The Killer Son – about a man who killed his mother during a psychotic episode – may feel to many like gawking at a totally abject situation.The episodes that focus on a domestic abuser, Damian Homer, feel more complete. There, we hear from his former partner, Stacey Hill, and the focus shifts to the insidious nature of intimate partner violence – which ran concurrent to Stacey and Damian’s happy faces on social media, and which led to the death of Stacey’s mother, Wendy. But, too often, Murder 24/7 attempts to go deep only to end up somewhere shallow. We certainly see how well West Mercia police do their jobs. But, without more of the why, cases such as The Killer Son – or indeed The DPD Murder – feel like true-crime cliche.Murder 24/7 aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

A teenage shepherd called Mabrouk Soltani was murdered and beheaded on Mount Mghila in central Tunisia by members of Jund al-Khilafah (“soldiers of the caliphate”), the Tunisian branch of Islamic State, which habitually hides out in that remote, rugged region. They videoed their grotesque homicide, claiming the boy was an army spy and ordered his terrified 14-year-old cousin, who was with him, to carry the severed head back to his village as a brutal “message” – and this boy obeyed, in a stricken state of trauma that can only be guessed at. This horrifying event was to assume the status of national scandal in Tunisia two years later when thevictim’s elder brother was also murderedby IS in the same place and on the same pretext. (Four jihadis were convicted in 2019 and another 45 in absentia.)Achour’s film centres on the first event, while anticipating the second. Achraf (Ali Helali) goes up the mountain with his older cousin Nizar (Yassine Samouni), who brings his goats there because it is the only place with water for the herd to drink – and because it is beautiful. The nightmarish attack ensues and the village goes into deep shock; the head is kept in a refrigerator and despite the obvious danger of another attack, Nizar’s brother grimly resolves to lead a party of volunteers, including Achraf, back up into the mountain to recover the rest of the body so Nizar can be given a proper burial. All the while the heartless and prurient press gather at his home.The tone seems to be balanced between tragic and macabre, and at first it seems as if Achraf will carry the head in the bag back into his community and, in a state of profound shock, might even go into a state of denial about what has happened. That isn’t the case – or not exactly. Once the awful truth is disclosed, he has to talk to the girl with whom poor Nizar was hopelessly and unrequitedly in love, and this trauma brings her together with Achraf. He also has hallucinatory encounters and conversations with Nizar, which I think don’t entirely work and bring the film close to a kind of emollient fantasy dimension. However the movie is well acted, and honestly attempts to encompass the unbearable grief suffered by the family, although the bizarre element of mystery and the hateful political malice of IS, particularly with the second murder, can’t really be represented.Red Path is in cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsTunisiaIslamic StateAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Spotlight editor Walter “Robby” Robinson (Michael Keaton) travels to Providence to interview a fellow Boston College high school alumnus, where he and the victim, Kevin (Anthony Paolucci), make pleasant small talk about bygone school days. When the subject turns to the school’s hockey coach, Father James Talbot, however, the tone abruptly shifts. Kevin’s face hollows, his eyes deaden, and we see his soul drain from his body. “How’d you find out?” he says in a level, diminished tone that rings with years of trauma.It is a measure of how polished every aspect Spotlight is that, in a cast boasting Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams,world’s second-best ShrekBrian d’Arcy James, and criminally underappreciated performances from Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci, it’s a few moments from Paolucci (who has 12 credits on IMDb, all for small parts like this) that shows Spotlight at its most harrowing.‘Still brings me hope’: why Submarine is my feelgood movieRead moreThat is part of what makesfeelgood moviescomforting for me: a sense of being in good hands. It’s consoling, as I give up a few hours, to know that McCarthy and writing partner Josh Singer will usher me ably and without impediment through the story. After so many rewatches, it’s like having a trusted friend lead me blindfolded through my own home.They don’t waste a single breath in retelling the real-life revelation of Boston’s culture of paedophilic abuse uncovered by Spotlight, covered up by the Catholic church, and abetted by a community that ignored the open secret thatat least 87 priests had abused hundreds of childrenin the Boston archdiocese. Family dinners, drinks with friends, even a Red Sox game all exist solely to impress upon the audience more grisly details of the scandal. All while Spotlight’s reporters reckon with their own lapsed faith, their relationship with their city, and even their own complicity in maintaining the culture of silence that allowed the abuse to continue unabated for decades.Oh yes, sounds like a mug of hot chocolate, doesn’t it?I get it – on the face of things, Spotlight hardly screams feelgood vibes. Though don’t so many of usfind horror movies an unusual comfort? There’s an argument to be made that Spotlight fits into that criterion, harking back to an older style of horror that is brooding in the background: a fear of the unknown that slowly creeps up on the viewer as it is carefully revealed. Though in this case, we see the monster everywhere we go.This is aided by, and in many ways opposite to, the way Spotlight tickles the nostalgic part of our brains. Its washed-out palette of beige chinos and khaki hatchbacks plants us firmly in 2001, before the world became … all of this. For most of its runtime, it’s even pre-9/11. It grants Spotlight a sense of being the deep breath before the plunge; the last vestiges of an innocent world before the impact of incoming horrors, both local (the scandal) and global (theghastly effects of the US’s war on terrorthat we continue to feel today).The serenity that belies the horror at Spotlight’s core, however, makes it a primo Sunday afternoon movie. Never bombastic, it’s an engaging yet relaxing antidote to the threat of the post-Sunday dinner carbohydrate pass-out. If I’m exhausted, miserable or stressed,Spotlightis always something I can watch – that I will watch – even if I can’t imagine being able to concentrate on anything else. After breakups, I watch Spotlight; when my grandmother died, Spotlight; after a horrible day at work, it’s Spotlight. Maybe it’s the film’s stillness, or the latent horror, or both. Spotlight is nothing if not accessible, at least.I only wish more films captured this stillness. They’ve tried –Boston StranglerandShe Saidimmediately come to mind – but none have matched the efficient humanity that weaves around Spotlight’s tight, organised reminder that there remains, hard though it can be to believe, a little bit of justice left in the world. But for me specifically, it’s a curious balm – especially as a journalist. When I’m feeling uninspired, beaten down by the cycle of pitching to dying outlets, defeated by my career choices, I can stick on Spotlight and feel, at least for a couple of hours, a renewed sense of purpose.Explore more on these topicsSpotlightMy feelgood movieMichael KeatonMark RuffaloRachel McAdamsDrama filmsLiev SchreiberStanley TuccifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or are we?Houman BarekatMon 16 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 04.02 EDTShareWhat makes a genius? Pushed to define it, we might say it’s a combination of extraordinary talent and drive, often accompanied by a dash of eccentricity or madness. Ultimately, the designation is conferred by hype; it’s essentially an offshoot of celebrity, which is why, as journalist Helen Lewis notes in her new book. “A genius needs a story as well as achievements”. Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso all made pioneering breakthroughs in their respective fields while living unconventional lives that later became the stuff of legend.Lewis wants us to look at these figures in a more clear-eyed way, and see them as the selfish characters they often were. The lustre of genius, she observes, can provide cover for a multitude of sins: “alcoholism, family abandonment, unfaithfulness, abuse, weirdness, failure to take responsibility”. Since others invariably have to pick up the slack, this amounts to a form of exploitation. Reflecting on Leo Tolstoy’s treatment of his wife, Sophia Tolstaya, over the course of their 48-year marriage, Lewis concludes that the Russian novelist “was a genius, and a parasite”.The concept of genius presupposes a hierarchy of innate talent, and this comes with baggage, because the science of intelligence testing belongs to the same intellectual tradition that brought us eugenics and so-called scientific racism. Lewis introduces us to some of its notable thinkers, beginning with the Victorian anthropologist Francis Galton, whose 1869 book Hereditary Genius proposed that “greatness” ran in families, and including several of his 20th-century disciples, such as the British social psychologist Hans Eysenck and the US physicist William Shockley. Surveying the lives and works of these men, we notice certain recurring themes: iffy research, a tendency to overlook the importance of structural and material factors in determining success, and an enthusiasm for racial hierarchies.“Something about the subject of intelligence has a warping effect on its most furious proponents,” writes Lewis, though it’s probably the other way round – the subject seems to attract people who are neurotically fixated with dominance. For such individuals, the idea of genius functions as a self-validating affectation; it “makes a fetish of contrarianism, and flatters the ‘free thinker’ or ‘heterodox intellectual’ into moving from scepticism to conspiracism”. For his admirers among today’s online right, Elon Musk’s gaucheness is only further proof of his smarts.The book’s central message is that we should refrain from putting people on pedestals just because they happen to be talented. This is sensible, and Lewis’s suggestion that we should apply the term “genius” to specific works, rather than individual people, is persuasive. But the idea that large swathes of the reading public urgently need to be disabused of “the genius myth” is questionable. In one of several sweeping assertions written in the first-person plural, Lewis declares: “We love to contemplate lone rebels, indulge tortured artists and downplay the contributions of those around the genius to paint a more satisfying portrait of superhuman achievement.” Do we? There is an irritating circularity about such pronouncements, whereby the author projects on to the reader the very cliches that underlie her own analysis.The Genius Myth is one of those popular nonfiction books in which an author sells you the disease in order to sell you the cure. As is customary in this genre, it comes with its own bespoke jargon: Lewis has coined a term – “the deficit model of genius” – to denote the prevalence of certain handicaps or character flaws among extremely talented scientists and artists. A banal truism is thus passed off as sociological insight.Lewis strives for the easy, conversational style of a Ted Talk, but her attempt at a pally register comes off stilted and ingratiating. The prose is remarkably heavy on italicisation, which lends a rather laboured feel to the exposition – at times, Lewis sounds as if she is trying to convince herself, quite as much as the reader, that something worthwhile is being imparted.A striking feature of this book is its tone of ambient philistinism, which comes through in a number of revealing asides. Reading Lewis’s kooky capsule summary of James Joyce’s contribution to English literature (“what-if novels, but harder to read”), her high-handed dismissal of “self-conscious precocity and ambition” in film, and her unnecessarily conspiratorial admission that she found Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary,Get Back, “quite boring”, one can’t help wondering if her misgivings about genius might be a bridge for certain personal hangups about rarefied art, and the people who make it.Lewis chides Eysenck for his “airy, assured judgments”, but she’s not above emitting some wind of her own. Her contention that Picasso’s womanising provided “an aspirational ideal to lower-status men trapped in bourgeois domesticity and wage slavery”, and that Donald Trump is therefore his “analogue”, is little more than a therapeutic rant. And Lewis surely overstates her point when she says that Picasso is “revered” not in spite of his personal shortcomings, but literally “because of them”. Again, her own viewpoint is projected outwards: since it’s simply inconceivable that people could care that much about the artworks, anyone who admires Picasso must admire him primarily as a shagger, not a painter.Those credulous Musk fanboys notwithstanding, belief in innate genius – and the special prerogatives afforded to those thought to possess it – is probably less pronounced today than at any point since the 60s. We are increasingly familiar with the stories of brilliant artists who are, or were, terrible human beings, thanks to a slew of articles over recent years, as well as books such asClaire Dederer’s Monsters. With The Genius Myth, Lewis clambers on to a bandwagon that was already starting to creak when, in 2023, the Brooklyn Museum in New York hosteda widely panned exhibitiondedicated to interrogating Picasso’s misogyny. At some point, it will grind to a halt.The Genius Myth: The Dangerous Allure of Rebels, Monsters and Rule-Breakers is published by Jonathan Cape (£22).To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The anthology’s series title has a significant founding story. The poetEavan Boland, a major supporter of women’s talent, was told by a gifted writer in her workshop that she didn’t want her poems to be published. It was because if her neighbours knew she was a poet they’d think she never washed her windows. I hope she and her neighbours since changed their minds.The current collection celebrates the 50th anniversary of Arlen House, Ireland’s first feminist press, with new, unpublished poems by more than 300 poets from Ireland and beyond. Many names will be familiar to readers, among them,Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Medbh McGuckian, Sinéad Morrissey, Rita Ann Higgins, Kerry Hardie and, an unexpected pleasure, Edna O’Brien. The so-far less familiar, younger generations of writers are well-represented: they include Victoria Melkovska, a poet and journalist, born in Ukraine in 1977 and resident in Ireland since 2003.It’s clear from the self-assured informality of tone in This Year Her Present that the writer knows her readers well and effortlessly shares their verbal idioms. Her list of presents from home is cleverly organised by means of a title that functions as a first line, leading to an unexpected negative, “wasn’t”. “Wasn’t” is the key that opens in each quatrain a treasury of earlier gifts from a female relative or friend, based elsewhere, possibly in Kyiv, but persistently “present”. The gifts transport a shared cultural identity, while the donor remains un-named. Obliquely, Melkovska’s poem functions as a “thank you” letter, while being at the same time an entrusting proclamation of her own identity to the wider audience looking over her shoulder.The first present evoked leads to an image of overstocked “sagging bookshelves” – the kind most of us can relate to – inexpensive, ad hoc, not the comfortably rooted bookshelves of long-established library owners. Suggesting a combined love of books and lack of privilege as common denominator, the phrase may help attune readerly sympathies. Elsewhere, the unique preciousness of home is asserted, sometimes through flavoursome gifts of food and drink that might locally be thought exotic, and can’t be obtained “for love or money”.A “vintage” postcard brings the sender’s face into sudden friendly perspective: more mysterious is the “one-of-a-kind” notebook or journal, with its “printed fore-edges / on pastel pages”, designed to reveal glimmers of pattern or picture as you fan the leaves. Melkovska doesn’t tell us directly if painful reminders are carried by the gifts. Each of them, whether a dress or notebook, is welcome and life-enhancing: a talisman.Melkovska’s stanza-structure is generally cohesive, but there’s an exception in stanza five: “[This year her present] wasn’t a sweets box …” “Sweets box” is refreshingly un-idiomatic, and it allows the expansion of the idea that the word “sweets” has a Shakespearean dimension (as in Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 1, “Sweets for the sweet …”). For Melkovska, too, the sweets are not mere confectionery: they contain “the songs we spun on air / and echo of our side-splitting laughs”. This meeting of the giver and the recipient might have been face-to-face, although “on air” could suggest virtual or radiophonic contact. Of course, “spun on air” also evokes “spun sugar” and other kinds of aeration, literal and metaphorical. In any event, there’s no doubt of the happy reciprocity of sweets shared between speaker and present-sender.After the sensuously delicious verbal evocations of Polish “honey mead” in the sixth stanza, the final awaited revelation is particularly stark: “This year her present was / a bottle of Lugol iodine”. The poem might have ended there, with a potent silence and, perhaps, a footnote explaining the purpose of the iodine. Melkovska chooses to follow her structural template, to seek images of the unthinkable, and the name of the unnameable.Besides the “heavy air”, she conjures the light of the radio halo in the newly sinister form of a “radiation halo”.In the context, the reference to “the edge of nuclear war” reminds us there is an edge that politicians, even the worst of them, might draw back from, but that there is no end to the potentiality of such a war when narcissism habitually attracts them to that edge. It’s a reminder, too, that no national borders, no kinds of edge, are observed by radiation.Victoria Melkovska’s first collectionFor the Birdswas published in 2023.

The Parisian artist and DJ, who is the inaugural artist of Tate’s Infinities Commission, explains whyStuart JeffriesMon 16 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘When I was a girl at high school,” says Christelle Oyiri, “we didn’t talk about plastic surgery. Now it’s normal for 18-year-olds to talk about what kind of lip-fillers they’re going to have. Something extraordinary has happened over the past 10 years.”What has changed? It’s not simply about keeping up with the Kardashians, though Oyiri recognises that the reality TV sisters have revolutionised the desires of some. “Kim Kardashian,” she says, “made it fashionable for women to want to look like how I and other black women look naturally because of genetics.”The bigger picture for Oyiri is something of primary concern to any visual artist: the power of the gaze. “We are seeing ourselves and being seen more than ever. That is what digital culture does. The gaze is omnipresent. Not just the gaze of others, but also the internalised gaze.”Oyiri, who is talking to me from her Paris studio via video call, says she often thinks about her mother and grandmother. “At my age, they weren’t seeing themselves as much as I see myself. Today, how could you not be body dysmorphic?”The 33-year-old Parisian artist and DJ explores these vexed concerns in a multimedia installation entitled In a Perpetual Remix Where Is My Own Song? She made this for the new Infinities Commission at The Tanks in London’sTate Modern. In the gallery’s basement, Oyiri’s bronze sculptures have been mounted on sound systems, each one representing the artist in a different guise.View image in fullscreenA different guise … another of Oyiri’s sculptures.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOne sculpture is called Raw, depicting Oyiri naked but modestly clutching her breasts. A second, called Surgery, depicts her with legs toned, abs sculpted, hands on hips, pose defiant, as if a physical makeover has given her a confidence boost. A third, called Mutant, shows Oyiri still naked but with little horns peeping from her forehead. This upgraded Oyiri comes with cloven hooves, a monstrous tail spooling from her coccyx and a diabolical gaze. It’s as if she’s refashioned herself as an avatar for some Tolkienesque video game. In a fourth, called Data Liquid, Oyiri’s head is apparently in the process of being dematerialised by some toxic wind. An allegory, perhaps, for how our human essences risk being destroyed to feed machine-learning AIs.“My art is inquiry-driven,” Oyiri explains. “I didn’t want to have surgical procedures, but to inquire what happens to us when we stage and correct our images.”My goal was to sculpt my body to reinvent the selfIn a sense, what Oyiri is doing in her art is not new. When she was born, in the Parisian suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1992, a few miles across the French capital a feminist artist called Orlan was undergoing a series of cosmetic operations because she believed surgically changing her body could be a powerful work of art. “My goal was to be different, strong – to sculpt my own body to reinvent the self,”Orlan told me when I interviewed her for the Guardian in 2009.So, from 1990 to 1995, the woman born Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte underwent nine plastic surgery operations, intending to rewrite western art on her own body. One operation altered her mouth to imitate that ofFrançois Boucher’s Europa, another altered her chin to look like that ofBotticelli’s Venusand a third involved two little implants – usually used to enhance cheekbones – on either side of her forehead like little horns. Perhaps the horns Oyiri sports in Mutant are little nod to Orlan, whose work she admires. That said, Oyiri’s art hardly sees cosmetic surgery as liberatory, as Orlan seems to have done.One gets a sense of what is at stake for Oyiri with another element of her installation. Behind the speaker stacks that pulsate with electronic music (including Squarepusher’s 8-bit computer classic from 1997 Journey to Reedham) is a vast video backdrop including footage from black strip clubs filmed in the American south. What interested Oyiri about these clubs is that they are both places of seeming self-realisation but are also places where, as Oyiri sums it up: “How women make a living depends on male gaze and satisfying the male gaze.”She adds: “We always change ourselves under the gaze of the other.” That’s to say societal norms and other people’s desires are always at play when we perfect our digital selves with Instagram filters or submit ourselves to Brazilian butt lifts.Oyiri’s Tate Modern installation has come about because she won the inaugural Infinities Commission, designed to “showcase the limitless experimentation of contemporary art”. One reason why she’s such a worthy recipient is that she is from what could be called the margins. “Where I came from, being an artist as I am now was not a thing,” she says. Of Ivorian and Guadeloupean heritage, her creative heroes were musicians, not artists. She looked up to black divas like Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Lil Kim and Nicki Minaj. “They’re the women I wanted to emulate. They’re my icons.”View image in fullscreenAnother digital self … Oyiri’s work at Tate Modern.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHer mum was a nurse at a private hospital, while her dad – “one of those three jobs dudes” she says – worked as a guard at Parisian museums. “I used to explore the collections with him.

Oyiri makesan interesting point in her Tate Modern installation: it’s not just musicians who quote, sample, remix and appropriate – that’s pretty much what happens when we undergo cosmetic surgery or create digital personae.In her late teens Oyiri started DJ-ing under the name Crystallmess. But for the influence of a now defunct New York-based collective and magazine DIS, she might have remained a turntablist rather than what she has become – a multidisciplinary artist working in film, sculpture, music and writing. “There were certain themes I found difficult to explore in music such as colonialism, consumerism and body images that I saw other artists and writers in the DIS collective working on,” she says. “What I learned from these guys is that you don’t have to choose between being a DJ or a visual artist. They created the cross-disciplinary and commercial community I benefit from. You can be multidisciplinary and have it all.”In only a few years, Oyiri has created a dizzying array of installations and multisensory artworks, exhibiting in Europe and the US. For her 2023 solo show in Zurich, she explored her Caribbean heritage with an installation called Venom Voyage, in which the office of a faux travel agency was built. It boasted the chilling business slogan “spreading the travelling bug since 1972” and had its walls emblazoned with paradisiacal images of Caribbean heritage.Venom Voyage showed Oyiri fulfilling her childhood dream of becoming an archaeologist in a way she might not have imagined. She dug into the Caribbean’s paradisal glamour to unearth what lies beneath. “I used to go on holiday as a kid to Guadeloupe and I loved it there,” she recalls. “What I wanted to explore was how our images of paradise conceal the opposite. If you ask someone from the UK or France or Spain, all of which are former imperial nations, what paradise looks like they will say some Caribbean island, right? But I wanted to draw attention to the opposite – beneath this paradise is really crazy wealth disparity. And it’s not really paradise: in Guadeloupe pesticides used in farming cause cancer. Paradise and poison are right next to each other.”View image in fullscreenMultidisciplinary … Oyiri in DJ mode.Photograph: Pierrick Rocher/BFA.com/ShutterstockI ask Oyiri what it’s like to be a black woman of Caribbean ancestry exhibiting at Tate Modern. After all, it was Caribbean sugar that made this temple to art possible – and you don’t have to look too far into the history of sugar to find enslaved people working in plantations. True, neither Tate nor Lyle were slave owners, but as theTate’s own website puts it, both were connected to slavery in “less direct but fundamental ways”.“It is very strange for me,” Oyiri replies. “I have been made aware. Throughout my life, I have had to kind of reverse-engineer all this history.” She mentions Kara Walker – the great African American artist, whose work similarly explores colonialism, race and identity – as one of the people who helped her reverse-engineer herself. Walker’s monumental 2014 sculpture A Subtlety or the Marvellous Sugar Baby, which depicted a white sphinx with an African woman’s features, was displayed at a derelict Brooklyn sugar refinery, in homage to “the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant”. Four years later Walker’s 13-metre tall working fountain Fons Americanus was installed in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall looking like, as Bidisha put it in her Guardian review, “a monumental rebuke to the evils of empire”.How do you follow that? “I don’t! I don’t dream of competing with what Kara Walker did!” Oyiri laughs. “But whatever I do is kind of inspired by the conversations she created. I started to look at the Caribbean in a different way. What was paradise becomes something very different indeed. You just have to look in a different way.”In a Perpetual Remix Where Is My Own Song? opens at Tate Modern, London, on 17 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designTate ModernArtInstallationSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stereophonic’s set designer David Zinn has rendered one meticulously, from the complex console and shabby furnishings of the mixing suite to the fully functioning recording booth it gazes upstage into. As the play’s fictional band gathers behind the glass, the dramatic possibilities of their pressurised containment are immediate.David Adjmi’s music-infused drama – songs by Will Butler of Arcade Fire – arrives from Broadway trailing a record number of Tony nominations for a play, and a now-settled lawsuit. Fleetwood Mac’s erstwhile engineer felt the story too closely resembled the making of their best-known album. Rumours? Echoes, certainly.

In between the kit-tinkering and longueurs are moments of creative transcendence, including a late-night epiphany so electrifying that the sound waves will excite your internal organs. The cast, playing their own instruments, convince as an ensemble of longstanding and Lucy Karczewski, as Diana, has a voice that captivates even when it is exposed and cracking in a tense overdubbing session.Behind the mixing desk, Eli Gelb and Andrew Butler reprise their Broadway roles as inexperienced-but-ambitious engineer Grover and his oblivious sidekick Charlie. Grover may begin as a comic foil, desperate to avoid the whirlpool of angst, but like every character (including Jack Riddiford’s infuriating Peter) he is empathically realised across the band’s year-long odyssey. At more than three hours, the run time can feel as indulgent as one of Pink Floyd’s longer tracks – but this is an extraordinary allegory for artistic perfectionism and the destruction it leaves in its wake.At theDuke of York’s theatre, Londonuntil 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

And, as David Pountney’s striking production for Grange Park Opera proves, Tchaikovsky’s rarely staged melodic sleeping beauty has lost none of its power to unsettle the stomach while titillating the ear.The work is timely. The Pushkin poem at the opera’s heart concerns an 18th-century Ukrainian war hero whose grab for independence wouldn’t be realised until 1991. That the grizzled Hetman (a term for an administrative ruler) is also a relentless torturer who murders his latest girlfriend’s father is, to a curious extent, neither here nor there. Throughout the opera, we are rooting for him, if not all, then certainly most of the way.Historically, Mazeppa was a regional leader who defied Peter the Great in the hope of freeing his country from the Russian yoke. Tchaikovsky’s romantic subplot concerns Mariya, a young woman who leaves her parents for a life of adventure with the charismatic warlord. When her father tries to shop him to the tsar, the old man is promptly handed over to Mazeppa to be killed. After the Hetman is defeated in battle, Mariya duly loses her mind, expiring on the corpse of a faithful childhood friend.View image in fullscreenSterling support … John Findon (Andrei) and Rachel Nicholls (Mariya) in Mazeppa.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDirectorially it’s presented as very much a play for today, with Francis O’Connor’s efficient, movable set and Tim Mitchell’s stark lighting creating an all too recognisable world where oligarchs and mercenaries vie for power and violent death is only a heartbeat away. After an oddly sluggish start, Pountney is quickly into his stride. Repurposing the famous hopak (an energetic Ukrainian dance) as an interlude, he even finds a moment of humour as the lovers embark on a crazy choreographed motorcycle ride, stopping off at a motel for a quickie before hitting the road again. The gruesome violence, when it comes, includes the extraction of several teeth, one eyeball and execution by giant jump leads.Grange Park has assembled a fine cast led by David Stout whose ageing Mazeppa is a cross between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the leader of a chapter of the Hells Angels. Joking aside, it’s a moving and dramatically crafted performance wedded to a firm baritone with plenty of heft. Rachel Nicholls’ lightning-bolt soprano is well suited to the steely but ultimately vulnerable Mariya, the voice only occasionally unsteady towards the top.John Findon offers sterling support as the hapless Andrei and Luciano Batinic brings nobility to Mariya’s father Kochubey, singing through mounting layers of blood and gore. Sara Fulgoni is fierce if a trifle squally as his wife. The only reservation is Mark Shanahan’s occasionally routine conducting of the English National Opera Orchestra. Tchaikovsky’s fervent score deserves more oomph.Mazeppa is atGrange Park Opera, Surrey, until 6 JulyExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the acclaimed author’s new play they have central roles, in a remote Sligo setting where they are sleeping rough in eerie caves on the outskirts of a town. Homeless and unwelcome in the area, these two have hit middle age and are lost, in ways they can’t acknowledge.Frustrated with each other, yet unable to separate or to leave, even when threatened with arrest, the brothers’ mutually dependent predicament has echoes of Beckett and Enda Walsh. Martin McDonagh’s The Lonesome West hovers in the background too – although Barry’s take on rural dysfunction contains less violence and a lot more depression.View image in fullscreenSearching for a signal … Tommy Tiernan.Photograph: Ros KavanaghHere the pair’s escapism comes in online form, through the stolen smartphones and laptops that are scattered around designer Joanna Parker’s imposingly abstract, almost lunar landscape setting. As they grapple with parts of a broken-down van, tyres, ladders and junk, they desperately attempt to get an internet connection to check the latest updates from a Mexican actress with whom Bopper is obsessed to the point of losing grip on reality.In Caitríona McLaughlin’s production, the brothers’ comic double-act is given full rein, with Monaghan bringing knockabout physical energy to the anguished Bopper, while Tiernan’s background in standup comedy allows Archie to be a more deadpan foil. Stretched over 13 scenes, each announced with a surtitle – “Scene 10, The Descent of Man” – the play at times seems like a series of gags, sketches and one-liners, treating the pair’s physical and mental deterioration with a familiar black humour that lacks some emotional underpinning.The local garda sergeant, Helen, whose connection to the pair is not immediately revealed, is an underwritten role, with which Judith Roddy does her wry best. It takes an explanatory epilogue from Helen to fill in some of the gaps. Her police statement adds a layer of reflective poignancy that earlier came only in snatches, as when Archie wonders about their cave-dwelling ancestors and they briefly contemplate “the purpose of the brothers McRae”.AtAbbey theatre, Dublin, until 18 July; then atTown Hall theatre, Galway, 22-26 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAbbey theatreKevin BarryIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

She used to say, if you see a show that you like the look of, I’ll get tickets. So I’d go on the Royal Court website and if there were many black people in the cast, I’d want to go because I could see myself.I would have been around 16 when I sawSucker Punchby Roy Williams. It’s about two young men who know that their bodies can be a kind of tool to better themselves so they fall into boxing. An aspiring white promoter zeroes in on their talent. It is about rivalry, but also about how community works together, and is a really good investigation of masculinity and the ownership of black bodies.I had been to shows at the Royal Court before but they transformed the space for Sacha Wares’ 2010 production. It was completely 360-degree, in the round. I remember the accuracy of the boxing ring, the ropes. It was visceral. The actors were dripping with sweat. And when they moved, we moved, because we thought we were going to get punched! The acting felt so charged and so full-body, as if they’d been plucked from the street. We were fully in it – as if you could ultimately step into the characters’ roles if you just walked a couple of metres. It felt very real. I came away feeling, I need to understand how this is made.It was my first time seeingDaniel Kaluuya. I remember him winking at me and my mum in the audience.

So why has he taken so long to release his new album? And can we please see his diamond-crusted Virgin Mary medallion?Mon 16 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 09.37 EDTShareSlick Rick is tucking into a late room-service breakfast in his Park Lane hotel room. He is back in London, the city his family emigrated from when he was a boy, because he’s launching a new album, Victory, his first since 1999’s The Art of Storytelling, which featured an array of guest artists – including Outkast, Nas and Snoop Dogg – paying homage to one of hip-hop’s legendary figures.Even today, he remains the rapper’s rapper, the most-sampled hip-hop artist in history. Ghostface Killah has called him the greatest of all time. Eminem described himself as “a product of Slick Rick”, Jay-Z likened him to Matisse and Mark Ronson once gave a Ted talk dissecting his work. Questlove called his voice “the most beautiful thing to happen to hip-hop culture”.Jay-Z likened him to Matisse. Mark Ronson did a Ted talk dissecting his workSo what has he been doing for the last 26 years? He’s keen to point out that he’s been busy. There was a lengthy battle with US immigration (he was granted American citizenship in 2016); guest appearances on tracks by Jay-Z, Missy Elliott and Mariah Carey among others; collaborations with fashion brands; a real estate empire to tend to. A smart cookie, Slick Rick invested his 80s earnings in property in the Bronx in New York City, the downside of which, “delinquent tenants and such”, is explored in an exasperated track on Victory called Landlord. But it took a meeting with actor Idris Elba “at a celebrity-type party thing” to bring a new album to life: Victory was recorded at Elba’s homes in London and Paris. Uniquely among his catalogue, the results lean into the former Ricky Walters’s British roots: UK rapper Giggs makes a guest appearance, as does Estelle, and the accompanying videos were shot in south London.View image in fullscreenPre-eyepatch … in the early days.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThe bracelet on his wrist is platinum and enormous, his watch definitely warrants the description “iced out” but, by Slick Rick’s standards at least, he’s dressed down. The patch that covers his right eye, injured by glass from a broken window when he was two, is just an eye patch, rather than the jewel-encrusted variety that has become his trademark (Sotheby’s sold one of them last year for $25,000), and there’s no sign of his famous neck chains complete with vast pendants.On a day when he’s feeling more flamboyant, Slick Rick looks as if he’s wearing a jewellery store’s entire window display around his neck. It’s a style he says he borrowed from mid-80s drug dealers in Baychester, the neighbourhood of the Bronx to which his family relocated from Mitcham in 1976, seeking a better life. “Crack cocaine was everywhere, and people that was getting rich off crack had enormous jewellery and nice cars and pretty girls – it was like they were giants. Once you get past the stigma of it being bad, you can harvest the beauty out of what you saw. When we saw the jewellery looking like that, it was like, ‘You can’t go back to small. You can’t go back to gold with no diamonds on it.”No, he frowns, he’s not dialling his look down now he’s reached his 60s. Quite the opposite: he heads to his bedroom and returns with a huge, diamond-encrusted medallion featuring the Virgin Mary. “You’re selling yourself, you know what I mean? Let’s say you ain’t made a record in 26 years – you’re like an old, washed-up, broke motherfucker, do you know what I mean? But when you present yourself like that, it makes people look at you different: ‘Oh, I thought you was a broke ass’. The music eventually catches up, but in the meantime, you sell yourself.”View image in fullscreenBig names … with Snoop Dogg, left.Photograph: Johnny Nunez/Getty Images for Slick RickSelling his image is something Slick Rick’s proved exceptionally good at: in the US you can buy not just Slick Rick T-shirts, but Halloween costumes, even rugs. Not that there was any danger of it overshadowing his music.He was like no one else in mid-80s hip-hop. Rapping in a soft, conversational, singsong voice, he sounded less like someone addressing an audience than a man telling a particularly ornamented anecdote, with one eyebrow permanently raised at the absurdity of it all. It just came out that way, he says: “At the time, I was probably the only English rapper, but I mixed it with an American accent, because I’m trying to be cool.” And indeed there’s something slightly disconcerting about meeting Slick Rick, at least if you’ve spent the last 40 years listening to his work: in conversation, he soundsexactlylike he does on record.At the time, I was probably the only English rapper, but I mixed with an American accent, trying to be coolHe says that moving from Mitcham to the Bronx was a culture shock – “it was like being in Disneyland or something, more variety of music, food, cultures” – but equally he was in the right place at the right time. In his early teens, hip-hop’s first stirrings swept Black neighbourhoods in the Bronx. He can remember seeing the Cold Crush Brothers performing in a local park – “four or five of them, two DJs, choreographed dance steps, it was just beautiful to us” – and the disappointment of hearing the first hip-hop singles. “They didn’t sound like they did in the streets.”By then, he had his own group, the Kangol Crew, with their own look – “the Kangol hat with a little suit jacket, we was popular in school because we stood out”. But really, he says, it was “just kids banging on the desks and making up rhymes, like competing with each other to make the team laugh”. Still, it was the root of his distinctive approach to writing: rather than just bragging, he took to writing stories, illuminating them by taking on characters and adopting different voices. He says he got the latter idea from the children’s records by Alvin and the Chipmunks, on which actor Ross Bagdasarian would manipulate tapes of his voice to create characters, effectively holding conversations with himself, although Slick Rick’s characters and stories were infinitely more outrageous. “That was just me entertaining my age group. Later, critics said it was misogynistic or whatever, but if you’re trying to entertain children your age, that’s going to come with it. You’re not going to nitpick and chip away at it – don’t use that word, don’t use this word – because you’ll mess up the humour.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not looking for a legacy’ … performing at the Soul Train awards in 2013.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images for BETHis real break came when he entered a talent contest at a local club called The Armoury: one of the judges was Doug E Fresh, already making a name for himself as “the original human beatbox”: they teamed up and started making tapes together. “Then someone leaked the tapes to the radio and they just got so popular that a record label thought they should put it out, and then … it went international.”It certainly did: credited to Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew, 1985’s The Show sold 1m copies in the US and reached the Top 10 in Britain. But it was the B-side, La Di Da Di, that cast the longest shadow: a lengthy shaggy dog story and showcase for MC Ricky D (as he was then known), packed with endlessly quotable lines, it’s subsequently been sampled more than 1,200 times, by virtually every major rapper – from 2Pac to Kanye West, Run-DMC to Tyler, the Creator – and a dizzying array of non-hip-hop artists: La Di Da Di is probably the only thing the oeuvre of Miles Davis shares with that of the Vengaboys, or indeed BTS. It’s provided the hook for the Notorious BIG’s Hypnotize, the chorus for Miley Cyrus’s We Can’t Stop and a melancholy counterpoint on Lana Del Rey’s Doin’ Time. It rumbles in the background of Beyoncé’s Party, was covered in its entirety by Snoop Dogg – whose vocal style owes a considerable debt to Slick Rick’s – and Robbie Williams borrowed its lyrics on Rock DJ. “It draws people in,” suggests Rick of its longevity. “It’s like watching a half-hour comedy special or something. And it taught the kids that they could go in another direction – ‘[other hip-hop] is just braggadocious, you can go this way too’.”His solo debut album The Great Adventures of Slick Rick was a platinum seller, spawning more heavily sampled classics in Hey Young World and Children’s Story, which subsequently formed the basis of Montell Jordan’s This Is How We Do It and TLC’s Creep, respectively. Then everything went wrong.A cousin, hired as a bodyguard, attempted to extort money from him: when he was let go, he threatened to kill the rapper and his mother. The situation escalated, shots were fired, and Slick Rick was convicted of attempted murder, serving five years (he was given a full pardon in 2008). He recorded two more albums, 1991’s The Ruler’s Back and 1994’s Behind Bars, while on bail or day release. He doesn’t want to talk about his jail time today, nor does he mention either of those albums in the list of achievements he enumerates on Victory (“They were rushed, made on bail. I didn’t reach my full potential. I don’t want to undercut my audience with filler tracks,” he shrugs) although Behind Bars in particular has some stellar moments. The heartbreaking All Alone (No One to Be With) presses his classic storytelling into the service of a song about a single mother’s life going haywire, and the chilling title track is, as he puts it, “a child’s imagination of what everybody perceives jail to be – dangerous, you might get raped, you might get extorted”.It is undoubtedly a peculiar situation: an artist who has exerted a vast influence on hip-hop, while only releasing five albums in a 41-year career, two of which he disowns. But Slick Rick seems noticeably more interested in showing me his design for a platform-soled version of the Clarks Wallabee shoe – “it’s modern, it’s perfect,” he enthuses – than he is in discussing his legacy. “It doesn’t matter. You just live your life and then let it resonate how it resonates, let it inspire how it inspires. I’m not really looking for a legacy or nothing like that. Just let it happen how it happens, OK?”It’s probably an easy thing to say when you know your fellow rappers have spent decades calling you a legend, but no matter: the great Slick Rick shakes my hand, and returns his attention to his sausage and eggs.Victory is out now on 7Wallace/Mass AppealExplore more on these topicsHip-hopSlick RickinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s 2012, 2am and we’re in her bedroom playing our favourite Jurassic Park drinking game, where you swig every time you see a dinosaur.“Isit, though?” I said, doubtfully, dipping a Walkers Sensation in some coleslaw.View image in fullscreenSlaying … Jurassic Park’s T rex.Composite: Guardian Design; FlixPix/Alamy“Course it is. All the gays loveJurassic Park. Don’t be an idiot, Jones.” She pointedly slapped down the lid on the coleslaw as if that were the end of the matter.I thought about it a bit and ultimately agreed with her. I absolutely loved Jurassic Park. And so did just about every queer person I knew. Jurassic Park, in fact, made me feelproud.Prouder than seeing a load of 00s popstrels perform at Pride parades, prouder than drinking in the street in Soho, prouder even thanM&S’s Pride sandwich. Granted, my judgment was a little clouded from the drinking game. But still.I’ve since wondered if this was specific to my strange little bubble of pop-culture-obsessed London reprobates. But its surprisingly innuendo-ready quotes (“clever girl”, “hold on to your butts”, “dinosaur eats man, woman inherits the Earth”) and unforgettable performances (human and raptor) are an enduring staple everywhere from drag brunches to bleary afterparties.London’s historic queer venue the Royal Vauxhall Tavern helda Jurassic Park cabaret nightin 2023 called “Life Finds a Slay”. In San Francisco last year, the Brava theatre hosted “Jurassic Drag”, two Jurassic Park nights celebrating various drag legends (“they’ve survived a hostile world and trekked the Earth collectively for more than 170 years … which we all know in drag time is roughly 250 million”). Also last year, the Canadian podcaster and academic Hannah McGregor published a feminist-focused queer memoir, Clever Girl, billed as “a smart and incisive exploration of everyone’s favourite dinosaur movie and the female dinosaurs who embody what it means to be angry, monstrous and free”. (An honourable mention goes to the British gay couple and their dog whowent viralin 2020 for recreating scenes from the films during lockdown.)It makes sense when you look at the first two movies. Their director, Steven Spielberg, has always had a propensity for the camper, more fun side of mild to moderate peril, flinging damsels into snake pits and children into shark-infested waters at the first chance he gets. He and the screenwriter David Koepp wield this impish inclination with gusto in Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park: The Lost World, whether it’s a dilophosaurus wobbling her wattles or Julianne Moore gasping on glass over a gulch. Laura Dern is constantly in peril in the first movie – and for a lot of gay men, women in peril is a favourite genre – there is a stampede of psychosexual and misogynistic issues to dive into withthatone. (Other notable women-in-peril franchises beloved of gay men include Scream, Buffy, Tomb Raider and, depending on Tyra Banks’s mood, America’s Next Top Model.)Also, if you are a millennial gay man, Jeff Goldblum’s tanned, heaving bosom inside a liberally unbuttoned shirt was definitely at leastpartof your sexual awakening. A special mention should go to Bob Peck as park warden Robert Muldoon, who sported short-shorts that would make even Lara Croft raise one of her perfectly plucked eyebrows. (The later Jurassic World films are notably sanitised, safe and sexless in comparison – like smooth, scaly iPhones.)Really, though, if I stand up in the Jeep, take off my sunglasses and really look at it, themainreason I find pride in Jurassic Park is right there, rumbling and stomping in front of me: the dinosaurs.Dinosaurs are deeply camp – their fierce, confident assuredness followed by their fiery, dramatic downfall. Their strutting, swaggering gaits. It’s very drag, with their relentless energy and fierce joie de vivre, not to mention their various ruffs and feathers and talons and shiny teeth. They just served.Some may say it’s ridiculous to have an emotional affinity with 65m-year-old extinct reptiles, to which I say: why is it any more ridiculous than having an affinity with Strictly Come Dancing or Taylor Swift or raccoons? It’s not. It’s completely normal. Now, pass those night-vision goggles: we’re going to Hampstead Heath."

But then I took controlRo MitchellMon 16 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 06.59 EDTShareIwish I could say that if my teenage self had a window to the future, she would be proud of the person I’ve become. But, in truth, I think she would dislike me just as much as she disliked herself. Back then, I could have spoken for hours about all of the reasons I hated the person I was. And that wasn’t something I believed would change. I used to be all-consumed by my inner critic: the critical voice in my head was much louder than any rational thoughts or words of affirmation others offered me.I had an eating disorder. Each day was a monotonous cycle of exercising as much as possible and eating as little as I could get away with. I was miserable, and it was all because of the cage I’d built within my own mind. This is not something unique to people with eating disorders. I’ve realised, after sharing my story online, that so many people have this unkind voice in their heads, critiquing their every move. And that when you start to talk back, your life improves in ways you wouldn’t expect.If someone else had said these words to me every day, I’m sure I would have recognised it as bullyingBefore I knew I was controlled by my inner critic, I took everything it said as fact. My self-esteem was so low. I’d stand in front of the mirror and the barrage of insults would begin: ugly, fat, useless, unlovable, spotty, disgusting. If someone had said these words to me every day, I’m sure I would have recognised it as bullying. But coming from my own mind, they felt justified and accurate.But one day, standing in front of my bedroom mirror, I realised this was just a voice. This voice that took such pleasure in reminding me how utterly worthless I was, wasn’t actually my own. It was a separate entity to me. Suddenly, everything changed. Every time I noticed my inner critic calling me lazy and unproductive, I started to stick up for myself. I would tell myself: “Actually, I don’t need to be doing anything now, I deserve to rest”. If it called me ugly, I would remind myself that I didn’t need to be so hard on myself.The one change that worked: meditation cured my insomnia – and transformed my relationshipsRead moreFor the last five years, I tried hard to say nice things about myself in my head until neutral self-talk felt normal. It hurts to know how unkind to myself I was. I feel incredibly sad for that version of me.While I occasionally still have to remind myself not to be self-critical, my inner critic has slipped away. Therapy and journalling has helped me to find joy in self-acceptance. I can make a mistake and instead of berating myself, I can reassure myself. I no longer shrink myself to please my inner critic, I have learned to stand up for myself. I know now that just because you think something that doesn’t make it true.How to Talk to Yourself by Ro Mitchell is published by Bluebird.

As a small child, I’d gaze up at the posters ofFreddy KruegerorPinheadin our local video rental shop with a curious mix of fear and desire. I wanted to be scared, and I also did not. I was 11 when Channel 4 screened A Nightmare on Elm Street. My poor mum, assuming it couldn’t bethatbad if it was on TV, let me record it. I watched through my fingers, drunk on anxiety, the anticipation of the kills almost unbearable. There is, I would argue, something quite queer about this complicated urge. Horror is titillating.View image in fullscreenQueer subtext … Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street series.Composite: Guardian Design; Collection Christophel/AlamyThe golden age of the slasher movie was the 1970s and 80s. I’m sure film-makers were inspired by the cultural austerity of the Reagan era, theMoral Majorityand the unfolding Aids crisis. But, as a child, I was blissfully unaware of those things or my burgeoning queerness. I just knew I wanted to watch these films.Some horror films are explicitly queer in tone. Hellraiser is quite clearly about anal sex (“The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond limits; pain and pleasure, indivisible”). Sleepaway Camp, from 1983, features a controversial reveal: the killer, “Angela”, turns out to be actually her brother, Peter – forced to live as a girl by her insane mother. FYI that’s not usually how being transgender works.As a suburban tween, I wasn’t primed for queer subtext, even in the gayest one of all:A Nightmare on Elm Street2: Freddy’s Revenge (now the subject of its own (very good) documentary Scream, Queen!). I didn’t even pick up on the none-too-subtle allegory of poor Jesse (Mark Patton) being “entered” by Freddy and forced to kill his leather-clad PE teacher in the gym showers. When the female love interest attempts to comfort the understandably distressed Jesse, he rejects her and instead cries on a strapping male friend instead.I’d argue that the queerness of slasher films is more compelling when it’s less obvious, usually through: the killer and the final girl.View image in fullscreenThe ultimate revenge … Sissy Spacek in Carrie.Photograph: Album/AlamyAt first glance, there’s an obvious “otherness” to the killer in a slasher film.Carrie, Prom Night,Friday the 13thand Terror Train all hinge around a vulnerable, different-coded character (or a relation thereof) seeking vengeance over a historical wrong. In Carrie, the gory revenge of Carrie White is almost orgasmic. Sissy Spacek’s titular character suffers great indignity for almost the entire run-time, until she unleashes a torrent of murderous rage at those who have mocked her, providing a rush of emotional release for the viewer. While some of Carrie’s victims are somewhat sympathetic, the vast majority have it coming. I am happy to confess that, while I was being relentlessly bullied all through high school, I did wish from time to time that I could “pull a Carrie”.Carol J Clover’s seminal 1992 book Men, Women and Chainsaws examines the feminist subtext of horror movies, but I think we can apply much of her logic to a queer reading of the same texts. Clover argues that most slasher films, rather than being purely sadistic male-gaze fantasies, instead encourage viewers to empathise with what she deems the female “victim-hero”.The final girl is the one character who makes it to the closing credits intact, and it was this character I saw myself in. Until 1996’s meta-heavyScream, the final girl was usually asexual – babysitting or eye-rolling while her more libidinous friends shagged their way to the grave. Prime examples are the chaste Laurie Strode (Halloween) and Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street). As a young queer viewer who considered the notion of sex scarier than slasher Jason Voorhees, I found safety in these girls abstaining from sexual relationships.When did you last see a man begging for his life in a horror movie?Read moreClover posits that the mild-mannered high-schooler often transforms into a masculinised tough girl by the end of the film. She emasculates the (usually male) killer by removing his (usually phallic) weapon and then, often, kills him with it. This formula still holds true, withTerrifier 2,The Invisible ManandMaXXXinejust a few recent examples. In each case, our girl is in some way different from her peers; she is quieter, smarter, or possesses some form of heightened insight. She is often disbelieved by her friends or authorities when she confides her trauma. She is oppressed, both by her stalker and by those who deny her reality. By the end, she has overcome her oppressor and walks away a more fully formed version of herself; a survivor.And if that’s not queer, I don’t know what is.Juno Dawson is the author ofHer Majesty’s Royal Coven. The final book in the series,Human Rites, is released 17 July 2025."

This one is easily my favourite so far: the cloves lend a wonderful smokiness, and if you can pop the chicken in the marinade in the morning, it will have taken on an amazing depth of flavour by the evening. This would work just as well on a barbecue – just scale up the amount of chicken and the marinade ingredients as needed.Tandoori chicken skewers with coriander chutneyYou will need four large metal or bamboo skewers (if using the latter, soak them in water for half an hour first).

Thread the chicken pieces on to four skewers, then cook on a very high heat for three minutes on each side, until cooked through. To check, cut into a piece of chicken: if need be, cook the skewers for another minute on each side. If you don’t have skewers, cook the chicken in a single layer in a searingly hot frying pan for the same amount of time, flipping the pieces over as required – this is a bit more fiddly than turning skewers, though.Leave the cooked chicken to rest for three or four minutes, then serve hot with the chutney alongside, or wrap in flatbreads with shredded lettuce, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsChickenQuick and easyFoodMeatMain courseIndian food and drinkBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"

She made superlative chicken pies, and I always think of them at this time of year. Mum would use shop-bought pastry, but here I’ve made a herby rough puff to up the summery feeling. The onion and anchovy turnovers, meanwhile, are the perfect pocket savouries to keep you going on a long walk or day out. You could always make one batch of pastry and halve the amount of both fillings, so you can have some of each.Chicken and herb piePrep15 minChill1 hr 20 minCool1 hrCook2 hr 10 minServes4-6For the herby rough puff pastry50g flat-leaf parsley,picked and finely chopped1 bunchlemon thyme,leaves stripped and finely chopped, stalks reserved for the filling300g cold unsalted butter, diced500g plain white stone-ground flourA pinch of fine saltA little milk, for brushingFor the filling1 lemon, zest finely grated, the fruit left whole1 bunch dill,leaves picked1 bunch tarragon,leaves picked1 medium-sized chicken1 small onion2garlic cloves½ tsp black peppercornsSalt and black pepper50g butter, plus extra for greasing1 bunchspring onions, trimmed and sliced3 rashersstreaky bacon, roughly chopped50g flour250g creme fraicheEgg wash or cream, for brushingFlaky sea saltTo make the pastry, combine the herbs with the butter, kneading them through until you have a brightly speckled butter, then chill for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, get on with the pie filling. Put the zested lemon and herb stalks in a large pan with the chicken, onion, garlic and peppercorns. Cover with water, bring to a simmer, then add a couple of generous pinches of salt and poach for about 45 minutes, until the chicken legs pull away easily from the body. Leave to cool in the stock for an hour.Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Retrieve the chilled butter, cut it into chunks and toss these through the seasoned flour until every chunk is well coated. Flatten the pieces of butter between your fingertips, then pour over 220g cold water and toss through the butter and flour. Squeeze the mix together with your hands, until you have a shaggy-looking lump of dough.Roll out the dough into a 30cm x 15cm rectangle, then cut it into three 5cm x 15cm strips. Stack these on top of each other, turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat the rolling and stacking once more. Chill for an hour.Now lift out the cooled chicken and strip off all the meat. Strain the stock, return it to the pan and reduce to 500ml.In a second pan, melt the butter, then fry the spring onions and bacon for three to five minutes, until the onions are soft. Sprinkle in the flour, cook until you have a thick roux, then add the reduced stock and cook for a few minutes until thickened. Stir in the creme fraiche, reserved lemon zest, herbs and chicken meat, season with salt and pepper, then leave to cool.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and lightly grease a 23cm springform tin. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry until it’s large enough to line the tin with some overhang. Use the rolled out pastry to line the tin, then spoon in all the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry until it’s large enough to cover the top of the pie. Brush the edges with a little water, then drape the pastry over the pie to enclose it. Trim the edges, then press all around with the back of a fork to seal. Use any pastry offcuts to decorate the top.Put on a lined baking tray, brush with egg wash or cream, sprinkle with flaky salt and pepper, and cut a small vent or two in the top. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until deeply golden and bubbling. Leave to cool slightly before unmoulding from the tin.Onion and anchovy turnoversView image in fullscreenAnna Higham’s onion and anchovy turnovers.Prep10 minChill1 hr 20 minCook1 hr 40 minMakesAbout 18For the herby rough puff pastry50g flat-leaf parsley,picked and finely chopped1 bunch lemon thyme,leaves stripped and finely chopped300g cold unsalted butter, diced500g plain white stone-ground flourA pinch of fine saltFor the filling75g butter6-8 tinned or jarred anchovy fillets, drained and chopped, plus 2 tsp oil from the tin or jar5 medium-large mixed onions, peeled and thinly sliced2 big pinches of saltBlack pepperTo make the pastry, combine the chopped herbs with the butter, kneading until it’s evenly speckled, then chill for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, make the filling.

Chill for an hour.When the onions are very soft, take off the lid and carry on cooking for about 20 minutes more, until the onions have started to deepen in colour. Take off the heat and leave to cool.Take the pastry out of the fridge and cut it in half. Firmly tap both pastry halves with the length of the rolling pin, to flatten them. Roll one piece into a large square about 3mm thick, then cut into nine even squares. Chill in the fridge while you roll and cut the other pastry half.Lay out all the pastry squares on a work surface and divide the onion filling between them. Fold each turnover into a triangle, and press the edges with the back of a fork to seal. Put on a lined baking tray, sprinkle with flaky salt and black pepper, and cut a small vent into each turnover.

The pharmacy assistant insisted, despite my questioning, that I was exempt from prescription charges.Two weeks later I returned with another prescription, and was told that they had made a mistake and I was liable for charges after all. I paid the outstanding fee on the spot.I have since received a letter fromtheNHSBusiness Services Authority (NHSBSA) stating that I will be fined for non-paymentof the original prescription.I have provided evidence of payment, and my pharmacist has written to it confirming the error, but the NHSBSA saysboth are inadmissible.Reviewers reporting a similar experience on Trustpilot compare NHSBSA’s intransigence to the Post Office’s behaviour during the Horizon scandal, andI have to agree.LM,Leamington SpaThe number of blameless people fined by the NHSBSA for non-payment is a scandal thatI exposed and have covered repeatedly. They include new mothers and cancer patients who are entitled to free prescriptions but who, due to an oversight by medical staff, were not registered for an exemption certificate.The NHSBSA, which checks patient exemptions on behalf of the NHS, insisted that, because you didn’t pay the charge on the day you collected the prescription, you were liable for a fine, which is five times the prescription fee plus the original charge.It reversed at speed when I got in touch and, hours later, informed you that you were in the clear. Its statement implies it repented its intransigence unprompted.“Following investigation, we recognise that, in this case, the patient realised the error and acted quickly to correct the issue before receiving an inquiry letter from the NHSBSA. We have therefore been able to close the case and remove the penalty charge in this instance,” it says.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

It’s your body’s way of signalling effort – “and more effort tends to signal more reward”. This may include a feeling of discomfort and a desire to stop if you have a racing heart or burning muscles: a stress response that evolved to regulate exertion. Perkin adds: “If exercise didn’t induce some discomfort, we’d all just do it constantly, and be fatigued.”Then there’s delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms), the ache you can feel a day or two after a workout. “It’s thought it may be a protective mechanism – your body’s way of telling you that muscle needs time to recover,” says Perkin.Low-impact exercise such as walking and cycling can be really effective – particularly when done for extended periods of timeIs it true that … taking collagen supplements slows signs of ageing?Read moreBut your starting point matters. When you begin exercising, movement may feel more uncomfortable, but as your body adapts, you may move more efficiently or develop stronger mental resilience. Then it will feel easier, but you’ll probably still be making gains.Doms is also more likely to be caused by some exercises than others, no matter your level of exertion. Workouts that are new to you are more likely to trigger it, so can those, like running downhill, that cause muscles to stretch while under tension.“You don’t need to experience a lot of pain to make improvements,” says Perkin, especially if you’re starting from a low baseline. Low-impact exercise such as walking and cycling can be really effective – particularly when done for extended periods of time. “Any movement – even if it doesn’t feel tough – is far better than doing nothing,” he says.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …FitnessHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A red kite cavorts in the breeze over handsome parkland, a cuckoo calls and, down by the Wissey, a gin-clear chalk stream, reed warblers chunter from deep within the rushes.Bodney Hall mapIf ever a region deserved to be its own county, it’s Breckland. This is a unique swath of south Norfolk and north Suffolk dominated by sandy heathland. It has an unusually dry climate more typical of central Europe and is notable for its rare plants and birds. Once an area dominated by inland sand dunes and commercial rabbit warrens, since the 20th century it’s been planted with the pines and conifers of Thetford forest. These woods offer a wealth of walks but there is also the vast Stanta army training area, 30,000 acres in size, where people cannot go – and other species thrive.We savour a long evening swim to the soundtrack of cuckoos, reed warblers and even a booming bitternBreckland is a stronghold for charismatic endangered birds such as the goggle-eyed stone-curlew, dashing forest-dwelling goshawks and enigmatic, nocturnal nightjars. It’s home to ultra-rare and fantastically named plants and invertebrates, from theprostrate perennial knawelto thewormwood moonshiner beetle. It has every conservation designation going and would undoubtedly be a national park if so much of it hadn’t been commandeered by the military.This land is usually overlooked by visitors whizzing through en route to the Norfolk coast or Norwich. It’s perhaps not helped by an absence of pretty towns and fancy restaurants (although well-heeled Bury St Edmunds on its southern edge boasts the Michelin-starredPea Porridge). I live 30 miles away and I’ve never brought my family for a holiday here, until now.View image in fullscreenThe writer swimming at Bodney Hall Farm.Photograph: Patrick BarkhamMy children immediately take toBodney Hall Farm, where we are staying in a beautifully renovated cottage, the smaller of two high-end self-catering options. Guests are given the run of the 40-acre grounds and gardens which roll down to the River Wissey and feature a magical mix of interesting trees, formal planting, wildflowers and wildlife.I live 30 miles away and I’ve never brought my family for a holiday here, until nowWe stroll the banks of this private stretch of the Wissey. Since relocating from London in 2016, owners Henry and Anna Sands have been restoring the river, encouraging natural wiggles and bringing back the natural clarity of the water as it races over shingle, providing homes for dashing inhabitants including wild trout and kingfishers.It’s possible to swim in the river but there’s also a jetty for easy access into a large Wissey-fed pond enveloped by rushes and willows. We savour a long evening swim to the soundtrack of cuckoos and reed warblers and – to my amazement – even a booming bittern. The water is sweet and fresh, and I feel as if we could be in Scandinavia, especially when we warm ourselves in our private woodfired hot tub as the first stars emerge. I’m hoping for a strange drone or red flare from the military training area, but all is quiet.View image in fullscreenGuests are given the run of the grounds and gardens at Bodney Park Cottage.Photograph: Miles WillisI rise early for a 5.45am swim and just miss an otter – Henry Sands, who is up even earlier, spots it – and there’s just enough time for a morning hot tub before we head to nearbyGrime’s Graves, the largest known and best excavated flint mine in the country. Here, 4,500 years ago, late Neolithic people dug up to 1,000 mines up to 13 metres below ground and used antler picks to extract flints embedded in the chalk. The flint was particularly high quality and exported across the country, making specialist tools and weapons. The site is a large grassy clearing filled with the strange lumps and pits that are old, long-filled-in mineshafts. The air is filled with the song of dozens of skylarks.The English Heritage visitor centre is pleasingly low-key – and quiet, naturally – with “please touch” signs so we can feel the weight of flints and the sharp edges of knapped stone. My kids enjoy brandishing replica axes before we move to the real highlight: descending into a nine-metre mineshaft excavated by archeologists in 1914. They found the remains of antler picks, pottery, animal bones and neolithic bats – andDaubenton’s batsstill roost in the excavated shafts where it is a constant 8C.View image in fullscreenGrimes Graves, the largest known and best excavated flint mine complex in the country.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership /Alamy“It smells nice down here,” says my son Ted as we descend the steel staircase. The scent is cool, damp stone. At the bottom, we can crawl on the chalk a short way into some of the horizontal excavations. It’s a vivid experience, a portal into another time.Dark holes is a theme of our day because we next head toOxburgh Hall, a stately home that has a priest’s hole which I remember from childhood was a thrilling portal into Tudor terror. On our way, we drop in onFoulden Common, one of a plethora of tranquil but rare wildlife-packed nature reserves includingWeeting HeathandLakenheath Fen. Thetford forest boasts several good country parks and there’s a multitude of cycle rides, swims (the Little Ouse is another gorgeous small river) and walks, including the long-distancePeddars Wayon the old Roman road leading from Thetford to the north-west Norfolk coast.Breckland has a dry climate more typical of central Europe and is notable for its rare plants and birdsOxburgh is a red-brick Tudor palace surrounded by a fine moat which must be one of the most picturesque National Trust properties. The hall was built by Sir Edmund Bedingfeld around 1476 and the 10th baronet still lives in a wing of the house. The rest of his ancestral home is open to the public, and the rooms are filled with vast oil portraits, ornate furniture, ancient books and even leather wallpaper, which was amusingly purchased secondhand from Spain by thrifty Victorian aristocrats.The priest’s hole was built up a tiny staircase, below a brick-topped iron hatch, so the Bedingfield family’s Catholic priest could be safely concealed during the persecution of the Catholics that saw the family fall from favour when they refused to renounce their faith. It is not known how much action the hole saw, but this tiny claustrophobic stone cell may have saved the life of a priest or three.Unfortunately, after a visitor became stuck in the hole (it’s oddly much harder to get out than in) we’re no longer allowed inside, and have to make do with peering down the hatch and watching a video of a stressed (actor) priest fretting inside.View image in fullscreenA northern pool frog is released into ancient pingos at Norfolk Wildlife Trust.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAfter a late lunch at theBedingfeld Arms, with swifts screaming as they circle the 1783 pub, I take an evening excursion to another unique nature reserve:Thompson Common. The map reveals this to be another place of strange indentations in the land: a profusion of nearly 500 pingos, small ponds formed when subterranean mounds of ice thawed and the soil slumped down at the end of the last ice age. It’s a bewitchingly unusual place, home to rare dragonflies and the very rarepool frog, which became extinct in the 1990s but has been successfully reintroduced from Sweden. The males can be heard “singing” in late spring, via a pair of white inflatable sacs like airbags either side of their head.There’s an eight-mile circularpingo walking trailfor a full day out but I took a shorter potter through the reserve. The frogs are doing well thanks to restoration work by Norfolk Wildlife Trust which has seen the excavation andrevival of a dozen “ghost” pingoes, with many ponds filled in during a century of agricultural “improvement” and intensification.I’d like to say we enjoyed a fine evening of the frog chorus but there’s nothing melodic about the groaning croak which sounds like a duck with laryngitis. They don’t call on my visit; instead I hear the bugling song of a crane from somewhere in the undergrowth. It’s another notable experience in this fascinating land, which is much the finer for its all-enveloping strangeness.Accommodation was provided byBodney Hall Farm,which has a cottage (sleeps 4) from£300a night and lodge (sleeps 12).Grimes Graves(English Heritage)is open daily10am-5pm(family up to five from £20.70).Oxburgh Hall(National Trust)open10.30am–3pm;gardens 9.30am–5pm(family up to fivefrom £32.50).Foulden Common and Thompson Common (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) are free to enterExplore more on these topicsNorfolk holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysSuffolk holidaysWildlifeHeritageBirdsCycling holidaysShareReuse this content"

But only by attuning to pain can we hope to healMoya SarnerMon 16 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareWe can try as hard as we like to build a better life for ourselves and our loved ones, but the truth is that sometimes things happen that are very difficult to recover from. Terrible, traumatising, crushingly painful things. If you are someone who has experienced abuse; lost a loved one too young; lost a baby or a child; wanted a child and not been able to have one for whatever reason; suffered irreparable injury to your body and your mind; or survived any tragedy that has left you drowning in despair, a better life may feel absolutely and irredeemably out of your grasp.I understand this. I have seen it many times in my consulting room, and although I have been very fortunate in my life, I have also known that feeling of certainty that there are some traumas that you just cannot recover from. When you’re in the middle of it, or stuck in its aftermath, that is all there is.But I have learned, as a patient in therapy and as a therapist, that it can become possible for pain and trauma to be attended to, put into words and understood. And this can include the most overwhelming, unimaginable, earth-shattering losses.This is easier described than done. We go to all sorts of lengths – often unconsciously – to hide from what hurts, to obscure the true meaning behind our pain. Sometimes, we believe we are in pain, but actually we aren’t – we are avoiding it, pushing it away, turning our backs to it. Like hearing someone crying, and quietly slipping out of the house and closing the door.Feeling your pain is what makes movement possible, while turning away from it ensures you will stay stuck in itTake anxiety. A person might seek therapy because they want help for life-sapping anxiety symptoms – from the pounding in their chest to the racing thoughts in their head and the whole mind-and-body clench that means they struggle to get out of bed. They are miserable. But what I discovered is that it can be easier, in some ways, to feel miserable about anxiety symptoms than to feel the emotions we are running away from. These physical and psychological symptoms can emerge as a more acceptable diversion from the deeper emotional anguish that we cannot bear to face. It might, unconsciously, seem preferable to be in anxiety than to be in pain. But if we are to stand a chance of being able to understand the meaning in our suffering, we need to turn towards the feelings, the memories and the losses that anxiety leads us away from.If you’re paralysed by anxiety, you aren’t living your life. But if you are in pain and you know why, perhaps because you are longing for something you cannot have – love, security, a mother, a child – and you give voice to that pain, even if only within your own mind, if you put it into words and listen to it, attend to it, then you can understand the meaning of your suffering and come alive. There is consolation in that, and it is very different from leaving yourself to cry behind a closed door.This is different from what people call “dwelling” on or in something, which implies a kind of wallowing, like worrying a wound. Feeling your pain is what makes movement possible, while turning away from it ensures you will stay stuck in it. Perhaps this is what the psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion was exploring when he wrote that good therapy should “increase the patient’s capacity for suffering”.Therapy isn’t about life hacks. The best solutions are simpler – and more complexRead moreThere’s just one more thing I wanted to say about this. When something terrible happens to you, there is often an assumption – spoken or unspoken – that it was your fault. It is of course possible that had you made different decisions, had it been possible for you to act differently, this thing might or might not have happened – and that can be very painful, but crucial, to recognise. It might also be the case that nothing could have prevented this thing from happening; that it was quite simply out of your hands, which is a truly terrifying thing to contemplate.It might even feel better to hold on to your misplaced guilt, because this belief that it was your fault protects you from the reality that terrible things can happen and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. The famous scene in Good Will Hunting when Robin Williams tells Matt Damon: “It’s not your fault” is so powerful because Damon’s character thinks he already knew that, but we can see when he breaks down that he didn’t actually believe it. What doesn’t ring true about that scene for me is that he eventually believes it because Williams tells him – in my experience, it doesn’t work like that. This is something we cannot be told by someone else; we have to find this truth inside ourselves.It is devastating to face this reality. But counterintuitive though it may be, a better life can grow out of the anguish of recognising that we are not in control. Because although we cannot control what happens to us, when we can allow the experience of our true suffering, our pain and our grief, we can find understanding and a capacity for compassion, for ourselves and others too.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It made me very ill. My hair fell out. I withdrew from the world for a while. I had therapy, and I’m just about now coming out of the other end. I’m quite heavily medicated – I don’t mind saying that because I think people should be open about their mental health and why it happens. It really did affect me.”In 2011, Belfield had suggested in veiled terms that Green should be sent to Auschwitz after she presented a documentary about the concentration camp. It was the start of a 10-year campaign of harassment against her, which included emails, YouTube videos and tweets.While Belfield was cleared of stalking Green, and also Helen Thomas, Rozina Breen and Stephanie Hirst,all former BBC employees, the trial judge ruled he had targeted them in “a personal campaign of revenge”, leaving them in need of psychological support. Belfield was handed an indefinite restraining order preventing him from contacting the women.Green, who lives in West Yorkshire, became frightened when, before his release, Belfield began promoting six books he had written in prison, his Voice of Reason YouTube channel, and a summer speaking tour to “tell all and expose his side of the story”.He appeared to make light of his crimes on his website, claiming he would be performing in a pantomime jokingly dubbed Jack and the Bean Stalker in 2026. His website also featured the banner: “Thank you for stalking AlexBelfield.com – Officially a political prisoner since 2023.” The jokes, which were first reported by Nottinghamshire Live, have since been taken down.Green said it was ludicrous that Belfield was “grifting” after causing so much suffering. “I live my life because of him in a very rigid, protected way,” she said. “It’s been a good 15 years of my life. And when I say I’m coming out of it, I don’t wake up depressed, I don’t wake up anxious. Anxiety is the worst thing I think anybody can have. Some days I actually feel happy.”For the theatre blogger Philip Dehany, who was stalked by Belfield, the YouTuber’s “horrendous” conduct proves he is not remorseful. Dehany, 43, who is pursuing a civil claim for harassment against Belfield, said: “I can’t imagine how difficult prison would have been, but I had hoped he would want to put it all behind him. All I want to do is be able to move on. But because he’s locked me into this civil case and because he’s writing these books, he appears to be reluctant to move on.”Green now hopes Belfield will go on to “live a decent, honest, quiet life” by adhering to his licence conditions, which every offender is subject to so they do not seek to gain income from their crime. “What I am concerned about when he comes out is that it’s free publicity for him to spout his shite about being an oppressed political prisoner,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it claimed copies of his autobiography, His Own Worst Enema, had already shipped. While the email did not mention his licence conditions, it said: “There are dark forces at work behind the scenes, making it impossible for Alex to move forward as planned.”The Ministry of Justice would not comment on Belfield’s licence conditions but said: “Offenders released on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled to prison immediately if they break the rules.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeBBCJeremy VineEnglandPrisons and probationUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

In almost every apartment, a television set shows images of crowds at a rally, cheering a vast Russian flag emblazoned with the Z pro-war symbol.Meanwhile, police bang on the doors looking for dissidents, while another big screen on the stage shows very different images, evocative and melancholic photographs of provincial Russia. As the lights go down at the end of the performance, the final image is of a van in a lonely parking lot, a coffin loaded into the back.This contrast between the Russia portrayed on Kremlin-run TV channels and the real Russia is at the heart of a new production of Modest Mussorgsky’s opera Boris Godunov, staged byone of the country’s most feted film and theatre directors, Kirill Serebrennikov. It premiered this week in Amsterdam and draws on many of the exiled director’s own experiences in Russia.Serebrennikov pulls the action of Mussorgsky’s brooding opera, which follows the reign and death of an ill-fated 17th-century Russian tsar, firmly into the present day. There are multiple implicit and explicit references to Vladimir Putin’s regime and the war in Ukraine.In an interview, Serebrennikov said he had been working on his concept for the staging for more than five years, but had to radically rethink it after the full-scale invasion. “This is a story not just about tsars but about the people, and a lot has changed for the Russian people in the past five years,” he said.View image in fullscreenSerebrennikov’snarodare the residents of an on-stage apartment block.Photograph: Dutch National Opera/Marco BorggreveThe Russian people – thenarod, in Russian–are given powerful choral music by Mussorgsky, and alternate between lamenting their lot and erupting in fury. Serebrennikov said he wanted to show that thenarod, in the end, was made up of individuals and explore what responsibility they had for their situation.“In Boris Godunov, thenarodis usually portrayed as a mass, all standing in a line, a background for the tsar. And I wanted to see these people, see every individual in the crowd, whether they are old or young, healthy or sick. This crowd is made up of individual personalities, though of course, when they gather together or when there is a time of war they can quickly turn into an aggressive mass,” he said.Serebrennikov’snarodare the residents of his on-stage apartment block. As the action unfolds, they get on with their lives: drinking, having sex, arguing, celebrating. Men sign up for the army, women mourn the loss of their relatives who have gone to fight. All the time, the television flickers in the background, imparting its propaganda.In this production, the first aria of Tsar Boris is a televised New Year’s Eve broadcast from the Kremlin, stage-managed by aides and then beamed into every apartment. Mussorgsky’s scenes in which the rapacious Polish nobility plans to conquer Russia is also reimagined, as a primetime show called The Conspiracy, filmed complete with US flags and shown in the homes depicted onstage to frighten them into believing a western plot against them.The only apartment not to have a television is the one belonging to the Holy Fool, a fleeting but important character in the opera, who laments the state of Russia and speaks truth to the tsar. Serebrennikov reimagines the fool as a modern-day dissident, and also gives the character a series of spoken monologues not in the original opera, selected and edited from the courtroom speeches of Soviet-era and modern-day Russian dissidents.View image in fullscreenSerebrennikov reimagines the fool character of Mussorgsky’s opera as a modern-day dissident.Photograph: borggreve/Dutch National Opera/Marco Borggreve“Boris – this is my country, I don’t want to leave,” says the fool at one point, a dilemma experienced by many recent émigrés from Russia. “Many people have left, they have every right. But I ask myself, why am I the one who has to leave, and not you?”The evocative images of the “real” Russia shown onstage come from the photographer Dmitry Markov. Serebrennikov, who was a friend, described him as “a phenomenal artist who shot Russia like nobody else did”. He commissioned Markov to shoot some scenes especially for the opera, butthe photographer died last year, at the age of 41, before he was able to take the images, and Serebrennikov has devoted the production to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These contradictions came to a head in 2017, when he was accused of fraud and put under house arrest. His production of a ballet charting the life of the dancer Rudolf Nureyev was the hottest ticket of the season at the Bolshoi theatre.But when it opened in late 2017, with much of the Kremlin elite in attendance, the director was still under house arrest.View image in fullscreenScenes in which the rapacious Polish nobility plans to conquer Russia is reimagined as a primetime show called The Conspiracy.Photograph: borggreve/Dutch National Opera/Marco BorggreveSince the invasion, these strange ambiguities have been ruthlessly ironed out of the Russian arts scene. Serebrennikov’s beloved theatre space, the Gogol Centre, was closed down, and many directors and actors have left Russia, unable to work in the new climate of rigid ideological orthodoxy.Serebrennikovhas called the war“a tragedy for Ukraine and a suicide for modern, open Russia”. He said with his Boris Godunov staging he wanted to explore the affects on Russian society of the brutal war.“We see that the external aggression against another country also has an unexpected vector inside the country, people attacking each other. This is about physical violence and emotional violence, everything from domestic abuse to crime and murders. It’s about self-destruction, and that is what I wanted to make this opera about: how a thoughtless and senseless existence in the environment created by the authorities can lead to self-destruction,” he said.It is a bleak vision, and Serebrennikov does not leave much room for hope, either in the opera’s grim finale or in his own thoughts about the future of Russia.“Some people like to live with illusions, to live in hope. To say: ‘Everything will turn out OK.’ I don’t really understand this idea of hope and I don’t like to play these games. Why will everything turn out OK? Where is the evidence for this view? I believe in taking conscious, thought-through decisions, in trying to grasp and understand the reality as it is,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaOperaVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeNetherlandsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s time to ditch themReaders respond to Sally Weale’s article about whether the exams taken in year 11 are still fit for purposeMon 16 Jun 2025 12.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareSally Weale cogently questions why we need to continue with the outdated GCSE examination, being the only country in Europe to have such an assessment (‘They are making young people ill’: is it time to scrap GCSEs?, 11 June). There are two additional reasons that support the case for abolition.First, the cost.GCSEsare a billion-pound-plus industry. Few people realise that, per student, we spend more on the exam entry than on providing resources to study the subject.Second, most importantly, GCSE results are standardised as a bell curve of results. A third or more of young people receive below-average results because the statistical model so determines.The government wants to improve technical and vocational education, but this will not happen while hundreds of thousands of young people are told that they “didn’t do very well at school”.Bob MoonEmeritusprofessor ofeducation,Open UniversityRe Sally Weale’s article on the effect of GCSEs on young people, I attended a traditional grammar school in Colchester in the 1970s. We had a forward-thinking headteacher who believed that seven GCE O-levels were enough. One of these, English language, was taken in year 10, which left only six at the end of year 11.No formal English literature exam was taken, but pupils spent year 11 writing an extended essay on a literary subject of their choosing. This was marked by the school, and a grade, though not recognised externally, was given. It made for a more leisurely year 11.Ironically, my brother, who was in the top stream at his secondary modern school, had far more exams, with a mixture of both GCE O-levels and CSEs.At the time, most students left school at 16, whereas now they are in full-time education or training until 18. So it would seem that the GCSE is an outmoded exam that needs to be scrapped.PaulKilvertHullGCSEs were intended to recognise what pupils know, understand and can do – they do not. They were supposed to be assessed fairly – they are not, as grades are based on norm referencing. They were designed as a rite of passage at 16 for pupils at the end of their statutory education – but 90% of pupils stay in education until they are 18.We need school-based diagnostic and formative assessment systems from 11 to 18, which can guide young people on to their next best stage of learning, not expensive and stressful GCSEs. Age 18 is the time for the summation of a young person’s schooling, not 16. And at 18 we need proper recognition of where young people really are as they continue their learning journey into and through adult life.Frank NewhoferOxfordThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which argues for the scrapping of GCSEs, is named after the man who rejected a golden opportunity to do so and replace them with a diploma-based system when he was prime minister, based on the 2004Tomlinson report. If it is “a decade’s work” to come up with a new qualification framework, we might now have been a decade into one if New Labour had made the change when it had the chance.Derrick CameronStoke-on-TrentIn the current round of exams, my grandson had to sit three in one day. How is that fair? How can it be justified? Where’s the sense in it? Yes, it’s time to scrap GCSEs.Prof Colin RichardsFormer HMinspector ofschoolsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Recognition does not punish Israel. It offers hope to those in Palestine and Israel working for peaceful coexistence, mutual security and equal rights.The international court of justice hasadvised that Israel’s military occupation of East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and Gaza is unlawful, and must be ended. Yet ministers in the Netanyahu government seem determined to Balkanise the West Bank with more and more illegal settlements, along with destroying viable life for Palestinians in Gaza. Both designed, it seems, to make impossible the verytwo-state solutionto which the world has long been committed: a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israeli one. Yet how else can there be a peaceful future for Palestinians and Israelis alike?This is no reward for terror. Rather, it reaffirms Israel’s recognised right to 78% of what was the British mandate territory. The Palestinian people have the self-same right to determine their own future, free from occupation.It is fitting that the UK andFrance, which conspired together to carve up the Ottoman Levant through the infamous Sykes-Picot agreement, should now endorse that Palestinian right unconditionally.France,Belgiumand like-minded Commonwealth partners such as Canada and Australia can emulate us – but Britain needs to give a lead.We ask our government to recognise Palestine now, for the common good of all in a region that needs peace and stability, not war, terror and mass starvation.Eluned Morgan MSFirst minister of WalesAndy BurnhamMayor, Greater ManchesterEmily Thornberry MPChair, Commons foreign affairs select committeeAndy Slaughter MPChair, Commons justice select committeeExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaInternational court of justiceWest BankForeign policylettersShareReuse this content"

As we ramp up defence spending, it would be incoherent to try to part-pay for it by hollowing out the British Council.The British Council is at the heart of Britain’s global influence – fostering education, English-language skills, cultural exchange and mutual understanding in more than 100 countries.Yet funding pressures and the burden of a £197m loan now mean that it may close its doors in as many as 60 countries (British Council ‘may have to close in 60 countries’ amid cuts to aid budget, 8 June).As the United States retreats and rival states expand their global presence, this is the moment to invest in institutions such as the British Council and the BBC World Service, not to make false economies.Shuttering British Council offices would be a failure to recognise the obvious truth that hard and soft power work in a complementary and mutually reinforcing way. One secures borders and deters enemies; the other opens minds and wins friends.The UK cannot hope to remain globally influential without both.Jo JohnsonFormer ministerfor universities, science, research and innovationCurtailing the work of the British Council overseas would be a very shortsighted move. The dividend in influence and goodwill for the UK from minimal financial investment is significant and beneficial. I spent 25 years working on pro-democracy missions in 35 new and emerging democracies across four continents and I experienced at first-hand the gratitude of local people for the projects run by the British Council.In addition to its many English language and literature courses, it tailored its smaller projects to the particular needs of each country. I particularly appreciated the flexibility of the modest budgets controlled by the local British Council boss to back up the work on electoral practice, governance and representation by providing grants for training, civic education and similar needs.One thing is sure: such is the desire for literacy and education in developing countries, young people will seek to find it in the programmes offered by other countries.Michael MeadowcroftLeedsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Outside our tech block stood three tall morello cherry trees whose fruit generally lay squashed, staining the concrete with their juice. That all changed with the Kosovans. As the fruit ripened, they climbed and harvested the treasure, later coming to lesson with stained shirts and faces. It was a delight to see them happily in their element.Tatiana SokoloffLondonI didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the idea that traybakes are “a ‘queering’ of the meat-and-two-veg sit-down dinners associated with the traditional heterosexual British family unit” (My unexpected Pride icon: The Green Roasting Tin, a cookbook no lesbian vegetarian can be without, 12 June).

Now it has emerged that the agency will withdraw from the Hope Through Action project managed by the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI). USAID had pledged $29.5m (£22m) over five years to the project, which was designed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats in westernTanzania.Launched in November 2023, the project is intended to protect endangered chimpanzees through reforestation and “community-led methodology” in order to conserve biodiversity conservation and improve local livelihoods.Its work is built upon Jane Goodall’s research.She “redefined species conservation” byhighlighting the importanceof cooperation between local people and the natural environment to protect chimpanzees from extinction.According to JGI figures, chimpanzees have become extinct in three African countries, and overall population numbers have fallen from millions to below 340,000.Goodallcriticised Trump during his first term in officewhen he signed an executive order dismantling Barack Obama’s clean power plan. She called Trump’s climate agenda “immensely depressing”.In collaboration with JGI Austria, Ecosia – a Berlin-based search engine that donates 100% of its profits to climate action – has offered $100,000 over the next three years to further TGI Tanzania’s Gombe reforestation project. The donation far from covers the original funding amount, but it is intended to pay for the planting of 360,000 seedlings, work put at risk after the project was defunded.The director of JGI Austria, Diana Leizinger, said: “We refuse to abandon people and nature. Where hope could have been destroyed, we are helping it grow again.”An analysis in April by Refugees International found that 98% of USAID’s awards related to the climate had been discontinued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Three months ago, Israel imposed a fullhumanitarian blockade on Gaza, cutting off food and other critical supplies to the Palestinian territory. Aid convoys entering Gaza have also been repeatedlyattacked.View image in fullscreenThe wreckage of a car after an attack by the Israeli military in May that killed five aid workers. Hunger is widely seen as being used as a weapon in the Gaza war.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyFakhri said that unless there was concerted international intervention to protect aid delivery throughout the world, humanitarian organisations would eventually cease distribution, creating a “dystopia”.He said the UN security council, whichpassed a resolution in 2018condemning the unlawful denial of aid to civilians, had been rendered ineffective because members kept vetoing attempts to help.“Where the security council is blocked by a veto, the general assembly has the authority to call for peacekeepers,” said Fakhri.He said such a move could happen quickly with a majority vote of the 193 member states required – a proportion that Fakhri predicted would easily be reached.“What the general assembly would do is politically implement what countries are already obliged to do.”Frustration over the lack of international action to safeguard vital aid supplies – particularly inGaza– has forced activists to take matters into their own hands.Last week,a yacht attempted to break the Israeli blockadeand deliver aid to Gaza but was prevented by Israel.On the same day the boat was intercepted, a land aid convoy set off from Tunisia with the similar intention of breaking Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid for the Palestinian territory.In Africa, aid delivery in Sudan has becomeincreasingly fraughtas key routes are blocked or attacked while aid facilities and humanitarian workers have been targeted.View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry relief supplies in Gaza. Israeli forces killed at least 60 people seeking food at a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation centre, with dozens wounded.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/GettyJeremy Laurence, a Geneva-based spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said: “We are deeply disturbed by the intentional obstruction of aid trying to reach civilians from Gaza toSudanand elsewhere, including through attacks on aid convoys.“Worryingly, these practices appear to be on the increase,” Laurence said. “Wilfully impeding relief supplies to starve civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime.”Meanwhile,Human Rights Watchdescribed as “horrifying” the spike in the frequency and severity of attacks on humanitarian workers.Louis Charbonneau, United Nations director at HRW, said:“Last year set a grim record for the number of humanitarian workers killed in conflict zones – more than 360 – most of them in Gaza but also in Sudan, Ukraine and elsewhere.”Fakhri added: “Whoever controls aid has a significant amount of power in a particular region and conflict.”He warned that if attacks continued then traditional aid distributors such as the UN could be forced to give up.Gaza is ‘hungriest place on Earth’ with all its people at risk of famine, says UNRead more“It makes it less likely for the UN, for the international community, for the Red Cross, for civil society organisations, to do that work and then who will take over? These militarised operations seen in Gaza?” he said.Fakhri was referring to theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), a US and Israel-backed logistics group that aims to replace Gaza’s UN-led food and humanitarian supply distribution network.Last Wednesday, Israeli forceskilled at least 60 Palestinians in Gazawho were seeking food from a GHF distribution centre, with dozens more wounded.Charbonneau urged greater justice for attacks on humanitarians and aid convoys. “One big motivator is impunity, which emboldens the governments of Israel, Russia, the warring parties in Sudan and others to target or fire indiscriminately at civilians, including humanitarian workers,” he said. “The problem is they feel confident they can get away with it.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentFood securityConflict and armsGazaSudanUnited NationsHaitinewsShareReuse this content"

But officials are rightly worried about the region’s large and unpredictable mammals: moose, cougars, wolves, black bears – and the six dozen grizzlies known to live in the region.Alberta’s ministry of public safety and emergency services told the Globe and Mail it has a “comprehensive wildlife mitigation strategy” in order to corral world leaders.The province installed miles of fencing with a “minimum height of eight feet to limit wildlife access”. In areas where animals are often spotted, electric fences have also been installed.Most people who have spent extended time in the Rocky Mountains have come across a bear. Often, the apex mammals are far more attuned to human presence than vice versa and flee the area before any encounters. Even when startled, bears – both black and grizzly – will scamper off into the forest.But in recent weeks, charges by a grizzly with two cubs prompted officials to close parts of Kananaskis Country. On 13 June, officials warned visitors to Ole Buck Mountain to be vigilant after a cougar was spotted. A day later, officials closed a portion of the Peter Lougheed trail after a grizzly was spotted feeding on a carcass.A further potential complication for summit organizers is the love of golf courses shared by both the bears in the region and the US president, Donald Trump. The 600-acre course within Kananaskis Valley is known both for its rugged beauty. And in spring, when food sources in the high country are still inaccessible, open urban environments scattered throughout the wilderness draw in curious bears.Canada: grizzly bear hunting quietly reinstated in AlbertaRead more“One of the things that people sometimes forget about is what an incredible environment these golf courses are for all sorts of wildlife,” Darren Robinson, the course’s longtime general manager, told CBC News, adding that cougars and moose have also stalked the greens.“There’s been days last summer where I literally saw, from in the clubhouse, five different bears. Some black, some grizzlies, some young, some parents. It’s beautiful.”A tragic incident last yearunderscored both the persistence of grizzlies – and their vulnerability to humans. Nakoda, a famed white grizzly, easily scaled one of the wildlife fences after she was struck by a car – an injury that later proved fatal.Her “devastating” death shook park workers, who spent “hundreds upon hundreds of hours” with her over the years, said Saundi Stevens, Parks Canada’s wildlife management specialist with the Lake Louise, Yoho and Kootenay field unit. “Just weeks ago, everyone in our office was actually celebrating her emergence from the den with two new cubs,” Stevens told reporters.Nakoda’s death was also a stark reminder that despite the fretting over security for world leaders, the biggest risk to the region’s inhabitants will almost always be humans.Explore more on these topicsG7AnimalsCanadaAmericasWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

He also said the war in Ukraine would not have happened if Moscow had been kept in the club.Trump made his remarks in front of media, alongside Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, who is hosting the G7, at the start of the summit’s first round of talks.Russia wasthrown out of the G8 after it invaded Crimea in 2014, and Trump’s defence of Vladimir Putin came a day before the US president is scheduled to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the fringes of the summit. It will be the first meeting between the two men since Pope’s Francis’s funeral in April.Zelenskyy is pressing for a reluctant Trump to respond to Putin’s refusal to agree a 30-day ceasefire byapplying sanctions on Russia that the US Senate has already approved.Trump, however, has shown little sign of losing patience, and late on Monday said he was still waiting to see whether a deal could be reached with Moscow.“Sanctions costs us a lot of money. It costs the US a lot of money. You are talking about billions and billions of dollars,” he said.Earlier in the day he repeated his opinion that expellingRussiafrom the G8 was a “big mistake”.“You wouldn’t have that war,” he said. “You know you have your enemy at the table, I don’t even consider, he wasn’t really an enemy at that time.”He blamed the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama for Putin’s expulsion.“Obama didn’t want him, and the head of your country didn’t want him,” Trump said, naming Trudeau several times and calling the ousting a mistake.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled that the EU would be asking the US and other G7 member states to tighten sanctions on Russia by lowering the cap at which Russian oil can be bought from $60 a barrel to $45.The aim is to reduce Russian revenues from oil sales. TheG7originally set up the complex price cap, so the EU needs the support of all G7 states to lower it.Von der Leyen told reporters: “To achieve peace through strength we must put more pressure on Russia to secure a real ceasefire, to bring Russia to the negotiating table, and to end this war.“Sanctions are critical to that end. As a result of the G7 and EU sanctions combined, for example, Russian oil and gas revenues have fallen by almost 80% since the beginning of the war.”The EU is preparing an 18th round of sanctions heavily focused on cutting off Russia’s oil revenues.Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy said: “Russia spits in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war.”He said the latest Russian attacks on energy infrastructure came right after Putin had spoken to Trump offering to act as a mediator in the Iran-Israel crisis.“This war could have ended long ago if the world had reacted to Russia in a principled way instead of falling for manipulation and lies,” he said.He said that unlike Russia, Ukraine had complied with US requests not to target its opponent’s energy facilities.Trump also gave no obvious ground on tariffs in his bilateral meeting with Carney. “I’m a tariff person,” he said. “It’s simple, it’s easy, it’s precise and it just goes very quickly.“I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good.”Trump has imposed levies on steel, aluminium, cars and other Canadian products that do not comply with the continental free trade agreement’s rules of origin.Explore more on these topicsG7Donald TrumpRussiaCanadaAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Failing to do so undermines community support for the concept, as well as failing to meet the housing needs of the community.”The rental asking price of many of the affordable homes currently advertised would also require tenants to part with more than 30% of their income.A one-bedroom apartment in Homebush in NSW which was listed for $600 a week would cost a prospective tenant $31,285.71 annually. Single applicants can earn no more than $80,700, meaning more than 38% of their income would be spent on rent on the “affordable” property.In Victoria, a one-bedroom fully furnished apartment in Caulfield marketed at “hospitality and retail staff” is listed at $615 a week, which would be $32,068 annually.To be eligible, singles can make no more than $73,530, making the rent more than 43% of their income.The current advertisements follow another string of Bondi apartments recently advertised under the state’s affordability program, with a two-bedroom two-bathroom flat listed for $1,300 a week.After Guardian Australia enquired about the two-bedroom property listed for $1,100, the rent was dropped to $1,040 a week.A spokesperson for HomeGroundSydneysaid the property could be rented for as much as $1,400 a week in the normal market.“We recognise that when market rent is high in locations such as Sydney’s eastern suburbs, even below-market affordable rents can seem high,” the spokesperson said.But 20% below market price “makes it much more affordable for families to live close to where they work and go to school”, the spokesperson said.So what is affordability?As rents have surged by more than 30% in many parts of the country over the past three years, affordable housing programs are often marketed for essential workers or those making below $90,000 so they can live in their own communities.The managing director of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, Michael Fotheringham, said many of them offer affordability in name only, with no standardised definition of the term across jurisdictions in Australia.“It’s a really loose terminology that different state rules apply across the country, and we have both federal and state government investing in programs to deliver affordable housing,” he said.“But what ‘affordable housing’ is, is really unclear.”In NSW, affordable properties should be rented out with a discount of 20% on the market rent, though the guidelines say “flexibility in pricing may be applied to moderate income households”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Housing Australia Future Fund has promised to create 20,000 new affordable homes across Australia over five years from 2024.“We’ve got this real inconsistency across the country,” Fotheringham said.One key issue, especially in capital cities, is the huge increase in asking rents over the past three years.Expensive eggs, rental rises, falling fuel costs: what we learned from the ABS April inflation reportRead moreIn June 2022, a typical one-bedroom unit across Australia rented for $444 a week. Today, that figure has reached $565 – a jump of more than 27% in just three years, data produced for Guardian Australia by Everybody’s Home shows.For houses, the story is similar. The average asking rent for a house has climbed from $588 a week to $722, a rise of nearly 23%. That means a renter is now paying more than $7,000 extra each year for the same home compared with 2022.In capital cities, the picture is even worse. Average unit rents have jumped by 35.7% since 2022, while house rents have increased by 31.3%.Fotheringham said a project is more likely to get approved if a portion of a development is set at an affordable rent, with councils in some cases allowing more stories.“Governments incentivise it, because they want there to be more affordable supply, even if the current methods of calculating what’s affordable are imperfect,” he said.Australia needs a consistent national approach that is locally sensitive, he said, suggesting the government should carefully consider tying it to incomes rather than market rate.“Affordable housing [with a] capital A is, a name of a product, rather than experience,” he said.While states struggle with bridging the gap, people are increasingly being forced out of suburbs they may have lived in for generations, said Everybody’s Home’s spokesperson, Maiy Azize.“Governments keep rolling out ‘affordable’ housing schemes, but there is no substitute for social housing. That means low-cost rentals that people can actually afford,” she said.Australia currently needs 640,000 more social homes than it has, Azize said.“Until we clear that backlog, and then open the door to people on middle incomes, we’ll never tame runaway rents,” she said.“Right now, a person on an average income in Sydney can’t get into social housing, but they can’t afford the private market either. That gap is swallowing whole communities. The only fix is to boost social housing – and make it available to more people.”Explore more on these topicsRentingHousingSydneyNew South WalesCost-of-living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Three smaller Israeli stands, which did not have hardware on display, and an Israeli Ministry of Defence stand, remain open.

The French president,Emmanuel Macron, last Friday reiteratedhis country’s support for Israel’s right to protect itself, but in reference to its strikes on Iran he called on “all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to de-escalate”.Israel’s defence ministry said it had rejected the order to remove some weapons systems from displays, and that exhibition organisers responded by erecting a black partition that separated the Israeli industry pavilions from others.The ministry said: “This outrageous and unprecedented decision reeks of policy-driven and commercial considerations. The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition – weapons that compete with French industries.”View image in fullscreenFrench police patrol the stand of the Israel defence ministry at the Paris airshow.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPAIAI’s president and chief executive, Boaz Levy, said the black partitions were reminiscent of “the dark days of when Jews were segmented from European society”, according to Reuters.Earlier on Monday, images taken by the AFP agency showed yellow writing on one of the black walls around the stands. Accompanied by a drawing of an Israeli flag, it read: “Behind these walls are the best defense systems used by many countries. These systems are protecting the state of Israel these days. The French government, in the name of discrimination, is trying to hide them from you.”Later, the section of black wall appeared to have been replaced by a white wall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was convicted by the court in Frankfurt of two deaths and eight cases of severe torture.The court imposed the highest possible sentence on the man, a supporter of Assad, whose crimes – including war crimes, torture and murder – the judge, Christoph Koller, said had “seriously injured nine people, both physically and mentally, and killed two”.He described the doctor, based on one of several experts’ reports, as having a “sadistic” nature that was given particular expression when he tortured his victims.“Above all, the accused enjoyed harming people that he considered inferior and of lower value to himself,” Koller said.Witnesses called to give evidence during the almost three-and-a-half-year trial described, sometimes in considerable detail, the severe abuse they had received at the hands of Mousa, including beatings and kickings, or how he deliberately set broken bones with insufficient levels of anaesthetic. They also told the court how the doctor had poured flammable liquid on their wounds and parts of their body – and in two cases, including that of a 14-year-old boy, on their genitals – and set them on fire. He injected one prisoner with a deadly poison while the man had been trying to defend himself. He died in front of fellow prisoners.The court also heard how he had beaten and kicked a young man suffering from epileptic seizures, knowing he had the condition, which led to it worsening. He later administered a pill, which caused the man to die in the presence of his brother.Koller praised the more than 50 witnesses who he said had possessed the courage to share the descriptions of their suffering with the court, sometimes over several days. He said without them the case could not have been brought successfully.During her summing up, the senior public prosecutor Anna Zabeck emphasised to the court last month the difficult circumstances under which the witnesses had testified. Both they and their relatives living in Syria were repeatedly threatened and intimidated to prevent them from appearing at the trial, she said.She said the witnesses had been “asked to give almost everything during their testimony”, by discussing the violence that had scarred them “physically and mentally”. The prosecutor Christina Schlepp added that, despite repeated accusations from the defence lawyers that the victims had been part of a conspiracy against the doctor, there were “no signs they had wanted to incriminate” Mousa for the sake of it.During the often hours-long court sessions, Mousa mainly sat in the dock with his head bowed, and repeatedly had to blow his nose.Mousa has lived inGermanyfor 10 years. He worked in various clinics over five years as an orthopaedic medic, most recently at a hospital in Bad Wildungen in the state of Hessen, in western Germany, until his arrest in summer 2020. He was recognised and reported to the authorities after some of his victims saw him in a TV documentary about the Syrian city of Homs and was placed in custody. The court case against him at Frankfurt’s higher regional court started in January 2022 and took place over nearly 190 days.It was possible to try the doctor in a German court even though the crimes were committed in Syria due to the principal of universal jurisdiction in international criminal law. This allows for the prosecution anywhere of a person alleged to have committed war crimes.The federal prosecutor’s office had asked for the man to receive life imprisonment – which usually runs to a maximum of 15 years in Germany – followed by preventive detention – meaning he would always stay behind bars, because of the potential danger it considered him to pose to wider society should he ever be released.Lawyers acting for the doctor called for him to be acquitted on the charge of the two killings, arguing that he had not been working in Homs at the time they took place.The doctor, who entered court wearing a black fur-trimmed hooded coat to cover his face, pleaded not guilty, insisting he had been the victim of a conspiracy.Explore more on these topicsGermanySyriaBashar al-AssadEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaTorturenewsShareReuse this content"

There were no burial records.On Monday, excavation crews began sealing off the site before the search for remains next month. “There are so many babies, children just discarded here,” Corless told Agence France-Presse.It was Corless’s work that led to an Irish commission of investigation into the so-called mother and baby homes, to which young women and girls were sent for decades to give birth in, rather than in hospital or at home. Doubling as orphanages and adoption agencies for much of the 20th century, the institutions were run by religious orders with sanction by the state, which overlooked deprivation, misogyny, stigma and high infant mortality rates.The government made a formalstate apologyin 2021 after thecommissionreport.In Tuam, hoarding has been placed around the excavation site, now in the middle of a housing estate. The preliminary work is expected to last four weeks before a full-scale excavation begins on 14 July.The site was once a workhouse and the search for the infants’ remains could be complicated by the fact that victims of the 19th century great famine are also thought to be buried there.Daniel MacSweeney, who is overseeing the operation, told RTÉ radio: “It’s an incredibly complex challenge because of the size of the site and the fact that we are dealing with infant remains that we know, at least in the case of the memorial gardens (on the site), are co-mingled.”The existence of mother and baby homes has been described as a dark stain on Irish society. In 2017, the then taoiseach Enda Kenny described what was revealed about Tuam as “a chamber of horrors”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two systems were involved, prompting orange weather warnings: the first came from the west via Brittany and hit the north of the country, and the second arrived via Spain and affected south-west France.More than 30,000 lightning strikes were recorded between midnight on Friday and early Saturday. Eure, north of Paris, was worst hit with 4,326 strikes. Strong winds lashed Normandy – Rouen recorded a 76mph (123km)/h) gust that broke the 64mph record set in 2019. Hail affected several areas, leading to infrastructure and crop damage.There were further storms over central and north-west France on Saturday night, many with very large hailstones. The largest, found in Orly, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, measured 85mm.Several factors led to the severe weather. A key component was a phenomenon known asgoutte froide, in which an isolated, upper-air cold pool detached from the overall circulation, creating significant atmospheric instability.Athalweg d’altitude(upper-air trough) provided the lift necessary by favouring air ascent. Warm, moist air flowed into the trough and was forced upwards. As the air rose, it started to cool and water vapour began to condense, forming clouds. As this clouds swelled, they created severe thunderstorms.As air flowed into the trough from every direction, it enabled supercells to develop by introducing the element of spin. Supercells are large-scale, highly organised storms with a rotating updraft that can sustain themselves for several hours and travel hundreds of miles – one of which swept through northern France on Friday.A recent heat dome over the country helped intensify the storms by providing a greater gradient between the surface and the upper air, and by bringing a greater source of moisture. A heat dome occurs when high pressure persists over a region, trapping warm air and allowing temperatures to rise several degrees above the seasonal average.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerFranceEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The measure, like other attempts to claw back power from the executive branch, faces a steep climb in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans have been mostly unwilling to challenge Donald Trump’s authority.“I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,” Kaine said in a statement. “The American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation’s men and women in uniform into harm’s way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.”Later on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, introduced a separate piece of legislation that would bar the use of federal funds for any use of military force “in or against Iran” without congressional authorization. Several progressive Democrats, including senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland joined as sponsors.“Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,” Sanders said in a statement. “I will do everything that I can as a Senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the US from being drawn into another war.”Sanders has accused Israel of timing its attack on Iran to “sabotage” the latest round of talks between the US and Iran over the future of Iran’s nuclear program that had been scheduled for Sunday but were cancelled.Trump on Monday said Iranian officials would “like to talk” about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, while Israel indicated its attacks on Iran were not yet finished. Trump – along with Democrats and Republicans – have issued stark warnings to Iran not to strike US targets as it launches retaliatory attacks.“If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” Trumpwroteon Truth Social.War powers resolutions are considered “privileged” under Senate rules, guaranteeing a floor debate and vote. Even if Kaine’s measure ultimately fails, it will compel lawmakers to confront pressing questions about the US role in the rapidly escalating Middle East conflict – and, more broadly, about presidential war powers and Congress’s constitutional authority over decisions of war and peace.Kaine’s resolution would not prevent the US from defending itself against imminent threats but would require congressional approval for offensive action. Sanders’ bill contains an exception for self-defense.On matters of foreign policy, Trump’s coalition includes Iran hawks like Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as “America First” subscribers who share the president’s longstanding opposition to US involvement in foreign conflicts.Graham on Sunday said he preferred a diplomatic solution, but barring that, he urged the president to “go all in”.“Make sure that, when this operation is over, there’s nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program,” he said in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. “If that means providing bombs, provide bombs.”Kaine’s move is part of a long-running effort to rein in presidential war powers, which has in the past brought together unlikely partnerships between Democrats and a growing faction of far-right anti-interventionists.During Trump’s first term, Kaine led a similar effort to limit Trump’s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval, following the president’s decision to order the killing of Iranian Gen Qasem Soleimani, which brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. Though both chambers of Congress approved the resolution, Trump vetoed it.That veto followed an earlier one in 2019, when Trump blocked a separate bipartisan War Powers resolution aimed at ending US support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen’s civil war – an effort that drew support from Democrats and a small group of anti-interventionist Republicans.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

An Air India plane bound for London Gatwick took off from Ahmedabad, India, at 1.38pm local time last Thursday. On board were 242 people. Within moments of takeoff, the airlinercrashed, sending up a fireball of exploding jet fuel.Initial reports suggested all passengers and crew had perished. Then, miraculously, there was one survivor – a British man,Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, who while badly injured was able to walk out of the wreckage by himself. Ramesh, who was returning to his family in London, told the Hindustan Times: “I don’t know how I survived. I saw people dying in front of my eyes – the air hostesses, and two people I saw near me … I walked out of the rubble.”AirIndiasaid the passengers on board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were made up of 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, one Canadian and seven Portuguese nationals. Footage shows the plane flying low over a residential area before disappearing behind buildings followed by an explosion. At least 24 people on the ground died as the flight crashed into a hostel housing medical students in a crowded residential area of Ahmedabad.A black box was recovered from the crash site last Friday. The UK Foreign Office said officials were working with Indian authorities to establish the facts around the crash and provide support to those involved.The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he was stunned and saddened while the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the crash “devastating”.There is still much we don’t know in the days since the crash, most importantly about why it happened. To help put things into context, I spoke toGwyn Topham, the Guardian’s transport correspondent, about the Boeing airliner involved and why the crash is likely to renew scrutiny of the manufacturer. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesMiddle East| Israel and Iranbroadened their strikesagainst each other in an escalating war that has killed and injured hundreds of people. Donald Trump called for an end to the conflict and warned Tehran against striking US targets in the region.UK news| The government’s welfare plans have tobe pushed through, Keir Starmer has said, indicating that there will be no further concessions over cuts to disability benefits.UK news| Thousands of university students in the UK have been caughtmisusing ChatGPTand other artificial intelligence tools in recent years, while traditional forms of plagiarism show a marked decline.UK news| China and Russia are stepping upsabotage operationstargeting undersea cables and the UK is unprepared to meet the mounting threat, according to new analysis.Greenland| Emmanuel Macron has criticised Donald Trump’s threats totake over Greenlandas he became the first foreign head of state to visit the vast, mineral-rich Arctic territory since the US president began making explicit threats to annex it.In depth: Devastating news deeply felt in BritainView image in fullscreenAkeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara, who are reported to have died in the crash.Photograph: Family handout/PAThe plane crash is the deadliest involving Britons in recent years, casting a shadow of mourning over large parts of the UK.Gareth Thomas, MP for Harrow West and the chair of the APPG on British Gujarati, told First Edition: “Harrow is home to a large British-Gujarati community, many of whom have close family ties to Gujarat, and this devastating news will be felt particularly strongly here.”Among those confirmed dead are businessman Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their four-year-old daughter Sara (pictured above), according to the Gloucester Muslim community.Also killed in the crash were Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, who ran the Wellness Foundry in south London and Ramsgate. The business offered psychic readings, tarot, reiki, and yoga.Adam Taju, 72, and his wife, Hasina, 70, were also on board, along with their son-in-law, Altafhusen Patel, 51, who lived in London with his wife.Javed Ali Syed, a hotel manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia Hotel, and his wife, Mariam, were also reportedlyamong the victims.What do we know about the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner?The Air India plane that was headed to London was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This model of plane has been in service since 2011. There are more than 1,100 787s in service worldwide, used by most major international airlines. This is the first time one has crashed.“It was seen as revolutionary when it came in because it was so much lighter,” Gwyn Topham explains. “People called it the ‘plastic plane’ at the time because of the composite materials. That made it more fuel-efficient, quieter, and generally a nicer plane to be on. It doesn’t feel that novel now, but at the time it was a leap forward.”Gwyn adds: “There have been issues over the years. About a decade ago a lithium-ion battery caught fire on a plane parked at Heathrow, which was obviously alarming. And in 2013 there were a couple of electrical fires in Japan that led to the aircraft being grounded briefly. But nothing since that time that would make most people worry about flying this plane.”He notes that while awhistleblower last yearurged Boeing to ground all 787 Dreamliners worldwide during Washington hearings, Boeing rejected the claims.Air India, which operates a fleet of Dreamliners, has been using the US-built long-haul plane since 2012. This is the airline’s first serious incident since 2020, when a smaller Boeing 737-800 operated by Air India Express skidded off the runway on landing during bad weather.Tata Group, the parent company of Air India, said it would provide 10m rupees (£86,000) to the families of those killed in the crash. The company also said it would cover the medical costs of those injured and provide support in the “building up” of the medical college hit by the plane.Further scrutiny on BoeingThis latest crash piles further pressure on Boeing, which has faced significant scrutiny over the past few years due to a series of production issues and safety concerns.Most notable are the two major crashes that were due to faults on Boeing’s 737 Max planes, inIndonesiaandEthiopiain 2018 and 2019. That model was taken out of service for almost a year, before being relaunched and returned to widespread use.Last month, Boeing agreed to pay $1.1bn (£812m)in a dealwith the US justice department to avoid prosecution over these two crashes, which together killed 346 people. The families of the crash victims described the deal as “morally repugnant”.“That really shocked the industry and the public. At first, many didn’t want to believe it could be the plane and people thought it might be pilot error. But it turned out to be Boeing’s fault, and that severely damaged trust,” Gwyn says.“Since then, every Boeing incident, from relatively minor ones to the door panel that blew off on an Alaska Airlines flight last year, ends up getting massive attention. Ryanair has even complained publicly about receiving planes with faults.“Even if this crash turns out to have nothing to do with the aircraft itself, it still puts a fresh spotlight on Boeing.”What impact will this have on the aviation industry?Hours after the crash, flights were allowed to resume at the airport in Ahmedabad. Despite these high profile crashes, Gwyn doesn’t expect passengers to be deterred from flying.“It’s important to remember that aviation is very safe. I think 2023 had no fatal passenger jet crashes at all. When crashes do happen, they’re usually the result of a combination of rare and unexpected factors,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even when Ryanair offered refunds to passengers booked on the 737 Max, no one took them up on it.

But she didn’t ask permission,” the staff member said.“I spent the weekend afterwards worrying: did I do my job properly? I know I did, but no one’s perfect all the time and this was recorded. I don’t think I slept for the whole weekend.”They were also concerned that a patient in the next bay was giving consent for a colonoscopy – an invasive diagnostic test – at the same time as the daughter was filming her mother close by. “That could all have been recorded on the film, including names and dates of birth,” they said.Ashley d’Aquino, a therapeutic radiographer in London, said a colleague had agreed to take photographs for a patient, “but when the patient handed over her phone the member of staff saw that the patient had also been covertly recording her, to publish on her cancer blog.“AsNHSstaff we wear name badges, so our names will be visible in any video. It makes people feel very uncomfortable and anxious.”Dean Rogers, the SoR’s director of industrial strategy and member relations, urged all NHS trusts and boards to ensure that patients know they need permission from staff before filming.“As healthcare professionals we need to think: does that recording breach the confidentiality of other patients? Does it breach our ability to deliver care?”Dr Katharine Halliday, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “In my experience, rules about filming and recording are there to protect the privacy and dignity of patients and staff and should be followed accordingly.“In a clinical environment, you will be surrounded by patients in their most vulnerable moments, staff focusing on life-saving work and sensitive personal information. It’s important to be mindful of this and always seek permission for photography, filming or recording – even if it’s just for your own personal use.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care was asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSSocial mediaPrivacyTikTokInstagramHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

That is far higher than the average four days taken off sick by workers in the UK overall.A report by Unison found that call handlers’ jobs have become increasingly challenging in recent years as the demand for care, which rose during Covid, has remained consistently high since, while ambulance handover delays outside hospitals have worsened.In March control room staff in England, Scotland and Wales answered more than 700,000 calls – more than 22,000 a day.“These findings paint a bleak picture of the conditions faced by 999 control room staff. TV programmes about ambulance services don’t show things as they really are,” said Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary.Unison’s report said: “Relentless exposure to traumatic and increasingly complex incidents, verbal abuse, long shifts and low pay are contributing to stress, burnout and fatigue.One call handler told Unison: “Some shifts are overwhelmingly traumatic, with 90% of the calls of a distressing nature. One shift, I handled three road traffic accidents and two cardiac arrests.”“There’s a persistent pressure to remain on the phone, no matter how emotionally drained we are.”Another had dealt with four different calls about suicide in the same shift.A third said: “It’s relentless. You log in, take emotionally intense calls for 12 hours straight and then go home.“Certain calls stay with you. I once spoke to a distressed mother whose daughter had suffered life-changing burns. The panic in her voice is something I’ll never forget.”Several call handlers identified lack of support for dealing with the emotional and psychological impact of their jobs as a key reason why so many people leave.Unison obtained data from 11 of the UK’s 13 NHS regional ambulance services. They also found that some call handlers end up being off sick for several months because of stress and trauma, 80% of the South East Coast ambulance service’s (Secamb) call handlers left during 2023/24, and that Secamb also had the highest average number of days off sick taken by its call handlers – 54 days each in 2023/24.NHS England said call handlers played a vital role in the urgent and emergency care system and admitted that they needed to do more to support them. A spokesperson said: “We know there is more to do and the health service is committed to tackling burnout by continuing to offer more flexible working options.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

An MDC could now be established in early 2026, including representation from the council, which even now under Labour control has opposed the scheme.Cllr Adam Hug, the leader of the council, said: “While the mayor’s formal decision today was not the council’s preferred outcome, it is far from unexpected, and it is now important for Oxford Street’s future to move forward together.”He added that since 2022 the street had “roared back to life after the pandemic” and said the council would work with Khan to see it “reimagined” in a way that worked for visitors, shoppers and residents.Oxford Street is already largely restricted to general traffic but is a key route for London buses and taxis. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the LTDA, which represents black-cab drivers, thought the plans would worsencongestion in the capital. “Putting this traffic down surrounding streets will cause chaos – we’re already Europe’s most congested city, maybe we’ll now get the world title,” he said.Detailed traffic proposals to reroute buses and ban all traffic will be released and consulted on later this year.Khan added: “We want to rejuvenate Oxford Street; establish it as a global leader for shopping, leisure and outdoor events with a world-class, accessible, pedestrianised avenue. This will help to attract more international visitors, and act as a magnet for new investment and job creation, driving growth and economic prosperity for decades to come.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chief executive of Ikea Uk and Ireland, Peter Jelkeby, said the pedestrianisation plan was a positive step that would “create a more welcoming and accessible space – bringing wide-ranging benefits to visitors, shoppers, businesses and the wider community”.The executive director of Selfridges, Meave Wall, said the department store was “hugely energised by the renewed commitment to make this area more enticing and attractive for locals and visitors from around the world”.The New West End Company, which represents 600 businesses around the area, said the consultation results were an important step forward.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryPedestrianisationSadiq KhanLondonPlanning policyShops and shoppingnewsShareReuse this content"

Half said they sourced news from the once all-powerful TV networks.The accelerating global shift towards social media and video platforms is laid bare in a major study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which surveyed almost 100,000 news consumers worldwide.It reveals a further diminishing of the influence of traditional news organisations, with more people heading to podcasters, YouTubers and TikTokers. The authors warned it is allowing populist politicians such as Trump and Argentina’s Javier Milei to bypass the scrutiny of the transitional media in favour of new, online networks.The role of news influencers, who use their personal brand to win an online following, is growing, led by the extraordinary impact of thepodcaster Joe Rogan during last year’s US presidential election.One-fifth (22%) of those contacted in the US said they came across news or commentary from Rogan in the week after the presidential inauguration, including a disproportionate number of young men, a group traditional media struggles to reach.News influencers on YouTube, Instagram andTikTokare also finding large audiences in India, Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand, which have younger populations that are heavy social media users.Meanwhile,Elon Musk’s Xhas seen a major shift to the right among its users, according to the analysis. Musk’s takeover of the site has been followed by a 50% increase among right-leaning users, from 10% of the group in 2021 to 15% this year. There has been a corresponding fall in left-leaning users, from 17% to 14% over the same period, asliberals have abandoned the platform.The findings confirm the huge changes taking place in news consumption worldwide. “The rise of social video and personality-driven news represents another significant challenge for traditional publishers that are struggling to adapt their content and tone to these very different environments,” said Nic Newman, a founding member of the BBC News website and the study’s lead author.“Online video may be a good way to engage younger audiences, but there is very little commercial upside for publishers, with most news consumption taking place via platforms rather than owned and operated news websites. Publishers also face a loss of influence, with populist politicians increasingly looking to bypass scrutiny by working with sympathetic influencers instead.”View image in fullscreenThe report highlights the diminishing influence of traditional news organisations, whose scrutiny is also being bypassed.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesA decade ago, just two online networks were delivering news content to more than 10% of the report’s global sample. That has now grown to six.Facebookreaches more than a third (36%), whileYouTubeis not far behind (30%). Instagram and WhatsApp are used by around a fifth for news content, while 16% turn to TikTok and 12% still receive news from X.There are concerns that truth will suffer. Overall, 58% of the populations studied remain worried about their ability to tell what is true from what is false online. Concern is highest in Africa (73%) and the US (73%).Thephenomenon of news avoidance continues to riseas users restrict the amount they consume, complaining about feeling overwhelmed by a gloomy news agenda. Four in 10 people in the study’s global sample said they sometimes or often avoid the news – up from 29% in 2017 – the joint highest figure ever recorded.The UK has one of the highest proportions of news avoiders, where 46% say they sometimes or often avoid the news.In another major change on the horizon, young people are already turning to artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini for news. It poses a serious risk to news companies as users may receive all the information they need through a chatbot without ever visiting the original source of the story.The numbers using chatbots for news are still relatively small overall, but are higher with under-35s at 12% of the group. Across all the countries involved in the study, people expect AI will make the news cheaper and more up-to-date but less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYouTubeTikTokXInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed”.However, the US executive order implementing the deal highlighted a possible hiccup over steel tariffs. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel.In a paragraph setting out a future move to “most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles”, the order says the UK has “committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities”.This would seem to refer to US worries about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel even though the UKgovernment took control of the company in Aprilto stop Jingye closing its Scunthorpe plant. Trump’s administration wants assurances that Jingye does not use British Steel as a way to circumvent US tariffs.A full version of the deal first outlined in May hadbeen seen as imminent, but Downing Street will be particularly happy to have it finalised at the summit, with full endorsement from a cheerful Trump – even if he did wrongly say the deal was with the EU.“I just signed it, and it’s done. And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union, and it’s a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income,” Trump said.“And we have many, many other ones coming. But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good, but the relationship that we have is fantastic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s slightly more liberal than I am,” Trump joked at one point.Asked if the UK was now protected from future tariffs, Trump said: “The UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them – that’s their ultimate protection.”He added: “The prime minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He’s done a very, very good job. He’s done what other people, they’ve been talking about this deal for six years, and he’s done what they haven’t been able to do. So he’s done really a very good job.”The comments came just before the pair met for talks at the G7 event, where Starmer was poised to push the US president for new sanctions against Russia and to help end the war between Iran and Israel.In a separate announcement late on Monday, Downing Street said it expected further sanctions on Moscow to be set out at the summit, seeking to “ratchet up pressure until Russia is ready to commit to a full and unconditional ceasefire”.

The raids have continued as Donald Trump has sent the national guard and marines to LA to respond to protests, despite the objections of California leaders, who havesued to stop a deploymentthey deem unconstitutional.Also over the weekend, videoemergedof immigration actions in Montebello, a suburb east of the city of LA. Last Thursday, armed border patrol agents, who drove in an unmarked car, ended up detaining Jason Brian Gavidia and pressing him against a fence by an auto body shop he runs, the New York Timesreported.View image in fullscreenAfter millions protested Trump in national ‘No Kings’ demonstrations, the president to escalate Ice raids in Democratic-run cities, including LA, Chicago and New York.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesAn agent interrogated Gavidia, a US citizen, asking, “What hospital were you born at?” Gavidia, 29, was born down the street, and video shows agents twisting his arm, as he said, “I’m American! … I’ll show you my ID. I was born here.” A witness filming the encounter is heard saying: “Literally based off skin color.”Gavidia was released, but Javier Ramirez, another US citizen who is Gadivia’s friend and coworker, was detained by two agents, forced facedown on the ground and taken to federal detention, where he has remained in custody, the New York Times reported.Salvador Melendez, the mayor of Montebello, acitythat is 79% Latino, told the Guardian on Monday that the videos and reports of Ice in his community had caused widespread anxiety.“This is racial profiling. They’re stopping folks because of the way they look,” said Melendez. “Ice agents are terrorizing our community. They are taking actions and asking questions later. There is absolutely no due process.”Ice agents were spotted in a small area of Montebello, the mayor said. “But psychologically, they are already in our whole city. People are not going to work, not going out, not going to school. People don’t want to ride the bus. It’s extremely unfair … seeing Ice agents come in with these big guns, it almost feels like a war zone. They’re militarized to apprehend folks and they rough up our people.”After millions protested Trump in national “No Kings” demonstrations, the president pledged Sunday toescalate Ice raids in Democratic-run cities, including LA, Chicago and New York.“Folks have to stay vigilant, we have to look out for one another. If you see something, alert your neighbors,” said Melendez. “It’s beautiful to see people coming together, helping their neighbors and rallying against this … This is not normal and we have to be outspoken.”Immigrant rights’ lawyers have said that people detained in the raids have disappeared or had little contact with theirattorneys or families. Amid the crackdown, residents across the region have increasinglygone into hiding, turning typically lively immigrant hubs desolate.View image in fullscreenMarchers stop to look at flyers with photos of people who have been arrested by Ice.Photograph: David McNew/Getty ImagesDHS and border patrol did not respond to inquiries about the detentions in Montebello, but Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary, said in a press release Monday: “DHS targets have nothing to do with an individuals’ skin color. What makes someone a target is if they are in the United States illegally.”A spokesperson added in a statement to the Guardian: “DHS and its components continue to enforce the law every day in greaterLos Angelesand throughout the country … DHS agencies will not be deterred from the completion of our mission.”The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, has continued to keep a curfew in place for the downtown neighborhood that has been at the center of protests, but some activities in the center of the city have resumed, includingtheatrical performances. And while the national guard remains deployed, as the courts consider California’s objections, many areas in the LA region were functioning relatively normally, with little sign of the protests and the aggressive federal response.But signs of the immigration crackdown are still being felt across the city. In LA’s Koreatown, a dense immigrant neighborhood, street vendors have been staying home out of fear of raids, causing significant financial hardships, said Andreina Kniss, an organizer with Ktown for All, a mutual aid group. Volunteers identified more than 60 families of vendors out of work andfundraisedmore than $50,000 for them, she said. The group had distributed funds to 36 families covering a month of expenses, as of Monday morning, allowing vulnerable workers to stay home.“We felt like we couldn’t stand around and watch them have to make the choice between being kidnapped and paying their bills,” she said. “The city is being held hostage economically, and it’s not going to end until these Ice raids end.”She hoped to see mutual aid efforts expand: “The $2,000 you raise for a family might prevent a family separation. It can change people’s lives. We’re just normal neighbors who care about neighbors.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesUS immigrationCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

They said the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and Plasencia is expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks.Plasencia and a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer had been the primary targets of the prosecution, after three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for their cooperation.Plasencia had been scheduled to start trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.Perry was found dead by his assistant on 28 October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine was the primary cause of death. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common.Perry, 54, began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. About a month before the actor’s death, he found Plasencia, a doctor who in turn allegedly asked the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to obtain the drug for him, according to court filings in the Chavez case.“I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia texted Chavez, according to court filings from prosecutors. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between Santa Monica,California, where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged at least four vials of ketamine, the filings said.Matthew Perry died of ‘acute effects of ketamine’, autopsy report saysRead moreAfter selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry’s “go-to”, prosecutors said.While Plasencia is accused of supplying the bulk of Perry’s ketamine in his final weeks, another defendant, Jasmine Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major ketamine dealer, is alleged to have provided the dose that killed the actor. She is also scheduled to go to trial in August. She has pleaded not guilty – making her the only one of five people charged in Perry’s death who has not entered a plea agreement.Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time onFriends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMatthew PerryDrugsCaliforniaFriendsnewsShareReuse this content"

Columbia largely accepted the government’s terms for restoring funding – in anagreementwidely panned as a capitulation of its own academic freedom – several days before the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) sued the Trump administration over the cuts.The judge in the case, Mary Kay Vyskocil of the southern district of New York, ruled that the faculty unions had no “standing” to bring the suit and had not clearly indicated how the administration had broken the law.Trump officials cutting $1bn in NIH grants is ‘void and illegal’, judge rulesRead more“It is not the role of a district court judge to direct the policies of the Executive Branch first and ask questions later,” the judge, a Trump appointee, wrote in her 30-pageruling. “Plaintiffs have not established their standing to litigate this case, let alone any violation of any law.” She seemed to accept the government’s prerogative to withhold funding and its argument that Columbia had enabled antisemitism to fester on campus. She also noted that Columbia had remained “conspicuously absent” from the case.The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment. That funding has not yet been restored though the education secretary Linda McMahon recently said that Columbia had “made great progress” and that the administration was considering a consent decree with the university.The administration has also cut billions in funding to several other universities, warning dozens more that it is investigating them over alleged antisemitism on campuses. So far, Harvard, which has lost more than $3bn in federal funding, is the only university to sue the administration in two separate lawsuits, one overfunding cutsand another against the administration’s ban on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students. On Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts extended atemporary blockon the administration’s order concerning Harvard’s foreign students.The AAUP has filed three other lawsuits against the Trump administration – over its ban ondiversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, theattempted deportationof pro-Palestinian students and funding cuts at Harvard. The group has vowed to fight on.“This is a disappointing ruling, but by no means the end of the fight,” Todd Wolfson, the AAUP president said. “The Trump administration’s threats and coercion atColumbia Universityare part of an authoritarian agenda that extends far beyond Columbia. Ultimately, lifesaving research, basic civil liberties and higher education in communities across the country are all on the line. Faculty, students, and the American public will not stand for it. We will continue to fight back.”Protect Democracy, the group representing the AAUP and AFT said they would appeal Monday’s ruling and vowed to “continue to fight to stop the administration from using public funding as a cudgel to consolidate power over higher education”, they wrote in a statement.“This is a deeply problematic decision that ignores what this is all about – a government attempt to punish a university over student protests that galvanized a national movement in opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza,” said Radhika Sainath, senior managing attorney at Palestine Legal, a group advocating for pro-Palestinian voices on US campuses which had filed a brief in support of the AAUP’s lawsuit.“The court uncritically takes the government’s line for granted, that speech activity critical of Israel is inherently anti-Jewish – though Jewish students and professors make up a large percentage of those speaking up for Palestinian human rights.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationColumbia UniversityUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It would not apply to the national guard or other troops and it exempts Swat teams and officers responding to natural disasters.Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator representing San Francisco, and Jesse Arreguin, a Democratic state senator representing Berkeley and Oakland, said the proposal seeks to boost transparency and public trust in law enforcement.“We are seeing more and more law enforcement officers, particularly at the federal level, covering their faces entirely, not identifying themselves at all and, at times, even wearing army fatigues where we can’t tell if these are law enforcement officers or a vigilante militia,” Wiener said.Ice raids in LA continue as armed agents target immigrant communitiesRead more“They are grabbing people off our streets and disappearing people, and it’s terrifying,” he added.The state senators said that in recent months, federal officers have conducted raids while covering their faces, and at times their badges and names, at churches, restaurants, hardware stores and schools in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Concord, Downey and Montebello.“Law enforcement officers are public servants and people should be able to see their faces, see who they are, know who they are. Otherwise, there is no transparency and no accountability,” Wiener said.Some videos of raids showing masked officers using unmarked vehicles and grabbing people off the streets have circulated on social media in recent weeks.On Wednesday, a group of masked and armed mendetained a Latino manin a church parking lot in Downey, a small, largely Latino suburb near Los Angeles.The senior pastor of the church, Rev Tanya Lopez,described the incidentand said the men did not identify what agency they worked for and refused to provide their names or badge numbers when asked. Lopez attempted to speak to the man, who only spoke Spanish, but one of the men turned a rifle on her.“Who knows if this man is a citizen?

The bank believes that the oil market may have already accounted for a loss of some Iranian oil production, meaning that prices would most likely remain steady at the current price of about $75 a barrel.The theory was echoed by analysts at Rystad Energy, a globally recognised consultancy, which said that the conflict appeared likely to be contained by the involvement of the US, which hopes to keep oil prices low.The market would probably remain capped at below $80 a barrel if the White House can broker a period of relative calm in the region, it said.What is the Strait of Hormuz, and why does it matter?The market’s muted reaction belies its intense focus on the Strait of Hormuz.The 21-mile wide waterway located south of Iran is a narrow chokepoint for the world’s fossil fuel supplies, through which 20% of global oil supplies and 20% of liquefied natural gas (LNG) flow.Iran produced about 3.4m barrels of oil a day in May, and exported about 1.7m barrels a day, or 1.6% of global oil demand. China is the biggest importer of oil produced in Iran.Fears that the strait could be shut due to regional tensions are well-rehearsed within the global energy industry. Iran has threatened to close the strait in retaliation in the past so, although this remains an unlikely scenario, it is a key focus for oil market traders.So far, transportation of oil appears to be unaffected  by the conflict. The number of ships passing through the strait of Hormuz increased 5% in the week up to Sunday, with 954 vesselspassing through the waterway,  according to data released by the Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) on Monday.The JMIC, which coordinates information from international navies, said the strait remained open but the threat to traffic was still significant. It also reported ongoing jamming of communications signal in the “broader Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz” .Lloyd’s List Intelligence, which monitors maritime traffic, said that loadings of vessels in the Gulf continued over the weekend but tankers waiting to load in Iran were keeping a greater distance from the port.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said on Monday it had received multiple reports of increasing electronic interference in the waters of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.It added that the interference was significantly impacting vessels’ positional reporting through automated systems.What do higher oil prices mean for household finances?In the UK, the most likely impact of the crisis on household finances would be on petrol prices and gas bills, although this may not be apparent for months.While the recent oil price hike by $10 a barrel may resultin a 5p per litre increase in petrol and diesel pricesat the pump over the next couple of months, wholesale costs are still well below the highs seen in the first quarter of the year.Average UK petrol prices have so far remained stable at 132p a litre and diesel at 138.2p a litre, according to the AA, well below the 145.3p a litre and 153.9p a litre for petrol and diesel respectively in March last year.An escalation of the conflict that blocks UK imports of gas from Qatar, a major UK trading partner, would also have a significant impact on British heating bills.Europe’s gas markets remain well above the levels before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the end of Russia’s pipeline gas exports to most of Europe has left the continent more reliant on imports of gas from farther afield, including LNG imports from the US, the Middle East and Africa.Would more drilling in the North Sea lower prices for households?No. Although flaring geopolitical tensions are frequently used by some to argue for an increase in North Sea oil and gas production, there is evidence to suggest that the small volumes produced domestically would do little to temper surging global oil prices.An oil market surge might mean higher profits for North Sea drillers, but their supplies would be unlikely to mean lower bills for households.Explore more on these topicsOilMiddle East and north AfricaOil and gas companiesIranIsraelCommoditiesEnergy industryexplainersShareReuse this content"

He also said the war in Ukraine would not have happened if Moscow had been kept in the club.Trump made his remarks in front of media, alongside Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, who is hosting the G7, at the start of the summit’s first round of talks.Russia wasthrown out of the G8 after it invaded Crimea in 2014, and Trump’s defence of Vladimir Putin came a day before the US president is scheduled to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the fringes of the summit. It will be the first meeting between the two men since Pope’s Francis’s funeral in April.Zelenskyy is pressing for a reluctant Trump to respond to Putin’s refusal to agree a 30-day ceasefire byapplying sanctions on Russia that the US Senate has already approved.Trump, however, has shown little sign of losing patience, and late on Monday said he was still waiting to see whether a deal could be reached with Moscow.“Sanctions costs us a lot of money. It costs the US a lot of money. You are talking about billions and billions of dollars,” he said.Earlier in the day he repeated his opinion that expellingRussiafrom the G8 was a “big mistake”.“You wouldn’t have that war,” he said. “You know you have your enemy at the table, I don’t even consider, he wasn’t really an enemy at that time.”He blamed the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama for Putin’s expulsion.“Obama didn’t want him, and the head of your country didn’t want him,” Trump said, naming Trudeau several times and calling the ousting a mistake.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled that the EU would be asking the US and other G7 member states to tighten sanctions on Russia by lowering the cap at which Russian oil can be bought from $60 a barrel to $45.The aim is to reduce Russian revenues from oil sales. TheG7originally set up the complex price cap, so the EU needs the support of all G7 states to lower it.Von der Leyen told reporters: “To achieve peace through strength we must put more pressure on Russia to secure a real ceasefire, to bring Russia to the negotiating table, and to end this war.“Sanctions are critical to that end. As a result of the G7 and EU sanctions combined, for example, Russian oil and gas revenues have fallen by almost 80% since the beginning of the war.”The EU is preparing an 18th round of sanctions heavily focused on cutting off Russia’s oil revenues.Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy said: “Russia spits in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war.”He said the latest Russian attacks on energy infrastructure came right after Putin had spoken to Trump offering to act as a mediator in the Iran-Israel crisis.“This war could have ended long ago if the world had reacted to Russia in a principled way instead of falling for manipulation and lies,” he said.He said that unlike Russia, Ukraine had complied with US requests not to target its opponent’s energy facilities.Trump also gave no obvious ground on tariffs in his bilateral meeting with Carney. “I’m a tariff person,” he said. “It’s simple, it’s easy, it’s precise and it just goes very quickly.“I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good.”Trump has imposed levies on steel, aluminium, cars and other Canadian products that do not comply with the continental free trade agreement’s rules of origin.Explore more on these topicsG7Donald TrumpRussiaCanadaAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It would allow US authorities to impose an additional tax starting at 5% and increasing by five percentage points annually, up to 20%.Max Yoeli, a senior research fellow in the US and the Americas programme at Chatham House, says section 899 “threatens to further alienate foreign investors”.It could chill investment into the US by calling into question its “fundamental openness”, he addedin a comment piece.The Italian bank UniCredit agrees that section 899 could further damage foreign investor sentiment towards US dollar-denominated assets. It could backfire on the US, it says, given the large amount of domestic assets held by foreigners.“The list of countries that would fall into this category is long and encompasses most European countries, including Italy and Germany,” UniCredit told clients, saying that foreign investors had more than doubled their holdings of US assets over the past decade.“Not only would this additional tax serve to finance corporate tax reductions, but it would also likely be used as a negotiating tool for the US in trade deals, especially as Republicans seem willing to withdraw from the global minimum tax framework.”View image in fullscreenA chart showing the value of US assets held by foreign investors, in trillions of US dollars.Photograph: UniCreditUniCredit also fears the dollar’s safe haven status could be undermined if there are fresh tax disputes between the US and other countries.The One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed by the US House of Representatives last month. The Senate is yet to approve the bill, with the White House setting a deadline of 4 July.George Saravelos, the global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, warned last month that section 899 could allow the US administration to transform its trade war into a capital war by “explicitly using taxation on foreign holdings of US assets as leverage to further US economic goals”.UK companies could certainly fall foul of section 899, as Britainoperates a digital services taxaimed at tech multinationals, and adiverted profits taxdesigned to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first, containing the flight data recorder, was located within 28 hours ofThursday’s disaster in Ahmedabad, in which at least 279 people died.Most of the victims were onboard flight AI171 bound for London Gatwick, all but one of whom died after the plane crashed into buildings moments after failing to properly take off from Ahmedabad airport.Air India captain sent mayday less than minute before crash, say authoritiesRead moreThe captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, sent a mayday call seconds after the plane left the runway.No evidence or explanation has yet been shared from the investigation, led by Indian officials with assistance from the UK and US. They werereported to be initially focusing on engine failureand issues with the wing flaps and landing gear to trace the causes of one of the world’s worst ever plane crashes.Most relatives of the 279 known victims, 38 of whom were killed on the ground, were still waiting on Monday for results of DNA testing before health officials could return the bodies of their ones.About 80 of the deceased had been identified by late on Sunday, according to a doctor at Ahmedabad’s civil hospital, Rajnish Patel. “This is a meticulous and slow process, so it has to be done meticulously only,” Patel said.crash graphicWhile some mourners have held funerals, most are facing an anguished wait.Rinal Christian, 23, the younger brother of a passenger, told the AFP news agency: “They said it would take 48 hours.

Air India was ordered to carry out additional maintenance and checks on the 33 remaining planes in its fleet but big airlines around the world continue to operate the model as normal. More than 1,000 are in regular service.Investigators will also have to consider the possibility of human error and aspects such as aircraft maintenance at the airline, which is owned by Tata Group. The company has been trying to revamp its ageing fleet.Air India’s chair, N Chandrasekaran, told staff on Monday that the crash should be a catalyst to improve safety, urging employees to be resolute in the face of any criticism.During a meeting attended by nearly 700 staff at the company’s headquarters near Delhi, Chandrasekaran said it was the most heartbreaking crisis of his career. “We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline,” he said.“We need to wait for the investigation ... It’s a complex machine, so a lot of redundancies, checks and balances, certifications, which have been perfected over years and years.

That would have led to 2,700 immediate job cuts as well as the symbolic loss of Britain’s ability to make steel from iron ore.Jingye is still the legal owner of British Steel, despite the takeover. British Steel owed Jingye businesses £711m at the end of December 2023, according to previously published accounts.The bulk of those debts, £434m, is owed to Jingye’s Chinese subsidiaries. Another €312.5m (£266m) is owed to Jingye’s British holding company, Jingye Steel (UK) Holding Ltd.In newly released accounts for the UK company, Jingye said it is “currently assessing the recoverability of these balances and the potential for a commercial settlement”. However, it cautioned that “due to the complexity of the arrangements and the ongoing nature of discussions, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate the amount or timing of any recovery”.The accounts suggest that Jingye is gearing up for negotiations with the government over the size of the debt repayment. Those debts would probably have been wiped out in the liquidation planned by Jingye, but were preserved by the government intervention.The Financial Times has previously reported that the government hadconsidered legislation to wipe out the debts, although that would probably raise significant opposition from investors as it would represent the direct expropriation of privately held assets.Jingye also said it expected a “commercial resolution” in relation to the ownership of the business, suggesting it may hope to receive a payment for its shareholding. It has engaged the law firm Linklaters to advise on recovering money, Sky News first reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s it,” he said. “We’re not going home. We get to play tomorrow night. But it’s pretty cool.”A NO-HITTER AND MCWS-RECORD 19 STRIKEOUTS FOR GAGE WOOD!What a performance for the Arkansas pitcher 🔥pic.twitter.com/QC4E7r1Nrl— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter)June 16, 2025Arkansas (49-14) play another elimination game Tuesday night against the winner of Monday night’s game between LSU and UCLA.Murray State (44-17), only the fourth No 4 regional seed since 1999 to reach Omaha, went 0-2 in their first appearance.Wood’s bid for a perfect game ended in the eighth when his 2-2 breaking ball hit Dom Decker in his back foot.Nezza sings national anthem in Spanish at Dodgers as protest against immigration raidsRead more“When I hit the guy in the foot, I knew I screwed up,” said Wood, who got a foul out and consecutive strikeouts to end the inning, then looked skyward and gave a primal scream and did a couple of high steps as he headed to the dugout.The Arkansas faithful behind the first-base dugout did a brief “Woo Pig Sooie!” chant as Wood warmed up for the ninth.Wood (4-1) hit pinch-hitter Nico Bermeo in the back of his left elbow with a fastball to start the ninth. Bermeo initially was awarded first base, but Arkansas challenged the call, arguing Bermeo moved his elbow into the pitch. The call was overturned and Bermeo was out.Wood struck out Connor Cunningham and Jonathan Hogart to finish the game. He was mobbed by teammates, with the celebration moving from behind the mound to the area between second and third base.“Gage was just executing pitch after pitch, getting ahead in the count and elevating his fastball in and out. What a great job,” coach Dave Van Horn said. “The few plays we had to make behind him – maybe nine, eight? – just glad we made all those plays.”Wood went to three-ball counts just twice, and 83 of his 119 pitches were strikes.The closest Murray State came to breaking up Wood’s no-hitter was Carson Garner’s hot grounder that pulled first baseman Reese Robinett to his left. Robinett snagged the ball and touched the bag for the last out of the seventh inning.View image in fullscreenGage Wood of the Arkansas Razorbacks threw a career-long six innings and struck out a career-high 13 against Creighton in a 1 June regional game at George Cole Field during the Fayetteville Regional.Photograph: Wesley Hitt/Getty ImagesWood showed early signs that this could be a special day. He had excellent command of his signature four-seam fastball, breaking ball and changeup. Of his first 20 fastballs, 19 were strikes, and he fanned nine of the first 12 batters he faced – seven in a row from the third to fifth innings.Wood has gone from closer as a freshman to middle reliever as a sophomore to weekend starter as a junior. He injured his right shoulder throwing a warmup pitch in his 23 February start against Michigan and didn’t return until 18 April against Texas A&M, a total of 54 days.He threw a career-long six innings and struck out a career-high 13 against Creighton in a 1 June regional game, then went three and one third innings in a super regional win over Tennessee on 8 June.Wood now joins Ehrler and Wixson in CWS lore. Ehrler’s no-hitter came in Texas’ 7-0 win over Tufts on 19 June 1950, and Wixson’s came in a 7-0 victory over North Carolina on 15 June 1960.Asked what he did with the game ball, Wood said, “I gave it to my dad and said happy late Father’s Day.”The Razorbacks broke open the game after Murray State’s Graham Kelham relieved Isaac Silva to start the seventh. SEC player of the year Wehiwa Aloy doubled in a run and another scored when right fielder Dustin Mercer tried to make a shoestring catch on Logan Maxwell’s shallow fly and the ball got under his glove.Silva kept his team close in his six innings, with Charles Davalan’s third-inning RBI single producing the only run against him.Silva allowed six hits, walked two and struck out seven. He repeatedly got out of trouble, holding the Razorbacks to 2-for-10 hitting with runners in scoring position and stranding two runners in the third, fifth and sixth.Explore more on these topicsBaseballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’scomically underattended military paradelurched through Washington DC at the exact same time on Saturday as theoverwrought opening ceremonyunspooled for Fifa’s beleaguered Club World Cup, in a definitely-not-full Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.Trump’s jingoistic birthday bust contrasted painfully with themultimillion-strong turnoutat the “No Kings” anti-Trump rallies that gathered all over the country. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, meanwhile – or “Johnny”, as Trump pronounces the name of one of his favorite allies in the sports world –had promisedthe opening match of the swollen tournament he forced down the soccer world’s throat would be sold out. Instead, attendance between Inter Miami and Al Ahly,a fitting 0-0 stalemate, was announced at a still-better-than-expected 60,927 in the 64,767-seat venue.Messi drink launch affirms Spanish as new lingua franca at Club World Cup | Barney RonayRead moreMind you, that was after ticket prices had reportedly been cut from $349 to just $4.And so began not only the expandedClub World Cupbut the Concacaf Gold Cup as well, kicking off a 13-month period, culminating in the 2026 World Cup final, during which organizers hope the United States will take a star turn as a soccer destination, elevate the sport and enrich all those involved.For all the buildup, and despite the bought-and-paid-for enthusiasm from the Dazn studio analysts hyping up the Club World Cup, the entire spectacle felt a bit flat, and about as impactful as the omnipresent advertising for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund on the hoardings surrounding the field at both tournaments.On the Big Soccer Event Excitement Dial that reads “meh” at one end and “2022 World Cup final” at the other, the needle never crossed beyond the halfway point. Attendances reflected as much.On Sunday, the United States men’s national team dominated an utterly hopeless Trinidad and Tobago in their Gold Cup opener,5-0, reconstituting a modicum of momentum at long last followinga dispiriting stretch of lossesfor Mauricio Pochettino’s men. But a mere 12,610 had turned up to the 18,000-seat PayPal Park in San Jose.More remarkably still, Mexico did not pack out SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on Saturday, even though the Los Angeles area is probablyEl Tri’s biggest market other than Mexico City. Just 54,309 of the 70,240 seats were occupied as Mexico edged past Gold Cup debutants Dominican Republic 3-2.None of the other Club World Cup games of the opening weekend sold out either. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena drew plenty but was not full for the most appealing match of the slate, European champions Paris Saint-Germain’s 4-0 rinsing of 10-man Atlético Madrid. Only just over half of MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford filled in for Palmeiras v Porto, another scoreless affair. Bayern Munich’s10-0 destruction of Auckland City– because it was apparently important to establish whether the champions of Oceania belonged on the same field as the 34-time German champions – couldn’t even fill up a 26,000-seat Major League Soccer venue in Cincinnati. Fans, however, did score an 11th goal, of a sort, witha bannermarking the 10th anniversary ofthe Baur au Lac raidthat swept up a generation of corrupt Fifa officials. “World football is more poorly governed than before!” it proclaimed. “Smash FIFA!” Sunday’s nightcap between Botafogo and the Seattle Sounders didn’t sell out either, with an official attendance of 31,151 in 68,740-seat Lumen Field, even though the Sounders were playing at home (though that figure is in line with the team’s usual average).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, there was hardly any overlap in the markets where matches were held last weekend – other than PSG v Atleti and Mexico v Dominican Republic, both played in the Los Angeles area.Certainly, theshocking prices Fifa initially demandedfor the Club World Cup did not help, even if the “dynamic pricing model” ensured that they tumbled rapidly in the last few weeks. Concacaf, likewise, is notorious for charging sky-high prices, even if those prices leave stadiums half-empty. That’s hardly looking like it will change. When US Soccer submitted its bid book with Mexico and Canada for the World Cup more than eight years ago, it projected an average ticket price of $305 for the group stage.Yet there was fun to be salvaged from the proceedings. The USMNT’sbig winwas satisfying, for US fans at least, and the Dominican Republic’s challenge of mighty Mexico wasan uncut bit of fun.Al Ahly ran roughshod over Miami for much of the first half but somehow failed to find the net with a disallowed goal and a missed penalty in a scintillating 45 minutes marked by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari’s remarkable saves. In the second half, Lionel Messi stirred himself to bedevil the Egyptian side with a vintage display. Yet Messi hit the crossbar with a long, late, swerving shot and Al Ahly made a series of remarkable goalline saves to preserve the draw.These were footballing fireworks.

He hadqualified in fifthon the grid and had been hoping to make inroads on those ahead of him while managing his tyres. But the accident cost him half a second per lap and was followed by other problems with the car.McLaren play it cool after Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri collide at Canadian GPRead moreThe 40-year-old Britonfinished sixthin a race won by George Russell, well behind the leading contenders. “I was holding on up until the damage, I was kind of holding on to Oscar Piastri I think,” Hamilton told Sky Sports.“I was feeling optimistic and then I didn’t see it happen but obviously I heard I hit a groundhog, so that’s devastating. I love animals so I’m so sad about it. That’s horrible. It’s never nice to see that – I just hope it didn’t suffer.“That’s never happened to me here before. But the floor, basically the right side has a hole in it and all the veins are all gone. Then, we had a brake issue halfway through as well. I’m grateful that I could just finish, particularly with the brake issue I had to bag those points. But to still come away with sixth, I think if everything was perfect, if we had done everything right, if we didn’t have any problems, maybe it would have been fourth.”Lando Norris, meanwhile, has been warned to expect “tough conversations” by McLaren after the team principal, Andrea Stella, conceded the British driver’s confidence will have been dented by his crash with Oscar Piastri.Norris collided with his teammate as they fought for fourth in the closing laps of the grand prix on Sunday. Norris accepted full responsibility for a collision he said made him look foolish and leaves him 22 points behind Piastri in the battle for the drivers’ title.

The situation would have been different if Lando did not take responsibility and apologise.”Norris was already on the back foot heading into the race following two mistakes in qualifying which left him seventh on the grid. He drove well to bring himself back into contention only to misjudge the move on Piastri, which again raises questions over his credentials as a legitimate championship contender.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But despite his latest setback, he said: “There are plenty more races left. I don’t expect to catch Oscar easily.

Spaun, not so long ago a journeyman professional, played out his dream by holing out from 65ft on the final green at Oakmont.Spaun is a prime example of how the penny can drop for golfers at different stages. Now 34, he is in the form of his life and bound for the Ryder Cup. When he talked later of being awake at three o’clock on Sunday morning because his young daughter was vomiting, his relatability only grew. Everybody loves an underdog.JJ Spaun completes fairytale with monster final putt on wet and wild day at US OpenRead moreSpaun’s heroics on that 72nd green did the United StatesGolfAssociation a huge favour. It provided an upbeat tournament reference point. Until then, the US Open had been defined by chaos and carnage.Plenty of people like their sport that way. A chunk of the golfing audience think it is magnificent that cosseted players endure one week a year where par is king. There is a counter point, one which says Argentina taking on Spain in a World Cup final where the grass was knee high and goals were wonky might be riveting for a while but would hardly determine sporting excellence. Why not make the courts smaller during the opening rounds at Wimbledon? So long as everyone played by the same rules, where is the problem? The 125th US Open came dangerously close to crazy golf territory.There are surely only so many times you can watch professionalsbarely move a ball from dense roughbefore turning over to the Antiques Roadshow. And this is all US Open competitors could do; there was no concept of imagination, creativity or great skill when the ball bounded through slick greens or off sloping fairways. Oakmont provided a wonderful test of attitude, of that there is no question. Beyond that? Hmm.View image in fullscreenAdam Scott’s challenge at the US Open faltered on the back nine on Sunday, with the rough behind him one reason why so many players struggled.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesThere is a key background theme when it relates to the US Open and course setup. This one has nothing to do with ego or the desire of officials to torture players in a manner nobody else can. Instead, it should be remembered that the USGA is front and centre when it comes to rolling back the golf ball for elite players from 2028. It believes hitting distances are out of control, leading to historic venues – such as Oakmont – potentially becoming obsolete. The argument is perfectly fair, albeit the USGA and its chums at the R&A have been painfully slow to address an issue where the horse bolted long before studies were commissioned.The USGA and R&A have opposition from umpteen other elements of the golf establishment. Last Wednesday, the USGA made plain it will not be delaying rollback plans. By Thursday, 156 players were chopping their way through Oakmont’s foliage. This felt no coincidence, instead a means of the USGA telling the world this is its only way to protect a course while scope to butcher it with 350-yard drives exists. Add in pin positions on slopes and golf’s playing aristocracy look silly. Every one of them did in this US Open.The difficulty comes when pondering whether luck became far too influential in the outcome. Tyrrell Hatton will spend days if not weeks bemoaning breaks on the last two days of the tournament. The Englishman has a point; both on Saturday and Sunday his ball finished in thick rough on slopes leading in to bunkers. Hatton had no proper shot to play on either occasion. This bunker protection was not needed – the sand traps themselves were penal enough – with their implementation only adding an element of freakishness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The margin for error was so small. This was amplified in the crucial stages, a rain deluge limiting the ability of players to control their ball to an even greater extent than before. Adam Scott, not one for outspoken comment, labelled the course “borderline unplayable”. The guddle in the puddle. Golfers live charmed lives and it was telling, beyond Scott and Matt Fitzpatrick, they refused to bemoan the Oakmont situation. Privately, though, there were plenty of questions raised about fairness.Rory McIlroy has his own challenges after achieving his lifetime dream at the Masters. Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler somehow ended up in the top 10 of the US Open. Yet at no stage was this an illustrious leaderboard, one which gave the sense of marquee names jousting for a trophy on Sunday. Spaun has no cause to care but there must be some responsibility on majors to let the cream rise to the top. Far too many A-listers departed Oakmont at halfway than was healthy.Spaun’s glorywas built on resilience. This relates to a career that was not going anywhere fast only a year ago and a US Open final round which included a front half of 40. He can celebrate as wildly as he likes. Big‑picture terms just determine this was a forgettable major.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenGolfPGA TourUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Mercedes-Benz Stadium can hold crowds of 75,000 but staging this match at 3pm on a Monday afternoon was probably not the wisest scheduling move.Chelsea 2-0 LAFC: Club World Cup – as it happenedRead moreVast sections were empty, the upper tiers were shut and Enzo Maresca probably summed it up best by noting that it was not easy forChelseato play in such a “strange environment”.It is embarrassing for Fifa given that Atlanta is not a place where football usually suffers from a lack of attention. This is the self-styled epicentre of soccer in the US, so much so that the new national training centre is being built on a 200-acre site near the city, but few locals seemed aware that this game was taking place.News of ticket prices tumbling in the hours before kick-off said a lot. After all Atlanta United, who play their Major League Soccer fixtures here, averaged attendances close to 45,000 last season; Chelsea also pulled in over 70,000 fans when they played Newcastle United in a pre-season friendly here two years ago.But perhaps the lack of interest was not a surprise. Chelsea versus Newcastle is one thing; Chelsea versus limited MLS opposition from the other side of the country does not quite have the same appeal. LAFC had familiar faces in Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud but Steve Cherundolo’s side were only taking part because of Club León being kicked out due to a breach of Fifa’s multi-club regulations.View image in fullscreenThere were plenty of empty seats at a ground that can hold 75,000.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesChelsea, on the other hand, will play in the Champions League next season, have the advantage of Premier League riches and are full of confidence afterwinning the Uefa Conference Leaguelast month. They have spent big and have added competition for places in attack after signing Delap from Ipswich for the bargain price of £30m. Delap has shown that he means business by taking the No 9 shirt. The 22-year-old has been signed to score goals but he can also make them.He was in bustling form after being thrown on midway through the second half and earned an assist when he crossed for another Chelsea substitute, Enzo Fernández, to kill off LAFC’s slim hopes of snatching a point with 11 minutes left. It was encouraging for Maresca to see his strikers gearing up for a battle to earn a starting spot.It was clear that Nicolas Jackson needed more support last season. Chelsea were not the same side when Jackson was unavailable and should think twice if they have any plans to sell the Senegal forward, whose blend of pace, power and intelligent link-up play proved far too much for LAFC’s to handle during a lopsided first half.True, the 23-year-old’s finishing can be frustrating. Yet while Jackson missed a good headed chance in the second half, he still managed to catch the eye by dropping deep to set up Chelsea’s opener by spraying a reverse pass down the right for Pedro Neto to cut inside, move on to his left foot and slam a low shot inside Lloris’s near post.“I am quite curious to see how Nico deals with competition,” Maresca said. “Hopefully both strikers can score goals and assist. We had two or three months last season without Nico and Marc Guiu. It is a nice feeling for a manager to have two strikers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reece James and Roméo Lavia need to be managed carefully and were replaced by Fernández and Malo Gusto at half-time.Chelsea, who face Flamengo in Philadelphia on Friday, improved when Delap came on. He troubled LAFC with his powerful running, barrelling down the right and almost finding Fernández. Neto then set up Cole Palmer, who shot wastefully over.It was over when Delap picked out a late run from Fernández, who converted from close range. There was concern when Moisés Caicedo went down with cramp. Perhaps the fact that clubs can pocket $2m (£1.47m) through group-stage victories will make the pain easier to ignore.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupChelseaLos Angeles FCmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old Ekitike has scored 19 goals in 47 Bundesliga appearances for Frankfurt, having initially been loaned to the German club in February 2024. The Frenchman subsequently signed a five-year deal for around £14m last April.

It’s one of the best and most competitive leagues in the world. I’m looking forward to testing myself at this level, facing top players every week and helping the team achieve great things.”Truffert, born in Belgium, won his sole France cap as a substitute in a2-0 Nations League defeat by Denmarkin September 2022. He played for France’s Under-23 team at the 2024 Olympics, helping them finish as runners-up, and scored nine goals in 191 appearances for Rennes.

The 26-year-old Udinese and Slovenia centre-half is very close to signing for Daniel Farke’s promoted team but late interest from other clubs, notably Newcastle and Milan, may place that £17m deal in peril.Bijol, though predominantly right-sided, is two-footed and has the sort of high-calibre passing range that betrays his origins as a defensive midfielder. Throw in his aerial ability and controlled aggression and it is easy to understand why the former CSKA Moscow player, who faced England at Euro 2024, is so admired by Farke.View image in fullscreenSlovenia defender Jaka Bijol is a target for Leeds and Newcastle.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APEddie Howe, Newcastle’s manager, is also seeking a right‑sided, ball-playing central defender to compete for that berth with Fabian Schär.

Clubs from the top division and WSL2 voted unanimously in favour of a proposal to expand the league and raise minimum standards, making the second tier fully professional.The changes must be backed by the FA because it has a “golden share” in WSL Football, which took over the running of the top two tiers of domes­tic women’s football in ­England last year. The vote at a shareholder meeting on Monday followed months of dis­cussions with players, clubs, fans and other stakeholders, during which more than 20 league formats were explored.Women’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from world’s top six leaguesRead moreNext season the top two WSL2 clubs will be promoted and the third-placed team will have a playoff against the bottom WSL side to determine who will take the 14th spot. The idea of scrapping relegation outright was rejected after a public backlash whenthe Guardian reportedthat it was among the options on the table.Thereafter the WSL’s bottom club will be relegated and replaced by the second-tier winners and the teams finishing second-bottom of the WSL and second in WSL2 will face a playoff. WSL2 will remain a 12‑club division.The FA continues to be responsible for the third-tier Women’s National League (WNL) and will decide on its format but it is proposed that from 2026‑27 the National League North and National League South winners be promoted and two WSL2 clubs drop down, in line with current guidelines.Next season, to achieve the ­requisite numbers in the top two divisions, the two WNL winners are due to be promoted but only one WSL2 club would be relegated and a ­playoff is planned between the WNL’s ­runners‑up for a third promotion spot.Any team promoted from the WNL must meet the minimum WSL2 standards to gain entry, or a relegated team would be given a reprieve.Nikki Doucet, the WSL Football chief executive, said: “We believe this next evolution of women’s ­professional football will raise minimum standards, create distinction and incentivise investment across the board … The introduction of a ­promotion/relegation playoff creates distinction for the women’s game and introduces a high-profile, high‑stakes match.”It is understood the decision not to expand the WSL beyond 14 teams, at least for the time being, is down to data suggesting it would dilute the quality and create a congested calendar, leaving too few available matchdays.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two more free agents, Vladimir ­Coufal and Kyle Walker-Peters, are also under consideration.Walker has become surplus to requirements at City after being loaned to Milan in January. But the Italian club do not wish to sign him permanently.Fenerbahce, managed by José Mourinho, are thought to be interested, as are Galatasaray though their first choice for the position is Sacha Boey of Bayern Munich.Tijjani Reijnders, meanwhile, is aiming to emulate Ilkay Gündogan as a goalscoring No 8 for City afterhis €55m (£46.6m) movefrom Milan last week. Reijnders has been signed by Pep Guardiola to be a dynamic box‑to‑box midfielder and the 26-year-old ­Dutchman is clear ­regarding who he will look to at City.“Gündogan is someone I can learn a lot from,” Reijnders said. “It’s nice to see him nearby and the way he does it.”View image in fullscreenTijjani Reijnders is with Manchester City in the US.Photograph: Carmen Mandato/Fifa/Getty ImagesAsked whether this included the German’s ability to score via late runs into the area, Reijnders said: “That is what I did last ­season with Milan, being more on the scoresheet. It’s very important to score goals as a ­midfielder and it’s what I’m ­looking for; that and assists.”Reijnders scored 10 times in 37 Serie A appearances in the past ­season, a sizeable increase on three in 36 in the ­pre­vious campaign. In all ­competitions he scored 15 times in 2024‑25, compared with four in 2023-24.“The first season at Milan I wasn’t calm in my head when I had opportunities and it was something I was thinking about in the summer after,” he said.“I watched clips of myself when I got into those situations and tried to adapt to those kinds of things in the second season, to be calmer in front of goal. The No 8 position is why they [City] got me. Now I have to fill the No 8 and do my best to show that I should play.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He arrives from Leicester, where he had worked under Ruud van Nistelrooy since last December.Barry-Murphy’s only experience as a first-team manager came with Rochdale, where he finished his playing career, from 2019-21. He then spent three years as manager of Manchester City’s elite development squad.Bournemouth sign Adrien Truffert, paving way for Liverpool target Kerkez to leaveRead more“One of the main reasons I came here was the opportunity to work with this group of players and the exceptional talent coming through, to mould a squad that gives the whole club something to be proud of,” Barry-Murphytold the club’s website.“We want to be successful, for sure, and I believe we will be. We’re here to win, to reward the supporters,” the 46-year-old added. “We want fans to feel genuinely excited walking into the stadium this week. To do something different with this group of players is my real vision for the club.”Barry-Murphy will be joined by Lee Riley, who departs his coaching role at Manchester City’s academy to become assistant coach. Riley worked with Barry-Murphy in City’s youth setup and at Rochdale.“I’d like to welcome Brian to Cardiff City Football Club. We are delighted that he has agreed to become head coach,” said the Cardiff owner, Vincent Tan.“Throughout the interview process, Brian showed a huge passion for our club because he believes in what we’re trying to do. He knows this level having played and managed at this standard before, where he was noted for his style of play. Since then, he has only gone from strength-to-strength as a leader.“He brings enthusiasm, vibrancy and an exciting outlook on what today’s football is, while looking to play an attacking style that our fans are sure to enjoy,” Tan added. “It’s a combination of all of Brian’s great talents that make him the right man to take us forward into this next chapter.”Born in Cork, Barry-Murphy played for his hometown club, Cork City, before joining Preston in 1999. He also played for Sheffield Wednesday and Bury before moving into coaching at Rochdale.Cardiff will play in the third tier next season after finishing bottom of the Championship, dropping out of the football pyramid’s top two divisions for the first time since the 2002-03 campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We recognised that and we thought that was wrong, so we began to run girls’ football programmes in schools, after the school day and during holidays, and what we found was that those girls were as talented as the boys, and that was with huge barriers and challenges around them and without any football role models they could look up to.”The decision to engage further with those girls grew from this. “If they wanted to model a football technique or a skill, they’d have to look to professional men players and that just didn’t sit right with the football club,” Hudson says. “So we took those girls’ football programmes and the passion, commitment, togetherness, belonging and loyalty that those girls were showing, which was just so powerful, and took a big leap of faith. We developed a youth training scheme for 16- to-18-year-olds with the aim of mirroring what the boys had in terms of a pathway.View image in fullscreenAn Arsenal in the Community girls’ session takes place at Haverstock School.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“There was no route into professional football for women but at least we could get to the point where they had a YTS scheme as an option. So they were full-time with us from 16 to 18 and were paid for by a government training scheme. The bulk of their time they were being coached as players, but then they gained lots of sports qualifications and gained experience in the JVC Centre at Arsenal in a sort of leisure centre environment. So we were equipping them with work skills and more. That was just such a powerful programme and all of a sudden that attracted players like Rachel Yankey.”The club would help senior players find jobs in the club too, Alex Scott famously washing the men’s team kits in her early days there.The landscape is very different today but Arsenal are still doing that base-level community work. One of the coaches working with the girls at Haverstock School, Abby Webster, is a former pupil. “As soon as I hit 18 I was able to get a job in the community,” she says. “I’ve been out to other places to get some more experience but then I’ve always come back here; this has always been where my heart stays.”Bella, Myah, Kayla and Stevie step away from the session, faces red, to talk about its impact. “We’re closer now,” says Bella. Abby, says Stevie, is “less like a coach and more like a person that you can go and talk to. She’s more like a cool, younger person, like a cousin or something.”All four have been taking part since the sessions began, having previously had only the inter-form cup available for matches. They love the sessions and have loved being taken on trips too, including to the Arsenal Hub, the centre of Arsenal in the Community. “We’ve met Declan [Rice],” says Myah. “We got signed shirts, the new shirts,” Kayla says.When Arsenal in the Community was launched in 1985, it was a way to give back to locals facing disruption on match days and engage with a generation of young people “that we felt they weren’t being listened to”, says Hudson, who was awarded an MBE last Friday for services to Arsenal’s community. “Unemployment was high, there was some racial tension in the city and we wanted to engage those young people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMany of those challenges exist today. “The riots in the 80s and 90s were kind of replicated in 2011,” Hudson says. “Society was in a pretty bad place back then and the challenges nowadays are similar, though there are some differences and different nuances. Unemployment is still a real challenge for certain young people that haven’t had any decent role modelling around education and work pathways.”View image in fullscreenFreddie Hudson was awarded an MBE last Friday for services to Arsenal’s community.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe community programme has also enabled Arsenal to assist local authorities with issues such as teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, school attendance and punctuality, Hudson says. “The beauty of the football club, though, is it’s nimble. It’s not a local authority, it’s not an NHS, where there’s levels of signoff you have to go through. We can be really responsive and with a bit of creativity and nimbleness and passion and commitment, all of a sudden you could be facing a challenge one day and the workforce could be out there with partners delivering on those challenges within a couple of weeks.”Arsenal want to ensure a route remains from their community work into the women’s and girls’ teams, alongside their talent ID programme and academy. “We are also aware of barriers that are there for local girls to come through and have plans to reduce those,” Wheatley says. Those plans include moving some training to Londonand helping with the financial burdens that come with being a part of a team.Improving the diversity of the senior side is also an important driver behind the work done further down the chain. Wheatley is proud of Arsenal’s diversity in the academy and says: “We have strengthened the pathway between the academy and first team just to ensure that there is that progress.”The success of the first team and of individual players provides what Hudson describes as “a golden opportunity that we can’t let pass” at community level. “All the success we’ve had in the 2022 Euros, with all the success that Arsenal Women have had with 62 trophies, it’s phenomenal,” he says. “And we’ve got a great window to drive some female-focused messages, supporting those young girls through pinch points of anxiety in their lives, but not just with women and girls. We’ve got a great opportunity to take some of those conversations, some of that education, some of that awareness, to a male audience, and that’s what we’re doing too.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After droppingout of Serie Alast season, they face the prospect of consecutive relegations if they cannot overturn their first-leg deficit.“Many players and staff, at the moment, are not even able to show up at the sports centre to resume training,” Milan said. The club said it had made informal contact with Serie B officials and received “general openness” to evaluating their postponement request.Salernitana have also called for an investigation into the “causes of this widespread and serious episode”. The incident risks prolonging a month-long saga that has seen Brescia being sent down to Serie C due to financial irregularities, andSampdoriahanded a chance to avoid relegation via the two-legged playoff.Explore more on these topicsSalernitanaEuropean club footballSampdorianewsShareReuse this content"

The 35‑year‑old scaled as high as No 21 less than two years ago but he now sits at No 199 in the ATP rankings. He received a wildcard to competeat Queen’s Cluband he will also need a wildcard in order to compete in the main draw at Wimbledon in two weeks’ time.“It’s always amazing to play here,” Evans said. “I didn’t know he was in the top 20, if I’m honest with you. I knew he was very good. I was really just trying to focus on playing some good tennis because this year it’s been few and far between.“Days like today, whatever happens this week, is why I’ve been carrying on; to get out here and put my game on the court and enjoy it.”Last month, Evans’s ranking of No 215 marked his lowest position since 2018. He has spent most of the past 10 months competing on the ATP Challenger tour and has reached just one quarter-final during this period. As he has struggled to build any momentum, even losing against multiple players ranked outside the top 350, his difficulties have naturally generated ample doubts about his future in the sport.“It has been a pretty long year so far, I’ve been playing the lower tournaments and, let’s be honest, this is why I’m still hanging around to get back on the grass and try and get some wins,” he said.Evans put together a spectacular match on Monday on the grass, a surface to which his distinct game remains so well suited. He bamboozled his American opponent throughout the match with his backhand slice, struck his forehand brilliantly and served well in the decisive moments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will now try to use the confidence he has gained from such an impressive match to replicate this level on a more consistent basis.Later on Monday, Jacob Fearnley eased into the second round with a 6-2, 6-4 win against Alex Bolt. Cameron Norrie, meanwhile, endured a difficult defeat against the 19-year-old eighth seed Jakub Mensik, losing 7-6 (6), 1-6, 6-1. “We played every tough game except for the last one and he won all of them,” Norrie said. “A good first match on the grass, and he served unbelievably well. I knew he had a good serve. I didn’t think it was really that good, but he’s a good player, tough player. I’m really impressed with him.”Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Reliever Sean Hjelle was told about 30 minutes before first pitch that he would start.Aaron Judge crushes home run off Red Sox rookie after ‘crazy’ Yankees jibeRead more“Yeah, it was a lot, and it was late, but you know what? This is something we really needed,” Giants manager Bob Melvin said. “To get a guy like Devers … there’s a lot you have to give up for him, but this fits us perfectly. It’s a power left-handed bat, a guy that can go the other way and hit for power in our ballpark. I mean, it’s tailor-made for us, so kudos to the front office to swing this.”A three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5m contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston’s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.But his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office “ should do their jobs ” and look for another player.A day after Devers’ comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora. The situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained a significant quadriceps injury on 23 May.“Everybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers – he basically was the face of the franchise,” San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said in an on-field interview during the ESPN broadcast.Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco’s president of baseball operations in September, said he reached out to Craig Breslow, Boston’s chief baseball officer, about two weeks ago. Trade talks picked up momentum over the past few days.Posey and Melvin declined to address what position Devers would play in San Francisco – “That’s a conversation for myself, Bob and [general manager Zack Minasian] to have with him,” Posey said – but they are convinced Devers’ bat will have a significant impact on a lineup that has produced only 16 homers from the left side this season.“We’re excited about adding one of the best hitters in all of major league baseball to our lineup,” Posey said. “We’re obviously taking on a lot of dollars, but there’s a belief that adding a guy like this puts us in a good position keep winning ballgames, get into the playoffs and try to win a World Series, which is our ultimate goal.”The Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6.5 games behind division-leading New York.Devers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.The Giants have lacked slugging since Barry Bonds hit 45 homers in 2004; they are the only team in the majors who have not had a batter hit 30 homers since then. Devers has hit at least 30 homers in three different seasons.“It’s tough losing [Harrison and Hicks] … but we’re getting a guy back who changes the lineup, who’s probably a top-10 hitter in baseball every year,” Giants pitcher Logan Webb said. “Any time you add a player of that caliber, I think you give yourself a chance every day. I don’t know where he’s gonna hit, but I don’t think it really matters. The guy’s a stud, plain and simple. I’m excited about it.”Devers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump – just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.But the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop – and fan favorite – Nomar Garciaparra. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.The acquisition of Devers is the latest big move by Posey, 38. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15m, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182m, seven-year deal in December.Harrison, 23, is 9-9 with a 4.48 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 39 games for the Giants over three seasons. Hicks, 28, was 5-12 with a 4.83 ERA and 139 strikeouts in 42 games over two seasons. Tibbs, 22, was the 13th overall pick in last year’s draft; he is hitting .246 with 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 57 games for Single-A Eugene of the Northwest League this season. Bello, 20, is 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in eight games for the Giants’ rookie league team in Scottsdale, Arizona.Explore more on these topicsMLBBoston Red SoxSan Francisco GiantsBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet both were still right in the thick of contention, just one stroke off the lead, before having their winning chances dashed on the 15th hole.Adam Scott said conditions were “borderline unplayable” toward the end, when asked about Sam Burns being declined a casual water ruling at 15.“We must have looked horrible, both of us playing like that,” Scott said. “But that’s what can happen in these things. If you get a little off, you’re just severely punished.“It just wasn’t easy out there. All things being equal, it’s Sunday of the US Open, one of the hardest set-ups and the conditions were the hardest of the week.“Thank God it wasn’t like this all week.

The water was so close to the surface. Like the shot I hit on 11, it’s bizarre. I just don’t know, it was like an aquaplane on the ground. It’s a tough call, but we played. Everyone had to deal with it.”Turning 45 next month, Scott had been bidding to become the oldest US Open champion since Hale Irwin in 1990, and the second-oldest winner ever.He would also have joined five-times British Open winner Peter Thomson, his idol Greg Norman, who claimed the Claret Jug twice, and David Graham as only the fourth Australian man to capture multiple major championships.The popular Queenslander had the chance to follow Graham, the 1979 PGA Championship and 1981 US Open champion, as the only Aussie to snare two majors in America. Alas, the golfing gods once again conspired against him.But in a small consolation that will have big ramifications for his legacy, Scott is guaranteed a start at next year’s Open at Shinnecock Hills courtesy of his top-12 finish in Pennsylvania.After teeing it up for 96 straight majors, the longest streak among active players, Scott is exempt for next month’s British Open as well as the 2026 Masters and PGA Championship. At least he won’t be left stranded on 99.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenGolfEuropean TourPGA TourAustralia sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is encouraging that Delap has paid little attention to claims of a curse befalling Chelsea’s No 9 shirt, which has been vacant since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left the club two years ago.Never-ending season gives Maresca chance to test Chelsea’s evolving squadRead moreThe England Under-21 international has jumped at the chance to make the shirt his own, even though Romelu Lukaku and Fernando Torres are examples of expensive No 9s who flopped at Chelsea. Delap is keen to make his mark and add more ruthlessness to an attack that has suffered from wasteful finishing in recent years.“Liam knows quite well how important the number nine is for this club,” Maresca said. “I don’t see any problem. I see Liam quite relaxed, easy, he’s doing well, since he arrived he’s working well. We know each other already from years ago, so I know what Liam can give us. He knows what we can give to him to improve and to become a better player. In terms of No 9, hopefully he can score goals for us.”Maresca coached Delap when he was part of Manchester City’s academy. That connection proved handy when it came to convincing Delap to sign a six-year deal with Chelsea and snub offers from Manchester United, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest. However Maresca has not decided if the former Ipswich forward is above Jackson in the pecking order.“The message is always the same – you arrive, you work hard, you work more than the other No 9,” the Italian said. “The conversation with Liam has been quite clear. He was keen to join us because he knows the way we play. We won for the first time for City the Under-23 competition – he scored 24, 25 goals that season.“He knows exactly what we can give him, to him and I know what Liam can give us. The conversation was quite easy. We like Liam, Liam like us. I don’t have any doubt that he can be in the future England No 9.”View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson and Liam Delap are competing for a starting spot in Chelsea’s attack at the Club World Cup.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesMaresca said that Chelsea intend to sign another winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United.

They have been busy in the transfer market but Maresca refused to reveal whether they will revive a move for the Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan.The attempt to sign Maignan has caused uncertainty over Chelsea’s goalkeeping situation. There have been indications that the club will listen to suitable offers for Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Djordje Petrovic has asked to be omitted for the squad and is likely to leave after impressing on loan at Strasbourg. However, Maresca insisted that Sanchez remains first choice.“The situation about the keepers is quite easy,” he said. “Robert is the number one. Then we have Filip, the number two. Penders joined us.

Concerns over ‘excessive’ surveillance in smart devicesRead moreIt is demanding that manufacturers and data handlers ensure data security, are transparent with consumers and ensure the regular deletion of collected information.Stephen Almond, the executive director for regulatory risk at the ICO, said: “Smart products know a lot about us: who we live with, what music we like, what medication we are taking and much more.“They are designed to make our lives easier, but that doesn’t mean they should be collecting an excessive amount of information … we shouldn’t have to choose between enjoying the benefits of smart products and our own privacy.“We all rightly have a greater expectation of privacy in our own homes, so we must be able to trust smart products are respecting our privacy, using our personal information responsibly and only in ways we would expect.”The new guidance cites a wide range of devices that are broadly known as part of the “internet of things”, which collect data that needs to be carefully handled. These include smart fertility trackers that record the dates of their users’ periods and body temperature, send it back to the manufacturer’s servers and make an inference about fertile days based on this information.Smart speakers that listen in not only to their owner but also to other members of their family and visitors to their home should be designed so users can configure product settings to minimise the personal information they collect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The larger offer prompted Wojcicki to raise her own with the backing of a Fortune 500 company, according to the former executive. The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks after a court hearing currently scheduled for 17 June, the company said on Friday.Wojcicki had made multiple bids to take the company private while still CEO. The company’s board rejected her each time, and all of its independent directors eventually resigned in response to her takeover attempts.Once a trailblazer in ancestry DNA testing, 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March, seeking to sell its business at auction after a decline in demand and a 2023 data breach that exposed sensitive genetic and personal information of millions of customers.23andMe has lost a major chunk of customers since declaring bankruptcy, with the threat of a sale of users’ most sensitive information – the company sequences a person’s entire genome – to an unknown buyer looming. The company has said that about 15% of its existing customers have requested the closure of their accounts in response to its bankruptcy and planned sale. Experts have advised customers to ask the company delete their DNA data for privacy protection. TTAM said on Friday it would uphold 23andMe’s existing privacy policies and comply with all applicable data protection laws. Earlier this week, New York and more than two dozen other US states sued 23andMe to challenge the sale of its customers’ private information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

London seems to be the online dating capital of Britain, with 24% of respondents saying they engage with dating apps on at least three days a week.This contrasts with the country in general, with the study finding that only 4% of Britons spend any time on dating apps.According to the study, the average British person claims to spend three-and-a-half hours a day online, though 20% of those asked admitted to spending above five hours of their day on the internet.Popular times to be online varied, but 64% of respondents said they spend time online between the hours of 11pm and 6am, with 19% of them saying this is the time they visit YouTube.In the north, analysis tells a tale of three cities.

Mr Trump backed down after the generalwarnedthat attacking Iran would start a war, with the risk of US officials being “tried as war criminals in The Hague”.Five years on, Israel’s prime minister has thefight with Tehranthat he has spent decades preparing for, bolstered by Mr Trump’s claims thatinternational lawno longer applies. After all, why worry about red lines when The Hague’s already got a warrant out for you and your alliespretendnot to notice? It helps when the US treats the international criminal court like a rogue actor. Mr Trump has even gone after the court’sjudgesand prosecutor for daring to scrutinise “our close ally” Israel over Gaza. Legal norms? Apparently, those are for enemies, not friends.As the UN charter is typically interpreted, the use of force is allowed against an actual or imminent attack in self-defence – but it must be necessary and proportionate. With Mr Netanyahu’s expanding aims –regime change, strikes onenergyinfrastructure and bombingresidentialareas – the action no longer even pretends to be self-defence. In response, Iran has launched10 wavesof ballistic missiles, killing Israeli civilians and targeting its oil and gas facilities.Israel justifies its actions by saying Tehran ispreparingto build a nuclear bomb. If true, Israel knows more than both theUS and the UN’s nuclear watchdog. The International Atomic Energy Agency’sfindingof a safeguards breach has political weight, but no legal bite. YetIsrael– still the region’s only nuclear power, undeclared and outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – is bombing Iran to stop it from doing what it never admitted to doing itself.Mr Netanyahu lacks thebunker-busting bombsand bombers needed to seriously damage Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites. So the strategy may be to hit hard enough to force Iran into submission – or to provoke abacklashbig enough to drag Mr Trump in. Either way, it’s a strategy that relies less on deterrence than on provocation.Israel’s impunity sets a dangerous precedent, where the strong act as they please and the weak suffer the consequences – convention and law be damned. But Mr Netanyahu may have felt his options were narrowing. Troublingly for him, Iran had signalled unprecedentedconcessionsduring talks with Mr Trump. Whether from weakness or calculation, that opening was real. The prospect of an Iran-US nuclear deal that permitted Tehranlimited uranium enrichmentunder strict monitoring may have been too much for Mr Netanyahu.Ever the opportunist, the Israeli prime minister seized the moment. Tehran’s allyHezbollahwas neutralised, Iran’s air defences crippled and Iran’s partner Bashar al-Assad had fled Syria – opening a “corridor” for airstrikes. With UScoordination secured, Israel’s military struck. The bonus for Mr Netanyahu was that he received a political domestic boost just as his coalition threatened tounravel.If the fighting escalates, things could spiral out of control, perhaps with civil war in Iran or aglobal economic shock. Better to trade words than missiles,thinks Tehran. If the US and Iran pursue realistic goals, a verifiable non-proliferationdealis within reach. As ever, jaw‑jaw is better than war-war.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was a disappointing, sad affairMoira DoneganThe uniformed soldiers marched irregularly, slightly off beat; the turnout was small and the crowd seemed defeatedMon 16 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 15.11 EDTShareIn one version of the story, you can blame the French. Evidently it was in France, watching the 2017 Bastille Day military parade alongside Emmanuel Macron at the outset of his first term, that Donald Trump initially got the idea to stage an armed spectacle in Washington DC in honor of himself. Back then, the military said no. In a now-famous anecdote, Gen Paul Selva, who grew up in Portugal under its integralist regime, told Trump that such parades are “what dictators do”. James Mattis, his then-secretary of defense, reportedly revolted against the idea, saying he would “rather swallow acid”. Trump never got his parade.Until now. Restored to power after an interregnum in which all American institutions failed to hold him accountable for his crimes and abuses, Trump has now set about a second term in which he is pursuing vengeance against his perceived enemies, using his office to enrich himself, and indulging all the impulses that were checked by his staffers and advisers back when anyone serious still worked for him.Having stuffed the military and defense department leadership exclusively with sycophants and incompetents, Trump is now surrounded exclusively by the kind of people he likes best: people who can’t see any reason not to give him whatever he wants. On Saturday, they gave him a military parade for his birthday, complete with tanks, missiles, airplanes overhead and parachutists. A band sang Happy Birthday. The spectacle was mostly paid for by taxpayers, but there were corporate sponsorships, too – among them the Thiel-backed venture Palantir, and the crypto exchange Coinbase.If Trump was expecting a display of pomp and pride that rivaled his own egotism, he may have been disappointed. The parade, as it turned out, was something of a disappointing affair. The uniformed soldiers marched irregularly, slightly off beat; the turnout was small and the crowd seemed defeated, low-energy, a bit wilted and unenthused after spending hours in DC’s brutal summer humidity. It rained. It was all a great contrast to the large-scale protests that had exploded across the country earlier that day, with millions taking to the streets in jubilant displays under the banner “No Kings”.1:50Tens of thousands rally against Trump across the US - videoIn one, big crowds expressed opposition to Trump’s vision of America, and offered instead a colorful hope for equality and the dignity of self-government. In the other, a desultory group of soldiers trooped through what looked like a mostly empty city – DC had been largely blocked off, in no small part to prevent the protesters from clashing with the military parade and possibly creating a Tiananmen Square-style visual. The soldiers popped up from their tanks and waved wearily to a smattering of onlookers. Once in a while, the bored-looking president roused himself to his feet and delivered a flaccid salute.Trump coveted a military spectacle but his parade proved underwhelming: ‘Just kind of lame’Read moreThis wasn’t what Trump was hoping for. Nominally, the event was meant to mark the US army’s 250th anniversary. But no one really believes that that was the reason for the parade. Instead, the event marked Trump’s 79th birthday, and was meant both to celebrate his seizure of power and underscore his determination to quash dissent. The armed forces were used as an ornament to his ego and a threat to his enemies.As Trump has illegally seized control of the California national guard, deployed the marines to Los Angeles, disappeared dissidents, crammed migrants into internment camps with atrocious conditions, and had his underlings rough up opposition leaders, the military parade was meant to celebrate his successful pursuit of his dictatorial ambitions, to emphasize the solidity and fearsomeness of his rule, and to remind onlookers that those who oppose him can be met with violence.All of Trump’s fearsome power and ambition, however, was complicated, in the scenes from the parade, by how obscenely on the nose it all was. Trump clearly wants to be a dictator, and major forces in American politics are helping him become one. But more than wanting to simply be a dictator, Trump also wants to play a dictator on TV.He is playing to type now, with his military parade, and the type is authoritarianTrump has always reinforced his politics with an aesthetic: his gilded Trump Tower apartment signifying his wealth, his bouffantish combover and long red ties signifying his winking vulgarity, his love of fast food signifying a declasse self-indulgence.He is playing to type now, with his military parade, and the type is authoritarian. With his display of power and authority – with the military used as a prop to demonstrate his love of violence and indifference to the constitution – Trump is imitating himself, seeming to cast one eye to the viewer for their reaction. He seems to imagine, always, what his next line would be in the sitcom – a bit like the mobsters on The Sopranos, who modeled themselves self-consciously off of characters in The Godfather and Goodfellas. He’s thinking less of what he wants to do, less of what his true interests or impulses are, and more of what someone like him, a dictator, should be doing.In this way, though it has become easy to fear and hate Trump, it has always remained a bit hard to take him seriously: he is a simulacrum of a strongman dictator, doing the things he has seen strongmen dictators do on TV. It can feel buffoonish, this self-referentiality; it implies a lack of spontaneity, a sense that perhaps, if he needs to prove his own power so badly, Trump might not actually believe in it. But perhaps this is another lesson of our age, the one in which irony and sincerity have collapsed, and in which the dictator tries, with evident effort, to hit his marks on the screen: just because he’s faking it, doesn’t mean it’s not the real thing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

Now a former spokesperson is revealing the disconnect between words and realityMon 16 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 19.39 EDTSharePoliticians lie, and the people around them do too. When it’s convenient – when the whole world is pulsing with revulsion, for example – they begin to reveal flavors of the truth.TheBiden administrationlied more than most, its public-facing members particularly. Its policy in Palestine was to embrace the Israelis in a “bear hug” – to smother them with love. And there’s thin cover for a genocide beyond lies.Now, Matthew Miller, the former state department spokesperson, is speaking out. It appears he has a new job – one that seems to require public-facing work, which may explain his decision to sit for a Sky Newsinterview. You take your lumps and get it over with. Only I’m not sure it’s over for Miller.I call on the UK to join the world majority – and recognise the state of Palestine | Husam ZomlotRead moreIn the interview, the former spokesman shared his personal view that it is “without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes”. Asked why he had not said this when he was employed by the government, he replied: “When you’re at the podium, you’re not expressing your personal opinion. You’re expressing the conclusions of the United States government.”Miller isn’t alone. The Biden-era spokespeople for the genocide included the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, and the deputy state department spokesperson Vedant Patel, as well as Jake Sullivan, a primarypolicymakerfor an addled president, who represented the actual center of power along with John Kirby, a former admiral, and Antony Blinken, the former secretary of state. The group spent the period from October 2023 to January 2025 lying to an anguished public. They lied scornfully (Jean-Pierre) or gleefully (Miller), mawkishly (Kirby and Blinken), or blandly (Patel and Sullivan). And they did it every day, for 15 months.They told extravagant lies: Hamasbeheaded40 babies. They told savageliesabout “command and control” centers under al-Shifa hospital – they told us not to believe what we’d seen and to believe what theycouldn’tshow us. They lied about Israeliinvestigationsand Biden’shumanity, his capacity for “empathy”. Every lie they told was consequential, about infants inincubators; about the execution ofHind Rajab, a child; and about thewayin which their pierwas usedto facilitate an Israeli massacre.They lied about the things that matter most. They lied to obscure a genocide, spinning whorls of confusion.In the Sky News interview, Miller twitched visibly just before he made the remarks about war crimes. Watching him, I wondered what had happened to his confidence, the brazen and unembarrassed way in which he skipped, lightly, through so much human carnage, whistling past Gaza’s profusion of mass graves.And yet, despite himself, the former spokesperson continues to lie. He claims to not know if what the Biden administration has orchestrated in Gaza is a genocide, perhaps to shield himself from the worst of the moral reckoning. The tactic he’s taken is a tired one, and the interview is self-indulgent.But at least Miller is braver than the others. In avideorecorded at Harvard’s Kennedy School, which is where both Brett McGurk, who also helpedorchestratethe genocide, and Jake Sullivan have taken jobs, Sullivan meekly, dishonestly describes “the choices the president made”.The choices the president made.It all brings to mind the former secretary of defense Robert McNamara’s book, In Retrospect, a self-exculpatory account of his participation in the Vietnam war. Two million civilians were killed in that conflict, which achieved nothing, and was fought for nothing. And yet, McNamara waited 20 years to publish that account, long after many of his victims had died.So with that retrospective, we may encourage Sullivan, Miller, McGurk, Jean-Pierre, Blinken, Patel and all the others to come forward. If they do, they will be pilloried and mocked and verbally abused for what they’ve done.But they should do it anyway, because they owe their victims so much. Not least the truth.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceThis article was amended on 16 June 2025. An earlier version included a quote from Matthew Miller on the role of political spokespeople that had been given in a more general context, rather than directly in response to being asked about alleged war crimes. In the latter response, now quoted from the same interview, he went on to say that “the United States government had not concluded that [Israel] committed war crimes [and] still have not concluded [that].”Explore more on these topicsBiden administrationOpinionIsrael-Gaza warGazaJoe BidenUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

Why not just quit?Mon 16 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 15.57 EDTShareLike soldiers in a well-disciplined army, Republican members of US Congress do whatever CommanderDonald Trumpdemands. While the foot soldiers may occasionally grumble, they quickly fall in line when Trump intervenes.Republican representatives go through contortions to satisfy the bully in the White House: we hated deficits, goes the party orthodoxy, but now we vote for adding trillions to the deficit; we supported Ukraine, but now we cozy up to the Russians; we scrutinized cabinet nominees, but now we give our “advice and consent” to a cabinet of knaves and charlatans.In being supremely supine, these legislators are behaving as if they were members of parliament, taking their cues from the prime minister. Yet as every schoolchild knows, “balance of powers” was the framers’ watchword, with the three branches of government each held in check by the others.I was a Republican – the party I believed in no longer exists |  Paolina MilanaRead moreApologies for this civics lesson, but it’s a reminder that this is not the world we now live in. The constitution is merely an inconvenience for Trump, who says that he “doesn’t know” whether he must abide by its provisions.“I run the country and the world,” the president said, in anAtlantic interview. He regards Congress’s role as merely rubber-stamping his decisions – its members have no business thinking for themselves. Case in point: Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”The final version of that 1,037-page measure was pushed through the House of Representatives inless than a day. Legislators had precious little time to understand, let alone debate, its provisions because Trump and his sock-puppet, Mike Johnson, the House speaker, don’t give a fig about their opinions. To adapt a line from the comedian Rodney Dangerfield: “They don’t get no respect.”Under these circumstances, even the brightest bulb would have missed a provision here or there. It’s no wonder that someRepublicanswere embarrassed by their ignorance of the specifics of the legislation.Consider thecase of Mike Flood, a Republican backbencher from Nebraska. “I am not going to hide the truth – this provision was unknown to me when I voted for that,” Flood said during a town meeting, responding to questions about a provision that makes it easier for the federal government to defy court orders. He would not have voted for the bill, Flood said, if he had realized what was in it.Marjorie Taylor Greene, the walking conspiracist from Georgia, was also flummoxed. “Full transparency, I did not know about this section, blocking states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there.”Why do the Republican members of Congress stand for such treatment? Why don’t they speak up or quit?Imagine how Republican lawmakers would respond under the influence of truth serum. “Should Congress have a say in setting tariffs?” they might be asked. “Is it OK to lift immigrants off the streets and ship them to a hellhole in El Salvador?” “Should Elon Musk & Co have been allowed to rampage through the federal government?” “How about Trump intimidating federal judges who dare to challenge his actions?”Some true believers in the Republican party would doubtlessly follow their Pied Piper, even if it meant leaping over a cliff, but many lawmakers would be aghast. How do they reconcile their beliefs and their behavior?Ethicists argue that government officials have a duty to speak out against moral rot, even if there’s a price to pay. Consider the fate of the former congressman Adam Kinzinger, who voted to impeach Trump and, facing likely defeat, opted not to run again, or Liz Cheney, who lost her House seat because she spoke truth to power. Those principled decisions are as rare as hens’ teeth.My colleagues are too scared to express their opinions, said the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, who is often the lone Republican voice of dissent in the upper chamber. “You’ve got everyone zip-lipped. Not saying a word, because they’re afraid they’re going to be taken down, they’re going to be primaried, they’re going to be given names in the media. You know what, we cannot be cowed into not speaking up.”Resigning on the grounds of principle is almost unheard of, and it’s easy enough to understand why. If you’re a Republican legislator, you have a nice life, with a decent salary, a generous healthcare plan and a solid pension. Constituents fawn over you. Little League all-stars and scout troops pay you a visit, hanging on to your every word. You get VIP treatment at Butterworth’s, the “in” restaurant for the Trump crowd.Maybe you justify your decision to stay on the job by imagining that you’re doing something of value. Perhaps you contend that there’s no point in your resigning because whoever replaced you would behave in the same way. But those rationales cannot stand the light of day.The lawmakers who privately blanch at Trump’s authoritarian impulses presumably entered politics with the idea of doing good. They might ask themselves whether – by following the herd and being dissed by the White House – they are still doing good. If their honest answer is “no,” the only justification for their remaining in office are the creature comforts and the intangible perk of obeisance. Should that suffice?Such arguments would have carried weight during the Watergate era, when ethics in public life were taken seriously. In the present political climate, on the other hand, even to remind lawmakers that speaking out or resigning may be the morally right course of action risks being dismissed as terminally naive. But history will surely be unkind to the politicians who put ambition over principle and paved the way to autocracy. How will they justify their actions – or inaction – in this crucible year?David Kirp is professor emeritus at the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, BerkeleyExplore more on these topicsRepublicansOpinionDonald TrumpUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In that moment, the background band atDonald Trump’smilitary paradesegued from Jump by Van Halen to Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival, just after the announcer explained that M777 howitzers are made out of titanium.Nobody, apparently, had considered the lyrics: “Some folks are born, made to wave the flag, they’re red, white and blue, and when the band plays Hail to the Chief, they point the cannon at you.” If this was some kind of surreptitious protest by the musicians, I salute them, but given the time and the place, sheer obliviousness is a better explanation. The crowd, pretty thin, did their best imitation of a cheer.The US clearly does not know how to do an authoritarian military parade. To be fair, they are just getting started. Authoritarian military parades are supposed to project invincible strength. They are supposed to make your own people impressed with the inhuman discipline of your troops, and to strike fear into your enemies at the capacity of your organization. In Trump’s parade, the soldiers resembled children forced to participate in a half-assed school play, trying to figure out how to avoid embarrassment as far as possible, and the military itself looked better suited to running a Kid Rock tour than a country’s defence.Right back at ya! Trump’s crude but effective rhetorical standby | Chris TaylorRead moreBut do not confuse Trump’s debased parade with a joke or an innocent piece of entertainment. The Trump parade took place in the immediate aftermath of the assassination ofMelissa Hortman, a Minnesota state representative. While it was under way, security forces werefiring teargason protesters in Los Angeles.Violence is coming to define American political life – spectacular violence including the parade and real violence like the assassination of Hortman. Political destabilization is arriving far too quickly to be perceived in its entirety. So much is happening so fast that it’s impossible to keep track of the decline. Increasingly, the question is becoming: when are we going to start calling this what it is?When I published my book The Next Civil War in 2022, the US was very far from the threshold of what the experts at the Peace Research Institute Oslo defined as civil war, which is 1,000 combatant deaths a year. They defined civil conflict as 25 deaths a year, so the US already fits comfortably in that category. But the definitions of war and conflict never applied perfectly to the American reality, because it is so much bigger and so much more geographically diverse than other countries. As we start to see violence overtaking American political life, the transition is more like a sunset than a light switch. Every day violence becomes more and more settled as the means ofUS politics.The parade, and the“No Kings”counter-protests, were both distractions from the fact that American political life is moving away from discourse altogether. Don’t like what the senators of the other party are saying?Handcuff them. Don’t like protesters?Send in the marines. Don’t like the makeup of the House of Representatives in Minnesota?Kill the top Democrat. The political purpose of the parade, from Trump’s point of view, was to demonstrate his mastery of the means of violence. He needed to show, to the military and to the American people, that he can make the army do what he tells it, and established traditions and the rule of law will not alter his will.But the primary effect of the parade was to demonstrate an immense weakness, in Trump and in the American people. It was a parade reminiscent of the most vacuous regimes in history. In 1977, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, the leader of the Central African Republic, declared himself emperor and indulged in a coronation that imitated the coronation of Napoleon I in immaculate detail. He even went so far as to use eight white Norman horses to pull the carriage, but the French horses were not used to the climate and several died. Trump’s parade felt like a lazier version of that.Americans disagree on much – but this week, we have been coming together | Robert ReichRead moreThe spectre of defeat hovered over the entire celebration of supposed strength. The last time theUS militarythrew a parade was 1991, which was the last time they triumphed over an opponent, the last time their war machine produced the results they had been attempting. The US has not won a war since then. But hey, if you can’t win a war, at least you can throw a parade.Except they couldn’t even throw a parade! The end of the show was almost too perfect. A frail Lee Greenwood, a country singer long past his “best before” date, sang God Bless America raggedly, lousily. “Our flag still stands for freedom,” he sang. “They can’t take that away.” Oh can’t they? Trump at the center fidgeted like a rich kid bored with his servants and toys. The whole business was like watching some sordid fairytale: the unloved boy who everybody hated grew up to force the American people to throw him a birthday party and give him a flag. Andthen almost nobody came.What’s true of men is also true of countries: the more they need to show off how strong they are, the weaker they are. The weakness, rather than the strength, is terrifying. Whoever is so scared and so needy as to need that parade is capable of anything. That goes for Trump, and that goes for his country.Stephen Marche is the author of The Next Civil WarExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpProtestUS militaryMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

But these twin shocks have unintentionally accomplished something the EU institutions never could. They have made European integration feel not just important, but existential – a matter of democratic survival – for ordinary citizens.From Helsinki to Lisbon, people are suddenly experiencing the same existential unease. Trade wars, defence threats and military aggression don’t respect borders. More and more Europeans now recognise that their small, individual nations cannot withstand simultaneous pressure from both Washington and Moscow. They find themselves caught between economic coercion and military intimidation.Recent Eurobarometer data confirm the shift:74% of Europeansnow view EU membership as a positive thing – the highest level of support ever recorded.This is a historic opportunity. And yet, EU and national leaders remain paralysed – unable, or unwilling, to convert this public support and shared urgency into political momentum for reducing Europe’s dependence on US military guarantees and economic shelter.This is the real tragedy: Europe’s governments no longer practise the very ideals they preach. Though the EU still speaks the language of multilateralism and climate leadership, its policy direction and that of most of its member states increasingly mirror Trump’s.On migration, the EU’s new pact on migration and asylumreframes asylum as a security risk, echoing Trump’s immigration crackdown. On climate, Ursula von der Leyen’s European Commission has quietlydismantled key green dealinitiatives and delayed critical legislation, in a deregulatory shift reminiscent of Trump’sEPA rollbacks. Civil society is also under mounting pressure. Just as Trump has targeted non-profits and dissenters, the conservative European People’s party (EPP) – von der Leyen’s political “family” – has launched anunprecedented assaulton NGOs, threatening their funding and legitimacy. Even fundamental rights are at risk. TheEU’s responseto Hungary’s ban on Pride marches and expansion of surveillance powers has been tepid at best – tacitly tolerating democratic backsliding within its own ranks.But perhaps the most dangerous convergence lies in how power is exercised. Trump governs by executive fiat,sidelining Congress with executive orders. Today’s commission is drifting in a similar direction at the demand of a majority of its member states. It centralises power, pushing throughcomplex “omnibus” packagesand bypassing the European parliament most recently in itsproposal to rearm the EU.What we are witnessing is not just a rupture in the transatlantic alliance but something more insidious.There are signs of an ideological convergence between Trump’s America and today’s European political centre, where parties are increasingly stealing ideas from the far-right –as in Germany– or governing with those parties, directly or indirectly. That is not only the reality in many EU countries but in theEU system itselfunder von der Leyen.Despite pledges in her first term to stick to the centre of politics, the commission increasingly relies on the votes of a rightwing majority in the European parliament, formed by conservative and far-right groupings of all stripes. These include the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), which used to be considered mainstream conservative but which now brings together Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party with more extreme far-right parties such asFrance’s Reconquêteand the Sweden Democrats. There is also the Patriots for Europe (PfE) group,co-led by Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán, and the even more extreme Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN),dominated by Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland.The EPP has traditionally allied with socialist and liberal MEPs who as a bloc helped elect von der Leyen last year. But the EPP has recently voted with parties to the right of it, notably todelay a new deforestation law. The same happened onbudgetary matters, therecognition of Edmundo Gonzálezas Venezuela’s president, and more recently in blockingan EU ethics body.There is also a growing presidentialisation of the commission. During the Covid pandemic, von der Leyen personally negotiated vaccine dealsby text message– shielding those discussions frompublic and parliamentary scrutiny.The risk is that tolerance of such a shift towards personalised, opaque governance makes it easier to pass to the “Trumpification” stage – where politicians increasingly borrow from the authoritarian playbook, preferring executive fiat over parliamentary democracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just when European citizens are most willing to support joint action – on Ukraine, Gaza, big tech, or defence – their leaders are failing to respond. What’s missing is the political courageto articulate a compelling alternative to far-right messaging – one that makes an affirmative case for EU-wide action on the issues that matter most to Europeans: common security, managed migration and shared prosperity. This means presenting European integration not as a threat to national identity, but as the means to protect and strengthen it.When European nations pool their defence capabilities, they don’t surrender sovereignty – they multiply their capacity to defend their communities. When they coordinate migration policies, they don’t open floodgates – they create orderly, humane systems that serve both newcomers and existing communities. When they harmonise economic policies, they don’t level down – they lift up regions and workers who have been left behind. This vision appeals to the same desire for security and belonging that populists exploit, but offers real solutions instead of scapegoats.View image in fullscreenA poster of the Alternative for Germany’s (AfD) co-leader, Alice Weidel, is seen behind a ‘Make Duisburg great again’ cap.Photograph: Louis van Boxel-Woolf/AFP/Getty ImagesThis failure to articulate such a vision has real costs. Every month of delay in building European defence capabilities is another month of dependence on an unreliable US. Every compromise with authoritarians – whether in Budapest or Jerusalem – erodes the democratic credibility that makes European leadership possible.Trump and Putin have inadvertently given Europe a shared sense of purpose and a need for urgent action. The question is not whether Europeans are ready to respond – the polls show they are. The question is whether Europe’s leaders will sleepwalk into irrelevance, or worse.Alberto Alemanno is the Jean Monnet professor of EU law at HEC Paris and the founder of The Good LobbyExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUrsula von der LeyenThe far rightMarine Le PencommentShareReuse this content"

Just don’t call it menswearMon 16 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 14.55 EDTShareIt’s a month until my wedding, and my suit has arrived in the post, unceremoniously crammed into a plastic postage bag. I wasn’t expecting it to come from China, but China is of course where things come from. Unbagging the crinkled jacket and trousers for my supposed Big Day felt a little deflating.Although I’m not sure what Ididhave in mind. I’ve never fantasised about getting married. As a gay woman, this wasn’t even an option for me until 2013. In fact, the closest I ever came to daydreaming about this occasion was when I was around four and I’d inferred from Disney movies that “getting married” was the act of a prince ballroom dancing with a princess. The dancing was neither here nor there, but I knew I wanted to be the prince.There wasn’t a single a-ha moment when I twigged that feminine clothes made me feel like the world’s most reluctant drag queen (a drag peasant?), but gradually I embraced being butch. Andcasualbutch I can do – wearingCarhartt, Finisterre, even M&S menswear for that middle-aged dad look.Then it comes to formalwear. Not that “formal” was what I had in mind aesthetically for the wedding (so far it’s looking more like a very slightly upmarket children’s birthday party). But turning up on the day dressed like a contractor feels like a tantrum, and there’s no small part of me that wants to look nice, whatever that means. I settled on the idea of a suit: something classic and well tailored.In women’s sections of high-street shops, lurid blazers with flouncy embellishments seem to whisper to each other about me, like a pack of vicious teen girls who only found out what a lesbian is by watching a controversial episode of their favourite soap. After several trips like this, I hadn’t tried anything on, and bespoke women’s suits from some of the beautiful female tailors of Savile Row are financially out of the question.It’s surprising to me how stressed I’ve become about looking good on my wedding day. But weddings get to you. No matter how much of a non-wedding wedding you think you’re having, it’s still … a wedding. While doing my utmost to queer the term “bridezilla”, I’m just a woman looking for a suit that doesn’t make me look like a member of the shadow cabinet.When the desperation hit after another three hours’ Googling variations on “women’s suit wedding androgynous”, I finally submitted to the eerie siren song of a site claiming to make affordable bespoke suits. With its slick UX and promise to solve an issue that had now been consuming me for months, I was sold. I designed my perfect suit – dark navy, streamlined and flattering without any frills – added it to my cart and entered my card details in a trance.A month later my AI-generated, SEO-advertised, Shein-era bag of “what did youthinkyou were getting?” flew in from Shanghai. I’d thought I was ordering it from a Europe-based company, but the item had been “dropshipped”, sent directly from the manufacturer rather than the e-commerce retailer I bought it from. The jacket was at least five inches longer than what I thought I’d ordered, and putting it on felt a little bit like trying on one of my dad’s blazers as a kid.The suit looked better after having been left to hang for 24 hours, but marriage material it is not. After a brief identity crisis in which I wondered whether my gender expression might be “scam victim”, I managed to override a lifetime’s worth of social conditioning and enter a full-on menswear store. I’d been drawn to the brand, Percival, since it released a Seinfeld-inspired collection. Even if I’m waymore of a Georgethan a Kramer. The moment I walked through the door, I also managed to find a near-perfect outfit. Which turned out to be a green linen suit – exactly the same one that was worn bySadiq Khanlast year. My partner tried to console me on this matter by reminding me that “wedidvote for him”.Yes, I’ll be taking my Sadiq suit to a tailor to shorten the arms and bring in the shoulders. No drastic alterations, though. Even if you have boobs, I’ve learned, the term “menswear” should be consigned to the past, along with bathroom carpeting and lobotomies. While we’re at it, bring on the grooms in white dresses.Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and DivaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The priority should be the best palliative careMon 16 Jun 2025 12.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 12.45 EDTShareAs MPs prepare for the final decisive votes this Friday on one of the most consequential laws of our generation, an act that could determine a person’s right to live or die, they should take time to consider the fundamental flaws in the bill that have been exposed during the debates of recent months.For it has become clear that whatever views people hold on the principle, passing theterminally ill adults (end of life) billinto law would privilege the legal right to assisted dying without guaranteeing anything approaching an equivalent right to high-quality palliative care for those close to death.I understand the often-cited case for assisted dying – that we should not deny terminally ill people the freedom to choose. But there is no effective freedom to choose if the alternative option, the freedom to draw on high-quality end-of-life care, is not available. Neither is there real freedom to choose if, as many fear, patients will feel under pressure to relieve their relatives of the burden of caring for them, a form of coercion that prioritising good end-of-life care would diminish.Every year, more than600,000 peopledie in the UK. It is estimated that between 75% and 90% of them should have thebenefit of palliative care, and that100,000 terminally ill peopledo not receive the palliative care that they need. The charity Cecily Saunders International estimates that demand for this type of care isexpected to rise by 42%by 2040.Access to such care is perhaps the country’s worst and least defensible “postcode lottery”, a person’s fate depending on whether there is hospice help nearby and whether places or home care are available.Delaying legislating until the recommendations of the recentcommission on end-of-life care– drawn up by MPs, doctors and charities, who propose guaranteeing new rights to and resources for those seeking palliative support – are incorporated into our NHS would begin to end the imbalance between the right to assistance in dying over the right of the dying to assistance in living. For at one and the same time, the bill removes the need forfinal judicial approvalfor legalised dying, while it contains no equivalent measures to make it easier for hard-pressed hospices to obtain the resources that would guarantee high-quality care. In fact, inpolling carried outin November last year by Focaldata for the campaign group Care not Killing, a big majority – 66% – of respondents agreed that “the government shouldsort out palliative and social care first before considering legalising assisted suicide”.Better end-of-life care is surely the priority. Last year Hospice UK, which represents more than 200 hospices, said thatone in fivewere warning of cuts to services, and this year the position seems worse. Just last month, for example, theKirkwood hospice in Huddersfieldannounced it has been forced to cut its beds from 16 to 12, as well as reducing home support, with the result it will serve 800 fewer patients each year. This is now a pattern – fromSt Giles in Lichfield,St Catherine’s in Crawley, toBirmingham HospiceandHospiscare in Exeter. Late last year, Hospice UK estimated that300 beds in England are out of usebecause of insufficient funding. And with integrated care boards required to manage their expenditure within funding constraints set nationally, only about60% of NHShospitals provide seven-day on-site specialist palliative care, and only athird of localitieshave out-of-hours access.We don’t yet know whether, and for whom, the government will be prepared to cover 100% of the costs of assisted dying. What we do know, however, is that, on average, a hospice patient ispublicly funded for barely a thirdof his or her costs. And so MPs are being asked to pass a bill in the full knowledge that, whenever it is implemented, the services available to all those who would prefer assisted living to assisted dying are inadequate. “The lack of a cohesive national strategy for effective palliative care delivery has resulted in fragmentation of specialist palliative care services,” said therecently publishedcommission on end-of-life care, “with inequity of provision, confusion over who takes responsibility for each patient, and lack of advice and support to the public and to staff in all services.”If the bill were to go through, anyone who was terminally ill might be faced with a dilemma: they could exercise the right to apply to die under the legislation by referring to two doctors and an expert panel, but they might continue to find it difficult to exercise their right to access quality end-of-life care. While I could apply directly to the proposed new panel to enforce my right to die, the process if denied quality palliative care is difficult and complex. I would first have to file a complaint with the healthcare provider – for example to the patient advice and liaison service for hospitals, or a localised complaint process for primary care. Once this process was exhausted, I would then have to ask my MP to make an application to theparliamentary and health service ombudsman(PHSO), whose website says that the current waiting time is seven months – and that would be before a caseworker was assigned, which also takes months, delaying still further the time before what should be an urgent judgment could be made.I understand the pressure on MPs from those who are in desperate pain, and who want relief that is not currently available to them. But as the palliative and end-of-life care commission’srecently publishedreport tells us, pain relief is becoming possible for almost every terminal illness and the government should make it a medical imperative to ensure this will continue to improve.I also understand that MPs will be advised by many that the sum of their responsibilities is the avoidance of unnecessary harm. But irrespective of whether you see life as a gift, and notwithstanding any religious convictions or the lack of them, an MP’s personal preferences cannot be separated off from the duties they have as members of a community to ensure that the way we treat the dying reflects the values of a decent, compassionate country. That should mean upholding the role of the medical professions as care-givers, and exclusively care-givers; avoiding the possibility of private profiteering by legal-medical consortiums which might well commercialise assisted dying as a lucrative business; safeguarding vulnerable people about whose fate the royal medical colleges have all expressed concern; preventing unacceptable coercive pressures that can be brought to bear on disabled people, and those who are incapacitated or mentally stressed; and thus showing that as a society we value life above death.These concerns can be best addressed by speedily implementing the report of the end-of-life care commission. For none of our obligations to each other are well served if our laws focus on the few who wish for assisted dying and do too little to support the majority of those facing their final days who want – and deserve – access to the best of palliative care.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was outragedMon 16 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 19.44 EDTShareI’ve been eating Subway sandwiches for a quarter of a century. Mainly out of habit.2001 Subway was something else: booth seating, ceiling fans with gold trim, leafy green house plants, faux brick and black-and-white New York cityscape wallpaper with a repeating Empire State Building frieze. Ahh.My go-to back then was a foot-long turkey sub on “hearty Italian” bread, cheddar cheese (there was only cheddar), lettuce, tomato and cranberry sauce with a dusting of salt and pepper. To complete the meal, a choc-chip cookie and a small soft drink from the self-serve post-mix machine with two little stamps for my Sub Club card. Collect eight, you got a free sub.If you’ve eaten at Subway lately you might be thinking I’m getting confused with some other sandwich place. Sadly no. 2025 Subway is a joyless abomination of its former glory.Less soggy, more glamwich: Australia’s salad sandwich glow upRead moreLet’s start with the interior. Today’s Subways have embraced the modern bland: grey, white and beige with a feature wall in vomit green. The booths that haven’t been heritage-listed are long gone, replaced with coloured seating cubes with no backs – I assume designed to make you leave.But what about the menu? Well, the subs are now almost as expensive as the nuclear ones.Hearty Italian bread went about 2002, the same year Subway stopped stocking cranberry sauce. I was outraged. My complaints to head office were numerous and ineffective.A couple of times I brought my own jar to the Subway enclave at my local BP service station. Management didn’t mind but they weren’t so keen on the knife. About 2018 Subway did briefly reintroduce cranberry “relish”. It wasn’t the same. Much drier.Back in the day the cranberry sauce would be in a big plastic squeeze bottle with the other sauces. You hoped you were served by a competent sandwich artist who knew to bang the bottle against the garbage slot in the counter first to get the water out. If they didn’t you got a soaking wet sandwich.My dad’s dad used to run pubs back in the 60s. “Ice is the cheapest thing you can put in a glass,” he’d say.So I find it bizarre that Subway made the choice about 2020 to replace the post-mix machines with fridges supplying soft drink in plastic bottles. At least Hungry Jack’s just moved drink machines behind the counter. But if you want ice at Subway, forget it.Remember the joy of licking a stamp and sticking it to your cardboard Sub Club card? Or better yet, finding a discarded stamp in the street and getting that free sub sooner than expected!Today Subway offers a plastic “Subcard” with a QR code. The person serving you never asks if you’ve got one and rarely seems to know when you should scan it. The credit points expire, too.But it’s not all bad. Subway introduced toasting ovens in 2005 so you have the choice of a “toasted” or “fresh” sub, which does somewhat imply toasted is the opposite of fresh.A tip for employees: if someone orders a classic chicken toasted, you still have to put the fillet in the microwave. Just toasting the bread with the chicken on top leaves the meaty interior the same temperature as the fridge.Modern Subway does offer more cheeses: cheddar, Swiss or “old English” (the orange one).And just this year Anzac biscuits made a welcome return. Subway had abandoned them in 2008 after the Department of Veterans’ Affairs noticed it was calling them Anzac “cookies” and not using the “official” ingredients. This is why Australia has a Department of Veterans’ Affairs.As far as fast-food napkins go, Subway has always had the best. If you reach into any of my jacket pockets you’ll always find at least one Subway napkin from a lunchtime past. But Subway has stopped printing its logo on them so now the napkins are just plain white.What other fun features will Subway gradually strip away from its dining experience over the next 25 years? I’ll let you know.David M Green is a comedian who reviews videotapes on the web seriesVHS Revue. He also wrote for Mad as Hell on ABC TV.

Every few months nowadays, another woman appears in a British newspaper charged with a suspected illegal abortion. Often the woman looks pale and gaunt. Sometimes she hides behind sunglasses as she bows her head. The photographs of these women walking into court feel akin to a public shaming, where the stocks are replaced by a breaking news banner, but the judgment remains the same.If this sounds like a punishment from a different time, it’s because it is. The law that’s largely used to prosecute women for a suspected illegal abortion was written in 1861 – that’s before women had the right to vote or own property independently. While the Abortion Act in 1967 gave widespread access to abortion, it was never made fully legal on the statute books.Now that may change. After more than a century and a half, this week could see abortion decriminalised in England and Wales – and for the first time, give tens of millions of women a genuine right to choose. When the crime and policing bill returns to the Commons, a Labour backbencher, Tonia Antoniazzi, willtable an amendmentto remove women from the criminal law. It would finally get rid of the anachronistic stain on otherwise modern abortion rights: women will no longer face prosecution if they end a pregnancy after 24 weeks or without approval from two doctors.There is some uncertainty. For one, a second amendment is beingput forwardby Stella Creasy that aims to enshrine access to abortion as a human right, and pro-choice charities fear would disrupt services. Although it has less support, it could also be selected for a vote. But parliamentary debate aside, reform is highly likely to be on the way. Antoniazzi’s amendment has already received the backing of more than 130 MPs,according to the Times, and senior government figures expect it to pass with a large majority.The urge for decriminalisation has increased as the risk of arrest has. It is estimated that more than 100 women have beenprosecuted for a suspected abortionover the last decade. And the number of court cases and convictions has actually increased in the 21st century. Between 1861 and 2022, only three women in Great Britain were convicted of an illegal abortion. Since December 2022 alone,seven women have been charged. One woman has been jailed.There is no clear reason as to why. When I asked the British Pregnancy Advisory Service – the leading abortion provider – about the spike in prosecutions, it pointed to an “inherent suspicion of women in certain circumstances”, combined with an increased awareness of abortion medicine by medical professionals, who then breach their duty of confidentiality, and police. Earlier this year, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), which sets the strategic direction for policing across the UK,quietly issued guidanceon how to search women’s homes for abortion drugs as well as seize their phones to inspect menstrual cycle tracker apps.The cases that have already made it to court – and the papers – have been deeply disturbing. Last month, Nicola Packerwas acquittedof unlawfully taking abortion pills at home after the legal time limit during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020. Arrested in hospital by uniformed officers while still recovering from surgery for a stillbirth, it took Packer more than four years to clear her name. During her trial, prosecutors picked over her “alternative” sex life and the size of her nipples.And yet this is also about the women whose names don’t make the headlines. Campaigners say women are routinely put under a police investigation that comes to nothing – the majority of them have in fact naturally given birth prematurely or had stillbirths. There have been cases of womendenied contactwith their children while police investigated a charge that was later dropped. One teenager who had a late miscarriagewas arrestedin front of her entire street.The small number of women and girls who have had an abortion past the legal cut-off point are often deeply vulnerable, and include victims of trafficking or domestic violence. As BPAS told me: “We’re aware of cases where the woman has been investigated, or even imprisoned, and nothing has happened to her abusive partner.”Why abortion rights in the UK are getting more and more perilousRead moreWhere is the public interest in any of this? Pregnancy loss – particularly late term – is still equated with guilt and failure. To lose a pregnancy and then be called in by the police and questioned under caution, let alone taken to court, is less criminal justice and more a kind of state-sponsored humiliation. It does not feel like a coincidence that the rise in prosecutions has come as abortion rights in the UK – from decriminalisation in Northern Ireland to the permanent adoption of telemedicine after lockdown – have made gains. Progress always comes with pushback.The rapid rise of Reform UK shows how, even in the mostliberal of societies, the threat to women and minority rights is never truly over. Nigel Farage has already floatedtougher restrictionson abortion as well as tax breaks for married couples. We need only look to the global shift to authoritarianism to see the extreme end-point of this. When police searched the car of the man suspected of killing a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota, US, on Saturday, they allegedly founda list of people with links to abortion rights.Decriminalising abortion will, in the short term, save a handful of women from the trauma of a courtroom, and a hundred or so more from a police cell. That matters. But it will also do something else of value: it will say no woman should be forced to continue a pregnancy against her will, and that abortion is healthcare, not a criminal offence. As we finally edge close to change, it is surely time to shift the stigma – it is not women who should feel shame but the MPs and prosecutors who let this barbarism go on.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Today we’re humiliated or hurt by those tasked with helping usMon 16 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 15.04 EDTShareTwelve-year-old Ahmad Zeidan’smother was shot and killedin front of him as she tried to secure food for her starving family at one of Gaza’s new US-backed distribution points. He lay beside her body for hours, afraid to stand up and run because any movement might cause his death.His mother’s death was one of many over the past few days at the hands of Israeli forces on the way to or at facilities operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). On Sunday 1 June,more than 30were killed. On Monday 2 June,three were killed. On Tuesday 3 June,27 were killed. Sunday 8 June,four killed. Tuesday 10 June,17 killed. On Wednesday 11 June,60 peoplewere reported killed.InGaza, hunger has been used as a weapon of war since the beginning of the genocide to weaken and control us. When the US humanitarian aid started to prepare distribution points to provide food supplies to people in Gaza, they offered a glimmer of hope that this hunger would finally be relieved. Now there is no hope. These aid points have become death traps. I’m darkly reminded of the Red Light, Green Light episode of Squid Game, except no one in Gaza wins.At Netzarim distribution point, people weak with hunger walked up to 15km over hot sand but, on arrival, were stopped at barriers and forced to pass through them one by one. Then they were led into an area surrounded by fences, where boxes of basic supplies were scattered on the ground, triggering frantic scrambles. People fought desperately to reach them.1:20Ahmad describes the moment his mother was shot at the aid centre – videoSome took only items they deemed valuable such as flour, which has become unaffordable, and left the rest behind. There were no clear systems to prioritise vulnerable individuals such as widows, the injured or elderly people. The scene resembled throwing meat into a cage of starving lions and watching them fight for survival. Of course, only the strongest win.After only 10 or 15 minutes, tanks began approaching the fences and opened fire on the crowd shooting at everyone, young and old alike. People began running, desperate to escape. Some carried the little they managed to grab, others fled with empty hands. They saw people falling around them, but couldn’t stop to help. Stopping meant dying.Some made it out alive from their visits to aid points. I heard my neighbour returning from a trip that lasted more than four hours. He was calling to his children: “Baba, Baba, I brought you bread! Baba, I brought you sugar!” I looked through the window and saw his children screaming with joy and hugging him. He was dripping with sweat, wearing only a vest. His shirt was tied to his back, filled with the small amount of aid he’d managed to gather.Compare the courage of Greta Thunberg’s Gaza aid mission with the inaction and complicity of western governments | Owen JonesRead morePeople are desperate. People are hungry. We are not bad people. We are not violent or wild. We are people who value our dignity more than anything. But the hunger we are facing is indescribable. Food is a right, not a privilege to be fought for. Yet we are living through famine. There is simply nothing to eat. When we go to the markets, there is nothing available. The roads are full of armed men who target the weak to take any aid they do manage to access. Then the merchants take it and sell it at hugely inflated prices.By contrast,Unrwa’s aid systemoffered a different model, one that was structured, humane and community-based. My father, who is a teacher in Unrwa schools, used to work with them in distributing food stamps and supplies to the people. Aid was handed out by familiar, trusted community members – teachers, neighbours – under the protection of local security. Most importantly, people were treated with dignity.The system was divided into monthly rounds, starting with large families and then moving down to smaller ones, each family having a registration number. Every family in Gaza used to receive their fair share through this system – flour, gas, sugar, oil and other essentials – all distributed through coupons in an orderly and dignified way.Even though there weren’t many types of food available, at least we did not starve. We had enough to eat, to fill our stomachs. Today, we are starving. This is so-called humanitarian aid. But it is anything but humanitarian. It is humiliation, nothing more.Esraa Abo Qamar is a writer based in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles,affirmed that statementto the ABC on Monday. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley,made the same callover the weekend. While Marles and Wong rightly urged de-escalation, and Ley urged caution, they also failed to condemn Israel’s attack on Iran, along with a few other outliers like France and Germany.Israel claims that its attack is necessary to preventIranacquiring nuclear weapons and using them in the future. The problem is that under international law, a country may only defend itself from an actual or imminent armed attack by another country.Israel’s ambassador to Australia disparages calls for diplomacy after Wong urges dialogueRead moreIran is obviously not attacking Israel with nuclear weapons. It is also not about to attack Israel, given that it has not built a single nuclear weapon, let alone indicated a specific threat to use one. Inflammatory and even genocidal rhetoric by Iranian officials over the years does not equate to a concrete plan to launch an imminent nuclear attack, particularly when Iran knows Israel has many more nuclear weapons and is backed by the US arsenal. Hossein Salami, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard chief killed by Israel in the latest attack, had vowed in 2019 to “wipe the Zionist regime” off the political map.There is no wider legal right of “anticipatory” self-defence against a speculative, more distant future threat, to prevent another country acquiring weapons, or to disarm a country. Israel’s lawless attack hands Iran the legal right of self-defence.When Israel attacked an Iraqi civilian nuclear reactor being built in 1981, the UN security council condemned it. When Israel bombed a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, it received little support. The US-led coalition’s attack on Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 2003, to dismantle weapons of mass destruction, was denounced by the vast majority of countries. The then UK attorney general warned it could constitute the international crime of aggression by political leaders. Recall too that Russia claimed to invade Ukraine in part because it speculatively feared Nato expansion.Where there is no actual or imminent attack, there remains time to pursue non-violent means to address the threat, including action by the security council and International Atomic Energy Agency, sanctions, and diplomacy. The US was still negotiating with Iran as Israeli bombs began shredding peaceful dialogue, while the security council and IAEA were still actively monitoring Iran’s nuclear activities.The current international rules on the use of force were written into the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 by the countries that survived the worst war in history, which killed perhaps 80 million people. Countries deliberately chose to abandon an international order built on brute military force, by limiting self-defence to only the most essential cases when a country is under attack.The risk of abuse of “anticipatory” self-defence is simply too great, and too dangerous, for the world to tolerate. Many countries have hostile relations with other countries. Allowing each country to unilaterally decide when they wish to degrade another country’s military, even when they have not been attacked, is a recipe for global chaos – and for the unjustified deaths of many innocent people. Would Australia accept, for example, another country’s right to preventively bomb our Aukus program, if they perceived it as a security threat?Israel’s current aggression against Iran is sadly part of a pattern of unlawful “anticipatory” violence against other countries. Most recently, since the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Israel has systematically destroyed Syrian military bases and equipment, in the absence of any attack by the new Syrian authorities on Israel. It has thus deprived a sovereign country of its capacity to defend itself and to restore order, including to prevent atrocities against minorities.The attack on Iran also raises concerns because it is not limited to preventing nuclear weapons, as claimed, but has also involved attacks on oil infrastructure and military bases. This suggests the attacks are a pretext for a wider campaign to weaken Iran. The attack may also have violated international humanitarian law, which regulates the fighting once it begins. The many Iranian nuclear scientists Israel has targeted were not taking a direct part in the hostilities and were thus protected civilians immune from attack.None of this minimises Iran’s transgressions. Its trajectory towards nuclear weapons has rightly fuelled international concern, albeit in a context where Israel is the only nuclear weapons power in the Middle East, making others feel insecure and fuelling an arms race. Iran’s retaliatory strikes appear to have involved indiscriminate attacks on Israeli civilians, itself illegal. Iran is also well known for illegally sponsoring Hezbollah.But illegal preventive war is not the answer. By allowing Israeli impunity for alleged international crimes in Gaza, the world has enabled Israel to feel untouchable and commit ever more severe violations. In the present geopolitical moment, every day we witness international law collapse further under the weight of realist politics and historically shortsighted hawks. This moral slide makes international life less stable and predictable, and more violent, for everyone, even the most powerful. It fuels grievances that perpetuate inter-generational cycles of vengeance and extremism.International law is only law if we demand that our allies, not only our adversaries, obey it. If we apply it selectively, we cannot expect others to respect it, or to respect us.Ben Saul is Challis chair of international law at the University of SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionIsraelIranAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a broken systemPeter Breadonand Elizabeth BaldwinThe unfair gaps in access to healthcare in Australia are deep and longstanding, but they’re not inevitableSun 15 Jun 2025 21.18 EDTShareWhen it comes to health, Australia is an unfair country.Poorer Australians die about 7.5 years earlier than the wealthiest, and spend more years living with chronic disease. People from some communities, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, face an even higher risk of illness.This injustice has deep, gnarled roots, from disadvantage and discrimination to poor air quality and unhealthy diets. But there’s one cause that’s more visible, and should be easier to fix: people missing out on healthcare they need.A recentcomparison of 10 wealthy countriesfound Australia’s healthcare system rates highly overall, but ranks second-last on access to care, beating only the notoriously inequitable US system.One million Australians missing specialist doctor appointments due to cost, report findsRead morePoorer and rural Australians are sicker, yet they get less care. It’s a perverse pattern that applies to most types of healthcare, including dentists, medicines, mental health care and allied health.And aGrattan Institute reportreleased this week compiles new data showing that access to specialist doctors, such as psychiatrists and cardiologists, is also highly unequal.We mapped access to public and private specialist care and found that people in the poorest areas receive about a quarter fewer services than those in the wealthiest areas. That means poorer communities are missing out on tens of thousands of appointments every year, despite being sicker than average.Rural Australians get about half as much care as people living in major cities. In many rural areas, specialist care is extremely scarce. Half of remote and very remote areas receive fewer than one specialist service per person each year, something not seen anywhere in Australia’s major cities.Why does this happen?First, specialist fees are high, and there’s not much relief for poorer people. Unlike at the GP, disadvantaged people are rarely bulk billed when they see a specialist.Three-quarters of people earning less than $500 a week paid a bill for at least one specialist visit in 2023. That’s not much less than for people on the median household income, who paid a bill 84% of the time.And when the bills come, they’re high and rising. The average fee charged has risen by nearly three-quarters since 2010. Again, poorer people aren’t getting much of a discount: the median cost for the poorest people who pay fees is $170. That’s not much lower than the $220 figure for people on an average income.In much of Australia, private care costs are high, and there’s no good alternative if you can’t paySecond, there aren’t enough public appointments where they’re needed most. Free clinics in public hospitals deliver just one-third of all specialist appointments. And as private services decline, public services don’t fill the gap.Compared with the average, the communities in the bottom fifth of the nation get 26 fewer private services per 100 people. But they only get an extra three public services per 100 people. As a result, waiting lists for public clinics can be very long – often many months longer than clinically recommended.Put these two problems together and you get a broken system. In much of Australia, private care costs are high, and there’s no good alternative if you can’t pay. The result is missed or delayed diagnoses, preventable illness and avoidable hospital visits.To reduce fees and wait times, Australia needs to reform specialist training, reduce unnecessary referrals, and crack down on excessive fees. But an essential part of the solution is much more investment in specialist clinics in underserved areas.Governments must invest for impact by targeting need. They should combine data on public services, private services, and community needs, then rebalance our skewed service system and put care where it’s needed most.To make it happen, health ministers should commit to a guaranteed minimum level of specialist care in the national health funding deal currently being negotiated between federal and state governments. It would cost about $500m to fill the worst gaps in the country.To maximise the impact, public clinics should change the way they operate. There are many opportunities to improve their efficiency, but too often, they aren’t the focus of hospital investment and improvement plans.State governments should give public clinics more funding and support to adopt best practices. To make sure that expansion and improvement efforts are working, all governments should publicly report waiting times, as some states already do.The unfair gaps in access to healthcare in Australia are deep and longstanding, but they’re not inevitable. Without real change, we can expect fees and wait times to rise further as Australians get older and sicker. But with targeted public investment, we can make sure that specialist care doesn’t become a special privilege.Peter Breadon is the health program director at Grattan InstituteElizabeth Baldwin is a Senior Associate in Grattan Institute’sHealthProgramExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

He died two days laterRead moreThis year alone,12 Indigenous peoplehave died – 31% of total custodial deaths.The raw numbers are a tragic indictment of government failure to implement in full the commission’s 339 recommendations.We are potentially further away from resolving this crisis than we were 34 years ago.Recent deathsKumanjayi White was avulnerable youngWarlpiri man with a disability under a guardianship order. He stopped breathing while being restrained by police in an Alice Springs supermarket on 27 May. His family is calling for all CCTV and body camera footage to be released.Days later a 68-year-oldAboriginal elderfrom Wadeye was taken to the Palmerston watchhouse after being detained for apparent intoxication at Darwin airport. He was later transferred to a hospital where he died.Both were under the care and protection of the state when they died. The royal commission revealed “so many” deaths had occurred in similar circumstances and urged change. It found there was:Little appreciation of, and less dedication to, the duty of care owed by custodial authorities and their officers to persons in care.Seemingly, care and protection were the last things Kumanjayi White and the Wadeye elder were afforded by NT police.Preventable deathsThe royal commission investigated 99 Aboriginal deaths in custody between 1980 and 1989. If all of its recommendations had been fully implemented, lives may have been saved.For instance, recommendation 127 called for “protocols for the care and management” of Aboriginal people in custody, especially those suffering from physical or mental illness. This may have informed a more appropriate and therapeutic response to White and prevented his death.Recommendation 80 provided for “non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons”. Such facilities may have staved off the trauma the elder faced when he was detained, and the adverse impact it had on his health.More broadly, a lack of independent oversight has compromised accountability. Recommendations 29-31 would have given the coroner, and an assisting lawyer, “the power to direct police” in their investigations:It must never again be the case that a death in custody, of Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal persons, will not lead to rigorous and accountable investigations.Yet, the Northern Territory police has rejected pleas by White’s family for an independent investigation.Another audit?Northern Territory Labor MP Marion Scrymgour is calling on the Albanese government to order afull auditof the royal commission recommendations.She says Indigenous people are being completely ostracised and victimised:People are dying. The federal government, I think, needs to show leadership.It is unlikely another audit will cure the failures by the government to act on the recommendations.Instead, a new standing body should be established to ensure they are all fully implemented. It should be led by First Nations people and involve families whose loved ones have died in custody in recognition of their lived expertise.In 2023, independent senator Lidia Thorpemoved a motionfor the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner to assume responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations. While the government expressed support for this motion, there has been no progress.Another mechanism for change would be for governments to report back on recommendationsmade by coronersin relation to deaths in custody. Almost 600 inquests have issued a large repository of recommendations, many of which have been shelved.Leadership lacking?The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,recently concededno government has “done well enough” to reduce Aboriginal deaths in custody. But he has rejected calls for an intervention in the Northern Territory justice system:The shocking death toll from inaction in prisons – podcastRead moreI need to be convinced that people in Canberra know better than people in the Northern Territory about how to deal with these issues.Albanese is ignoring the essence of what is driving deaths in custody.Reflecting on the 25-year anniversary of the royal commission in 2016, criminology professor Chris Cunneen wrote that Australia had becomemuch less compassionateand more ready to blame individuals for their alleged failings:Nowhere is this more clear than in our desire for punishment. A harsh criminal justice system – in particular, more prisons and people behind bars – has apparently become a hallmark of good government.There are too many First Nations deaths in custody because there are too many First Nations people in custody in the first place.At the time of the royal commission,14% of the prisonpopulation was First Nations. Today,it’s 36%, even though Indigenous people make up just 3.8% of Australia’soverall population.Governments across the country have expanded law and order practices, police forces and prisons in the name of community safety.This includes a recent $1.5bnpublic order planto expand policing in the Northern Territory. Such agendas impose a distinct lack of safety on First Nations people, who bear the brunt of such policies. It also instils a message that social issues can only be addressed by punitive and coercive responses.The royal commission showed us there is another way: self-determination and stamping out opportunities for racist and violent policing. First Nations families have campaigned for these issues for decades.How many more Indigenous deaths in custody does there have to be before we listen?Thalia Anthony professor of law at the University of Technology Sydney.

He is sobbing, being consoled by friends. An older gay couple walk slowly, hands gripped together, supporting each other. Groups of young queer friends are arm-in-arm, united in grief. In front of them is the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, its panels sewn with images and messages: “Malcolm”, reads one, “I wish that I had known you longer.” Another panel is dedicated to “those rejected, denied, alone”. Another reads simply, “Dear Scott, I miss you so much!”Over the past few days, more than 20,000 people have visited Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall to see the quilt. Many of those visitors have wept openly in its presence, spending hours in the space. The atmosphere has been hushed, reverential. Some said on social media later that it was the best thing they’d ever seen at the Tate.The response suggests it is one of the most significant pieces of British art made in the past 40 years. And yet it is not like other artworks. It has countless makers, many unknown, many of whom will never have made or will make art again. It is unfinished, still being made. This art has no discernible monetary value, nor does it seek one: its purpose is much more transcendent. Until this display, the work had never been shown in its entirety in an art institution. It makes us question our understanding of what gets to be considered art. And yet, its future is unclear.The UK Aids Memorial Quilt is part of the world’s largest community art project. It was founded by American human rights activist Cleve Jones in 1985, in grief and rage at the lives being lost to Aids. It is made up of commemorative panels that measure 6ft by 3ft, the size of an average grave plot. This is intentional: at the time, many of those dying of Aids-related causes were denied a proper funeral, either because families had refused to acknowledge them, or funeral homes would not take in their bodies.View image in fullscreenEach panel is unique … some are plaintive, some defiant.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThequilt, known in the US as the Names Project, quickly grew. In the late 80s, Scottish activist Alastair Hume visited the US, saw the quilt and met Jones. On his return home to Edinburgh, he opened the UK chapter of the project. Panels were made by friends, partners, family members or colleagues of those who had died of Aids-related illness. They were even sometimes started by the person being commemorated, as a therapeutic act of making in their final days.When finished, the panels were sent to Edinburgh, with documentation about the person commemorated. In those days, homophobia was entrenched, meaning the person was often only identified by a first name. Indeed, many panels are dedicated to those whose names could not be said. The panels were then sewn into blocks measuring 12ft by 12ft, with no hierarchy about the placing of panels. Those of recognisable names, such as Freddie Mercury or Bruce Chatwin, are placed among those who never sought fame.The majority of panels commemorate gay men, but the quilt represents all who died from Aids-related causes, such as those who became infected with HIV through intravenous drug use, and those infected by contaminated blood, including children. Each panel is unique, some expertly crafted, others by those who had never worked with textiles before. Some panels are plaintive, raw in grief; others are soft and love-filled; some are defiant. There are panels that remember a loved one’s humour and sensibility, others that show the anger at their death, as well as anger at governmental and societal failure to respond to the pandemic. One panel was made, and then covered with a white sheet, with a note declaring “the Parents do not want this panel shown anywhere. The Stigma still exists – Until this changes this panel will remain covered.”The majority of the panels were made before 1996, when new treatments made it possible to live a full life with an HIV infection. But the Aids crisis continues, with around 40 million living with HIV worldwide. Many millions are now newly imperilled due to President Trump’s cuts to USAID, threatening access to HIV treatments and services. Trump has also jeopardised future treatment breakthroughs by cutting funding to HIV vaccine research programmes at Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute. Globally, HIV stigma is still rife. The quilt galvanises as a call to action in the fight against HIV/Aids. When the Turbine Hall display opened on Thursday, Jones told the crowd that the quilt is “not just a memorial, but a weapon”.This five-day display came about after I, on behalf of the UK Aids Memorial Quilt Partnership, emailed the director of Tate, Maria Balshaw. Across the duration of the display it was extraordinary to watch the coming together of people, communities and generations. Those who lived through the 1980s and 90s could mourn loved ones who had died, as well as process their often-repressed grief. At the time, even though friend after friend was dying, society at large expected them to carry on as normal.View image in fullscreenThe atmosphere has been hushed, reverential … visitors to the Tate this week.Photograph: AM HansonFor younger people, the emotional power of the quilt gave them a visceral insight into the trauma experienced by an older generation. All could reflect on the continuing legacy of these underacknowledged deaths, and the absence in our cultural and social lives of all that these people could have done.Twenty-five years after Tate Modern first opened, it remains one of the most iconic spaces for art in the world. Before we installed the quilt , it was seen more as a grassroots protest project. But laid out on the Turbine Hall floor, in three long columns, the it revealed itself to also be a piece of art.The implications for this are seismic. It is rare to experience art with multiple meanings that are deep and complex yet clear. There is no side to the quilt, no irony or knowingness to its essence. This is unusual in a British contemporary art landscape still dominated by the effect of the YBAs, a group of mostly straight artists who came to prominence in 1988, seven years after the first reported Aids deaths. I believe the ensuing dominance of the YBAs came about, in part, because of the cultural vacuum caused by Aids deaths. Bluster and cynicism won out over emotion and sincerity.The quilt shows us what else art can do, other than be a career-building tool for profit. It has a purpose. It is also genuinely, harrowingly beautiful.Artcan be both these things: purposeful and impactful. It can be made by those who have no interest in becoming part of the art industry – and still be of international importance.My position is not anti-art. My husband is an artist, my parents were artists, I was a judge for the Turner prize in 2019. I believe in art as a life’s vocation, and that artists should be able to earn a livable wage from their work. Yet recent reports suggest that artists earnings are more unstable than ever. The current art industry infrastructure does not work for the majority of artists, only for a few star names and the high-powered galleries which represent them.If we acknowledge that the UK Aids Memorial Quilt is one of the most significant works of British art of the past 40 years, the dialogue immediately changes. It asks us to reconsider the value system placed on contemporary art, where a work’s market price is what defines its worth. If we can break free from this obsession with art’s monetary value, we can perhaps move to a more enlightened, more nourishing, more compassionate relationship with art and art-making.Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’Read morePressingly, we must now ensure the future of this art. The quilt is currently in the loving care of a partnership of volunteers from six HIV charities. For nearly two decades it had been in storage, before the Quilt Partnership formed in 2014 to become its custodians. They currently have no funds to carry out vital conservation work. It has no suitable long-term home.I believe the quilt should be seen as the next Prospect Cottage. Just like the successful 2020 campaign to save Derek Jarman’s home in Dungeness, we must now fundraise to preserve this vital part of our social and cultural history. It is not about the quilt entering a permanent collection like that of Tate or V&A, since it needs unique ongoing care. The quilt requires its own bespoke permanent home, where it can be properly stored, conserved and made available for research. We must act now to save this artwork as a weapon in the fight against Aids.The quilt still grows. On Thursday, a new panel was symbolically added to the Turbine Hall display, to represent the many new panels that are being made. Panels that have been created by those who, for decades, have been too grief-stricken to face the task. Others are by young people, who want to commemorate a relative who died before they were born. Hopefully soon, the quilt will be on display again, both in London and around the country. Now, more than ever, we cannot forget its vital lessons.To support the future preservation of the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, please visitaidsquiltuk.orgExplore more on these topicsTate ModernAids and HIVTextile artArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about beating trolls, ‘inhumane’ Labour – and her love of gravyLucy WebsterMon 16 Jun 2025 11.41 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShare‘No,” saysRosie Joneswith a laugh. “I have never done any drug-related illegal activity, believe it or not. But I respect your attempt to try to get me to reveal I am an underground drug dealer. Sorry – not the world I live in!”We’re having this conversation because Pushers, the comedian and actor’s new series about a disabled woman who turns to drug dealing when her benefits are stopped, kicks off this week on Channel 4. Jones wrote the script and stars as the main character, Emily. How much of it is influenced by her own life? There are, undoubtedly, similarities. “From the very beginning,” Jones says, referring to when she originally came up with the idea, back in 2018, “we knew my character would be northern, working class and disabled.” That was important for two reasons: firstly, Jones’s favourite sitcoms growing up all featured “gritty” northern characters; and secondly, those sitcoms lacked any representation of disability.I have to talk about the bloody government. Of course I doThat’s where the similarities end, though. “Not to get too political too quickly,” she says with a grin, “but we wanted to show what it’s like to be working class and disabled right now – because, well, basically it’s shit for a lot of people. I think Emily is very different from me because, unlike me, she’s not had opportunities. She’s not really had supportive family. She’s gone under the radar. When we meet her, she’s almost invisible.” Invisible is definitely not a word you would use to describe Jones, but that’s the point: she wants to highlight the reality of life for the disabled people who aren’t on national TV.View image in fullscreen‘I have too much fun making people laugh’ … with Ryan McParland in Pushers.Photograph: James Stack/Channel 4“Obviously I want the sitcom to be entertaining,” says the 34-year-old as we chat over Zoom. “But in my opinion, the best comedy engages with reality and says something about the state of affairs in the country. When we came up with the concept, there was a Conservative government and I had just had my benefits cut, so it’s rooted in that reality. We wanted to say something about how the Tories were treating disabled people.” She pauses. “It won’t surprise any reader that I am on the left. I am liberal. I’m a Labour-voter, so when Labour came in last year, personally I was like, ‘Yes! Come on!’ But in terms of the sitcom, I knew it wouldn’t be out until nearly a year into a Labour government. I thought we would be living in a utopia where every disabled person gets the funding and services they need, and there wouldn’t be a need for a sitcom about benefits.”She’s joking, but her disappointment with the direction the government has taken is evident. “Sadly,” she says, “now I think we need it more than ever. I’m incredibly angry.” Consequently, she is quite happy for Pushers to be seen as a commentary on what’s happening politically.Since March, when Labour announced sweeping cuts to Pip, the main disability payment, as well as the health-related top-up for people on universal credit, Jones has been at the forefront of opposition. Last month, she was one of more than 100 celebrities and prominent disabled peoplewho signed an open letterto the prime minister, calling the cuts “inhumane”. She doesn’t see any tension between being famous for comedy and taking a political stand. In fact, she thinks they go hand in hand.“My hero is Billy Connolly. And I think the most intelligent people in the world aren’t politicians – they’re comedians, because we have the power to say something true and real and political and topical, but still make people laugh. It’s disarming. It gets people’s guard down. A lot of people say to me, ‘You should be a politician.’ And I say no, because I have too much fun making people laugh, but also because I fundamentally believe I can make more change and have more influence being a comedian – because people listen to me. And when they watch the sitcom or come to one of my gigs, they can say they had a great night but also, ‘I’ve never thought before about what it’s like to be a disabled person, or what it’s like to be disabled under this government.’ So I’m slowly chipping away. It’s not hard to have politics in comedy. It’s actually a no-brainer.”That’s certainly true of her forthcoming standup tour, called I Can’t Tell What She’s Saying – a refrain Jones, who has a speech impediment, hears all the time. “It’s a reference to a lot of the haters I get online, who say they can’t tell what I’m saying, quickly followed by, ‘She’s not funny.’ I’m like, ‘How do you know I’m not funny if you can’t bloody tell what I’m saying?’ So, like everything I do in life, it’s me facing the haters full-on and saying, ‘This is me. You can’t hurt me. Stop your silly comments because I’m just going to keep doing a job that I adore.’”Politics also features in the show’s content, which marries jokes about being single with jokes about being treated as a spokesperson for vast swathes of the population. (“Oh,” the press release cheerfully adds, “and boobs.”)“It’s about the struggles of trying to find love while navigating the weird world of TV and fame and success and power. It’s also about the pressure of feeling the need to represent disabled people, even though I am a bit of an idiot. First and foremost, I want to make people laugh. There’s so much bad stuff happening, if people give me their evening, I want to give them a giggle. But I do touch on politics and how disabled people are being affected right now. Being a disabled person with a platform means I have to talk about the bloody government. Of course I do.”View image in fullscreenStreet hustlers … Pushers.Photograph: James Stack/Channel 4It’s not all politics though. “As a good Yorkshire lady, my new show is about gravy!” she adds, speaking more seriously than at any other point in our interview. “Because I love gravy. Cut me open and I’d bleed gravy.”These days, it’s not only comedy keeping Jones busy. “Sometimes,” she says, “I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the fact that I’m a writer who writes books but who also writes sitcoms. I’m also a standup comedian, and an actor, and also a presenter. I’m also a founder and trustee of my own foundation.”The Rosie Jones Foundation was launched in April to “empower lives and change minds so that no person living with cerebral palsy (CP) ever feels alone or unheard”. It aims to tackle the high prevalence of mental health issues among teenagers and adults with CP.A 2019 studyfound that “the risk of depression was 44% higher and the risk of anxiety 55% higher” in adults with the condition than among their non-disabled peers.I’m just trying to make the world better and more welcoming for disabled peopleThe foundation takes a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, it matches people seeking support with therapists who share and understand their experience of disability. For Jones, that “common ground” between therapist and patient is key. Secondly, it provides spaces for disabled people and their families, who are often at risk from loneliness and isolation, to meet and share experiences (Jones will be holding meet-ups in her tour locations). Lastly, it curates workshops for young people with CP to learn skills and confidence, helping them access the social and financial benefits that come from work or volunteering.For Jones, it’s all linked. “Naturally, the cuts and the lack of funding for support right now take a toll on disabled people’s mental health. That’s what the foundation was set up to work on. Even though there isn’t a direct connection between the sitcom, my standup and the foundation, it all plays into the same cause, of me just trying to make the world better and more welcoming for disabled people.”Jones emanates a sense of drive. It shines from her. Just before we say goodbye, she tells me something that seems to characterise everything she does. “I’m a proud, passionate disabled woman,” she says. Her work makes sure we know it.Pushersbegins on Channel 4 on 19 June.

So I’m proud the album is an outsider classic – but feel depressed these songs are still relevant’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 16 Jun 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareJon King, singer, songwriterI grew up in a really boring village in Kent, so moving to Leeds as a student was thrilling. It was an A-list place to see gigs. On the other hand, the buildings were as black as soot, the Yorkshire Ripper was around and you could feel the tension between the National Front and the south Asian community. I saw swastikas on walls and on an anti-NF march I was hit with a truncheon by a mounted police officer. So I gradually came up with the modest ambition to change the world.I had knownAndy Gill, our guitarist, since primary school. We were like brothers but also chalk and cheese. Musically, the four of us in the band never let each other off the hook – which sometimes resulted in actual fights. That tension fed the music. Andy wasn’t a trained guitarist but had this genius way of flicking his fingers and stabbing at the instrument like it was his personal enemy, which would become hugely influential. We’d started as a knock-off Dr Feelgood, but once we came up with Love Like Anthrax we realised we had to dump all the other songs and write more like that. Then Damaged Goods opened the floodgates – we brought funk to punk.We lived on a houseboat and would get pissed with UK Subs. I’m still amazed nobody drownedThe songs on our debut album Entertainment! took a microscope to society. 5.45 – on which I sing, “How can I sit and eat my tea with all that blood flowing from the television?” – was about the evening news. Every household had been sent a “Protect and survive” pamphlet because of the threat of nuclear war: Guns Before Butter tapped into that paranoia. At Home He’s a Tourist came from the Jean-Paul Sartre-type idea that the defining sensation of modern life is to feel uncomfortable. Then our bandmates Dave Allen and Hugo Burnham had the hilarious idea of making it a disco song, because we all loved Chic. It charted at No 58, but because we refused to change the word “rubbers” (or condoms) to “rubbish”, the BBC wouldn’t allow us on Top of the Pops.Entertainment! was recorded with no effects, so at the playback the record company thought it was a demo. But over the years it has inspired so many musicians, from Kurt Cobain and REM to Run the Jewels and Frank Ocean. Whenever we play the songs now, I’m almost depressed that they’re still relevant, but I’m proud that Entertainment! has become an outsider classic. Nobody makes a record like that for the money.Hugo Burnham, drumsI was an English literature and theatre student playing in the rugby team but I realised I was never going to meet girls standing on tables singing songs with my trousers round my ankles. I gravitated to university clubs such as the Funk Society and met cooler people like Jon and Andy, who weren’t wearing flares. Dave had moved to Leeds from Cumbria to find a band. He was the only real musician among us.We fought about everything from the music to the price of Mars bars but laughed about everything else. We started off rehearsing in a smelly basement in a Victorian building surrounded by mannequins. ThenGang of Four, the Mekons and Delta 5 became a collective who shared rehearsal space and drank together in the Fenton pub. Buzzcocks let us support them and took us on tour in Europe, so we became a spectacular performing band, bashing into each other on stage. All the labels were desperate to sign their version of the Clash but we signed to EMI for the least money because they gave us full creative control.View image in fullscreen‘We fought about everything’ … the band in 1979.Photograph: Virginia Turbett/RedfernsAndy Gill: genius guitarist who burned a route out of punk | Alexis PetridisRead moreWe recorded Entertainment! in Workhouse studio in London, where Ian Dury had recorded New Boots and Panties!!, which we’d all loved. Between sessions we lived on a houseboat and would get pissedwith a churn of people including Charlie Harper from UK Subs. I’m still amazed nobody drowned. We recorded without click tracks and didn’t do many overdubs. The studio engineer hated us and every time Dave or I made a mistake, he made us do it all again, but the finished album sounds gritty and raw, simple but funky. We never talked much about the lyrics, but we all agreed it was far more interesting to sing aboutH-blocksor “the working classes” than cars and girls. A lot of the people who were influenced by us went on to make millions. I wish I had a penny for every song that sounds like ours.Gang of Four play Entertainment! in full as part of their final UK shows, at Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, on 23 June and O2 Forum Kentish Town, London, on 24 June.

People are in absolute raptures’: how mysterious masked rockers Sleep Token took over metalThey just headlined Download festival and their latest album went to No 1 in the US and UK – so why is Britain’s biggest metal band in a generation so hated by some?Alexis PetridisMon 16 Jun 2025 09.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 10.30 EDTShareOn Saturday, Sleep Token headlined Download festival in Leicestershire. Topping the bill at the festival is something of a rite of passage for artists of a certain musical bent, proof that you are now among the biggest bands in metal and hard rock: Metallica, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Guns N’ Roses are all former headliners. Last month, Sleep Token’s fourth album, Even in Arcadia, debuted at the top of both the British and American charts. Their most recent UK tour took in the biggest venues in the country: the same is true of their forthcoming US tour. In 2025, Sleep Token could reasonably claim to be the biggest British rock band in the world.But they wouldn’t, because Sleep Token operate behind a veil of anonymity. They have given virtually no interviews over the course of their career. The band’s frontman and chief songwriter is known only as Vessel; the other members are referred to as II, III and IV. They perform live wearing masks, hoods and body paint to conceal their identities and promote a fictional mythology: it’s too sprawling and complex to explain here – one fan has apparently produced a 35,000-word thesis on the subject – but it involves the band being a mouthpiece for a deity called Sleep. Their gigs are referred to as Rituals, their albums as Offerings, their social media posts frequently open with the word “Behold” and end with the word “Worship”. Like Hogwarts pupils, their fans are divided into “houses”: one is called Feathered Host, the other House Viridian.It’s not an approach entirely without precedent – the 70s progressive rock band Magma developed a mythology about a planet called Kobaïa, even singing in its “language”, Kobaïan – but it’s hard to think of anyone who has turned it to such commercial advantage. “No one saw this coming – it’s all fan-driven, it wasn’t pushed by anyone else,” says Luke Morton, editor of hard rock magazine Kerrang!. “I think it was during the pandemic when they really hit their stride – there was an escapist element, this world you could lose yourself in. TikTok had a large part to play in it – they just found this new audience that are so fully into it. I saw them in 2022 at Hammersmith Apollo, and there were people in floods of tears, in absolute raptures, just losing themselves in this world.”Of course, it takes seconds of Googling to discover Vessel’s real name, and indeed a video of him aged 18, offering his services as an online piano tutor. But the striking thing about Sleep Token’s fans is that they don’t seem to want to know, or at least want to pretend they don’t. Their online forums are governed by rules forbidding “providing information that leads to identifying members”. “Stop trying to break the spell,” counselled one fan on Instagram recently. “Just love it the way it is or leave it.”Whatever you make of all this, it’s at least an intriguing corrective to the idea that 21st-century music fans want artists to be relatable – as like themselves as possible – and that they essentially view music itself as a gossipy extension of artists’ lives, always scanning lyrics for clues to feuds with fellow stars or coded vitriol aimed at former partners. Instead, Sleep Token’s success seems to key into a supposedly old-fashioned, rather Bowie-esque idea that pop stars should be distant, remote, fantastical figures, their music a portal into a world very different from your own.View image in fullscreenSleep Token’s Vessel performing at Download.Photograph: Matt Higgs/Download festivalAnd yet, Sleep Token’s success has proved controversial. Even in Arcadia attracted some scathing reviews – Pitchfork called it “sanitized pop-rap with all the sexed-up verve of Droopy the dog” and their fans “dumb as hell”; The Needle Drop deemed it “plain and uninspired” and “metal for Disney adults”.To which any hard rock fan might shrug: so what? Ever since the debut album by heavy metal’s founding fathers Black Sabbath was dismissed by Rolling Stone as “claptrap” and “a shuck”, the kind of artists that play at Download and feature in Kerrang! have traditionally struggled to attract praise from the mainstream music press. But Sleep Token have attracted opprobrium from inside the hard rock community, too. Their initial success was adjacent to the progressive metal subgenre, a world of complex rhythms, lengthy songs and impressive technical proficiency: they are big on a sound called djent, which essentially means tricky riffs played on muted, low-pitch guitars. They always boasted a melodic sensibility, but it has become gradually more pronounced over their career: on Even in Arcadia, djent and what Morton calls “big, crushing breakdowns” are outweighed by the influence of R&B, hip-hop, dance music and straightforward pop. Some voices have started questioning whether they really deserve to be called a hard rock band at all, among them – unexpectedly – TV presenter and author Richard Osman: “It’s not hard rock,” he protested. “It’s the least metal thing I’ve ever heard.”Indeed, so much criticism has flown Sleep Token’s way that Doc Coyle, of US metal bands God Forbid, Trivium and Lamb of God among others, recently felt impelled to take to the internet in their defence, penning an article decrying “pretentious gatekeeping” and “a toxic heavy metal culture”: it’s perhaps worth noting that Sleep Token’s fanbase skews young.View image in fullscreenSleep Token with the Download festival crowd last weekend.Photograph: Adam Ross Williams/Download festivalFor his part, Morton thinks their success is evidence that “tribalism is a thing of the past”: as he points out, elsewhere at this year’s Download, McFly – a manufactured 00s pop band with a vaguely punk-ish lilt – are headlining a stage, which would have been unthinkable at the height of their fame. “There’s a backlash among metal elitists, but elitism always exists in heavy music, it has done since grunge happened. There’s a backlash to any sort of band that gets popular,” he says. “Nu-metal happened and people moaned, emo happened and people moaned. What I’ve seen more of is a quiet adoration for how big this all is: a ‘rising tide lifts all ships’ thing. If you don’t like it, fine.”But amid the mythology and lore, it’s hard not to notice that some of the lyrics on Even in Arcadia imply a certain weariness on the part of Sleep Token’s leader. “I swear it’s getting harder even to exhale … I try not to talk about how it’s harder now,” offers its most-streamed song,Caramel, adding “this stage is a prison, a beautiful nightmare”.Perhaps the real existential threat to the band’s continued success might not be the criticism they’ve attracted, but Sleep Token themselves, whoever they are.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She used to say, if you see a show that you like the look of, I’ll get tickets. So I’d go on the Royal Court website and if there were many black people in the cast, I’d want to go because I could see myself.I would have been around 16 when I sawSucker Punchby Roy Williams. It’s about two young men who know that their bodies can be a kind of tool to better themselves so they fall into boxing. An aspiring white promoter zeroes in on their talent. It is about rivalry, but also about how community works together, and is a really good investigation of masculinity and the ownership of black bodies.I had been to shows at the Royal Court before but they transformed the space for Sacha Wares’ 2010 production. It was completely 360-degree, in the round. I remember the accuracy of the boxing ring, the ropes. It was visceral. The actors were dripping with sweat. And when they moved, we moved, because we thought we were going to get punched! The acting felt so charged and so full-body, as if they’d been plucked from the street. We were fully in it – as if you could ultimately step into the characters’ roles if you just walked a couple of metres. It felt very real. I came away feeling, I need to understand how this is made.It was my first time seeingDaniel Kaluuya. I remember him winking at me and my mum in the audience. And Mum shoved me in front of Daniel afterwards. He said it had felt special for him seeing us in the audience because so often the audience is white. He said: “I acted better for you.”View image in fullscreen‘We thought we were going to get punched!’ … Daniel Kaluuya and Nigel Lindsay at the Royal Court.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianI was aStagecoachkid – I had been to their classes from a very young age to do drama, singing and dancing. But by that time I was not gagging to be where Daniel Kaluuya was. I had no idea directing could be a career – I wanted to become a barrister. When I realised there was this role, that you could create the vision, that you were actually the orchestrator of the actors, my mind really just opened. I was like, wow, that’s where my skill set lies.Years later, after university, I joined the Young Vic’s introduction to directing course and Sacha Wares was the programme leader.

Illustrated by Rebecca Cobb, 2012’s The Paper Dolls has an irresistible sense of childlike wonder, following a string of cut-out dolls as they explore a house while trying to avoid scissors.Key lineThey were Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie and Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PR14Tabby McTatThe festive BBC adaptations of Donaldson’s work are so beloved that it’s easy to overlook how some stories work much better as films than others. Tabby McTat – in which a cat becomes separated from his busker friend – is one of the best. There’s a real sense of melancholy to some of the sequences, before the happy ending – exactly what you want at Christmas.Key lineThe sun went down and the sky grew black. The stars came out, but he didn’t come back.View image in fullscreen13TiddlerTiddler is a small fish with a big imagination, always coming up with wild excuses for his behaviour. But is there any merit to them? This is Donaldson and Scheffler in pure entertainment mode, and – at least anecdotally – one of the stories that children respond best to.Key line“Sorry I’m late, Miss. I set off really early but on the way to school I was captured by a squid.”View image in fullscreen12The Smeds and the SmoosDonaldson has written hundreds of books in her career, but none felt quite as timely as 2019’s The Smeds and the Smoos. A Romeo and Juliet story about two aliens whose families hate each other, it’s hard to see this as anything other than Donaldson’s Brexit book. Scheffler’s dedication – “To all the children of Europe” – makes the link even more explicit.Typical line“Never, never marry a Smed. My dearest child, are you off your head?”View image in fullscreen11Chocolate Mousse for Greedy GooseNick Sharratt provides the illustrations for this sweetly simple book for very young readers. Not a great deal happens here – some animals have a dinner party and none of them behaves very well – but the whole thing is perfectly executed.Key line“Don’t just grab it,” says angryRabbit. “I’ll lickthe bowl,” saysfurry Mole.View image in fullscreen10Room on the BroomDonaldson is at her best when she leans into gothic fairytale darkness. Room on the Broom, where a kind witch and her animal hitchhikers fend off a dragon, is a perfect example of this. Completists might like to know that the book has also been adapted into a Chessington World of Adventures attraction that is about 5% too scary for its intended audience.Key line“I am a dragon, as mean as can be,and I’m planning to have WITCH AND CHIPS for my tea!”View image in fullscreen9Princess Mirror-BelleAlthough she’s best known for her picture books, Donaldson has also written a number of early years stories, designed to be the first thing that children read alone. Of these, Princess Mirror-Belle – about a girl’s reflection that comes to life and causes havoc – is the most irresistible. Perfect for kids who are just about ready to finally outgrow The Gruffalo.Key lineBy this stage they had reached the escalator. Mirror-Belle hopped on to it. “This is fun,” she said. “Does it go down to the dungeons?” “No,” said Ellen, riding down beside her. “It goes down to the food department.”View image in fullscreen8Jonty Gentoo: The Adventures of a PenguinDonaldson and Scheffler’s most recent book may cover old ground (like Stick Man, it’s a journey story, only this time about a penguin who escapes from the zoo), but it’s told with flair and has a pristine rhyming scheme. Plus, who doesn’t like penguins?Key lineHis aunts said,“Grow up!”,“Eat your fish!” and“Talk sense!”, but Jonty had noticed a gap in the fence.View image in fullscreen7The Smartest Giant in TownA bit of an outlier for a Donaldson/Scheffler book, in that it only intermittently rhymes. Nevertheless, the message of the story – that it’s better to be kind than nicely dressed – is as perfectly pitched as anything Donaldson has ever written.Key line“Cheer up!” said George, and he took off one of his shiny shoes.“It was giving me blisters anyway.”View image in fullscreen6A Squash and a SqueezeDonaldson’s first book was initially a lilting reggae song, performed by Floella Benjamin and Derek Griffiths on the children’s TV showPlay Schoolin the 1970s. But the story – about a woman who learns to live within her means after filling her house with farm animals – works far better as a book, especially when paired with Scheffler’s beautifully manic illustrations.Key lineThe little old lady cried “Stop, I implore! It was titchy for three and it’s teeny for four.”View image in fullscreen5What the Ladybird HeardLydia Monks provides vivid illustrations to this story, about a ladybird who uses her size and silence to thwart a farmyard robbery. Structurally, What the Ladybird Heard is a gem, first carefully laying out the robbers’ plan (twice, with a blueprint) only to hilariously subvert it at the climax.Key lineThe duck on the pond said“MOO MOO MOO!”“Two more steps to go!” said Hugh.View image in fullscreen4The Highway RatDonaldson was a songwriter before she became an author, and this is the secret to her success – you don’t need to read many of her books to see that they often have choruses. The chorus of The Highway Rat (a story about a greedy rat who learns the error of his ways) is the best of the lot. It’s a tricky metre for parents to enter into blind, but it absolutely rewards the effort.Key line“I am theRat of the highway – the highway – the highway – Yes, I am theRat of the highway, and I fancy a duck for tea!”View image in fullscreen3The Snail and the WhaleOne of her very best. This is in part down to Donaldson’s Lear-style rhyme scheme, but mainly because it is completely impossible to separate the text from the images. The story constantly draws the reader’s attention to the illustrations (“This is a rock”, “This is the sea”, “This is the teacher”) and, given the extremes of scale that Scheffler has to work with, it ranks as some of his best work. Quite frankly, the whole thing reads like a love letter between them.Key lineThese are the waves that arched and crashed, that foamed and frolicked and sprayed and splashed.View image in fullscreen2The GruffaloAn all-time classic. Donaldson’s third book was based on the Chinese folktale The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger, and revolves around a blazingly clever structure. First, a mouse fends off advances from three hungry animals by describing an invented terrifying monster to them. Then, when he realises that the monster is real, he retraces his steps and outwits everyone in the process. But you knew that, of course, because you’ve read it a million times.Key line“Oh help! Oh no! It’s a Gruffalo!”View image in fullscreen1Stick ManOstensibly a sequel to The Gruffalo’s Child (which features a toy stick man), this is just about as epic as picture books get. A stick loses his family, and has to make an Odyssean journey home. There are real stakes here; the moment when Stick Man awaits what seems like certain death would be impressive in any story, but the fact that this is a book for toddlers makes it doubly so.Key lineStick Lady’s lonely. The children are sad. It won’t feel like Christmas without their Stick Dad.To explore any of the books featured, visitguardianbookshop.com.

It’s exciting to do it with sport.”For Football City, Art United, Pfeiffer was paired with the former Juventus midfielder Davids, who hasa significant art collectionof his own and suggested recreating the intensity of the tunnel as players prepare to walk out into a stadium.View image in fullscreenEdgar DavidsPhotograph: Chris Payne“He referred to it as the moment of greatest tension,” says Pfeiffer. “Even more so than being on the field itself.”Visitors to the Aviva Studios in Manchester, where the exhibition is being held, will be immersed into a tunnel, with audio of crowd noise that Pfeiffer and his team recorded live at the San Siro stadium during the Milan derby earlier this year.Davids, who also played for both Milan sides during his career in Italy, was able to pull strings to get the artist’s team pitchside. Pfeiffer calls it a mix of the “preparation and interior space of the individual player” versus “the sound of 100,000 fans permeating the wall”.There are 11 “pairings” in total, with footballers and artists put together according to interests. Arguably the most anticipated work for locals comes from the United fan favourite and Manchester United bete noire Eric Cantona, who alongside the British conceptual artist Ryan Gander explores the effects of fame on a player.View image in fullscreenEric CantonaPhotograph: Paul CooperThe work features three parts: an automated spotlight that will pick out visitors at random so they can experience the “isolating glare of celebrity”; a song performed by Cantona,Les Temps Passeor Time Passes, will play; and a number of match tickets from the French forward’s final appearance at Old Trafford will be handed out to every 100th visitor replete with a message from him.Perhaps the most intriguing work is a collaboration between the Berlin and London-based artist collective Keiken and the England star Ella Toone. Visitors can step on to a podium and interact with a mask inspired by Toone’s “spirit animal”, the shetland pony.View image in fullscreenElla Toone.Photograph: Ella Toone“The idea is that football is for everyone and art is for everyone,” says Obrist. “We’re here to create a bridge of possibilities. There are moments of epiphany in football and art, and hopefully we can create some in Manchester.”This is not the first time Obrist has embraced football. He was a passionate backer of Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno’s filmZidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which he describes as a masterpiece.He has also had a long-running collaborative relationship with Mata, after the pair messaged each other on Instagram when the footballer began liking Obrist’s studio visit posts. This year’s project is the latest instalment ofThe Trequartista: Art and Football United, a multi-part exploration of the sport and artistic practice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Obrist described the 2023 work as ateaserfor what’s to come later this summer.The Honolulu-born, New York-based Pfeiffer’s work often intersects with sport. He has used digital editing to make it seem as if a boxer is being hit by an invisible opponent and removed audio from NBA games, creating eerie portraits of players. As one critic put it, Pfeiffer “strips away the pageantry” of sport and in so doing shows “the pain and contradiction that draw people in”.The Swiss Uruguayan artist Jill Mulleady once met Diego Maradona, and she is using that chance encounter as the basis for a “holographic illusion” of the footballer, which will recall his controversial “hand of God” goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.Alvaro Barrington teams up with the 90s Brazil star Raí to create a “large green felt banner” that will hang about the space, while the architects Stefano Boeri and Eduardo Terrazas have created a work on the floor of the Aviva Studios with the former Italian player Sandro Mazzola where visitors can recreate some of his goals.View image in fullscreenChildren recreating goals at the Stefano Boeri and Eduardo Terrazas x Sandro Mazzola exhibit.Photograph: Courtesy of Stefano Boeri ArchitettiOther work includes the manga artist Chikyuu no Osakana Pon-chan recreating scenes from the life of the former Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa; the Zidane co-creator Parreno and Marco Perego present a Sims-style video game where visitors can explore the “physical geography” of the former Everton and Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti.The US artist Suzanne Lacy, the Manchester City and Netherlands star Vivianne Miedema and the Angel City FC and New Zealand captain Ali Riley have created a film; Bárbara Sánchez-Kaneand the former Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Camposhave created a flamboyant mascot named Brody; and the British artist Rose Wylie worked with the Arsenal and England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy to turn moments from her daily life as a footballer into paintings.Football City,ArtUnited is at Aviva Studios, Manchester from 4 July to 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsManchester international festivalArtFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the horrific details are totally prioritised over the motives and the victim. Why are we still gawking at true-crime horrors?Hannah J DaviesMon 16 Jun 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn August 2023, delivery driver Aurman Singh was viciously attacked and killed by a group of eight men in Shrewsbury, suffering a traumatic head injury that led to his death. He had been struck with weapons including a golf club and an axe, before his mask-wearing assailants fled in two cars. One eyewitness – whose doorbell camera footage is analysed by police – says Singh’s eyes were “fixed open … it was like someone just pressed stop”.Singh’s killing – dubbed “The DPD Murder” by the programme-makers – was unusually callous and brutal, making for what lead investigator DCI Mark Bellamy describes as a “beast of a job”. It also makes for compelling television, although you may well wonder whether you should be watching it all, in such harsh detail. As its title suggests, Murder 24/7 is wall-to-wall, hour-by-hour death, its six episodes a sobering experience, during which – in spite of the care it affords its cases – you can’t help but feel voyeuristic.The first series – broadcast in 2020 – followed Essex police. This time we’re embedded with West Mercia law enforcement, as they investigate cases including Singh’s murder, which unfolds over two and a half episodes of this six-part series. By the end of the first, there are four men in custody, but only one – Arshdeep Singh (no relation to the deceased) – gives an account of the events leading up to Aurman’s death. There is, of course, footage of their respective police questionings. But, the real selling point is that we also see DS Alex Sullivan – an interview specialist – watching remotely, working out what and when to tell the suspects. In this case, that means figuring out when to tell Arshdeep that they’ve got him bang to rights, as they have a video of him disposing of one of the murder weapons in a wheelie bin.The work that Bellamy and his 45-strong team do is long, painful, and clearly takes a toll (his face in particular is fixed in a permanent frown, and I am happy to learn online that he has since retired from the force). But it is also necessary; in episode two (which airs tomorrow, followed by episode three on Wednesday), a discovery by a member of the public, coupled with that relentless policing, leads to a big breakthrough in the Aurman Singh case. Still, it’s wearying work: looking into Arshdeep’s phone records alone leads to 141,000 pages of calls and messages (a decision is quickly made to just home in on messages from the days leading up to the attack). On the phone of another suspect, more critical evidence is found (or as one officer puts it: “Jagdeep’s in a bit of bother there, in’t he?”)However, while investigating murders is clearly an onerous job, I’m not sure we ever move past the surface of the investigations. Despite dedicating two-and-a-half hours to the Aurman Singh case, we don’t ever get a sense of his killers’ motivations; nor do we get a portrait of Aurman, the 23-year-old at the centre of it all. It’s easy to call crime documentaries voyeuristic, but when you have such a strong sense of how somebody was killed – complete with 3D reconstructions of where the various murder weapons struck their skull – but no idea who they were, it’s difficult to ignore. It’s a criticism you can level at other cases in the series, too, such as that of an elderly man, Ivan, suspected of trying to kill himself and his son after his wife’s death. We see the emotional price paid by Ivan, and by DC Tracy Ruff, who treats his case with rigour but also compassion. But we don’t get a picture of the other two people involved: Ivan’s wife, Maureen, or his son, Gavin. Keeping them off-camera makes sense: Maureen is dead, and Gavin is severely disabled and – we later learn – now in the care of social services. But, with that in mind, is this a story we need to bear witness to at all? Meanwhile, watching The Killer Son – about a man who killed his mother during a psychotic episode – may feel to many like gawking at a totally abject situation.The episodes that focus on a domestic abuser, Damian Homer, feel more complete. There, we hear from his former partner, Stacey Hill, and the focus shifts to the insidious nature of intimate partner violence – which ran concurrent to Stacey and Damian’s happy faces on social media, and which led to the death of Stacey’s mother, Wendy. But, too often, Murder 24/7 attempts to go deep only to end up somewhere shallow. We certainly see how well West Mercia police do their jobs. But, without more of the why, cases such as The Killer Son – or indeed The DPD Murder – feel like true-crime cliche.Murder 24/7 aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The anthology’s series title has a significant founding story. The poetEavan Boland, a major supporter of women’s talent, was told by a gifted writer in her workshop that she didn’t want her poems to be published. It was because if her neighbours knew she was a poet they’d think she never washed her windows. I hope she and her neighbours since changed their minds.The current collection celebrates the 50th anniversary of Arlen House, Ireland’s first feminist press, with new, unpublished poems by more than 300 poets from Ireland and beyond. Many names will be familiar to readers, among them,Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Medbh McGuckian, Sinéad Morrissey, Rita Ann Higgins, Kerry Hardie and, an unexpected pleasure, Edna O’Brien. The so-far less familiar, younger generations of writers are well-represented: they include Victoria Melkovska, a poet and journalist, born in Ukraine in 1977 and resident in Ireland since 2003.It’s clear from the self-assured informality of tone in This Year Her Present that the writer knows her readers well and effortlessly shares their verbal idioms. Her list of presents from home is cleverly organised by means of a title that functions as a first line, leading to an unexpected negative, “wasn’t”. “Wasn’t” is the key that opens in each quatrain a treasury of earlier gifts from a female relative or friend, based elsewhere, possibly in Kyiv, but persistently “present”. The gifts transport a shared cultural identity, while the donor remains un-named. Obliquely, Melkovska’s poem functions as a “thank you” letter, while being at the same time an entrusting proclamation of her own identity to the wider audience looking over her shoulder.The first present evoked leads to an image of overstocked “sagging bookshelves” – the kind most of us can relate to – inexpensive, ad hoc, not the comfortably rooted bookshelves of long-established library owners. Suggesting a combined love of books and lack of privilege as common denominator, the phrase may help attune readerly sympathies. Elsewhere, the unique preciousness of home is asserted, sometimes through flavoursome gifts of food and drink that might locally be thought exotic, and can’t be obtained “for love or money”.A “vintage” postcard brings the sender’s face into sudden friendly perspective: more mysterious is the “one-of-a-kind” notebook or journal, with its “printed fore-edges / on pastel pages”, designed to reveal glimmers of pattern or picture as you fan the leaves. Melkovska doesn’t tell us directly if painful reminders are carried by the gifts. Each of them, whether a dress or notebook, is welcome and life-enhancing: a talisman.Melkovska’s stanza-structure is generally cohesive, but there’s an exception in stanza five: “[This year her present] wasn’t a sweets box …” “Sweets box” is refreshingly un-idiomatic, and it allows the expansion of the idea that the word “sweets” has a Shakespearean dimension (as in Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 1, “Sweets for the sweet …”). For Melkovska, too, the sweets are not mere confectionery: they contain “the songs we spun on air / and echo of our side-splitting laughs”. This meeting of the giver and the recipient might have been face-to-face, although “on air” could suggest virtual or radiophonic contact. Of course, “spun on air” also evokes “spun sugar” and other kinds of aeration, literal and metaphorical. In any event, there’s no doubt of the happy reciprocity of sweets shared between speaker and present-sender.After the sensuously delicious verbal evocations of Polish “honey mead” in the sixth stanza, the final awaited revelation is particularly stark: “This year her present was / a bottle of Lugol iodine”. The poem might have ended there, with a potent silence and, perhaps, a footnote explaining the purpose of the iodine. Melkovska chooses to follow her structural template, to seek images of the unthinkable, and the name of the unnameable.Besides the “heavy air”, she conjures the light of the radio halo in the newly sinister form of a “radiation halo”.In the context, the reference to “the edge of nuclear war” reminds us there is an edge that politicians, even the worst of them, might draw back from, but that there is no end to the potentiality of such a war when narcissism habitually attracts them to that edge. It’s a reminder, too, that no national borders, no kinds of edge, are observed by radiation.Victoria Melkovska’s first collectionFor the Birdswas published in 2023.

Short stories are not novels in miniature, or parts of novels pruned to stand on their own. Without the luxury of space and looser pacing, they demand of the writer a linguistic precision and compression that, at its most radical, borders on the poetic, and which across the breadth of a novel would feel wearying. Novels need room to breathe. The writer expanding their scope therefore faces a difficult adjustment: guarding against density while ensuring they don’t get lost in the space.For Wendy Erskine, the move to a larger canvas feels entirely unforced. Her highly praised stories, collected in 2018’sSweet Homeand 2022’sDance Move, often display a certain capaciousness, a willingness to wander beyond the single epiphanic moment that is the traditional preserve of the short story. Now, in her first novel, she revels in the possibilities of an expanded cast, yet controls the pace and framing with all the precision of a miniaturist. The result is a novel that feels like a balancing act: at once sprawling and meticulous, polyphonic and tonally coherent.The Benefactors is ambitiously structured, but functions in some ways as a short story with a novel around it. At the book’s heart is a pivotal, life-altering moment. Gracefully flowing into and out of it are the day-to-day lives that the moment both springs from and distorts, rendered in a tapestry of third-person narration and unattributed interjections of monologue – a kind of community chorus, commenting and adding colour. At the centre is Misty, a teenager who dreams of a career in special effects makeup, but who tops up her current job in a hotel by putting in the hours on Bennyz, or Benefactors, a camgirl site not unlike OnlyFans. Misty has a crush on Chris, the spoiled son of a wealthy businessman, but at a party in an Airbnb Chris and his friends Rami and Lineup sexually assault her. The trauma is Misty’s, but the aftermath is dominated by the parents: Misty’s adoptive father Boogie, Chris’s stepmother Frankie, Rami’s widowed mother Miriam, and Lineup’s idealistic but ultimately hypocritical mother Bronagh, who runs a successful children’s charity.Erskine’s great gift is for character – all are complicatedly flawed and empathetically renderedErskine’s great gift is for character. Not a single figure in this novel feels contrived; all are complicatedly flawed and empathetically rendered. In the novel’s first third, Erskine juggles not only a series of perspectival shifts but also multiple, fragmentary diversions back in time, constructing from a mosaic of voices and moments both a convincing cast and a richly textured collective portrait of suburban Belfast – an array of pasts and circumstances deeply and believably integrated.As the novel comes to rest in the present, Erskine draws for the communication of her characters’ inner lives on her other most striking skill: the construction of warmly human dialogue on the page. In the book’s most remarkable character, Misty’s wonderfully abrasive grandmother Nan D, all Erskine’s generous literary gifts find their perfect expression. Observe, for example, the sheer rhythmic poetry that careens across the page when Nan D, who favours a more direct form of reparation than the criminal justice system allows for, sardonically relays in beautifully cadenced sarcasm a cinematic fantasy of justice heroically upheld:Misty could end up with one of those lawyers like off the films, a young underdog, nice long hair like your woman, can’t remember her name. She’s been in loads of things. From the wrong side of the tracks, underdog, but sees something in Misty that reminds her of herself, you know what I mean? And works night and day. In libraries at midnight and grafting grafting grafting. And she turns a whole jury around, our girl. And those guys are going down and their lives are just grubbed up for all time.Boogie, too, is touchingly portrayed. The scene when, on hearing that Misty has been assaulted, he drives to the supermarket on the way to collect her from the police station and buys all the uncomplicated comfort he can think of – food, a dressing gown, orange juice – is, like much of this novel, poignant and true without ever being sentimental or manipulative. When Misty’s sister Gen, who accompanies Misty to the police station, uses the word “Dad” – just once, and entirely uneditorialised – the reader feels the weight of it without anything further needing to be said, such is the depth of the characterisation that has gone before.As should be obvious by this point, there is no doubting Erskine’s skill as a writer. The problem is that skill itself must be skilfully deployed – rougher textures allowed to show through the polish. Otherwise, the depiction can cleanse the subject of life. The Benefactors is a work of great assurance and precision, but by the end there is a sense that it has imposed its discipline and control on its characters, denying them emotional expansiveness. The novel’s structure – the quotidian trickling towards the seismic, the seismic dissolving in turn back into the quotidian – makes a perfectly valid point about the processing of trauma in collective life, but it costs the story its impact. When, towards the end, a character finally loses their temper, allows themselves to be seized by the irrational, it feels less like a shock than a relief, as if they have shattered not just their own inner reservation but the constraints of the narration around them – a narration that circles a significant trauma, but somehow never quite reaches inside it, as if in fear of what might be found there, and how it might trouble the perfect surface of Erskine’s creation.The Benefactors by Wendy Erskine is published by Sceptre (£18.99).

Or are we?Houman BarekatMon 16 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 16 Jun 2025 04.02 EDTShareWhat makes a genius? Pushed to define it, we might say it’s a combination of extraordinary talent and drive, often accompanied by a dash of eccentricity or madness. Ultimately, the designation is conferred by hype; it’s essentially an offshoot of celebrity, which is why, as journalist Helen Lewis notes in her new book. “A genius needs a story as well as achievements”. Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso all made pioneering breakthroughs in their respective fields while living unconventional lives that later became the stuff of legend.Lewis wants us to look at these figures in a more clear-eyed way, and see them as the selfish characters they often were. The lustre of genius, she observes, can provide cover for a multitude of sins: “alcoholism, family abandonment, unfaithfulness, abuse, weirdness, failure to take responsibility”. Since others invariably have to pick up the slack, this amounts to a form of exploitation. Reflecting on Leo Tolstoy’s treatment of his wife, Sophia Tolstaya, over the course of their 48-year marriage, Lewis concludes that the Russian novelist “was a genius, and a parasite”.The concept of genius presupposes a hierarchy of innate talent, and this comes with baggage, because the science of intelligence testing belongs to the same intellectual tradition that brought us eugenics and so-called scientific racism. Lewis introduces us to some of its notable thinkers, beginning with the Victorian anthropologist Francis Galton, whose 1869 book Hereditary Genius proposed that “greatness” ran in families, and including several of his 20th-century disciples, such as the British social psychologist Hans Eysenck and the US physicist William Shockley. Surveying the lives and works of these men, we notice certain recurring themes: iffy research, a tendency to overlook the importance of structural and material factors in determining success, and an enthusiasm for racial hierarchies.“Something about the subject of intelligence has a warping effect on its most furious proponents,” writes Lewis, though it’s probably the other way round – the subject seems to attract people who are neurotically fixated with dominance. For such individuals, the idea of genius functions as a self-validating affectation; it “makes a fetish of contrarianism, and flatters the ‘free thinker’ or ‘heterodox intellectual’ into moving from scepticism to conspiracism”. For his admirers among today’s online right, Elon Musk’s gaucheness is only further proof of his smarts.The book’s central message is that we should refrain from putting people on pedestals just because they happen to be talented. This is sensible, and Lewis’s suggestion that we should apply the term “genius” to specific works, rather than individual people, is persuasive. But the idea that large swathes of the reading public urgently need to be disabused of “the genius myth” is questionable. In one of several sweeping assertions written in the first-person plural, Lewis declares: “We love to contemplate lone rebels, indulge tortured artists and downplay the contributions of those around the genius to paint a more satisfying portrait of superhuman achievement.” Do we? There is an irritating circularity about such pronouncements, whereby the author projects on to the reader the very cliches that underlie her own analysis.The Genius Myth is one of those popular nonfiction books in which an author sells you the disease in order to sell you the cure. As is customary in this genre, it comes with its own bespoke jargon: Lewis has coined a term – “the deficit model of genius” – to denote the prevalence of certain handicaps or character flaws among extremely talented scientists and artists. A banal truism is thus passed off as sociological insight.Lewis strives for the easy, conversational style of a Ted Talk, but her attempt at a pally register comes off stilted and ingratiating. The prose is remarkably heavy on italicisation, which lends a rather laboured feel to the exposition – at times, Lewis sounds as if she is trying to convince herself, quite as much as the reader, that something worthwhile is being imparted.A striking feature of this book is its tone of ambient philistinism, which comes through in a number of revealing asides. Reading Lewis’s kooky capsule summary of James Joyce’s contribution to English literature (“what-if novels, but harder to read”), her high-handed dismissal of “self-conscious precocity and ambition” in film, and her unnecessarily conspiratorial admission that she found Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary,Get Back, “quite boring”, one can’t help wondering if her misgivings about genius might be a bridge for certain personal hangups about rarefied art, and the people who make it.Lewis chides Eysenck for his “airy, assured judgments”, but she’s not above emitting some wind of her own. Her contention that Picasso’s womanising provided “an aspirational ideal to lower-status men trapped in bourgeois domesticity and wage slavery”, and that Donald Trump is therefore his “analogue”, is little more than a therapeutic rant. And Lewis surely overstates her point when she says that Picasso is “revered” not in spite of his personal shortcomings, but literally “because of them”. Again, her own viewpoint is projected outwards: since it’s simply inconceivable that people could care that much about the artworks, anyone who admires Picasso must admire him primarily as a shagger, not a painter.Those credulous Musk fanboys notwithstanding, belief in innate genius – and the special prerogatives afforded to those thought to possess it – is probably less pronounced today than at any point since the 60s. We are increasingly familiar with the stories of brilliant artists who are, or were, terrible human beings, thanks to a slew of articles over recent years, as well as books such asClaire Dederer’s Monsters. With The Genius Myth, Lewis clambers on to a bandwagon that was already starting to creak when, in 2023, the Brooklyn Museum in New York hosteda widely panned exhibitiondedicated to interrogating Picasso’s misogyny. At some point, it will grind to a halt.The Genius Myth: The Dangerous Allure of Rebels, Monsters and Rule-Breakers is published by Jonathan Cape (£22).To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Spotlight editor Walter “Robby” Robinson (Michael Keaton) travels to Providence to interview a fellow Boston College high school alumnus, where he and the victim, Kevin (Anthony Paolucci), make pleasant small talk about bygone school days. When the subject turns to the school’s hockey coach, Father James Talbot, however, the tone abruptly shifts. Kevin’s face hollows, his eyes deaden, and we see his soul drain from his body. “How’d you find out?” he says in a level, diminished tone that rings with years of trauma.It is a measure of how polished every aspect Spotlight is that, in a cast boasting Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams,world’s second-best ShrekBrian d’Arcy James, and criminally underappreciated performances from Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci, it’s a few moments from Paolucci (who has 12 credits on IMDb, all for small parts like this) that shows Spotlight at its most harrowing.‘Still brings me hope’: why Submarine is my feelgood movieRead moreThat is part of what makesfeelgood moviescomforting for me: a sense of being in good hands. It’s consoling, as I give up a few hours, to know that McCarthy and writing partner Josh Singer will usher me ably and without impediment through the story. After so many rewatches, it’s like having a trusted friend lead me blindfolded through my own home.They don’t waste a single breath in retelling the real-life revelation of Boston’s culture of paedophilic abuse uncovered by Spotlight, covered up by the Catholic church, and abetted by a community that ignored the open secret thatat least 87 priests had abused hundreds of childrenin the Boston archdiocese. Family dinners, drinks with friends, even a Red Sox game all exist solely to impress upon the audience more grisly details of the scandal. All while Spotlight’s reporters reckon with their own lapsed faith, their relationship with their city, and even their own complicity in maintaining the culture of silence that allowed the abuse to continue unabated for decades.Oh yes, sounds like a mug of hot chocolate, doesn’t it?I get it – on the face of things, Spotlight hardly screams feelgood vibes. Though don’t so many of usfind horror movies an unusual comfort? There’s an argument to be made that Spotlight fits into that criterion, harking back to an older style of horror that is brooding in the background: a fear of the unknown that slowly creeps up on the viewer as it is carefully revealed. Though in this case, we see the monster everywhere we go.This is aided by, and in many ways opposite to, the way Spotlight tickles the nostalgic part of our brains. Its washed-out palette of beige chinos and khaki hatchbacks plants us firmly in 2001, before the world became … all of this. For most of its runtime, it’s even pre-9/11. It grants Spotlight a sense of being the deep breath before the plunge; the last vestiges of an innocent world before the impact of incoming horrors, both local (the scandal) and global (theghastly effects of the US’s war on terrorthat we continue to feel today).The serenity that belies the horror at Spotlight’s core, however, makes it a primo Sunday afternoon movie. Never bombastic, it’s an engaging yet relaxing antidote to the threat of the post-Sunday dinner carbohydrate pass-out. If I’m exhausted, miserable or stressed,Spotlightis always something I can watch – that I will watch – even if I can’t imagine being able to concentrate on anything else. After breakups, I watch Spotlight; when my grandmother died, Spotlight; after a horrible day at work, it’s Spotlight. Maybe it’s the film’s stillness, or the latent horror, or both. Spotlight is nothing if not accessible, at least.I only wish more films captured this stillness. They’ve tried –Boston StranglerandShe Saidimmediately come to mind – but none have matched the efficient humanity that weaves around Spotlight’s tight, organised reminder that there remains, hard though it can be to believe, a little bit of justice left in the world. But for me specifically, it’s a curious balm – especially as a journalist. When I’m feeling uninspired, beaten down by the cycle of pitching to dying outlets, defeated by my career choices, I can stick on Spotlight and feel, at least for a couple of hours, a renewed sense of purpose.Explore more on these topicsSpotlightMy feelgood movieMichael KeatonMark RuffaloRachel McAdamsDrama filmsLiev SchreiberStanley TuccifeaturesShareReuse this content"

A teenage shepherd called Mabrouk Soltani was murdered and beheaded on Mount Mghila in central Tunisia by members of Jund al-Khilafah (“soldiers of the caliphate”), the Tunisian branch of Islamic State, which habitually hides out in that remote, rugged region. They videoed their grotesque homicide, claiming the boy was an army spy and ordered his terrified 14-year-old cousin, who was with him, to carry the severed head back to his village as a brutal “message” – and this boy obeyed, in a stricken state of trauma that can only be guessed at. This horrifying event was to assume the status of national scandal in Tunisia two years later when thevictim’s elder brother was also murderedby IS in the same place and on the same pretext. (Four jihadis were convicted in 2019 and another 45 in absentia.)Achour’s film centres on the first event, while anticipating the second. Achraf (Ali Helali) goes up the mountain with his older cousin Nizar (Yassine Samouni), who brings his goats there because it is the only place with water for the herd to drink – and because it is beautiful. The nightmarish attack ensues and the village goes into deep shock; the head is kept in a refrigerator and despite the obvious danger of another attack, Nizar’s brother grimly resolves to lead a party of volunteers, including Achraf, back up into the mountain to recover the rest of the body so Nizar can be given a proper burial. All the while the heartless and prurient press gather at his home.The tone seems to be balanced between tragic and macabre, and at first it seems as if Achraf will carry the head in the bag back into his community and, in a state of profound shock, might even go into a state of denial about what has happened. That isn’t the case – or not exactly. Once the awful truth is disclosed, he has to talk to the girl with whom poor Nizar was hopelessly and unrequitedly in love, and this trauma brings her together with Achraf. He also has hallucinatory encounters and conversations with Nizar, which I think don’t entirely work and bring the film close to a kind of emollient fantasy dimension. However the movie is well acted, and honestly attempts to encompass the unbearable grief suffered by the family, although the bizarre element of mystery and the hateful political malice of IS, particularly with the second murder, can’t really be represented.Red Path is in cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsTunisiaIslamic StateAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Sounds a lot like Die Hard, right? Yippee ki-yay, knock-off merchants. Jon Foo plays a down-to-earth ex-special forces soldier whose day watching cartoons on the sofa is ruined when the villainous Cooper (Clayton Norcross) marches his goons into a downtown bank and rounds everyone up, including Michael’s incredibly annoying wife and child. (In fact they are so irritating that you may find yourself wondering uncharitably if Michael shouldn’t just let the baddies get on with their day in peace.) Cue a man on a mission movie with a couple of twists but very few actual surprises up its sleeve.The acting and script is, to put it kindly, uneven. The problem with ripping off Die Hard is that it’s not that easy: the underlying formula may be simple, but if you cut all of the action scenes out of Die Hard, you would still have an entertaining film. If you cut out all the action scenes from Last Resort, you would have an unholy mess. Moreover, the dialogue feels Trumpian, in the sense that it feels as if they are making it up as they go along. (Here’s a verbatim quote from the shouty lead villain: “Your daddy murders people! He kills them in cold blood! He cuts their feet! He cuts their hands! He tortures them! Oh no, he’s not so nice. He’s bad! He’s very, very bad! He’s bad!”)If you’re looking for something to scratch a Die Hard itch, that is certainly what Last Resort is trying to do, but there are many superior Die Hard rip-offs available – or you could just watch Die Hard.Last Resort is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Centring on a group of drag performers and gender-nonconforming artists in Athens, this shape-shifting film celebrates a vibrant underground scene that thrives in a homophobic system, rife with state-sanctioned discrimination and violence. Introduced through an episodic structure, figures from the community light up the screen with their artistry and activism as they carve out a safe haven of their own.In each of the vignettes, we get a glimpse of both the joy and the peril of navigating the city as a queer person. Decked out in extravagant costumes and makeup inspired by Leigh Bowery, Kangela Tromokratisch struts in towering high heels, while her drag performances, with their vaudevillian feel, parody heteronormative ideals of motherhood and marriage. Equally irreverent is Aurora Paola Morado, who weaves her Albanian heritage into her act as she takes aim at xenophobia in Greek society. For them and other artists featured in the film, drag is both a form of self-expression and a tool of protest.Some of the skits and performance pieces are shot on DV camera, a format that lends a fascinatingly grainy texture to the footage and also suggests a lineage between these contemporary artists and those who came before. Most powerfully, Avant-Drag! largely films its subjects on the streets, conveying the courage as well as the subversiveness of existing in drag in public spaces. Their presence is a political statement, just like slogans of protests graffitied on the city walls. The spectre of trauma might still linger – the film is dedicated to Zackie Oh, a Greek queer artistbrutally murdered in broad daylightin 2018 – yet the solidarity among this band of outsiders also imbues the city with the beautiful spirit of liberation.Avant-Drag! is on True Story from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDragLGBTQ+ rightsGreecereviewsShareReuse this content"

The film nominally tries to documentMondongo’s 2021 Baptistery of Colours project, in which the artists catalogued the chromatic spectrum with plasticine blocks inside a dodecahedron chapel. But it quickly snowballs into Llinás’s own scattershot inquiry into colour and portraiture, a tone poem that ceaselessly interrogates its own tones, a crisis of faith about representation, and – as he falls out with artists Juliana Laffitte and Manuel Mendanha – a droll depiction of a director’s nervous breakdown.As Laffitte lets fly at him at one point, Llinás can never resist the urge to interrupt with his latest brainwave. By quoting one critic referencinghis previous 13-hour portmanteau from 2018, the director pre-empts any criticism of the almost five-hour work in front of us: “You get the feeling he doesn’t know what to do next, and the solution he’s found is to autodestruct.” But this impish postmodernism quickly darkens in the Triptych’s first part, titled El Equilibrista (The Tightrope Walker); soundtracking Mondongo’s colour classification to bursts of music from Psycho and Vertigo, he seems disturbed by their quest to break down art into its constituent elements. This strand alternates with another in which an art historian attempts to document Mondongo’s process; both are constantly intercut with excerpts of Llinás’s documentary script, him revealing the canvas on which he is daubing his own strokes.Llinás redeems this lugubrious introduction in the second part, Retrato de Mondongo (Portrait of Mondongo), which begins with him pitching the film to Laffitte and Mendanha as a duel about their respective ideas of colour. His extends the emotional pitch to the elements from which film is constructed, like the stabs of Bernard Herrmann, or his own incorrigible addiction to metatextuality.But as he digs himself in deeper – redramatising his arguments with Mondongo, inflicting on us the writing of a long prose poem about his aesthetics – something breaks. Laffitte dresses him down about his egoism, saying it amounts to a form of “evil”. He sheds a solitary tear. Lost in midlife “tempest” about how to best represent reality, he admits nostalgia for “feverish nights” with Mondongo in the early 2000s, when he shared their sense of purpose. (Their portraits in plasticine, wood and other materials are indeed very beautiful.) It turns out the arch-maximalist pines for the simplicity ofla bohème.View image in fullscreenDeconstruction … from The Triptych of Mondongo Part 1: The Tightrope WalkerPhotograph: Publicity imageAlas, this Argentinian size queen can’t just leave it there. He has to give us part three, Kunst der Farbe (named for the 1961 manual on colour by Johannes Itten that inspired Mondongo’s project). Adding the proviso that it is his unfinished contribution to the duel, he’s right about it being a failure. Broken down into eight colour-coded subsections with pretentious titles such as Green or the Conclave of the Ancient Plant Bishops, most are pedantic montages with little insight into the hue in question. Llinás hams it up as a monocled Fritz Lang majordomo overseeing the farrago but this adds little; only traditional documentary-style commentary from his colourist offers any worthwhile perspective.If nothing else, the third part serves as a reminder that form can never divest itself entirely of content. Jokey deconstruction of directorial megalomania though it may be, The Triptych of Mondongo is compelling only when Llinás gets candid about his insecurities. But the buffoonery does have the odd moment: his cameraman Agustín – the Sancho Panza to this rainbow-dazzled Quixote – repeatedly screaming “I representedArgentinawell!” as their hound barks along sums up this art-theory dog’s dinner.The Triptych of Mondongo is at theICA, London, from 19 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsArgentinaArtAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stereophonic’s set designer David Zinn has rendered one meticulously, from the complex console and shabby furnishings of the mixing suite to the fully functioning recording booth it gazes upstage into. As the play’s fictional band gathers behind the glass, the dramatic possibilities of their pressurised containment are immediate.David Adjmi’s music-infused drama – songs by Will Butler of Arcade Fire – arrives from Broadway trailing a record number of Tony nominations for a play, and a now-settled lawsuit. Fleetwood Mac’s erstwhile engineer felt the story too closely resembled the making of their best-known album. Rumours? Echoes, certainly. If you know the names Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, chances are you’re going to read them in Peter, the band’s controlling genius, and Diana, whose need for independence grows with her rising star.View image in fullscreenTinkering and longueurs … Jack Riddiford, Nia Towle and Lucy Karczewski in Stereophonic.Photograph: Marc BrennerTheir fellow bandmates are also under strain. Bass player Reg is feeding his addictions from a kilo-bag of cocaine: as the band approaches its chart-topping breakthrough, he’s on course for a breakdown. Zachary Hart’s physical performance vibrates with tragicomic energy while Nia Towle, as his wife, Holly, absorbs the consequences (“It’s a torture to need people”). Even Chris Stack’s peace-making Simon is rendered hysterical by an infuriating buzz from his drums.‘None of this should have worked’: David Adjmi on how Led Zeppelin sparked Broadway smash StereophonicRead moreDirector Daniel Aukin’s production is as exacting and truthful as the script itself. Sounds and voices overlap as mic channels are opened and closed; silences are underscored with boredom and exhaustion. In between the kit-tinkering and longueurs are moments of creative transcendence, including a late-night epiphany so electrifying that the sound waves will excite your internal organs. The cast, playing their own instruments, convince as an ensemble of longstanding and Lucy Karczewski, as Diana, has a voice that captivates even when it is exposed and cracking in a tense overdubbing session.Behind the mixing desk, Eli Gelb and Andrew Butler reprise their Broadway roles as inexperienced-but-ambitious engineer Grover and his oblivious sidekick Charlie. Grover may begin as a comic foil, desperate to avoid the whirlpool of angst, but like every character (including Jack Riddiford’s infuriating Peter) he is empathically realised across the band’s year-long odyssey. At more than three hours, the run time can feel as indulgent as one of Pink Floyd’s longer tracks – but this is an extraordinary allegory for artistic perfectionism and the destruction it leaves in its wake.At theDuke of York’s theatre, Londonuntil 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the acclaimed author’s new play they have central roles, in a remote Sligo setting where they are sleeping rough in eerie caves on the outskirts of a town. Homeless and unwelcome in the area, these two have hit middle age and are lost, in ways they can’t acknowledge.Frustrated with each other, yet unable to separate or to leave, even when threatened with arrest, the brothers’ mutually dependent predicament has echoes of Beckett and Enda Walsh. Martin McDonagh’s The Lonesome West hovers in the background too – although Barry’s take on rural dysfunction contains less violence and a lot more depression.View image in fullscreenSearching for a signal … Tommy Tiernan.Photograph: Ros KavanaghHere the pair’s escapism comes in online form, through the stolen smartphones and laptops that are scattered around designer Joanna Parker’s imposingly abstract, almost lunar landscape setting. As they grapple with parts of a broken-down van, tyres, ladders and junk, they desperately attempt to get an internet connection to check the latest updates from a Mexican actress with whom Bopper is obsessed to the point of losing grip on reality.In Caitríona McLaughlin’s production, the brothers’ comic double-act is given full rein, with Monaghan bringing knockabout physical energy to the anguished Bopper, while Tiernan’s background in standup comedy allows Archie to be a more deadpan foil. Stretched over 13 scenes, each announced with a surtitle – “Scene 10, The Descent of Man” – the play at times seems like a series of gags, sketches and one-liners, treating the pair’s physical and mental deterioration with a familiar black humour that lacks some emotional underpinning.The local garda sergeant, Helen, whose connection to the pair is not immediately revealed, is an underwritten role, with which Judith Roddy does her wry best. It takes an explanatory epilogue from Helen to fill in some of the gaps. Her police statement adds a layer of reflective poignancy that earlier came only in snatches, as when Archie wonders about their cave-dwelling ancestors and they briefly contemplate “the purpose of the brothers McRae”.AtAbbey theatre, Dublin, until 18 July; then atTown Hall theatre, Galway, 22-26 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreAbbey theatreKevin BarryIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

In almost every apartment, a television set shows images of crowds at a rally, cheering a vast Russian flag emblazoned with the Z pro-war symbol.Meanwhile, police bang on the doors looking for dissidents, while another big screen on the stage shows very different images, evocative and melancholic photographs of provincial Russia. As the lights go down at the end of the performance, the final image is of a van in a lonely parking lot, a coffin loaded into the back.This contrast between the Russia portrayed on Kremlin-run TV channels and the real Russia is at the heart of a new production of Modest Mussorgsky’s opera Boris Godunov, staged byone of the country’s most feted film and theatre directors, Kirill Serebrennikov. It premiered this week in Amsterdam and draws on many of the exiled director’s own experiences in Russia.Serebrennikov pulls the action of Mussorgsky’s brooding opera, which follows the reign and death of an ill-fated 17th-century Russian tsar, firmly into the present day. There are multiple implicit and explicit references to Vladimir Putin’s regime and the war in Ukraine.In an interview, Serebrennikov said he had been working on his concept for the staging for more than five years, but had to radically rethink it after the full-scale invasion. “This is a story not just about tsars but about the people, and a lot has changed for the Russian people in the past five years,” he said.View image in fullscreenSerebrennikov’snarodare the residents of an on-stage apartment block.Photograph: Dutch National Opera/Marco BorggreveThe Russian people – thenarod, in Russian–are given powerful choral music by Mussorgsky, and alternate between lamenting their lot and erupting in fury. Serebrennikov said he wanted to show that thenarod, in the end, was made up of individuals and explore what responsibility they had for their situation.“In Boris Godunov, thenarodis usually portrayed as a mass, all standing in a line, a background for the tsar. And I wanted to see these people, see every individual in the crowd, whether they are old or young, healthy or sick. This crowd is made up of individual personalities, though of course, when they gather together or when there is a time of war they can quickly turn into an aggressive mass,” he said.Serebrennikov’snarodare the residents of his on-stage apartment block. As the action unfolds, they get on with their lives: drinking, having sex, arguing, celebrating. Men sign up for the army, women mourn the loss of their relatives who have gone to fight. All the time, the television flickers in the background, imparting its propaganda.In this production, the first aria of Tsar Boris is a televised New Year’s Eve broadcast from the Kremlin, stage-managed by aides and then beamed into every apartment. Mussorgsky’s scenes in which the rapacious Polish nobility plans to conquer Russia is also reimagined, as a primetime show called The Conspiracy, filmed complete with US flags and shown in the homes depicted onstage to frighten them into believing a western plot against them.The only apartment not to have a television is the one belonging to the Holy Fool, a fleeting but important character in the opera, who laments the state of Russia and speaks truth to the tsar. Serebrennikov reimagines the fool as a modern-day dissident, and also gives the character a series of spoken monologues not in the original opera, selected and edited from the courtroom speeches of Soviet-era and modern-day Russian dissidents.View image in fullscreenSerebrennikov reimagines the fool character of Mussorgsky’s opera as a modern-day dissident.Photograph: borggreve/Dutch National Opera/Marco Borggreve“Boris – this is my country, I don’t want to leave,” says the fool at one point, a dilemma experienced by many recent émigrés from Russia. “Many people have left, they have every right. But I ask myself, why am I the one who has to leave, and not you?”The evocative images of the “real” Russia shown onstage come from the photographer Dmitry Markov. Serebrennikov, who was a friend, described him as “a phenomenal artist who shot Russia like nobody else did”. He commissioned Markov to shoot some scenes especially for the opera, butthe photographer died last year, at the age of 41, before he was able to take the images, and Serebrennikov has devoted the production to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These contradictions came to a head in 2017, when he was accused of fraud and put under house arrest. His production of a ballet charting the life of the dancer Rudolf Nureyev was the hottest ticket of the season at the Bolshoi theatre.But when it opened in late 2017, with much of the Kremlin elite in attendance, the director was still under house arrest.View image in fullscreenScenes in which the rapacious Polish nobility plans to conquer Russia is reimagined as a primetime show called The Conspiracy.Photograph: borggreve/Dutch National Opera/Marco BorggreveSince the invasion, these strange ambiguities have been ruthlessly ironed out of the Russian arts scene. Serebrennikov’s beloved theatre space, the Gogol Centre, was closed down, and many directors and actors have left Russia, unable to work in the new climate of rigid ideological orthodoxy.Serebrennikovhas called the war“a tragedy for Ukraine and a suicide for modern, open Russia”. He said with his Boris Godunov staging he wanted to explore the affects on Russian society of the brutal war.“We see that the external aggression against another country also has an unexpected vector inside the country, people attacking each other. This is about physical violence and emotional violence, everything from domestic abuse to crime and murders. It’s about self-destruction, and that is what I wanted to make this opera about: how a thoughtless and senseless existence in the environment created by the authorities can lead to self-destruction,” he said.It is a bleak vision, and Serebrennikov does not leave much room for hope, either in the opera’s grim finale or in his own thoughts about the future of Russia.“Some people like to live with illusions, to live in hope. To say: ‘Everything will turn out OK.’ I don’t really understand this idea of hope and I don’t like to play these games. Why will everything turn out OK? Where is the evidence for this view? I believe in taking conscious, thought-through decisions, in trying to grasp and understand the reality as it is,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaOperaVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeNetherlandsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Parisian artist and DJ, who is the inaugural artist of Tate’s Infinities Commission, explains whyStuart JeffriesMon 16 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘When I was a girl at high school,” says Christelle Oyiri, “we didn’t talk about plastic surgery. Now it’s normal for 18-year-olds to talk about what kind of lip-fillers they’re going to have. Something extraordinary has happened over the past 10 years.”What has changed? It’s not simply about keeping up with the Kardashians, though Oyiri recognises that the reality TV sisters have revolutionised the desires of some. “Kim Kardashian,” she says, “made it fashionable for women to want to look like how I and other black women look naturally because of genetics.”The bigger picture for Oyiri is something of primary concern to any visual artist: the power of the gaze. “We are seeing ourselves and being seen more than ever. That is what digital culture does. The gaze is omnipresent. Not just the gaze of others, but also the internalised gaze.”Oyiri, who is talking to me from her Paris studio via video call, says she often thinks about her mother and grandmother. “At my age, they weren’t seeing themselves as much as I see myself. Today, how could you not be body dysmorphic?”The 33-year-old Parisian artist and DJ explores these vexed concerns in a multimedia installation entitled In a Perpetual Remix Where Is My Own Song? She made this for the new Infinities Commission at The Tanks in London’sTate Modern. In the gallery’s basement, Oyiri’s bronze sculptures have been mounted on sound systems, each one representing the artist in a different guise.View image in fullscreenA different guise … another of Oyiri’s sculptures.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOne sculpture is called Raw, depicting Oyiri naked but modestly clutching her breasts. A second, called Surgery, depicts her with legs toned, abs sculpted, hands on hips, pose defiant, as if a physical makeover has given her a confidence boost. A third, called Mutant, shows Oyiri still naked but with little horns peeping from her forehead. This upgraded Oyiri comes with cloven hooves, a monstrous tail spooling from her coccyx and a diabolical gaze. It’s as if she’s refashioned herself as an avatar for some Tolkienesque video game. In a fourth, called Data Liquid, Oyiri’s head is apparently in the process of being dematerialised by some toxic wind. An allegory, perhaps, for how our human essences risk being destroyed to feed machine-learning AIs.“My art is inquiry-driven,” Oyiri explains. “I didn’t want to have surgical procedures, but to inquire what happens to us when we stage and correct our images.”My goal was to sculpt my body to reinvent the selfIn a sense, what Oyiri is doing in her art is not new. When she was born, in the Parisian suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1992, a few miles across the French capital a feminist artist called Orlan was undergoing a series of cosmetic operations because she believed surgically changing her body could be a powerful work of art. “My goal was to be different, strong – to sculpt my own body to reinvent the self,”Orlan told me when I interviewed her for the Guardian in 2009.So, from 1990 to 1995, the woman born Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte underwent nine plastic surgery operations, intending to rewrite western art on her own body. One operation altered her mouth to imitate that ofFrançois Boucher’s Europa, another altered her chin to look like that ofBotticelli’s Venusand a third involved two little implants – usually used to enhance cheekbones – on either side of her forehead like little horns. Perhaps the horns Oyiri sports in Mutant are little nod to Orlan, whose work she admires. That said, Oyiri’s art hardly sees cosmetic surgery as liberatory, as Orlan seems to have done.One gets a sense of what is at stake for Oyiri with another element of her installation. Behind the speaker stacks that pulsate with electronic music (including Squarepusher’s 8-bit computer classic from 1997 Journey to Reedham) is a vast video backdrop including footage from black strip clubs filmed in the American south. What interested Oyiri about these clubs is that they are both places of seeming self-realisation but are also places where, as Oyiri sums it up: “How women make a living depends on male gaze and satisfying the male gaze.”She adds: “We always change ourselves under the gaze of the other.” That’s to say societal norms and other people’s desires are always at play when we perfect our digital selves with Instagram filters or submit ourselves to Brazilian butt lifts.Oyiri’s Tate Modern installation has come about because she won the inaugural Infinities Commission, designed to “showcase the limitless experimentation of contemporary art”. One reason why she’s such a worthy recipient is that she is from what could be called the margins. “Where I came from, being an artist as I am now was not a thing,” she says. Of Ivorian and Guadeloupean heritage, her creative heroes were musicians, not artists. She looked up to black divas like Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Lil Kim and Nicki Minaj. “They’re the women I wanted to emulate. They’re my icons.”View image in fullscreenAnother digital self … Oyiri’s work at Tate Modern.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHer mum was a nurse at a private hospital, while her dad – “one of those three jobs dudes” she says – worked as a guard at Parisian museums. “I used to explore the collections with him.

Oyiri makesan interesting point in her Tate Modern installation: it’s not just musicians who quote, sample, remix and appropriate – that’s pretty much what happens when we undergo cosmetic surgery or create digital personae.In her late teens Oyiri started DJ-ing under the name Crystallmess. But for the influence of a now defunct New York-based collective and magazine DIS, she might have remained a turntablist rather than what she has become – a multidisciplinary artist working in film, sculpture, music and writing. “There were certain themes I found difficult to explore in music such as colonialism, consumerism and body images that I saw other artists and writers in the DIS collective working on,” she says. “What I learned from these guys is that you don’t have to choose between being a DJ or a visual artist. They created the cross-disciplinary and commercial community I benefit from. You can be multidisciplinary and have it all.”In only a few years, Oyiri has created a dizzying array of installations and multisensory artworks, exhibiting in Europe and the US. For her 2023 solo show in Zurich, she explored her Caribbean heritage with an installation called Venom Voyage, in which the office of a faux travel agency was built. It boasted the chilling business slogan “spreading the travelling bug since 1972” and had its walls emblazoned with paradisiacal images of Caribbean heritage.Venom Voyage showed Oyiri fulfilling her childhood dream of becoming an archaeologist in a way she might not have imagined. She dug into the Caribbean’s paradisal glamour to unearth what lies beneath. “I used to go on holiday as a kid to Guadeloupe and I loved it there,” she recalls. “What I wanted to explore was how our images of paradise conceal the opposite. If you ask someone from the UK or France or Spain, all of which are former imperial nations, what paradise looks like they will say some Caribbean island, right? But I wanted to draw attention to the opposite – beneath this paradise is really crazy wealth disparity. And it’s not really paradise: in Guadeloupe pesticides used in farming cause cancer. Paradise and poison are right next to each other.”View image in fullscreenMultidisciplinary … Oyiri in DJ mode.Photograph: Pierrick Rocher/BFA.com/ShutterstockI ask Oyiri what it’s like to be a black woman of Caribbean ancestry exhibiting at Tate Modern. After all, it was Caribbean sugar that made this temple to art possible – and you don’t have to look too far into the history of sugar to find enslaved people working in plantations. True, neither Tate nor Lyle were slave owners, but as theTate’s own website puts it, both were connected to slavery in “less direct but fundamental ways”.“It is very strange for me,” Oyiri replies. “I have been made aware. Throughout my life, I have had to kind of reverse-engineer all this history.” She mentions Kara Walker – the great African American artist, whose work similarly explores colonialism, race and identity – as one of the people who helped her reverse-engineer herself. Walker’s monumental 2014 sculpture A Subtlety or the Marvellous Sugar Baby, which depicted a white sphinx with an African woman’s features, was displayed at a derelict Brooklyn sugar refinery, in homage to “the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant”. Four years later Walker’s 13-metre tall working fountain Fons Americanus was installed in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall looking like, as Bidisha put it in her Guardian review, “a monumental rebuke to the evils of empire”.How do you follow that? “I don’t! I don’t dream of competing with what Kara Walker did!” Oyiri laughs. “But whatever I do is kind of inspired by the conversations she created. I started to look at the Caribbean in a different way. What was paradise becomes something very different indeed. You just have to look in a different way.”In a Perpetual Remix Where Is My Own Song? opens at Tate Modern, London, on 17 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designTate ModernArtInstallationSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a unique swath of south Norfolk and north Suffolk dominated by sandy heathland. It has an unusually dry climate more typical of central Europe and is notable for its rare plants and birds. Once an area dominated by inland sand dunes and commercial rabbit warrens, since the 20th century it’s been planted with the pines and conifers of Thetford forest. These woods offer a wealth of walks but there is also the vast Stanta army training area, 30,000 acres in size, where people cannot go – and other species thrive.We savour a long evening swim to the soundtrack of cuckoos, reed warblers and even a booming bitternBreckland is a stronghold for charismatic endangered birds such as the goggle-eyed stone-curlew, dashing forest-dwelling goshawks and enigmatic, nocturnal nightjars. It’s home to ultra-rare and fantastically named plants and invertebrates, from theprostrate perennial knawelto thewormwood moonshiner beetle. It has every conservation designation going and would undoubtedly be a national park if so much of it hadn’t been commandeered by the military.This land is usually overlooked by visitors whizzing through en route to the Norfolk coast or Norwich. It’s perhaps not helped by an absence of pretty towns and fancy restaurants (although well-heeled Bury St Edmunds on its southern edge boasts the Michelin-starredPea Porridge).

Since relocating from London in 2016, owners Henry and Anna Sands have been restoring the river, encouraging natural wiggles and bringing back the natural clarity of the water as it races over shingle, providing homes for dashing inhabitants including wild trout and kingfishers.It’s possible to swim in the river but there’s also a jetty for easy access into a large Wissey-fed pond enveloped by rushes and willows. We savour a long evening swim to the soundtrack of cuckoos and reed warblers and – to my amazement – even a booming bittern. The water is sweet and fresh, and I feel as if we could be in Scandinavia, especially when we warm ourselves in our private woodfired hot tub as the first stars emerge. I’m hoping for a strange drone or red flare from the military training area, but all is quiet.View image in fullscreenGuests are given the run of the grounds and gardens at Bodney Park Cottage.Photograph: Miles WillisI rise early for a 5.45am swim and just miss an otter – Henry Sands, who is up even earlier, spots it – and there’s just enough time for a morning hot tub before we head to nearbyGrime’s Graves, the largest known and best excavated flint mine in the country. Here, 4,500 years ago, late Neolithic people dug up to 1,000 mines up to 13 metres below ground and used antler picks to extract flints embedded in the chalk. The flint was particularly high quality and exported across the country, making specialist tools and weapons. The site is a large grassy clearing filled with the strange lumps and pits that are old, long-filled-in mineshafts. The air is filled with the song of dozens of skylarks.The English Heritage visitor centre is pleasingly low-key – and quiet, naturally – with “please touch” signs so we can feel the weight of flints and the sharp edges of knapped stone. My kids enjoy brandishing replica axes before we move to the real highlight: descending into a nine-metre mineshaft excavated by archeologists in 1914. They found the remains of antler picks, pottery, animal bones and neolithic bats – andDaubenton’s batsstill roost in the excavated shafts where it is a constant 8C.View image in fullscreenGrimes Graves, the largest known and best excavated flint mine complex in the country.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership /Alamy“It smells nice down here,” says my son Ted as we descend the steel staircase. The scent is cool, damp stone. At the bottom, we can crawl on the chalk a short way into some of the horizontal excavations. It’s a vivid experience, a portal into another time.Dark holes is a theme of our day because we next head toOxburgh Hall, a stately home that has a priest’s hole which I remember from childhood was a thrilling portal into Tudor terror. On our way, we drop in onFoulden Common, one of a plethora of tranquil but rare wildlife-packed nature reserves includingWeeting HeathandLakenheath Fen. Thetford forest boasts several good country parks and there’s a multitude of cycle rides, swims (the Little Ouse is another gorgeous small river) and walks, including the long-distancePeddars Wayon the old Roman road leading from Thetford to the north-west Norfolk coast.Breckland has a dry climate more typical of central Europe and is notable for its rare plants and birdsOxburgh is a red-brick Tudor palace surrounded by a fine moat which must be one of the most picturesque National Trust properties. The hall was built by Sir Edmund Bedingfeld around 1476 and the 10th baronet still lives in a wing of the house. The rest of his ancestral home is open to the public, and the rooms are filled with vast oil portraits, ornate furniture, ancient books and even leather wallpaper, which was amusingly purchased secondhand from Spain by thrifty Victorian aristocrats.The priest’s hole was built up a tiny staircase, below a brick-topped iron hatch, so the Bedingfield family’s Catholic priest could be safely concealed during the persecution of the Catholics that saw the family fall from favour when they refused to renounce their faith. It is not known how much action the hole saw, but this tiny claustrophobic stone cell may have saved the life of a priest or three.Unfortunately, after a visitor became stuck in the hole (it’s oddly much harder to get out than in) we’re no longer allowed inside, and have to make do with peering down the hatch and watching a video of a stressed (actor) priest fretting inside.View image in fullscreenA northern pool frog is released into ancient pingos at Norfolk Wildlife Trust.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAfter a late lunch at theBedingfeld Arms, with swifts screaming as they circle the 1783 pub, I take an evening excursion to another unique nature reserve:Thompson Common. The map reveals this to be another place of strange indentations in the land: a profusion of nearly 500 pingos, small ponds formed when subterranean mounds of ice thawed and the soil slumped down at the end of the last ice age. It’s a bewitchingly unusual place, home to rare dragonflies and the very rarepool frog, which became extinct in the 1990s but has been successfully reintroduced from Sweden. The males can be heard “singing” in late spring, via a pair of white inflatable sacs like airbags either side of their head.There’s an eight-mile circularpingo walking trailfor a full day out but I took a shorter potter through the reserve. The frogs are doing well thanks to restoration work by Norfolk Wildlife Trust which has seen the excavation andrevival of a dozen “ghost” pingoes, with many ponds filled in during a century of agricultural “improvement” and intensification.I’d like to say we enjoyed a fine evening of the frog chorus but there’s nothing melodic about the groaning croak which sounds like a duck with laryngitis. They don’t call on my visit; instead I hear the bugling song of a crane from somewhere in the undergrowth. It’s another notable experience in this fascinating land, which is much the finer for its all-enveloping strangeness.Accommodation was provided byBodney Hall Farm,which has a cottage (sleeps 4) from£300a night and lodge (sleeps 12).Grimes Graves(English Heritage)is open daily10am-5pm(family up to five from £20.70).Oxburgh Hall(National Trust)open10.30am–3pm;gardens 9.30am–5pm(family up to fivefrom £32.50).Foulden Common and Thompson Common (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) are free to enterExplore more on these topicsNorfolk holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysSuffolk holidaysWildlifeHeritageBirdsCycling holidaysShareReuse this content"

This one is easily my favourite so far: the cloves lend a wonderful smokiness, and if you can pop the chicken in the marinade in the morning, it will have taken on an amazing depth of flavour by the evening. This would work just as well on a barbecue – just scale up the amount of chicken and the marinade ingredients as needed.Tandoori chicken skewers with coriander chutneyYou will need four large metal or bamboo skewers (if using the latter, soak them in water for half an hour first). Serve with flatbreads or naan, and shredded lettuce, if you wish.Prep15 minMarinate1 hrCook10 minServes2275gchicken breast chunks, or 2 chicken breasts cut into 2½cmcubesFlatbreads or naan, to serve (optional)Shredded lettuce, to serve (optional)For the marinade2garlic cloves, peeled and grated2½cm piece fresh ginger,peeled and gratedJuice and finely grated zest of½ lemon1 generoustsp ground cumin½tsp ground turmeric1 generoustsp smoked paprika¼tsp ground cloves1tsp chilli flakes1tsp flaky sea salt40g greek yoghurt1tbsp neutral or olive oilFor the coriander chutney30g coriander, leaves and stalks10g mint leaves1 large green chilli, stalk discarded, seeds and pith removed if you want less heat25ml neutral or olive oilJuice of½ lime1tsp flaky sea salt50g yoghurtMix all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces, mix well to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.Meanwhile, blitz all the ingredients for the chutney except the yoghurt in a food processor, until roughly chopped. Add the yoghurt and quickly blitz again to a smooth sauce. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, and set aside.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app, scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.When you’re ready to cook, put a griddle pan on a high heat. Thread the chicken pieces on to four skewers, then cook on a very high heat for three minutes on each side, until cooked through. To check, cut into a piece of chicken: if need be, cook the skewers for another minute on each side. If you don’t have skewers, cook the chicken in a single layer in a searingly hot frying pan for the same amount of time, flipping the pieces over as required – this is a bit more fiddly than turning skewers, though.Leave the cooked chicken to rest for three or four minutes, then serve hot with the chutney alongside, or wrap in flatbreads with shredded lettuce, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsChickenQuick and easyFoodMeatMain courseIndian food and drinkBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"

She made superlative chicken pies, and I always think of them at this time of year. Mum would use shop-bought pastry, but here I’ve made a herby rough puff to up the summery feeling. The onion and anchovy turnovers, meanwhile, are the perfect pocket savouries to keep you going on a long walk or day out. You could always make one batch of pastry and halve the amount of both fillings, so you can have some of each.Chicken and herb piePrep15 minChill1 hr 20 minCool1 hrCook2 hr 10 minServes4-6For the herby rough puff pastry50g flat-leaf parsley,picked and finely chopped1 bunchlemon thyme,leaves stripped and finely chopped, stalks reserved for the filling300g cold unsalted butter, diced500g plain white stone-ground flourA pinch of fine saltA little milk, for brushingFor the filling1 lemon, zest finely grated, the fruit left whole1 bunch dill,leaves picked1 bunch tarragon,leaves picked1 medium-sized chicken1 small onion2garlic cloves½ tsp black peppercornsSalt and black pepper50g butter, plus extra for greasing1 bunchspring onions, trimmed and sliced3 rashersstreaky bacon, roughly chopped50g flour250g creme fraicheEgg wash or cream, for brushingFlaky sea saltTo make the pastry, combine the herbs with the butter, kneading them through until you have a brightly speckled butter, then chill for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, get on with the pie filling. Put the zested lemon and herb stalks in a large pan with the chicken, onion, garlic and peppercorns. Cover with water, bring to a simmer, then add a couple of generous pinches of salt and poach for about 45 minutes, until the chicken legs pull away easily from the body. Leave to cool in the stock for an hour.Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Retrieve the chilled butter, cut it into chunks and toss these through the seasoned flour until every chunk is well coated. Flatten the pieces of butter between your fingertips, then pour over 220g cold water and toss through the butter and flour. Squeeze the mix together with your hands, until you have a shaggy-looking lump of dough.Roll out the dough into a 30cm x 15cm rectangle, then cut it into three 5cm x 15cm strips. Stack these on top of each other, turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat the rolling and stacking once more. Chill for an hour.Now lift out the cooled chicken and strip off all the meat. Strain the stock, return it to the pan and reduce to 500ml.In a second pan, melt the butter, then fry the spring onions and bacon for three to five minutes, until the onions are soft. Sprinkle in the flour, cook until you have a thick roux, then add the reduced stock and cook for a few minutes until thickened. Stir in the creme fraiche, reserved lemon zest, herbs and chicken meat, season with salt and pepper, then leave to cool.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and lightly grease a 23cm springform tin. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry until it’s large enough to line the tin with some overhang. Use the rolled out pastry to line the tin, then spoon in all the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry until it’s large enough to cover the top of the pie. Brush the edges with a little water, then drape the pastry over the pie to enclose it. Trim the edges, then press all around with the back of a fork to seal. Use any pastry offcuts to decorate the top.Put on a lined baking tray, brush with egg wash or cream, sprinkle with flaky salt and pepper, and cut a small vent or two in the top. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until deeply golden and bubbling. Leave to cool slightly before unmoulding from the tin.Onion and anchovy turnoversView image in fullscreenAnna Higham’s onion and anchovy turnovers.Prep10 minChill1 hr 20 minCook1 hr 40 minMakesAbout 18For the herby rough puff pastry50g flat-leaf parsley,picked and finely chopped1 bunch lemon thyme,leaves stripped and finely chopped300g cold unsalted butter, diced500g plain white stone-ground flourA pinch of fine saltFor the filling75g butter6-8 tinned or jarred anchovy fillets, drained and chopped, plus 2 tsp oil from the tin or jar5 medium-large mixed onions, peeled and thinly sliced2 big pinches of saltBlack pepperTo make the pastry, combine the chopped herbs with the butter, kneading until it’s evenly speckled, then chill for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, make the filling. Melt the butter in a heavy-based pan on a medium heat, add the anchovies and two teaspoons of their oil, and cook, stirring, until the fish break down. Add the onions, salt, plenty of pepper and two tablespoons of water, and stir well. Cover and leave to cook over a medium heat for 45 minutes, until the onions are very soft.Combine the flour and salt in a bowl.

Stack the strips on top of each other, turn 90 degrees, then repeat the rolling, cutting and stacking process once more. Chill for an hour.When the onions are very soft, take off the lid and carry on cooking for about 20 minutes more, until the onions have started to deepen in colour. Take off the heat and leave to cool.Take the pastry out of the fridge and cut it in half. Firmly tap both pastry halves with the length of the rolling pin, to flatten them. Roll one piece into a large square about 3mm thick, then cut into nine even squares. Chill in the fridge while you roll and cut the other pastry half.Lay out all the pastry squares on a work surface and divide the onion filling between them. Fold each turnover into a triangle, and press the edges with the back of a fork to seal. Put on a lined baking tray, sprinkle with flaky salt and black pepper, and cut a small vent into each turnover. Bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 15-20 minutes, until golden.Anna Higham is the owner ofQuincebakery in north London.Explore more on these topicsFoodBakingPastryChickenVegetablesPieMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
