That Ukraine will help shape. That’s backed by strength to stop Putin coming back for more.“I’m working closely with other European leaders on this and I’m clear that the UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal. Working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last.”Starmer stressed that any deal had to be one that lasted, and that was why security guarantees were so crucial. But Trump suggested that keeping the peace would be “the easy part” and the difficult bit was getting the deal done.Trump stopped short of providing a firm commitment on security guarantees, but instead suggested the US having a multibillion dollar stake in Ukraine’s rare earths sector would be enough of a deterrent for Russia.Starmer plays royal card as he tiptoes around the madness of King DonaldRead more“We’ll be working there. We’ll have a lot of people working and so, in that sense, it’s very good. It’s a backstop, you could say. I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.”Asked whether returning territory seized by Russia could play a part in any peace deal for Ukraine, Trump added: “We will certainly try and get as much as we can back.”The US president appeared to disagree with Starmer’s suggestion that, without a US military backstop, Putin would invade again. “I don’t think so. I think when we have a deal, it’s going to be the deal,” he said.“I think he’ll keep his word. I’ve known him for a long time now, and I think he will. I don’t believe he’s going to violate his word. I don’t think he’ll be back when we make a deal. I think the deal is going to hold now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think we’re gonna have any reason for it. I think we’re going to have a very successful peace.”He said that the British had an “incredible military” that “don’t need much help” and could “take care of themselves” very well but added that if UK peacekeeping forces came under attack “if they need help, I’ll always be with the British”.Trump also distanced himself from his previous remarks falsely calling Zelenskyy a dictator.“Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that,”he said, before admitting that the relationship between the two men had got a “little testy” over financial support but was now on firmer ground.0:18'Did I say that?': Donald Trump denies calling Zelenskyy a dictator even though he did – videoIn a further sign of a healing relationship between the two, Trump praised Zelenskyy as “very brave” and said he got along with him “really well”.He added: “We’ve given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure, they have really fought. Somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave in that sense.”A trade deal between the UK and the US, centring on technology, is also on the cards, although British officials suggested this might require further deregulation. Trump did not rule out imposing tariffs on the UK but said he had a “warm spot” for the country, which was in a very different place” from the EU, highlighting his own investments in Scotland.He added that Starmer had tried to persuade him not to introduce tariffs as the two countries had a balanced trading relationship. “We have a very good chance of arriving at a trade deal that could be really terrific for both countries.”In the only slightly terse exchange of the Oval Office session, Starmer pushed back againstJD Vance, Trump’s vice-president, after Vance repeated some of his criticisms of a supposed lack of free speech in European countries.Asked about this, Vance talked of “infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British – of course what the British do in their own country is up to them – but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens, so that is something that we’ll talk about today at lunch.”Starmer replied immediately: “Well, we’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn’t want to reach across US citizens, and we don’t, and that’s absolutely right, but in relation to free speech in the UK I’m very proud of our history there.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpRussiaTrump administrationJD VanceVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Once upon a time visitors had to fawn over mad King George III and maintain the great pretence that everything was normal. Now it was the British prime minister’s turn to show deference to a capricious, erratic US president who might blow it all up.FirstKeir Starmer, the 58th British prime minister (does Liz Truss really count?), andDonald Trump, the 45th and 47th US president, sat side by side before the fireplace in the Oval Office. Trump stretched credulity by claiming they “get along famously”. Starmer thanked Trump for “changing the conversation” on Ukraine.Then the prime minister reached into his jacket breast pocket andproduced a letter from King Charlesand handed it over (take that, Macron!)But the theatre came unstuck as a baffled Trump asked: “Am I supposed to read it right now?” Like a schoolchild trying to impress his parents with exam results, Starmer replied: “Yes, please do!”There was a long, agonising silence as Trump studied the letter. Oddly, he wanted to make sure it was signed.“That’s quite a signature isn’t it – beautiful!”Starmer told the gathering that the letter contained an invitation for Trump’s second state visit to Britain. Trump nodded at someone as if to impress them with how important it was. Starmer gushed: “This is really special. This has never happened before.”Then, placing a hand on Trump’s right arm for effect: “This is unprecedented!”But there was still some anxiety swimming in the prime minister’s stomach. “What I haven’t got yet is your answer.”Trump responded: “The answer is yes!”Rejoice! Rejoice! Corks pop, confetti swirls and fireworks explode. Prepare to bring theTrump baby blimpout of retirement.Starmer had calculated correctly that the puff and pageantry of a state visit with King Charles was bound to appeal to a man who, when he recently wrote on social media, “LONG LIVE THE KING!”, had only himself in mind.Donald Trump’s meeting with Keir Starmer: key takeawaysRead moreOna recent episodeof the TV programme Washington Week with the Atlantic, host Jeffrey Goldberg and guests suggested other ways for the leaders of US allies to gain Trump’s respect. “Golf and flattery”, was the conclusion, although guest Peter Baker noted that nominating Trump for the Nobel peace prize also helps.So it was no surprise when, in the Oval Office, Trump talked about his golfing investments in the UK and said: “I own Turnberry, I own Aberdeen, and I own a great place called Doonbeg, in Ireland, so I have a great warm spot for your country.”Journalist Mark Austinobserved on X: “Sometimes it’s the smaller stuff. I hear on good authority that high on the list of what Donald Trump wants from the UK is for the Open Golf Championship to be staged at his Trump Turnberry course in Scotland.”Starmer and Trump is a pairing as unlikely as fire and ice, rock and scissors or cats and cucumbers. Starmer is a strait-laced lawyer who defended human rights; Trump a brash reality TV starsending undocumented immigrants to Guantánamo Bay.Starmer has a passion for Beethoven piano sonatas and Shostakovich; Trump plays DJ at his Mar-a-Lago estate with offerings such as Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds, Hello by Lionel Ritchie, Guns N’ Roses’ November Rain and James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti’s It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World.Starmer was reportedly a vegetarian for 30 years, though he recently went back to eating fish, making him a pescatarian – which might sound a bit too DEI to Trump, a cheeseburger champ who spent part of his election campaign dishing them out from McDonald’s.Perhaps it was just as well we were spared a repeat of past UK-US dalliances: Franklin Roosevelt getting a full view of Winston Churchill in the buff, later describing him as a “cherub” who was “pink and white all over”; Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher dancing at the White House; George W Bush joking about Tony Blair: “Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t believe I said that. Next question,” with a smile playing on his lips.Relief for Starmer, having been spared a debate about the dictator-ness of Zelenskyy and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. But there was a less reassuring answer when Trump was asked whether the US would ride to the rescue of future British peacekeepers in Ukraine.“I’ve always thought about the British, they don’t need much help,” said Trump, as a bust of Churchill looked on. “They can take care of themselves very well, you know what? No, it sounds like it’s evasive, but it’s not evasive, you know, the British have been incredible soldiers, incredible military. And they can take care of themselves, but if they need help, I’ll always be with the British, OK, I’ll always be with them. But they don’t need help. You look at their career.”He turned to Starmer, awkwardly grabbed his hand and asked, “You have done very well over the years, haven’t you?”, speaking the language of one imperialist nation to another.Starmer launched into damage control mode: “I’m very proud of our country but we’ve also always been backing each other up between our two countries. That is why this is the greatest alliance for prosperity and security I think the world has ever seen. Whenever necessary, we’ve absolutely backed each other up.”But what Trump said next was even more alarming: “Could you take on Russia by yourselves?”“Well,” said Starmer, with a nervous laugh, looking tense with hands folded on knee. He might be able to breeze through the prime minister’s questions in Westminster, but Trump had left him lost for words. And Putin, no doubt watching from afar, must have been licking his lips.After lunch, the men held a joint press preference in front of hundreds of journalists in the east room. Starmer laid it on thick by remarking on seeing Churchill’s bust back in the Oval Office, Britain and the US’s alliance in the second world war and that invitation from the king.“An unprecedented second state visit,” he said, channeling Trumpian grandiloquence. “This has never happened before. It’s so incredible, it will be historic.”It worked. Trump, after all, is so obvious, so readable, so susceptible to flattery. He rejoined: “What a beautiful accent. I would have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent.”Millions of Americans recoiled at the thought of King Donald andthattimeline. But the inner Starmer did a little dance of delight.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchKeir StarmerUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador the US, has called this one of the “most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war”.Can the “special relationship” between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of “America first”? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises toraise defense spendingand negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?The US president is notoriously mercurial. His decisions are said to be influenced by the last person with whom he spoke. On Thursday, that person will be Starmer, who comes to the White House on the heels of France’sEmmanuel Macronto try his best to argue Europe’s case to the new US president.Here are six takeaways as Thursday’s meeting at the White House gets under way.1.A charm offensive with an invitation from King CharlesTrump greeted Starmer amicably as the UK prime minister arrived at the White House, where the US president said that the two got along “famously” and called the US-UK relationship “tremendous”.In an opening gambit, Starmer produceda letter from King Charles inviting Trump to visit the UK. “It’s an invitation for a second state visit. This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented,” Starmer said. Trump mused of Charles: “He’s a really great gentleman.”In his opening remarks, Starmer thanked Trump for making peace possible in Ukraine in a sign that the prime minister will limit his criticism of Trump’s sharp diplomatic turn away from Europe and the previous administration’s support for Ukraine.“Thank you for changing the conversation to bring about the possibility that now we can have a peace deal,” Starmer said. “And we want to work with you to make sure that peace deal is enduring, that it lasts, that it’s a deal that goes down to, historic deal that nobody reaches. And we’ll work with you to make sure that that absolutely happens.”2.Did Starmer manage to shift Trump on Ukraine?Trump’s remarks following the meeting indicated that his views may have shifted ever-so-slightly on Ukraine following the meeting with Starmer. He did not repeat his statement that Zelenskyy was a “dictator”, said that he respected the Ukrainian leader, and added that Ukrainians had “fought very bravely ... somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave”.0:18'Did I say that?': Donald Trump denies calling Zelenskyy a dictator even though he did – videoTrump also appeared to be shifting in his opening remarks when he said that his plan to sign a rare earth minerals deal with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday is “really going to get us into that country”. He indicated that the presence of American workers in Ukraine would provide a security guarantee for Ukraine because “we’ll be working there”.“We’ll have a lot of people working and so in that sense, it’s very good,” he said. “It’s a backstop. You could say, I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.”That is not the kind of security guarantee that Ukrainian, French or British officials have envisioned as backing European peacekeepers in the country in the event that a ceasefire deal is reached. But it is the closest that Trump has come to saying that the US would engage in Ukraine’s security and provide a deterrent threat against Russia restarting the war if a ceasefire were signed.3.Good signs for Starmer on tariffs and the Chagos IslandsThere were positive signs for Starmer that Trump would not slap harsh tariffs on trade with the UK, as Trump praised his lobbying and said Starmer “earned whatever the hell they pay him over there”.“I think there’s a very good chance that, in the case of these two great friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn’t be necessary,” Trump said. “We’ll see.”Trump also offered Starmer an early win by saying that he would likely support a plan for the UK to cede control over the strategic Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius but then lease them back to maintain control over a strategic airbase used by the US and the UK.The proposal to cede control over the archipelago had been mired in uncertainty after a general election led to a change of government in Mauritius and Starmer faced criticism at home for the deal to cede control over the series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony. On the eve of the summit, David Lammy admitted that Trump had an effective veto over the deal, saying: “If President Trump doesn’t like the deal, the deal will not go forward.”“We’re going to have some discussions about that very soon, and I have a feeling it’s going to work out very well,” said Trump. “They’re talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years. Actually, that’s a long time, and I think we’ll be inclined to go along with your country. We have to be given the details, but it doesn’t sound bad.”4.Keir Starmer is appealing to Trump’s checkbook, not to his heartThe key pledge that Starmer has made en route to Washington is to raise defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027, and then to 3% by 2035. He has called it the “biggest sustainedincrease in defense spendingsince the end of the cold war”.That firm commitment is seen as the enticement to convince Trump to provide a “backstop” to a European security guarantee to Ukraine that would restrain Russia from breaking a potential ceasefire. “The security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin,” Starmer told reporters on his plane en route to Washington.But in remarks at the British ambassador’s residence on Thursday, Starmer and his ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, also focused on the economic ties and opportunities for investment that exist between the UK and US. “We’re determined to help US innovators thrive in the United Kingdom so my message is we want to work with you, we want to welcome you to Britain, we want a new partnership because history shows that when we work together, great things happen,” Starmer said.Ultimately, Starmer will need to convince Trump that support forUkraineandNatois a good deal, and he will argue his position as a win-win transaction rather than an obligation or duty to world security that previous leaders in the United States used to believe.5.Starmer’s tightrope walkStarmer followed Macron’s lead in his visit earlier this week by correcting Trump during his remarks to say that Europe had mainly gifted its financial support to Ukraine and had not given most of the aid in the form of loans.“We wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had,” Trump said of his decision to demand Ukraine pay back the US for it support. “They get their money back by giving money, we don’t get our money back.”“We’re not getting all of ours, quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given. There were some loans but mainly it was gifted actually,” Starmer said.Starmer trumpeted the “special relationship” between the United Kingdom and the US in defense and in business, but also directed some good-natured barbs at current administration officials, wryly commenting on the “buzz” in Washington these days and speaking about a new leader in Washington whom some love and others “love to hate”. (He joked that this was the new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, but the oblique reference to Trump was lost on few.)“We share the view that our best days lie ahead. And, you know, taking out a chainsaw isn’t quite my style,” said Starmer, clearly referring to Elon Musk, who has riled the British establishment by speaking out in favour of the far-right Reform UK party. “But we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy. We are reforming permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth. And we’re open for business.”Like Emmanuel Macron, Starmer needs to show the US president that he can stand up to him – and also show his constituency that he isn’t willing to sacrifice his values in order to make a deal.Macron walked that tightrope earlier this week, but it didn’t yield the main prize: the promise of a US backstop to European defense against Russia. Perhaps Starmer will have better luck with a concrete offer on defense spending.6.Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs friends who can speak to TrumpThe strains betweenVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Trump are evident, particularly as the US strong-arms the embattled leader into signing a rare earths mineral deal that Zelenskyy initially refused to endorse; in the ensuing days, Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections”.A report in French media on Thursday said that Trump even sought to cancel his meeting with Zelenskyy this week until Macron stepped in and convinced Trump to receive the Ukrainian leader at the White House on Friday. If true, that could be a crucial intervention to prevent a breakdown in talks between the US and Ukraine as the country’s fate hangs in the balance.On Sunday, Starmer will host a meeting of European leaders that will include Zelenskyy. While the leader’s future appears uncertain, he may rely on European leaders such as Macron and Starmer to argue his side when his own relationship with Trump remains on shaky ground.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUS foreign policyUkraineUS politicsEuropekey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

The board has required the executive to report back at the earliest opportunity on the outcomes of the work the director-general has commissioned.”The documentary waspulled from BBC iPlayeron Friday 21 February after it was revealed that Abdullah al-Yazouri, the film’s 13-year-old narrator, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.A spokesperson for the corporation said BBC News conducted an initial review which “identified serious flaws in the making of this programme”.“Some of these were made by the production company and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable. BBC News takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation’s reputation. We apologise for this.”The spokesperson added: “During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections [the boy] and his family might have with Hamas.“Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy’s father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government.“It was then the BBC’s own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.”The spokesperson added that the production company, Hoyo Films, told the BBC it paid the boy’s mother, via his sister’s bank account, a limited sum of money for the narration.“While Hoyo Films have assured us that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift, the BBC is seeking additional assurance around the budget of the programme and will undertake a full audit of expenditure,” the spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenHoyo Films said of the documentary: ‘We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.’Photograph: Ibrahim Abu Ashayba/BBC/Hoyo FilmsIn a statement, Hoyo Films said: “We felt it was important to hear from voices that haven’t been represented on screen throughout the war with dignity and respect – and to tell the story about the devastating impact of war on their everyday lives.“We are cooperating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made. We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.”The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, has asked for an independent review into the making of the documentary to be expedited. It will be undertaken by Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews.In response to the BBC’s statement, Danny Cohen, a former director of BBC Television, said: “The BBC must allow a full independent inquiry to investigate the processes that led to this documentary being produced, and the pervasive anti-Israel bias that allowed it to pass through the system unobstructed.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, is to take up a new job at Sony later this year.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/Shutterstock for Edinburgh TV FestivalArtists for Palestine UK, a network of creative workers, said: “We are appalled that the BBC has chosen to give credence to a politicised campaign that sought to discredit a documentary about children’s experiences of unspeakable Israeli military violence, because one child’s father was deputy agriculture minister in Gaza.“This disgraceful decision comes despite nearly 900 media figures having warned the BBC of the dangers of such an approach.”Earlier, the BBC announced the departure of its creative chief after five years in charge.Charlotte Moore, the corporation’s chief content officer since 2020, is to leave later this year to take up a job at Sony.There was no suggestion from Moore or the BBC that her departure was connected to the row over the Gaza documentary.Moore said: “It’s been a tough decision to leave a job I love and an institution I believe in. But I’ve decided the time is right for a new challenge and a new adventure and to follow my heart to return to making shows.”She said it had been an honour to “lead the BBC creatively as chief content officer at a time of unprecedented change” and she was “very proud of what we’ve achieved during my time at the helm”.She will become chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, owned by Sony, which made the Netflix royal drama The Crown and the Starz Scottish historical show Outlander.Davie said Moore was “a creative powerhouse and real visionary who has made a huge impact during her time at the BBC”.Last week a letter was sent to Moore, Davie, and Deborah Turness, the CEO of BBC News,asking challenging questionsabout the documentary.The documentary’s two UK-based directors, Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash, gave directions to two Palestinian camera operators based in Gaza over nine months of filming.The BBC initially added a clarification to the film, but last Friday the corporation removed it from its platforms, saying: “There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company.”The letter to Moore, Davie and Turness was signed by Cohen, a former BBC One controller, and more than 40 others. It asked if the BBC knew about the child’s father, what diligence checks were undertaken, whether Abdullah or his family were paid, and whether Hamas permitted or authorised the filming.On Wednesday aseparate lettersigned by 500 film, TV and other media professionals called on the BBC to reinstate the documentary, saying it was an “essential piece of journalism, offering an all-too-rare perspective on the lived experiences of Palestinians”. Among the signatories were Gary Lineker, Mike Leigh, Juliet Stevenson and Ken Loach.Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevision industryCharlotte MooreGazaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The emergence later on Thursday of a search warrant, however, cast doubts about a possible gas leak and raised alternative questions about the discovery of prescription pills near Arakawa’s body.Gene Hackman and pianist wife Betsy Arakawa found dead at home alongside one of their dogsRead moreHackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found by deputies in their house in the Hyde Park area of Santa Fe on Wednesday. The sheriff’s spokesperson said that foul play was not suspected, “however exact cause of death has not been determined”.The spokesperson added that the cause of death was unlikely to be known until autopsies are completed.LiveA look back at Gene Hackman's acting career – video obituaryFurther questions were raised on Thursday in a search warrant, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian, which gave new details about what deputies found during their initial visit. The search warrant revealed that Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time before their bodies were discovered as “the body was in a state of decomposition with bloating in her face and mummification in her hands and feet”.A prescription bottle was also found on a countertop in the house, with pills scattered around.According to the search warrant, Arakawa was found on the floor of a bathroom near the countertop beside a space heater that the deputies believed could have toppled and knocked her over. Hackman’s body was in the mud room of the house, fully clothed in gray sweatpants and a long-sleeve T-shirt and with a cane.Deputies believed he might have had a sudden fall.The warrant indicated that in the initial search no problems with leaking gas were found. The search warrant concluded that the deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation”.“All I can say is that we’re in the middle of a preliminary death investigation,” the sheriff, Adan Mendoza of Santa Fe county, told theSanta Fe New Mexican. Three German shepherds were at the home at the time that deputies entered the property, one of which was found deceased inside a closet in the bathroom about 10-15ft from Arakawa’s body.Deputies reported that there were no signs of trauma to the bodies. No suicide note was discovered, according to theNew York Times.‘The greatest’: Hollywood pays tribute to Gene Hackman after actor’s deathRead moreThe couple had lived in New Mexico since 2004, when Hackmanretired from Hollywood. They had married in 1991.A longtime friend of the couple, Barbara Lenihan, told the New York Times that she had spoken with Arakawa in January. At that time, Hackman appeared to be becoming more frail but was still active.“They always were somewhat reclusive even though everyone loved to be around them,” she told the newspaper.Elizabeth Jean Hackman, the actor’s daughter and one of his three children with Faye Maltese, told TMZ that the family suspected that carbon monoxide poisoning might be to blame.She told the outlet they were not certain, but that they thought toxic fumes might be the cause of death.This article was amended on 28 February 2025, to correct Arakawa’s age at time of death.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to the judge hearing the evidence.”Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

In correspondence with Prevent, she said Rhianan “calls herself a fascist” and expressed concerns about “the way she looks at other races”, the inquest heard.The court was told that Rhianan, who had a shrine to Hitler in her bedroom and was a “Holocaust denier”, downloaded a bomb-making manual and sent messages “deemed to be suggestive of a violent and rightwing ideological mindset”.She was later arrested and charged, until the prosecution against her was dropped in December 2021 in light of evidence that she had been groomed and sexually exploited.Rhianan was found dead at Bluebell House residential home in Nottinghamshire on 19 May 2022, the chief coroner, Judge Durran, told the inquest at Chesterfield coroner’s court. She had been moved there after her arrest and was a looked-after child at the time of her death, the court heard.The inquest was told Rhianan had sent messages saying she “wants to kill someone in the school or blow up a Jewish place of worship” and that she “does not care who she kills and nothing matters any more”.Police initially decided not to arrest her but to gather evidence instead, as officers believed an arrest might “risk some impact on her mental health” and “could possibly lead to further self-harm and suicide attempts”.Two police officers visited her home in Bolsover, Derbyshire, in October 2020, where she handed over items including a diary and USB memory stick, Supt Stephen Riley, the head of counter-terrorism policing East Midlands (CTPEM), told the hearing.Later that day, she was treated in hospital after carving an image of a swastika into her forehead, and a day later, on 21 October, police decided to arrest her. That same month, CTPEM shared information with MI5 which then opened an investigation. In April 2021, Rhianan, then aged 15, was charged with six terrorism offences.At the time, she was the youngest person to have been charged with terror offences in the UK. In May 2021, a13-year-old boy from Darlington was arrested and later convicted, as part of an investigation into far-right terrorism.The inquest was told that Rhianan had been communicating with “known far-right extremists” online. The hearing heard that for several months she had been in contact with Christopher Cook, an American white supremacist, who according to the US Department of Justice was later convicted of being part of a terrorist plot.Rhianan self-harmed because she had “too many emotions” and “did not know how to deal with them”, the inquest heard.In a description read at the beginning of the inquest, Carter described her daughter as “one of the kindest, most loving children I had ever had the honour to know”, who “brought so much joy”. But she said she noticed Rhianan change after she was groomed online.The teenager had loved animals, particularly horses and cats, liked to cook and bake, and was “very good” at art, which her mother said was “her outlet for her when she didn’t know how to say something”.“She was generous and had a kind heart and was also different,” Carter said. She said Rhianan, one of four siblings, had a “small problem of mixing at school, making friends”, but was “there for them in any situation” when she did build friendships.“Her being groomed was huge and I saw Rhianan change,” Carter said. “This had a great impact on her and I did all I felt was right by her.”She added: “I miss her more than life itself. I miss her smile, her laugh and her conversations. I just miss her.”The inquest at Chesterfield town hall is scheduled to last for three weeks.Explore more on these topicsDerbyshireUK security and counter-terrorismNottinghamshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement did not say when he died or from what cause.Spassky is best remembered for his duel with US player Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between east and west, and was later referred to as “the match of the century”.The cold war showdown has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit, which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.Spassky became world champion in 1969 and held the title until he played the match that would define his career, facing the eccentric American prodigy.The Soviet Union had dominated the game for years and Spassky faced a must-win situation, initially taking the lead.But the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.Spassky showed great sportsmanship, applauding Fischer after losing the sixth game.Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, Spassky admitted decades later it was a relief to be rid of a “colossal responsibility”.Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.Spassky, who was the oldest living world chess champion, represented France in three chess Olympiads in 1984, 1986 and 1988, and was seen playing in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris during the 1990s.His health deteriorated in the early 2000s, and he disappeared from Paris in August 2012 before resurfacing in Moscow in October that year.“It was my desire to return to Russia, because my time in France had run its course. It was time to start a new stage. I understood it was time to leave,” Spassky said at the time.Explore more on these topicsChessRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There are no problems. They will be looked after well because they are their people,” Phumtham said. “There are undergoing health checks. After that, they will be sent home. Their relatives have received them.”China’s government had earlier announced that a group of 40 “illegal immigrants” had been repatriated from Thailand. China’s public security ministry said it attached “great importance” to their return and the “repatriation” was “in line with the laws” of China and Thailand and international practice.The security official did not mention that the group were Uyghurs, and many people who commented on social media appeared to presume they were linked to scam farms.At a separate press conference, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian rejected criticisms from “so-called human rights advocates” and said all ethnic groups in China enjoyed rights and freedoms as Chinese citizens.“Certain political forces have been spreading lies concerning Xinjiang in order to disrupt the order in Xinjiang. We are firmly opposed to such interference,” he said.The Thai prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, said only that “the law, international process and human rights” must be followed.The 48 detainees were among hundreds of Uyghurs who fled China in late 2013 and early 2014, travelling to south-east Asia with the help of people smugglers. Many had been told that if they could make it as far as Malaysia they could be resettled to Turkey.The groups were arrested in Thailand in 2014 and the following year109 were sent backto China, prompting global outcry. Photographs at the time showed some of them hooded, handcuffed and guarded by Chinese police. Others were sent to Turkey.The rest have remained in Thai custody for a decade. Five detainees died during that period, including a newborn and a three-year-old.The detained were part of an exodus of Uyghurs fleeing Xinjiang, where China is accused of committing human rights abuses, including the incarceration of about 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.Some governments have labelled the crackdown as a genocide and the UN found that it possibly amounted tocrimes against humanity. China denies the accusations.Elaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch said she feared the returned group now faced “a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance, and long-term imprisonment in China”, having already enduring a decade in immigration detention in Thailand.“Thailand’s actions constitute a blatant violation of Thailand’s obligations under domestic and international laws,” Pearson said. She said that until Wednesday, senior Thai officials had made public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.Last month UN human rights experts urged Thailand to halt the deportation, warning the detainees were at risk of “irreparable harm” if returned.Officials from the Chinese public security ministry claimed relatives of the group had asked for their return. “They and their families have suffered great harm. Their relatives have repeatedly requested the Chinese government to provide assistance so that they can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and reunite with their loved ones. Promoting repatriation is a reflection of the Chinese police’s effective protection of the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens,” an official said.Many relatives of the Uyghurs had pleaded with authorities not to return them to China. “The Chinese government doesn’t want the world to hear their stories,” the brother of one detaineetold the Guardian in January.“The Chinese government is always paranoid about Uyghurs going to a safe country in large numbers and living together,” said the man, who left China in 2016. “They always believe that’s a threat … That is the reason why the Chinese government wants them back.”Earlier this month Paetongtarn made an official visit to China and met Xi Jinping in Beijing. The two countries are marking 50 years of diplomatic relations.Peter Irwin, an associate director for research and advocacy at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said past experience suggested the 40 would be jailed.“I would imagine they will be in prison for the rest of their lives,” he said. “We know this because this has been the case for people who have been deported previously – you just don’t hear from them. The Chinese government treats people who try to flee the country as criminals … There is absolutely no way, from my perspective, that these people will be treated fairly.”Explore more on these topicsUyghursThailandChinaXinjiangAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The new company has already had successes, securing a new five-year TV deal with Sky Sports and the BBC worth £65m, and a three-year title sponsorship for the WSL with Barclays worth £45m.Buoyed up by these new deals, and Chelsea’s recent landmark signing of the first $1m women’s player, Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave, WPLL is keen to explore its options for further growth.One of the proposals to be discussed today is understood to involve an expansion of both the WSL and Championship, with the proviso that there would be no relegation between the two divisions initially.A source who will be involved in Friday’s talks confirmed that radical proposals will be on the agenda, and the clubs are open to any ideas that could help grow the sport.The structural changes would not be introduced until the 2026-27 season at the earliest. It is unclear when the proposals will be put to the clubs for a formal vote, although it is unlikely to take place on Friday.The rationale behind the proposal is that removing the threat of relegation would encourage owners to invest and help develop a more competitive league, which is currently dominated by Chelsea, who have won the past five WSL titles.Another idea set to be discussed is maintaining promotion from the Championship without relegation from the top flight, so that the WSL would gradually expand by one club every season.In addition to the controversial removal of relegation, the mechanism for establishing which clubs join the expanded WSL will also be contentious.The ambitious and well-resourced Birmingham City and London City Lionesses currently fill the top two places in the Championship, but relative minnows Durham are third, while big Premier League clubs who have been late to women’s football such as Newcastle would also make a claim to be included in the top flight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are only 11 teams in the Championship this season following the late withdrawal of Reading after owner Dai Yongge cut funding for their women’s operation.Initially created as a single-tier, eight-team breakaway league in 2011 with no relegation, the WSL expanded to include a second tier from 2014 onwards, originally named WSL 2. In the summer of 2018 there was another major expansion after a licence application process and the introduction of fully professional criteria for the top flight, so from the 2018-19 campaign onwards the top tier had 11 teams, while the semi-professional second tier – which was rebranded as the Women’s Championship – also consisted of 11 teams. The WSL grew to 12 teams a year later. The Championship remained at 11 teams for the 2019-20 campaign but only because Yeovil had been demoted from tier 1 to tier 3 because of financial problems.The Covid-19 pandemic then further delayed the addition of a 12th team into the second tier – because the lower leagues were declared null and void in the spring of 2020 and nobody was promoted.But since the 2021-22 campaign, the top two teams have each consisted of 12 teams, with a one up, one down promotion and relegation system. This term, only 11 teams have competed in tier two after Reading’s eleventh-hour withdrawal last June.WPLL declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

It was laterreferredto as “closer to The Hunger Games … than Coachella”.Its founder, Billy McFarland, described byVanity Fairas “the poster boy for millennial scamming”, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to six years in prison. He was later released after less than four years. A New York court also awarded $7,220 each to 277 attendees.But earlier this week McFarland appeared on TV to announce a kind of comeback.“Fyre 2 is real,”McFarland told the Today show. “My dream is finally becoming a reality.”View image in fullscreenBilly McFarland leaves federal court in 2018.Photograph: Mark Lennihan/APOn its website, Fyre was selling tickets for between $1,400 and $1.1m, with vague promises of luxury yachts, soon-to-be-confirmed headline acts and priceless experiences that could include diving with whale sharks, mixology sessions and, more credibly, survivalist challenges.Pushed on the lack of details, McFarland said that people who bought tickets knew they were “taking the risk”, apparently spinning the festival’s notoriety as a selling point.In fact, McFarland himself was not handling the details this time, with partners taking over the festival’s management. He said the festival “really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong.”Gasca was at a tourism fair in Bogotá, Colombia, with other officials from Isla Mujeres when they were blindsided by the Fyre festival announcement.Gasca said he had spoken with the minister for tourism in the state of Quintana Roo and also the hotels that Fyre listed as accommodation for guests on its website, and that none of them had heard about the festival.Impression Isla Mujeres, one of the luxury hotels at which Fyre promised accommodation, told the Guardian it had not received “any approach or enquiry with regards to the event” and that they were investigating it.In a public audience this morning, Atenea Gómez Ricalde, municipal president of Isla Mujeres, said she knew nothing more about the festival than what was online. “People are trying to use the peace and tranquillity we have created here for their own benefit,” she added.“The organisers didn’t even bother to approach the authorities,” said Gasca. “It’s very strange, because any manager knows that if you’re going to hold an event, let alone a massive event, you need municipal authorisation.“I think they thought they would just announce it and see if it got traction, then ask for the permits halfway down the path,” Gasca added. “It’s a bit of a naive way to think.”Given all the media attention the event was receiving, the local government put outa public denial, saying that no permit had been requested for the event.View image in fullscreenA still from Netflix documentary Fyre.Photograph: NetflixThe organisers of Fyre have since sent a statement to the Guardian, claiming to be in contact with local authorities and asserting that the festival will go ahead.Welcome back Billy McFarland and a new Fyre festival.

He had grown up in the rural and traditionally conservative stronghold where, he recalls, conversations and recognition of gender identity outside heterosexual norms were “nonexistent”.View image in fullscreenChris Taylor: ‘I know there are going to be people out there against it.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianSo he decided to do something about it.After running for Rochford councillor and MP last year with the Green party, Taylor decided to start a Facebook group for the LGBTQ+ community in January. It has since grown to 97 members and has ambitions to one day host a local pride event.“I know there are going to be people out there against it,” said Taylor, who added that the group had already received some hateful messages. “But they can’t dictate to us that we can’t be who we want to be in our community.”In the 2021 census, the district of Rochford in Essex was shown as the straightest place in England, after only 1.6% of the population identified as LGBTQ+. By contrast, inBrightonand Hove, one in 10 people over 16 identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or of another sexual orientation.AcrossEnglandand Wales, the percentage of those who identified as gay or lesbian or bisexual was 2% and 1.8% respectively, according to the 2021 census figures.While some members of the newly formed Rochford District LGBTQ+ group feel people may have been less open to answer the census question honestly, Rochford, with a population nearing 86,000 in 2023, is also home to an older population, with a median age of 46.Censusdata has previously shown significant correlation between sexual identity and age, with younger areas having more LGBTQ+ people.View image in fullscreenBev Danby: ‘If you’re gay, you join a gay group. What is wrong with that?’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBev Danby, 64, was compelled to join the local group because there was nothing else like it. Aside from the recent negative responses in the group, Danby said she had only ever had positive experiences living as a gay woman in the area.“It makes me less lonely,” said Danby of the group. “If you’re a gardener, you join a gardening group. If you’re a walker, you join a walking group. If you’re gay, you join a gay group. What is wrong with that?”She was one of nearly a dozen members of the newly formed group who met in Rochford for the first time in early February. While many in the group identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community, others identify as allies for their children who are navigating their own identities. Some members questioned the census figures, admitting to declining to answer honestly, while others spoke of the lack of LGBTQ+ visibility in the area, including gay bars, that had previously led them to feel less accepted.View image in fullscreenJames Edmunds: ‘I’ve seen the town and the area change so much in such a positive way.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIn 2016, James Edmunds leftEssexat the age of 18 for London as he found the area “very homophobic” and “unaccepting”. He had found a community in London, and returning to Rochford he was glad the new group had formed, with new allies and friends he had’t known were there.“Coming back five years later, I’ve seen the town and the area change so much in such a positive way,” said the 26-year-old.View image in fullscreenRosie Williams: ‘Fascism is back in fashion. It’s a scary time to be on the fringes of society.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe feeling was similar for Rosie Williams, 30, who had not anticipated returning to Essex after moving away for university.“I didn’t think I’d ever come back to Essex because I never really felt like I belonged here,” said Williams, who works for the mental health charity Mind, which will be helping provide services to the group. Had the group existed sooner, Williams said she probably would have come out earlier, and been more accepting of her identity.“Once I moved here, I did feel worried about being able to find a community and actually feel safe in my identity because of the politics of the area,” said Williams, who recently moved back to Rochford. Having access to the group had made her feel less afraid, she said, adding that when out with her partner she would often survey their surroundings and wonder if they would be safe holding hands.“It’s scary being gay at the moment,” she said, citing thepolitical rhetoric around trans identity, as one example. “Fascism is back in fashion. It’s a scary time to be on the fringes of society.”View image in fullscreenMary Holmes: ‘It’s very difficult to reach out.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianWhen Mary Holmes first came across the group on Facebook, she was thrilled.Holmes, 33, works as a population health nurse for the NHS in Rayleigh, within Rochford. Her role focuses on community outreach to address health inequalities, but reaching the LGBTQ+ community has been difficult for Holmes, who relies on data, including that from the census or how people register with their GP.“I was so excited because I’ve been looking for you guys for so long. Because people identify differently, or might not feel comfortable putting things, the standard ways of searching for people doesn’t come up with anything and it’s very difficult to reach out,” she said.A primary focus for Holmes was making others in the community aware of the lived experiences of those who identified as LGTBQ+, she said.“There are people out there that want to support, that want to educate and learn and I think that’s why it’s so important to try and grow these groups.”Explore more on these topicsSexualityEssexCensusCommunitiesBrightonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There, she encountered a colleague who made her question the safety of vaccines.“I remember someone in the community talking about their child who had been ‘vaccine injured’,” Johnson recalls. “It sparked a fear in me.” The science of vaccinations and immunization schedules also seemed impenetrable. “I was very conflicted, and felt like: ‘I don’t know any of this stuff, I didn’t go to school for this,’” she says.She wondered whether vaccinating her daughter had been a mistake.Johnson joined “crunchy” Facebook groups full of moms concerned about potentially harmful substances affecting their children, and started taking advice from a trusted anti-vax family member who seemed particularly credible because she was a nurse.With her next three children, Johnson chose not to vaccinate. This left them vulnerable to infections with high infant-mortality rates, like invasive pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae and whooping cough.“I felt I had done the quote-unquote research,” says Johnson. She read sources she thought were rational, like Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk’s book Dissolving Illusions, which perpetuates themyththat hygiene, not vaccines, is primarily responsible for the decline of infectious diseases. She and her anti-vax community were convinced the medical system was corrupt, profiting from the distribution of unsafe, unnecessary vaccines. To them, not vaccinating their children was the hard but righteous thing to do.Johnson soon began sharing what she had learned with others. “I had a decent following online. People were coming to me and listening to what I was sharing on the internet,” says Johnson, who remembers feeling a kind of “dopamine rush” when talking to other moms about vaccine “risks”. “I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret,” she says.I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regretNikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxerAround 2020, Johnson’s perspective shifted abruptly.She started feeling like her MLM job was rigged: “I was having a lot of success, and then I wasn’t. I started watching some anti-MLM content and realizing that everything I knew was just part of a lie,” says Johnson. “Then I watched my family member who I trusted fall deep into the QAnon rabbit hole. I just felt that was too ridiculous ... Like, I can’t really trust her judgment.”How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTokRead moreJohnson learned how misinformation spreads on social media, and re-evaluated the wellness content she had been consuming. She also started listening to more online influencers who had expertise in epidemiology and public health.Johnson changed her stance on vaccines, dubious wellness trends and diet culture. She was “exiled” from her mom groups but didn’t really mind. She asked her pediatrician to help catch her children up on vaccines as quickly as possible. “[Pediatricians] realize that people have gotten into this anti-vaccine rhetoric,” Johnson says. “They work with you.”Today, Johnson has relinquished the anti-vax myths that once shaped her life and identity. For experts and activists, such stories offer a glimmer of hope. As vaccine skepticism grows in the US and whole communities become more vulnerable to preventable diseases, is it possible to break through the noise and get people the healthcare they need?Why anti-vax sentiment is growing in the USThe anti-vax movement firstemergedin the mid-19th century in response to mandatory smallpox-vaccination laws. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, anti-vax activism was increasingly tied torightwing politics, framed around fears of government overreach and threats to personal freedom. In recent years, fueled by distrust of medical institutions, Covid-19-related anxieties and social media misinformation, the shift has accelerated.While vaccines may carry temporary side effects like soreness and fever, as well as the rare possibility of certain more serious risks like allergic reactions, no credible scientists who study infectious disease and epidemiology think that vaccines are remotely as dangerous as the diseases they prevent, says Dr Joe Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco, and author ofFalse. Large studies also consistentlydisproveanti-vax conspiracies, such as that vaccines cause autism.Yet, according to surveys from the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, the proportion of respondents who believe vaccines are unsafegrewfrom 9% in April 2021 to 16% in the fall of 2023. National vaccinationcoveragefor kindergarteners hasdippedsince 2020 after a steady prior decade.Measles, mumps and Rubella (MMR); diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, AKA whooping cough (DTaP); polio; and varicella vaccine rates decreased in more than 30 states in 2024 compared with 2023. Vaccination levels in children have fallen below the herd-immunity threshold for many preventable diseases, includingmumps,whooping cough(which killedat least a dozenpeople in the US last year) and measles, the latter of which is now infectingmoreAmericans than it has in decades and surged20%globally in 2023. This month, anunvaccinated child diedafter being hospitalized for measles in west Texas.View image in fullscreenA sign in Seminole, Texas, during an outbreak in Gaines county, on 25 February 2025.Photograph: Sebastian Rocandio/Reuters“Part of the problem is that people often weigh risks and benefits of vaccines based solely on themselves,” says Pierre. “They think: ‘I had a flu shot last year and I got the flu anyway,’ or: ‘I haven’t had the flu in five years and I never get vaccinated.’ They’re not thinking about the inherently altruistic benefit of vaccination that involves preventing community spread and protecting those who are most vulnerable to infectious disease, like our parents and grandparents.”Vaccine hesitancy has a high-profile proponent inRobert F Kennedy Jr, now head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. In a July 2023podcast, Kennedyfalselyclaimed: “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in reducing rates of death and disease around the world. He has toldFox Newsthat he still believes in the long-debunked 1998studylinking the MMR vaccine to autism.Jay Bhattacharya, another person who has questioned vaccine safety, has beennominated to head up the National Institutes of Health (NIH).RFK Jr has found a receptive audience among mothers who see themselves as fierce protectors of their children and are theprimary healthcare decision-makersin their households. “It’s very manipulative. You see somebody speaking with authority, and you just feel like, that’s the truth,” says Johnson. “Moms are unknowingly spreading this misinformation.”You see somebody speaking with authority, and you just feel like, that’s the truthNikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxerAnti-vax rhetoric may be so persistent because it is profitable. Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that 70% of Covid-19 anti-vax disinformation between February and March 2021 had been generated by 12 individuals with collective annual revenues of around$36m. They includeJoseph Mercola, a content producer whomade$7.2m during the height of the pandemic, and RFK Jr, who received asalaryof more than $500,000 for chairing the anti-vax Children’s Health Defence in 2021, amongother enrichmentfor his anti-vax views (Kennedy’s own children have been vaccinated).How disillusionment led one parent to change her mindLydia Greene, an Alberta-based 43-year-old, vaccinated her firstborn in 2008. Afterwards, her daughter started crying inconsolably and experienced low appetite. Greene called PublicHealthAgency of Canada’s non-emergency hotline for advice, but the nurse dismissed her concerns. She felt “kind of embarrassed”, Greene recalls, like just a panicky new mom making a big deal out of nothing.Still worried, Greene went online. In a motherhood forum, she read about a frightening butfalsetheory that babies lack a blood-brain barrier, making them vulnerable to brain injury from vaccines. “I found people saying: ‘They’re never going to admit it’s a vaccine side effect, but [your baby’s] brain is probably inflamed, she’s probably in pain,’” says Greene.Greene remembers a rising sense of panic and a distinct fear: “‘Something’s wrong with my kid.’” Subsequently, she decided not to vaccinate her next two children.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Her awakening came at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when she observed her anti-vax community “shunning the things they said prevented disease, like hygiene and masking”. To her, that seemed like “contrarianism, not critical thinking”. Moreover, Greene never found a single study supporting the notion that infants lack a blood-brain barrier, and was shocked to see some of the people in her anti-vax community online also claiming that the Earth is flat, which she thought was ludicrous.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conspiratorial excesses are unlikely to alienate every believer. “On the contrary, cognitive dissonance, the tension that arises when our beliefs butt up against reality, is typically resolved by digging our heels in even deeper,” says Pierre.The importance of real-life stories in changing beliefsStill, someresearchersbelieve personal stories, like Johnson’s and Greene’s, are more persuasive than facts alone. To convince vaccine deniers, “scientific facts should be contextualized and made relatable to be understood as elements of a human experience”, write the authors of one 2021 report.Vaccine advocacy groupsoften feature personal stories as part of their education materials to convey the risks of preventable diseases.Stories reveal the ways anti-vax ideology can cause harm, whether by increasing the risk of illness or distorting how children understand the world. Violet Adams, 32 (her name has been changed for her privacy), says that when she was growing up in British Columbia, her parents’ fear of vaccines instilled terror. “It’s very traumatizing as a child to hear things like: ‘The world is run by this evil, shadowy cabal,’” she says.At university, she saw firsthand that the science professors were “not brainwashed, not sheep” - and her beliefs began to change.To the general public, many vaccine-preventable diseases – say, polio or smallpox – can seem like relics of the distant past; people are not always familiar with their effects. Greene argues that public messaging should depict the consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, saying: “[People] need to know what diphtheria looks like, how it closes off your airway until you suffocate and die.” Washington state’s former secretary of health Dr Umair Shah hassaidit may take the death of an influential figure to a vaccine-preventable disease to bring back wider acceptance of immunizations.View image in fullscreenDr Harry Seanor of Willard Parker hospital with polio survivor Mark Fresco, age eight, wearing a newer ‘Monaghan’ 1lb iron lung, and Ann Bohrer in an older-model lung, in New York on 22 June 1949.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveFirsthand experience with vaccine-preventable diseases can be a wake-up call. In 2015, formerly anti-vax mother Kristen O’Meara watched all three of her children suffer through severe cases of rotavirus. “It was awful, and it didn’t have to happen, because I could have had them vaccinated. I felt guilty. I felt really guilty,” she later said in aninterview. The experience led her to reconsider her stance and vaccinate her children.Additionally, institutions “have to work on how to present the truth in ways that are psychologically appealing”, says Pierre.Conspiracy beliefs can be fueled by psychological needs like uniqueness, a sense of control and social affiliation, says Pierre. Crusading for the truth is a powerful feeling; think of Johnson’s “dopamine rush”. Greene has found meaning in helping others via vaccine advocacy – a different way to satisfy those needs. She is now a nurse and co-founder ofBack to the Vax, an organization that connects previously vaccine-hesitant parents, and a representative for the organizationVoices for Vaccines.How information and support can helpDr Devon Greyson, a health information scientist, has studied mothers who changed their minds about vaccines in an effort to “reverse engineer” the process, they say.In a 2022study, Greyson interviewed 23 mothers in Vancouver, Canada, whose vaccine attitudes evolved over time, whether more in favor of vaccines or further against them.Mothers who became more confident in vaccines described their shift as a cognitive journey “toward facts and away from fear”, guided by trustworthy health authorities and real-world experience, says Greyson. They benefited from non-judgmental support, opportunities to ask healthcare providers questions and the reassurance of seeing with their own eyes that vaccines didn’t harm their children. Greyson suggests this framework could be useful in communicating with vaccine-hesitant individuals: instead of simply telling them to “trust science”, encourage them to think scientifically – to ask questions of trusted experts, identify reliable sources and remain intellectually flexible.If I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptibleNikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxerBy contrast, mothers who became more skeptical described their experience as a descent into fear and anxiety, often triggered by dismissive healthcare encounters. Feeling brushed off by doctors left them seeking answers elsewhere, like online communities that stoked their doubts.Are you falling for wellness misinformation online? Here’s how to tellRead moreHealthcare providers are uniquely positioned to shape vaccine confidence and guide parents toward self-identification as critical, scientific thinkers.Yet, “physicians are under a lot of pressure, and they often have time constraints”, acknowledges Dr Kimberly Martin, a postdoctoral associate at Yale University’s department of psychology. Still, even small efforts to build trust, such as referring patients to reliable information and support, are “so important” in helping families make informed choices, says Martin, whose research focuses on Black Americans’ experiences in the healthcare system, including vaccine hesitancy.Researchsuggests that “prebunking”, or proactively warning people about vaccine conspiracies, is a promising approach. Resources like theJitsuvax project, co-created by psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral scientists and clinicians from seven universities to combat misinformation, can help inoculate people againstparticular conspiraciesbefore they stumble upon them online.There’s no guaranteed way to snap someone out of anti-vax beliefs. But what helps is early, empathetic support from community and healthcare providers, and making space for people to change their minds as they embrace facts and critical thinking. Johnson, Adams and Greene changed their views not because they were debated into submission, but because they were open, flexible and secure.Johnson is raising her kids with a solid foundation in scientific thinking. “I’m trying so hard to teach my kids critical-thinking skills,” Johnson says. “I feel like I’m a fairly smart person, and if I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyVaccines and immunisationHealthChildrenSocial mediaWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If your appetite for both is large, then Chris O’Dowd’s creation (he wrote and directed) has plenty to make you happy. If not, you might find the whole thing a little too underpowered to keep you going.Christina Hendricks, of Mad Men fame, plays hard-bitten TV producer Wendy Patterson. She is in charge of her first big Hollywood production and returns to her tiny home town of Drumbán in Northern Ireland (after 25 years in Los Angeles surrounded by fat-cat bosses and patronising colleagues) to shoot it there. This follows shenanigans by Drumbán’s more colourful and eccentric characters to keep the location scouts from choosing a more tax-advantageous site across the border; these shenanigans include a pig’s head on a stick and a sign saying “Death to the infidels”, which, you know … well, OK, all right. Not even so much from an offence-giving point of view but from an “Is this remotely credible in this particular world?” position.Trying to keep the gang of misfits in order is, for some reason, the town GP, Séamus Proctor (Paddy Considine), a happily married man – unless he finds out about the affair his wife, Catherine (Eileen Walsh), is having with a fellow teacher – and leading a life of contentment until Wendy reappears. It is clear by the end of the first episode that they have history and by the end of the second episode, not exactly the history you might assume. Though there is a bit of that kind of history, too. (“I went for your tit,” Séamus recalls of their pivotal night in the woods on the eve of the millennium, “and that move proved contentious.”)There are lots of things jostling for the viewer’s attention. An elderly patient who keeps warning the good doctor “They’re coming for you.” A fellow producer, Brad (Tim Heidecker), back in LA trying to undermine Wendy from afar. The mandatory comic scenes as local residents try out for parts as extras. The location scout Jules (Patrick Martins) falling for world-weary barmaid Shelly (Evanne Kilgallon) – though Jules himself is such an abject simpleton as to be wholly unemployable in the real world, and the necessary suspension of disbelief in the whole takes another knock. There is the terrible young football team whose unremitting badness Séamus (the coach) puts down to them all having been born the year the reservoir was poisoned by sheep carcasses.A gentle air of amusement pervades the episodes, with some nice touches strewn about (from the TV boss with an immunocompromised dog to Catherine’s speech to her class about the difference between myth and legend). A certain charm begins to exert itself as a plot begins to cohere, too.Wendy and the crew become increasingly enmeshed with Drumbán life – especially once Wendy is forced to cast gym owner and would-be entrepreneur Jimmy (Sam C Wilson) in the starring role when her A-lister drops out. Jimmy is desperate to pay off his IVF bills and court cases of an unspecified nature after the failure of Big Jim’s Jim-Jams (“Covid dampened people’s spirits for two-person pyjamas”) and is overjoyed by the prospect of fame and fortune. Brad does CrossFit with Armie Hammer’s orthodontist and offers to see if he can get the blacklisted star on the comeback trail, but Wendy declines.The meat of the story, though, is in the relationship between Wendy and Séamus and his betrayal of her after the events in the woods, the ramifications of which forced her out of town. The comedy drama takes on better shape and heft around the question of how much we need to be believed and how cruel the world – and parents – can be if we are not. Now Séamus has a chance to right that wrong but at huge cost to himself. Does he owe it to his erstwhile girlfriend? Must we always tell the truth, no matter how absurd it sounds and when it can do us no good whatsoever? What if it’s Christina Hendricks standing in front of you, alternately ice and fire, and equally terrifying in either mode? I don’t think anyone would envy Séamus his choice.Small Town, Big Story airs on Sky Max and is available on NowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewChristina HendricksTelevisionChris O'DowdMad MenDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

All I want to do is let people know that like many people, I have brittle mental health, and I have experienced my dark days, but I don’t see the need to make that public.”Lewis’s career has been built on talking fluently and precisely but when it comes to mental health issues perhaps actions speak louder than words.The 52-year-old, who became fabulously rich in 2012 when he sold his MoneySavingExpert.com website for a reported £87m, founded his charity, the Money and MentalHealthPolicy Institute, nine years ago.Of his motivation, he has spoken of his growing realisation of the “marriage from hell” that is the combination of money problems and mental health issues. It is also known that Lewis lost his mother in a road accident two days before his 12th birthday. It made him reclusive as a teenager.On receiving his windfall from the website sale, Lewis put £9m into a fund for charitable giving. “We have to protect people,” he says. “We have to protect people who can’t protect themselves, and we sometimes have to protect people from themselves within the mental health world.”View image in fullscreenMartin Lewis’s Money and Mental Health Policy Institute helped to stop distressing letters being sent to people in problem debt.Photograph: Alex Segre/AlamyThanks to smart investments, the fund has enabled £12.5m in charitable donations so far, of which £4.7m has gone to the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, and it still has £8m in its coffers.Lewis’s charity has chalked up some significant policy wins in its time, including changes to rules that forced lenders to send distressing letters to people in problem debt, and the introduction of a training module for all health professionals on the links between money and mental health problems.On Thursday it received a long-desired endorsement, a “very, very powerful Kitemark”, with the announcement that it will join a handful of consumer bodies with “super complainant” status under the Enterprise Act.A similar status is expected in relation to the Financial Services and Markets Act, widening the scope for potential activism. It may sound technical and bureaucratic, but that is the world in which Lewis works so effectively.The status gives the charity the power to raise official complaints against regulators on behalf of a group of consumers, to which they and the government must respond. It is an opportunity to tackle systemic issues that Lewis will no doubt seize.He is a inveterate doer and explains his plans while catching up with his 25,000-a-day steps target in a walk around Westfield shopping centre in White City, west London, after filming for ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show. “I didn’t quite make it last year – I did 24,700, average. So I need to sort myself out,” he says.A first target could be the insurance industry. The charity has a “lived experience” group of 3,000 people who provide insights into the problems people with mental health issues are facing, and the disproportionate premiums being paid for travel policies is flashing red on the dashboard.The testimony seen by the charity suggests, he says, that someone with severe depression is being charged an average of three times more than someone with no medical conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hugely counterproductive. All it does is catastrophise people’s finances, retrench them. They stop earning income, and you tend to collect less money. Signposting them to health [support] is better than threatening them.”Lewis is equally withering about the manner in which the governmentscrapped the universal winter fuel paymentfor pensioners who did not receive means-tested benefits, which he said seemed to have been intended to send a signal to the markets about Labour’s credibility. “A poor decision, a bad policy,” he says. “If we are going to do this [go for growth], we need to do this cleverly, and there needs to be a little bit of listening, not just to business, but also to those people who look at what’s going on for consumers.“My worry is that if we give free rein to some of the instincts that are out there, I think it could be detrimental”, he adds. “Having said that, I do accept the need to push the growth, so I’m waiting to see the balance.” It will be comforting to many that Lewis is there to keep an eye on the scales.Explore more on these topicsMartin LewisMental healthDepressionRegulatorsInsuranceHealthTravel insurancenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, there’s a new method for singles who want to ensure a date doesn’t have a secret spouse at home – provided they aren’t afraid ofmicroplastics.In a TikTokpostedthis month with more than 2m likes, the fitness influencer Dalia Grande spritzed glitter all over her body while getting ready for a first date: “bc I’m at the age where they could be married (Married men HATE glitter)”, she wrote in the caption.The subtext, for anyone who has never talked to a shiny mermaid at a Halloween party and gone home to discover that they, too, are now somehow covered in sparkles: cosmetic glitter transfers easily, leaving a trail of evidence from one woman to the next.Take good pictures and embrace the apps: how to start datingRead moreOr, as one commenter put it: “Married men don’t want to come home to their wives with fun glitter on them.”Liz Olivier, a makeup artist based in New York, called this theory “the strip club test”, referring to a trope in which a wife learns her husband has come home from a lap dance due to his unusually sparkly skin.“Glitter is a makeup artist’s nightmare,” Olivier said. “If it explodes in your kit, it gets everywhere and ruins everything. If you’ve ever been to Burning Man or a music festival, you know it’s not coming off for days. So yes, glitter could be a way to catch someone cheating, or to mark your territory.”For the Cosmopolitan beauty editor, Beth Gillette, using glitter to snare a philanderer seems like a ploy straight out ofPromising Young Woman, Emerald Fennell’s 2020 revenge fantasy, in which a woman played by Carey Mulligan uses her femininity to bait and con abusive men.“I feel like trapping people through makeup is totally something that character would do in the film,” Gillette said. “Or, this puts me in the headspace of Taylor Swift’s New Year’s Day: ‘There’s glitter on the floor after the party …’ We all know it’s impossible to remove.”It may not be entirely advisable to douse one’s body in glitter, whichis a microplastic. A spate of recent research indicates microplastics can negatively affecthuman healthand theenvironment. In 2023, the EU, always ahead of its US counterparts when it comes tonixing toxic substances, has evenbannedcosmetic glitter. (Brands have until 2035 to fully remove it from makeup.)Still, over the years TikTokers have found various ways to nail, or punish, two-timers with it.One usersuggestedpouring some loose glitter on the passenger side vanity mirror of a partner’s car, with the idea that it would make a mess should another woman open it to check her hair or makeup. (Fair warning, from one commenter: “Jokes on me, I would forget I did this and glitter myself.”)Or, as an alternative to classic payback such as keying a wayward lover’s car, consider a less illegal (but still devastating) TikTok-approved approach:glitter bombing his home.Though the glitter experiment is mostly a cutesy trend, it’s also a larger indictment of dating in 2025. After all, the fact that it might be necessary for single women to weed out married men using sneaky glimmer makeup means the bar is very low to begin with.“Dating fatigue in the post-pandemic world is so real,” Gillette said. “Everyone is so frustrated with the lack of options on apps, and when you do potentially match with someone, they all seem so unserious. By the time you actually do go on a date with someone, you’re low-key exhausted and kind of over it. I, too, would do anything to make my dates seem a bit more exciting.”One last word of advice to anyone considering this trick: too much glitter makes your life a mess, too. (Just ask any parent who’s not cheating on their spouse – sometimes their kids like to craft!) As Gillette put it: “I can just picture coming home from a bad date and being so annoyed with myself now that I have to get in the shower and scrub all this body glitter off.”Explore more on these topicsDatingWomenSocial mediaTikTokMakeupRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I knew some of the people who were murdered on 7 October.

The word “genocide” is inflammatory. The war began because of Hamas’s actions on 7 October, and they could have ended it at any point by giving up the hostages and surrendering.

It’s just about hating Israel.MarcoSome things she told me were distressing – how one of her boys was harassed as he was wearing a kippah skullcap. I understood her fears about that.

Why oh why has this happened?Stuart HeritageThu 27 Feb 2025 08.05 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 08.07 ESTShareThe miracle of Eurovision is how much it has legitimised itself over the last decade and a half. For years,the song contestwas the laughing stock of Europe, a toe-curling night on which all the continent’s fifth-rate novelty acts would gather and bing-bam-boom themselves to death while the rest of Europe looked on and jeered.But look at it now. By carefully repositioning itself, and by encouraging countries to submit relevant, modish entries,Eurovisionhas transformed into the party of the year. People love Eurovision – and not ironically, either. At a time of growing international strife – the sort of strife that it was designed to combat – Eurovision represents a moment of unity. It is, in short, in the shape of its life. It would take something spectacular to mess it up.Reader, something spectacular has happened. Yesterday,Eurovision introduced the world to Lumo, its new mascot. Eurovision has never had a mascot before, because it doesn’t need one. But for this year’s contest, in Basel, Switzerland, a competition was held to design one. And the winner was Lumo.According to Eurovision’s official website, “Lumo is said to embody the unstoppable power of music. Its untamed curly hair blazes like flames, dancing wildly to the beat and reflecting the electrifying euphoria of the Eurovision song contest. With its bright colours, it illustrates the heat of emotions – from fervent enthusiasm to the warming comfort of shared experiences. Its big bright eyes, mouth poised to burst into song and its expressive hands make Lumo a joyous ambassador of musical diversity and togetherness.” Full marks to those of you who got through all that.In reality, Lumo is terrifying. It is a multicoloured heart with hair that looks likeMichael Fabricantat a Jessica Rabbit dressing-up party. It has enormous bug eyes and the sort of oddly full lips you really only see on homemade pornography fan-art forums. Its arms and legs are weird, amorphous blobs. It looks like a normal mascot that has been passed back and forth between the teleportation machines from The Fly, if the machines had previously been contaminated with lumps of raw meat and a few handfuls of pubic hair.The press release says that Lumo will walk the streets of Basel come Eurovision time (the first semi-final is on 13 May). Previously, this sort of thing has been done via billboards, but clearly the organisers don’t think that went far enough. A billboard can’t follow you around, squealing and leaping, like the most hellish anxiety dream of your life. A billboard can’t terrify you while you are walking home from a night out. A billboard – and I’m truly sorry for putting this mental image into your head, but it is undeniable – doesn’t resemble the result of a drunken one-night stand between Mick Hucknall and the Crazy Frog.Obviously, the big question is why Eurovision thought it needed a mascot in the first place. Mascots are usually used in sport, so perhaps there is an element of the Olympics at play here; after all, over time, an Olympic mascot becomes intertwined with its host city. There wasthe Seoul tiger,the Munich dachshund,London’s all-seeing dildo. Whatever they are, these mascots become lasting representations of the city in question. Presumably, the hope is that whoever wins Eurovision this year will create a mascot to roam their streets in 2026.Well, don’t. Eurovision does not need this. It’s doing perfectly fine on its own. The beauty of Eurovision is that its fans have built the contest in their own image. They don’t need something – let alone something that looks like the result of the ChatGPT prompt “please ruin my day” – to do that for them. Eurovision is for the people, not for sentient hearts with bizarrely sexy mouths.But perhaps there will be an unintended consequence to the invention of Lumo. Europe ismore divided than it has been in decades. A continental war, once a distant possibility, looksmore likely by the day. But nothing unites people like a common enemy. If everyone, of every nationality, were to join together to hate Lumo as it deserves to be hated, there is no telling what we could achieve together.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So keenly did I loathe going to the shops that I just didn’t spend much money. I was perfectly happy, albeit a little bored and usually dressed in the same clothes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Then online shopping happened. The lure of one-click, next-day consumables unleashed my inner impulse buyer like a starving castaway at a buffet. I never quite became a shopping addict, but the thrill of home delivery fuelled a period of slightly unhinged affluenza. My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained. I accumulated retro camera kit (70% unused to this day), expensive books about using said camera kit (100% unread) and an untold number of dresses that I bought only because I could send them back for free. I never did send them back, of course, and I never wore them, because I never wear dresses. But they were so pretty.Ending up with no money sure helped kill the habit, but I don’t want to be in that position again, so I’ve since learned healthier strategies. It’s not about spending nothing, it’s about targeting your spending on things you genuinely want. Here I’ll share my tips on how to curb your enthusiasm for “Buy now”.View image in fullscreenAdd items to a ‘save for later’ basket for a more responsible buying buzz.Photograph: Sean Gladwell/Getty ImagesControl your impulse clicksOnline shopping is a marvel of convenience and a financial death trap. Just as the advent of remote shopping triggered a spending binge for me, the pandemic sparked anonline shopping frenzythat has never really ended, withonline retail spending continuing to reach record highs. Good news for the economy, perhaps, but bad news for your pocket and arguably yourmental health.If you find it hard to say “no” when gazing at a product page – any product page – switch it for “maybe”. Bookmark that tempting item in a “might buy” folder, save it to a wishlist or use Amazon’s “Save for later” button. I’ve found that the “maybe” often turns to “no” in the end, or at least to an “I can’t be bothered”, which saves just as much money.Making shopping lists helps you buy less, not more, in my experience. It focuses your mind on the things you need and want, and reveals in black and white how much you’re set to spend before you spend it. Adding an item to “Save for later” or to a shopping list, whether on paper or via a site such asWishList, is a sort of placebo buying buzz. It’s less immediately visceral than the high you get from clicking “Buy now”, but without the comedown realisation that you’ve just spent money on another superfluous thing.Set time and budget limitsIf you find yourself straying helplessly to certain sites for regular hits of retail therapy, set time and date limits. Compartmentalise your itch.Some former shopping addicts on Redditadvise setting one day a month to shop on trigger websites such as Asos and Amazon. My fear with this strategy is that you’d try to squeeze as much shopping as possible into your allotted time, so I recommend setting a budget, too, and limiting the number of items you can buy.Birthdays and Christmas can trigger buying binges in the irresistible guise of generosity, so set a budget and stick to it. Your recipient won’t love you more if you buy them a 12th, 13th or 14th present. If you enjoy buying presents, good for you – but buy them occasionally and mindfully all year round, and keep track of what you’ve bought.Curate your newslettersRetailer newsletters and social media are effective marketing tools, luring you in with the promise (and flattery) of exclusive super-fan discounts. That craft beer newsletter about time-limited free delivery for new releases just got you to spend £50 while you were bored at 3pm on a Tuesday. If you can afford it and it gives you joy, then great – but if you suspect it’s becoming a habit and you want to spend less, that newsletter subscription is best cancelled.Buying secondhand is still buyingView image in fullscreenUse the ‘one in, one out’ rule: every time you buy a new item, sell or donate an old one.Photograph: elenaleonova/Getty ImagesSales and preloved platforms such as Vinted also feel exempt from the usual rules, because you’re saving money – right? Well, no, you’re spending it.Black Fridayand other marketing feast days are spendthrift catnip, and retailers depend on you to spend, spend, spend. And as with discounts, secondhand can be a fantastic source of quality items that’d otherwise cost a fortune, but if you’re vulnerable to impulse overbuying, they’re still best avoided.Buy quality, not quantityDon’t let us put you off discount sales completely. Done right, they’re among our favourite things. If you’re after a particular high-quality item that you’ve coveted at full price and have budgeted for, a sale is an excellent opportunity to buy it – and there’s every chance you’ll use it and love it for years. It could be atimeless coat, a device you’ll use every day or a piece of furniture you’ll use for ever. Having a beloved investment piece cleaned, mended and maintained is much more satisfying than the temporary thrill of buying a new thing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

One investment piece may cost the same as 300 T-shirts from a high-street store, but the ethical and environmental cost could be much lower – and not only because you’re buying fewer items. Fast fashion is a grotesquely unethical business, and educating yourself about it is a powerful way to kill the habit. Its manufacture createsmountains of wasteand pollution andcontravenes human rights, and the throwaway habit it encouragescreates another waste mountain– most of which is landfill.If that’s not enough to curb your impulse buying, think about the packaging your purchases entail. The “free returns” model of online fashion generates billions of plastic bags and haulage miles, but clothes are far from the only offenders. The packaging I saw (usually while struggling under a pile of it) when reviewingthe best mattressesastounded me, and it seemed so needless. Even if you order a small bottle of perfume, it’ll come encased in its own inflated plastic spacesuit that can’t be recycled. Head to a shop if you hanker after something you can buy locally. Not only will you be supporting local businesses, but you’ll use less packaging and can see or try it out in person. You may decide you don’t really fancy it after all.Buy for the real youHowever great the quality of the thing you’re buying, it’s still wasted money if you buy it for the wrong reasons. Buying for the person you wish you were (“I WILL diet into this”; “I can’t afford it but …”), to impress others (“he said he likes women in heels”) and Fomo (“what if I miss out on a bargain?”) are as responsible for just as many unwanted purchases as the dopamine rush of impulse buying.Buy for the person you are, the body you have, the taste you have and the life you live. I’ve found this easier as I’ve grown older, not least because I know myself better and have less need to please other people. Ageing does present its own shopping challenges (changing shape, for example), but don’t feel pressed to buy a whole new wardrobe to suit your age. If you love an item and it fits you, it’s not “too young” for you. Bonus points if you’ve had it for decades.Fast fashion is often made for very young and thin wearers. If the Primark dressing room mirror fills you with self-loathing because the “medium” jeans won’t do up, it’s not you, it’s them. If you have lost weight and you’re happy about it, then go ahead and buy for your new shape, but don’t turn your purchase into a stick to beat yourself with when you gain a few pounds.Rediscover what you’ve already gotView image in fullscreenInvest in a sewing machine to keep your clothes going for years.Photograph: Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty ImagesMy indiscriminate spending phase turned my home into a mini landfill. It’s taken years of charity donations, eBaying and a small, carefully organised “keep” pile to restore the sense that I own it rather than it owning me. Even if you haven’t amassed your own personal junkyard, systematically going through your stuff can have a big positive impact on your mood and spending habits.You don’t have to go toKondoextremes. Just tidy your stuff to remember what you already have. This is especially true for the things you love buying – books, clothes, shoes, accessories, kitchenware, kit for hobbies or whatever – because they trigger the biggest impulse-buying buzz, even though you already have so much of it. Going through it, you’ll have moments of absolute delight (for free!) when you come across beloved items that got buried and forgotten.Sorting your clothes is also a useful reminder that your judgment isn’t at its best when you’re impulse buying. Are you ever going to wear those wide-leg PVC trousers that wouldn’t look good on a Hadid sister, let alone (no offence) you? Get rid. Donate to charity, have a clothes swap session with friends, or at least sell oneBayorVinted. Charities including theBritish Heart FoundationandOxfampay postage for your donation parcel. If you want to be really strict, set yourself a “one in, one out” rule: every time you buy a new item, sell or donate an old one.Just don’t get too attached to a donate/sell habit. It may encourage you to buy stuff while kidding yourself that “I can always sell it”. Better to treat each purchase as a forever buy. Here’s a pass for an additional buy, though:get a sewing machine, and you’ll be able to keep your clothes fresh and well-fitting for years.Jane Hoskyn is a freelance journalist who’s spent more than 30 years writing about, and often failing to resist, the consumer temptations of the internet.

Also why the obsession with horror films?MrSOBaldrickRichard I loved because he was like a mentor to me. He’s probably single-handedly done more for my career than anyone else. Just taking me under his wing, putting me in Rada, especially coming off the back of my crazy run on television. I couldn’t tell you how he found me. I don’t think he ever really told me.Bruce was amazing. He was so great with the kids and a lot of fun. The Sixth Sense was a massive movie set; a huge production. When we went to do the indie film [2008’s Assassination of a High School President] together, he was always playing guitar in his trailer, so I look back very fondly on that. He lights up a room when he walks into it and he’s just a lovely guy.View image in fullscreen‘He lights up a room’ … Barton in The Sixth Sense, which she starred in alongside Bruce Willis.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyI’m probably the biggest Hugh Grant fan ever, not least because I got to work with him when I was little and he was so nice to me. We were also born in the same hospital in Hammersmith [in west London], which doesn’t exist any more, but I’ll take as my claim to fame. Every Halloween, The Sixth Sense seems to get watched. At Christmas,Notting Hillcomes back out, so always I look back fondly.Horror films are good for strong female leads. I’d rather be doing something serious and dramatic than I would fluffy. I think it’s just the nature of the scripts. I mean, you’ve got to have a strong female if she’s going to get out of there alive …Actors used to be like most other professions, but are now often treated as dispensers of wisdom, with a philosophy and insight above ordinary mortals. What changed?eamonmccI don’t think anything’s changed. I think people still hold actors in too high regard for their opinions. It’s an age-old question and I don’t know why. Actors are supposed to exemplify something we want to be like, but that doesn’t mean they know better than anyone else.When portrayingMiranda GreeninInvitation to Murder,did you draw inspiration from any particular murder mystery novels or films?VerulamiumParkRangerView image in fullscreen‘I really love growing with a character’ … Barton in Invitation to a Murder.Photograph: © 2022 INVITATION TO A MURDER, LLC. All Rights Reserved.It’s loosely based onAgatha Christie, but it’s an original screenplay. I like Miranda because she is a strong woman, especially for the 1930s. She’s wearing the pants, running around solving mysteries. She’s incredibly well read and she’s great fun to play. This is the first of a trilogy, which I’m over the moon about. We’ve shot the second already. I really love growing with a character and getting to know them.You really stood out in your early roles inLawn DogsandLost and Delirious. Did you need help from your parents getting the Brit accent back? How did you find performing on stage in Ireland inSteel Magnolias,given your family connections?repoman71and RfolearI rely on speech coaches, not my family. My family comes from different parts of England. I’m a proud Brit, but I’m also very proud of the Irish side of the family. My mom was so proud to see me at the Gaiety [theatre] in Dublin, she literally cried. I took her to see the Irish dancing and she loved that too. It couldn’t have been more typically Irish. We went to Cork, Galway and Limerick. In at least three of the theatres, somebody sent a note backstage saying: “I’m related to you. If you want to come up to the front and meet me, I’m your such and such cousin.” It was really cute.How have your views about fame and Hollywood changed over the years? What advice would you give young actors coming up todayon how to dealwith fame?EmmaStone andhhhhssssFame is not something everybody has to deal with, so that’s a very specific question. I would say: concentrate on your craft. Fame is something that generally comes to people who don’t particularly seek it. Just concentrate on what you’re in the business for in the first place, and try to take the rest with as much grace and humility as possible. I was a pretty introverted, shy child, so for me acting got me out of school and around cool adults, and I got to go cool places. I have always loved storytelling, and I still love being able to lose myself in a character.How did you end up doing the video forEverybody’sonthe RunforNoel Gallagher? Are you anOasisfan? Have you got tickets [for thereunion tour]?JCMP555I’ve hung out with Noel before. We have mutual friends, so he just asked me. He’d just started High Flying Birds and was coming to LA. I think he knew I lived there and hoped I would be available. It was fun. I don’t know how I felt about getting my skirt ripped off. I was like: “Is this really what we’re doing?” But I’m still super-glad I did it because they’re the coolest. Have I got tickets? Are you kidding? I’m a hugeOasisfan. What kind of self-respecting Brit would I be if I wasn’t? I took my big sister Zoe to see them at Wembley [in 2000], which was on my bucket list. I could try to pull a favour, but I think everybody and their mother wants tickets. I might have to wait till they come to America instead of trying to crash the Europe dates, but we’ll see.View image in fullscreenBenjamin McKenzie, Mischa Barton, Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson in The OC.Photograph: Snap Stills/REX/ShutterstockWhat was it like having all those bands likethe Killersplay onThe OCand did you get to hang out with them?TurangaLeela2That was probably one of the highlights of the whole show. I got quite close to Rooney, Phantom Planet, andModest Mouse– one of my favourite bands – which I’ll never forget. Later, when I went to see them on tour, I was like: “Remember me?” We’d gruel away at the episodes, then they’d be like, “Now it’s band night”, and we would be absolutely thrilled. I think the whole cast and crew got a kick out of it.

It said everything about our new eraThu 27 Feb 2025 14.18 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 18.47 ESTShareShortly after Keir Starmer arrived in Washington to fight for the future of Europe, two men who make a mockery of everything he stands fortouched downon American soil. The toxic YouTube influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate have spent years under investigation in Romania on charges of rape and human trafficking, which they deny, Andrew is now wanted by British police overallegations of rape, and both brothers fortax evasionin this country.But to MAGAworld they are martyrs, unjustly persecuted abroad for the crime of saying what they think on the internet.Sitting beside Starmer, Trump protested that he knew ‘nothing about’ the Tates’ triumphant homecoming, though it follows reported US diplomatic pressure on the Romanian government to lift its travel ban and Andrew Tate has bragged of his friendship with the president’s son. But it was a small, stark reminder of just how far apart our two continents have become. It’s freedom of speech that reliably seems to galvanise Trumpworld, not the freedom of millions of Europeans to live in peace along Russia’s borders; as the president breezily told his cabinet this week, “we’ll haveEuropetake care of that”. Yet on the crucial question Starmer brought to Washington - of whether America will in turn take care of its old allies, offering the military backup without which its forces will be dangerously exposed - the best that could be said for Trump’s answer was that it wasn’t the anticipated outright no, and even that may come with trade-related strings attached.Starmer laid on the flattery with the recommended trowel, handing over an invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second state visit that evidently delighted the president. But though Trump praised him as a ‘special man’, this no longer feels like a special relationship; more the kind of loveless transaction that leaves both sides feeling grubby.Europe still believes in building alliances, in special relationships, in rules-based world order and in the very idea of the west. But Trump believes in none of that. To him, old allies are little more than “relatives that come round and use your pool for free”, as Britain’s former chief of the general staff Gen Sir Patrick Sandersrecently put it; those loser siblings who didn’t make it big like their billionaire brother has, and are increasingly just a drag to have around. And so he has decided to cut off their allowances and make them earn their own keep, forcing Europe first to pay for its own defence and second to do business on terms vastly more favourable to him.Britons long for a catharticLove, Actuallymoment where Starmer thrillingly lays down the law to the US, just like Hugh Grant’s fantasy prime minister. But while Emmanuel Macron got away withpublicly correcting Trumpwhen he visited earlier this week, Starmer isn’t a man to take risks: he couldn’t even bring himself to publicly condemnTrump’s threats to annexe Canada, a Commonwealth country. He will have been aware that he was in Washington not just on behalf of his own country, but to plead the cause of a continent at the most dangerous moment for Europe that I can remember in my lifetime.There will be no peace in Ukraine, nor in any other country along Russia’s borders, unless Vladimir Putin knows there would be a heavy price to pay either for breaking a ceasefire with Kyiv or destabilising neighbouring states. Though EU leaders are now scrambling tofind the moneyto build their own collective defence, following the US’s abrupt decision to pull the plug, in practice it will be years before they are ready to stand entirely on their own two feet and Putin knows it. A European deterrent force deployed in Ukraine without US backup risks being at best no deterrent and at worst a sitting duck. If Starmer’s dignity is the price to be paid for doing a deal that could save countless lives, then frankly America can have it. But even that may not be enough.Battle-scarred Trump whisperers have queued up in recent days to offer Europeans the same advice: don’t waste your breath appealing to Trump’s better instincts, or even the US’s national interest, since what he mostly cares about is himself. Tell him that whatever you want is also his route to a Nobel peace prize, or that signing a peace deal favourable to Russia makes him look weak in China’s eyes, or that there’s money in it.“We’re taking what we’re entitled to take,” Trump told his cabinet this week, of a grimly mercenary deal Volodymyr Zelenskyy is currently beingpushed to signwhich effectively trades Ukraine’s natural resources for its survival.I ran Britain’s army. I know what it needs. Don’t cut aid to fund defence | Richard DannattRead moreThe US will get to exploit the country’s valuable rare earth mineral deposits to the tune of billions of dollars, which could otherwise have been used to fund the rebuilding of a shattered country, in the kind of deal that countries defeated in war are more often forced to sign with their conquerors than with their supposed friends. In return, Ukraine hopes that US mining companies’ desire for a safe operating environment will motivate the US to offer some kind of security – or, at the very least, a backstop to whatever force his EU neighbours can assemble. If Starmer’s dignity is the price to be paid for doing that deal, or even for buying more time, then frankly the US is welcome to it.Accordingly, Starmer brought gifts to lay at the feet of the self-anointed king: the urgent rise in defence spending Trump is demanding – from 2.25% to2.5% by 2027initially, with more to come – funded by a painful cut to overseas aid. (Though it mirrors Washington’s own spending priorities, in truth that may have less to do with flattery than domestic reality: there is no time to roll the pitch for manifesto-busting tax rises or to build creative solutions such as therearmament bankproposed by the former chief of the defence staff Gen Sir Nick Carter, though those may well have a role to play in getting to the longterm goal of 3%.)Beyond that, Starmer has two cards to play, neither of them particularly comfortable ones for theLabourparty: not being a member of the EU (an entity that Trump increasingly sees as a means of screwing over Americans) in the middle of a trade war, and the offered social cachet of that royal visit.But while Trump talked in vague terms about how American companies’ mere presence in Ukraine would ensure nobody took liberties, that’s far short of the hard commitment to air cover and other critical functions that Europe seeks.Until that changes, what is left of thetransatlantic alliancelooks uncomfortably like two countries separated by a common threat – the collapse of a rules-based world order that has broadly kept the peace in Europe for almost 80 years – a threat that only one of us still even recognises as dangerous. And there may be no coming back from that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine, tensionsin the Indo-Pacific, and instability in the Middle East demand that Britain steps up. Our armed forces must be properly funded to meet these threats, and increasing defence spending to2.5% of GDPis a welcome and necessary move.But we need to go further and faster to meet the challenges we face. Britain’s military capabilities must be strengthened to deter aggression, safeguard our interests and maintain a credible global presence. Butcutting aidto fund it is a fundamental strategic error that risks making us weaker, not stronger. Funding one out of the money allocated to the other risks undermining the very security we are trying to ensure.Starmer’s cut to aid budget a ‘strategic mistake’, says former army headRead moreBritain’s security and influence on the world stage depend on a balanced approach – one that integrates our military strength with diplomacy and development. To wield power effectively, we need hard and soft power working hand in hand. Cutting development aid undermines our ability to stabilise fragile states, reduce the conditions for extremism and build alliances that enhance our security. Simply put, well-targeted aid prevents conflict and reduces the burden on our armed forces in the long run.As Gen James Mattis, the former US secretary of defence,famously put it: “If you don’t fund the state department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.” That same logic applies to Britain. Every pound we cut from development aid today risks costing us far more in future military operations. Complacency kills – both in war and in strategic planning.The decision to reduce aidfrom 0.7% to 0.5%of national income in 2021 was already a mistake, weakening Britain’s global standing and reducing our ability to shape international affairs. Now, slashing aid further to fund defence spending is not just shortsighted – it is dangerously counterproductive. Weak states become breeding grounds for terrorism, organised crime and mass migration crises. We need only look at Afghanistan, where reduced international engagement has allowed instability to flourish, with consequences for global security. Without well-targeted aid, instability in Africa and the Middle East will only worsen, leading to direct security threats for Britain and Europe. We are not only stealing from the world’s poorest and most vulnerable, but we are also stealing from British taxpayers by investing in a policy that will ultimately cost us more.Moreover, the premise that aid and defence are in competition is a false one. In reality, they are two sides of the same coin. Well-targeted development assistance helps to stabilise fragile regions, preventing crises before they require military intervention. It is aid that helps to rebuild war-torn societies, counter radicalisation and reduce the refugee flows that destabilise Europe. Without this investment, Britain will face an increased terrorist threat, more humanitarian emergencies and greater pressure on our borders. By neglecting this crucial component of security, we are setting ourselves up for greater instability, which will require even more military spending in the long term.Furthermore, the burden on Britain’s armed forces will only grow. If we cut aid, we will be forced to deploy military resources in areas where we could have mitigated instability through targeted development. History shows that intervention without stabilisation leads to drawn-out conflicts and increased casualties. The overstretch of our forces is already evident – our army is at itssmallest sizesince the Napoleonic wars, our navy isstruggling to maintaina credible global presence, and our air force is operating at capacity. If we do not take a comprehensive approach to security – one that includes aid as a core pillar – we risk overcommitting our forces and diminishing our overall defence capability.In a frightening new era, Starmer has made his move – and may have found his calling | Rafael BehrRead moreWe should also consider the moral imperative. Britain has long prided itself on being a force for good in the world. Turning our backs on the most desperate people, those who rely on British aid for survival, is not just a strategic mistake, it is a failure of our values. But beyond the moral argument, this decision will make Britain less safe. Weak governance and economic collapse abroad lead to radicalisation and conflict, and no amount of military spending can fully address those threats once they take root.Britain has long been a leader in Europe, not just in defence but in diplomacy and development. In a world where the US is stepping back from underwriting European security, this is a moment for leadership. Leadership means making the right choices – not false ones. Increasing defence spending should not come at the expense of cutting the very tools that help prevent the need for military intervention in the first place.It is time for a rethink. If we are serious about security, we must recognise that diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities – they are complementary. A well-funded aid programme, alongside increased defence investment, will ensure that Britain remains a global leader – both in strength and in moral authority. We cannot afford to get this wrong.If the government is serious about taking defence spending to 3% in the next parliament, it would be better to break its own fiscal rules and either raise taxes or increase borrowing. We may all have to share in the cost of doing the right thing.Gen Lord Dannatt is a former chief of the general staff, co-author of Victory to Defeat – The British Army 1918 to 1940 and author of Boots on the Ground – Britain and her Army since 1945Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It has been ripped apart floorboard by floorboard in a doomed attempt to find the bugging device spying on the guy who lives there. With every sweep, the man is seen in the corner, playing the sax. Fatalistic, but not exactly despairing; realistic but not precisely disillusioned – the craftsman who is an artist at heart, nonchalant, magnificent. Gene Hackman’s performance as surveillance expert Harry Caul in Francis Coppola’s paranoid conspiracy dramaThe Conversation(1974) was a jewel in his career. Caul is a pro eavesdropper who becomes obsessed with a conversation he records for a mysterious client that, to his horror, reveals a murder plot – unlocking his own private agonies of guilt and loneliness. The film turns on some variants of intonation and pitch that Harry doesn’t understand until it’s too late.Gene Hackman and pianist wife Betsy Arakawa found dead at home with their dogRead moreThe death of Gene Hackman marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave. Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn’sBonnie and Clyde(1967). He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile. He wasn’t gorgeous like Redford or dangerously sexy like Nicholson, or even puckish like Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged. His hair was of its age: frizzy, with evident male-pattern baldness. You really don’t get star haircuts like that any more.LiveA look back at Gene Hackman's acting career – video obituaryHe was unmissable as the reckless, racist cop Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’sThe French Connection(1971) and its sequel; masterly as the Rev Scott in Ronald Neame’s classic disaster picThe Poseidon Adventure(1972); superb as the ex-con in Jerry Schatzberg’s Beckettian masterpieceScarecrow(1973); and perhaps most unmissable as the weary, bewildered private eye in Penn’s Night Moves (1975). Later, he would be a wittily cast Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and then the mysterious plutocrat and self-made billionaire Jack McCann in Nicolas Roeg’s Eureka (1983) – his performance in which surely inspired Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood.View image in fullscreenPrivate agonies … Gene Hackman in The Conversation.Photograph: Ronald GrantHackman’s career has so much gold in it that it is almost impossible to mine, but there was also his FBI agent Anderson in Alan Parker’sMississippi Burning(1988); his querulous movie director Lowell Kolchek in Mike Nichols’s Postcards from the Edge (1990); and the careworn sheriff Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood’s westernUnforgiven(1992); not to mention the smilingly mysterious senior lawyer opposite Tom Cruise’s moon-faced newbie in The Firm (1993).Then there’s his late comic masterpiece – and maybe his flat-out masterpiece, full stop: Royal Tenenbaum in Wes Anderson’sThe Royal Tenenbaums(2001), the disbarred and penniless attorney who fakes stomach cancer so he can move back in with his ex-wife (an equally brilliant Anjelica Huston) and their grownup children, three eccentric, damaged former child prodigies played by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson.What is so extraordinary about these performances is that Hackman’s age never seems to change: he always seems to be wiry, tough and somewhere in his 40s or 50s. The “Royal Tenenbaum” Hackman could easily take the role of the “Popeye Doyle” Hackman.View image in fullscreenAbsolutely perfect … Hackman as the penniless Royal Tenenbaum in Wes Anderson’s 2001 film.Photograph: Allstar/TouchstoneAs the hardbitten cop in The French Connection – for which he won the best actor Oscar – Hackman has many unmissable scenes in which he does nothing but cruise vigilantly around town: the New York of the celluloid 1970s, which was sound-recorded on film so we get the distant, ambient wailing and fluttering of car horns. Hackman can do the deadpan, quotidian part of the performance as well as the action side of it: the racist barging into the black bar, the roughing up of suspects, the angry and contemptuous denunciations, and the undercurrent of sadness. This was a performance that laid down the law for all the others he subsequently gave.He was very different as Harry Moseby in Night Moves. Moseby is a private detective, with a great 70s moustache that exaggerates the downturn of his mouth, given the time-honoured job of tracking down a runaway teenaged daughter while also spying on the wife, but who stumbles on to a complicated mess, or tangle of messes, that he can never quite work out. The film gave him one of his greatest lines. When he turns down the chance to watch Eric Rohmer’sMa Nuit Chez Maud, he says: “I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kinda like watching paint dry.” He delivers the cinephile laugh-line with throwaway expertise.View image in fullscreenWitty casting … Hackman as Lex Luthor (with Ned Beatty) in Superman, 1978.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarQuite as good is his performance in Roeg’s underrated Eureka, a metaphysical murder mystery based on a true crime, which gives Hackman one of the best roles of his career: a wealthy prospector who strikes it rich and retires to the Bahamas, while fearing that his wealth is going to be taken away by his daughter (Theresa Russell) and a couple of rapacious, mobster investors from Miami (Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke). Again, Hackman hits the key notes of amused defiance, unafraid and unconcerned about everything except the strange demons inside his own head.‘Who are you calling a star?’: Gene Hackman interviewed at home in Santa Fe in 2002Read moreIn the end, I keep coming back to his performance in The Royal Tenenbaums, one that builds on his reputation for potent, unimpressed no-bullshit men but doesn’t simply satirise or send up his former career. His tatty, double-breasted chalk-stripe suit, his cigarette in the holder, his glasses, his indomitable grin, even his slightly too long hair are all absolutely perfect – as is the moment when he finally has to swallow his pride and take a job at the Lindbergh Palace hotel, and wear the cheap-looking but strangely well-tailored uniform and cap. His line readings are perfection, especially when he talks to his bewildered grandchildren about their mother, his daughter-in-law, who has died in a plane crash: “Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.”It doesn’t make sense to call Hackman unassuming when his presence was so potent; in some ways he conveyed the strength of a retired athlete turned sportscaster, or, for that matter, the high-school basketball coach he played in Hoosiers (1986). For four decades, the performances ofGene Hackmangave form and texture to American cinema.Share your memories and tributesYou can share your tributes and memories of Gene Hackman by filling in the form below.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Get on the right side of thatAndy BurnhamAs political and business leaders meet for the Convention of the North, our position is clear: we need a genuine new deal, and soonThu 27 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 08.48 ESTShareWhenever the next general election comes, two things already seem clear: it will be unlike any we have experienced before, and it will be won or lost in the north ofEngland. This is the new political reality of 2025.We need to face up to it fully now and start preparing the ground for a campaign that won’t be a traditional choice from the lineup of the main parties but of two fundamentally different worldviews. The stakes are extraordinarily high.The world is changing at a pace we haven’t experienced before. Yet UK politics still, at times, seems frustratingly stuck in decades-old default positions. Going forward, avision for growthbased on London, Oxford and Cambridge –the “golden triangle” – and airport expansion in the south-east is only justifiable if balanced by a new deal for the north; one that offers at least an equal ambition for economic, social and environmental renewal.By my reckoning, Labour mayors and ministers have three months in which to write that new story for the north so that it can be signed off at the spending review in June and delivered over the rest of this parliament. By the time the country next goes to the polls, we need to be able to point to tangible results telling a compelling story of how the second quarter of this century will be better than the false promises of aNorthern Powerhouseandlevelling upin the first.This is a colossal challenge but I am confident we can rise to it – starting today with political and business leaders gathering in Preston forthe sixth Convention of the North.My confidence comes from the fact that the north is already in a unique position. With a set of devolution arrangements covering more than 80% of the population, rising to 90% in May 2026, we have a greater ability to deliver more quickly than other parts of England.It is also based on a belief that, for the first time in 50 years, there is a credible path towards the re-industrialisation of the north.View image in fullscreen‘UK politics seems frustratingly stuck in decades-old default positions.’Illustration: Islandstock/AlamyThe fight that is coming will not be won by pandering to the alternative worldview, as the Conservative party is doing. Instead, we must take it on directly.By setting its face against net zero, Reform UK is turning its back on the north’s best chance of bringing back high-quality, well-paid jobs in large numbers, and two things have happened this week that should give us courage to stick to our guns.First, theCBI reported on Mondayhow the net zero sector grew by 10.1% in 2024 and now has almost a million jobs, with an average annual wage paying higher than the national average. Encouragingly, the north is playing a real role in this growth story. With the right investment now, our unique geography means we could be a global player in the green economy and, in time, a net exporter of green energy.The second inconvenient truth for Reform is the main reason forthe rise in energy prices. According to Ofgem, it is more driven by gas than anything else. When you combine that with a privatisation that left the British public paying way more for energy than people in other countries, arch-Thatcherites Nigel Farage, Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe suddenly find themselves very much on the wrong side of the argument.The arch-Thatcherites were, of course, the same people who advocated the sell-off of council homes in the 1980s and this brings me to the second component of what could be a compelling Labour plan for the north.With more available land than other parts of England, we are in the position of being able to make a quicker and bigger contribution to the mission of1.5m new homes. However, rather than building just any homes, there is a clear case for making at least a third social homes and building the majority in the north by the next election as a new generation of council homes.Green homes that are cheaper to rent and cheaper to run would show a serious intent to improve the lives of our residents and remove our communities from the grip of the housing crisis. But this new drive would also reinforce the north’s green energy revolution and bring forward the reform of a broken energy market towards more localised solutions.The north of England had high hopes for this government. Why is it only offering us crumbs from the south? | Peter HetheringtonRead moreIt would also open up a huge number of new training opportunities for young people. In communities that have suffered de-industrialisation, there is a vacuum left by an English education system that has been too focused on the traditional university route. This is another Whitehall default setting that must be changed.In Greater Manchester, two-thirds of young people don’t take the university route. We need to do much better by them. Our Greater Manchester Baccalaurate (MBacc) is based on the principle of two equal paths at 14 – one academic, one technical – and lays out a clear path towards green construction and other priority sectors. If adopted across the north, it would change the perception that the left does not care about those who seek technical qualifications.If you add a commitment to fix our broken transport system and build the new rail infrastructure we need, this new deal for the north can be made to stack up. But, as the Convention of the North will no doubt make abundantly clear, it will require Whitehall to focus on the northin a way it never has before.

The reference price for his £7.5m-worth of “golden hello” shares – the cost of extracting him from the world of private equity – was 91p. The engine-maker’s share price is now 732p, up 16% onThursday’s ultra-bullish full-year report, meaning the value of Erginbilgiç’s signing-on package has inflated to a princely £60m. Not bad for two-and-a-bit years’ work.He has to wait until 2027 and 2028 to collect the shares, but, unless a pandemic bigger than Covid lies around the corner, the risk of the paper gains evaporating before they become real looks negligible. The full-year numbers were streets ahead of what even City optimists had expected.First, “midterm” 2027 targets for operating profits will be hit two years ahead of schedule, said Rolls. Second, its new forecasts for 2028 represent another big bound forwards – from £2.7bn-£2.9bn this year to £3.6bn-£3.9bn. Third, Erginbilgiç says Rolls won’t stop there – “these mid-term targets are a milestone, not a destination,” he declared with a flourish.A few remaining City doubters maintain that the pace of the recovery is misleading and that the game for Rolls will get harder. The sceptical argument says currency movements,the civil aviation industry’s roaring comeback from Covidand backlogs in the delivery of new aircraft have all assisted Erginbilgiç’s much-vaunted renegotiation of contracts with airlines and suppliers.Erginbilgiç bristles at suggestions that renegotiating better terms represents a soft sort of victory – “if you classify that as an easy gain, you should be in the meeting room and you’ll change your mind.” He surely has a point because it’s hard to quibble with Rolls’ new-found ability to generate heaps of cash, the measure on which it fell short for about two decades even before Covid grounded planes and ripped through revenues from servicing engines. The company had to borrow heavily to survive the pandemic but is already debt-free and can afford a £1bn share buyback. It expects to be spitting out £4.2bn-£4.5bn of cash in 2028. Given the contracted nature of the business, the solidity around the projections ought to be good.As for the “strong growth prospects beyond the mid-term”, it’s also hard to dispute that Rolls finds itself in multiple sweet spots. Small modular reactors should (finally) get the go-ahead. The power systems business can expect a new class of customer in the form of data centres. The defence division was nicely supported bythe Aukus submarine partnershipeven before governments’ boost to military spending. And the potential biggie, sometime in the 2030s, would be Rolls’ re-entry into the market for engines for narrow-body airplanes – it currently supplies only the wide-body market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But those are tomorrow’s challenges. In the meantime, it’s enough to say the stunning revival at Rolls appears genuine.

It’s like hitting the “reveal codes” key on older computers that let you see everything.On Wednesday,Jeff Bezos, thethird-richest personin America, who boughtthe Washington Postin 2013,announced that the paper’s opinion sectionwould henceforth focus on defending “personal liberties and free markets”.Anything inconsistent with this view would not be published, according tohis statement. “Viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”The Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, promptly resigned, as he should have.When they speak of ‘freedom’, what they actually seek is freedom from accountabilityYou’ll recall that Bezos barred the Post fromendorsing Kamala Harrisin the last weeks of the 2024 election. Subsequently, the paper wouldn’t print its cartoonist’s drawing showing Bezos and other oligarchs bowing to Trump, leading thecartoonist to resign.Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, bought Twitter in 2022, laid off everyone who was filtering out hateful crap on the platform, renamed it X and turned it into a cesspool of lies in support of Trump.Mark Zuckerberg, the second-richest person, has followed suit, allowing Facebook to emit lies, hate and bigotry in support of Trump’s lies, hate and bigotry.All three of these men were in the first row at Trump’s inauguration. They, and other billionaires, have now exposed themselves for what they are.They are the oligarchy. They continue to siphon off the wealth of the nation. They are supporting a tyrant who is promising them tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks that will make them even richer.They are destroying democracy so they won’t have to worry about “parasites” (as Musk calls people who depend on government assistance) demanding anything more from them.When billionaires take control of our communication channels, it’s not a win for free speech.

McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison for wire fraud in 2018, related to his organisation of the first Fyre (he served only four). Whatever you think about the first Fyre – with its limp cheese sandwiches, its disaster-relief-tent accommodation, the absence of advertised headliners, the $26m of unpaid debt, the rats (were the rats influencer hyperbole? Perhaps, but on the other hand the festival happened on the parking lot of an abandoned resort development, and where else is a rat supposed to live?), you have to admit it lived up to one promise:it was legendary.Wire fraud is any swindling that happens electronically, whether by text, email, phone or social media. It’s so easy to fall on the wrong side of that – you could commit it just by sending a round robin, asking for a million dollars. Really, all that is standing between so many of us and jail is the sucker who will give us a million dollars. It’s really the suckers who belong in prison, if you think about it. Anyway, back to McFarland. “Obviously, a lot of that [talk] has been negative … but if it’s done well, I think Fyre has the chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry,”he said.View image in fullscreenThe infamous catering at the original Fyre festival in 2017.Photograph: NetflixTo throw the guy a bone, he built a huge amount of global notoriety over a very short time, and it would be a shame not to monetise this. Promotion for Fyre 1 started in December 2016, and by 27 April 2017, the festival had become auniversal analogyfor everything in the world that was bad. People who had flocked there, paying from $500 to $12,000 for tickets, had responded to the siren call of models and actors advertising the festival on Instagram. Within hours, it was the white-hot centre of schadenfreude.This tribe of festivalgoers had something deeper in common than merely being fools who had parted with their money. They had made certain assumptions about the festival, assuming it would form a backdrop for a fabricated life they could project on their socials. To witness their horror at sodden mattresses and cancelled flights, queues stretching hours to arrive at a wasteland, had the satisfying comeuppance of an Enid Blyton book. Look who got too big for their boots, and now their boots are full of untreated sewage.But this was only the overture. As the festival was cut short and the lawsuits began, the full hubris of McFarland unfurled. Professionals from every festival-related sector had lined up to tell him his investment wasn’t enough, his prep time was too short, he didn’t have the experience or skills or networks he needed, and he forged on anyway, becoming the poster boy for unhinged self-belief. In a world so dominated by the virtual, public shame has become the last line of defence against shitehawks faking it till they make it. What’s to stop a crypto bro simply saying he’s a billionaire until he is one? What stands between a very humble genius ascending to the point that he can assert his genius and humility by executive order? It’s a dicey old game. Sometimes, reality wins (Sam Bankman-Fried); other times, it loses (Donald Trump). So when the results land and it is Crowd 1 Naked Emperor 0, people really savour that.View image in fullscreenBilly McFarland leaves federal court in New York after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges in March 2018.Photograph: Mark Lennihan/APBesides the monsoon that arrived at Fyre 1, turning a bleak and comfortless event into one that posed an active hazard to public health, there was one other stroke of incredible bad luck for McFarland: his wasn’t the only enterprise mired in chaos. Trump had commenced his first term in office, splashing falsehood over everything, and firing cabinet members and staff during infantile tantrums. In Britain, we were in that nightmarish first phase of Brexit, when it was still impossible to believe that people so unprepared, so thoughtless and so histrionic could be steering the ship. Over time, “this is like the Fyre festival” became the standard expression of dismay to describe a range of political developments. For at least some of this long period, McFarland would have been in prison. Hopefully, for his own sake, he missed the extent of his gift to the English language, a shorthand for incompetence so profound that it defies analysis.But Fyre 2 “isn’t about the past”, McFarland says. This time he’s dreaming bigger, with the most expensive tickets priced at $1.1m. You have to love the audacity of that last $100,000. The so-called “Prometheus pass” gets you access to the fight team next to the “fight pit”, and really, who knows what that means – maybe you get to be beaten unconscious by Tyson Fury, or maybe it’s just a ringside seat to a thumb wrestle between two marketing managers, and the surprise is part of the point, guys, because “theorigin of the Prometheus passis shrouded in secrecy … Legend has it that it was inspired by the titan Prometheus”. Huh, yeah, sounds plausible. Can’t think of any other Prometheuses.Fyre 1 ignited because it was a harbinger of shitshows to come. The remake looks like the supremacy of the fantasists.

There is widespread awareness, too, that much of this isfar more violentthan used to be the norm in adult sexual publishing and entertainment – with more extreme content understood to drive engagement, as it does across the internet. The UK’s Online Safety Act should block children from accessing disturbing and unsuitable content. It is shameful that age-verification legislation took so long.Theindependent reporton pornography delivered to ministers this week ought to be the next step in a national effort to deal with the proliferation of online sexual violence. As Peter Kyle, the science secretary, said on Thursday, it is an authoritative piece of work. When he meets its author, Gabby Bertin, next week, he should commit to act on her recommendations. Draft guidance fromOfcom, regarding material currently defined as legal but harmful, is under consultation. But Lady Bertin is right to demand that ministers go further. While clear-sighted about the disproportionate harms to women, she notes, too, the dangers to boys and men, and highlights the prospect that problematic pornography use could be classed as anaddiction.Theinitial responsefrom ministers suggests that making strangulation pornography illegal will, rightly given the associated risks, be prioritised. This is one of several areas in which the gap between the rules governing online and offline content is both wrong and illogical. Material that is illegal to distribute in physical form (in films or DVDs) ought to be prohibited online as well. It is shocking that payment processors such asVisa and Mastercardhave, until now, been the closest thing there is to a regulator of the vast online pornography industry. The goal is not blanket censorship, but preventing harmful content from being produced, promoted and easily accessed, especially by minors.Ministers’ reiteration of pledges toban deepfake nude imagesand strengthen the law on intimate image abuse is also welcome. So is the acknowledgment that police tracking and recording of online sexual offences need to be improved, partly to increase understanding and evidence of links with “real life” violence. Even with theOnline Safety Actin place, the current laws dating back to the Obscene Publications Act are inadequate and poorly enforced. Statutory codes as well as legislation could be used to close loopholes. The government’s commitment to halve violence against women and girls must point to a more robust overall approach. Measures to protect performers should include a new right to withdraw consent – meaning that pornographic content would be taken down.The existence of pornographycategories including incest, step-incest and “teens”, points to dark aspects of sexuality that many people would rather ignore – and partly explains the extraordinary laxness with which the industry is treated. The safety by design measures in the Online Safety Act must be used to compel businesses to stop promoting material that is harmful but not illegal.Regulation of the sex industry is an international issue as well as a domestic one. But Lady Bertin directs her challenge to the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, in particular. For too long, she argues, pornography policy has been dispersed across government, leaving no one fully in charge. The review makes a powerful case that Ms Cooper should take it on.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But a lasting resolution will require greater rights for KurdsThu 27 Feb 2025 13.28 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 13.34 ESTShareAfter four decades of violence that have claimed at least 40,000 lives, this was a momentous declaration. On Thursday, the leader of the Kurdish insurgency, Abdullah Öcalan, revered by his supporters, called on fighters tolay down arms. In a written statement from his prison cell – he has been held in isolation for a quarter of a century – he urged his Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) not only to disarm but to dissolve itself.Yet optimism must be tempered. Ten years ago, a two-year truce between the militant group and the Turkish state imploded and some of the worst violence of the long conflict ensued.More than 7,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, have died since then.That attempt at a deal with a group designated by both Turkey and its western allies as a terrorist organisation came amid a very different political context, before the contours of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s illiberal democracy were so clear. The need to end the violence endures. The difference is that this time, thepeace effortsare driven byboth domestic politicsand regional developments.In October, President Erdoğan’s hardline ally Devlet Bahçeli, who once called for the execution of the PKK leader, surprised observers by suggesting that his life sentence might be reconsidered if he told fighters to disarm. Mr Erdoğan’s ambitions to continue in office despite Turkey’s term limits are clear: he has generously indicated that he would be open to running again “if the people want it”. But this would require either early elections or a change to the constitution. In either case, he would need support from legislators beyond his coalition – perhaps from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy party (DEM).The Middle East’s instability alsostrengthened Turkey’s desirefor security solutions. Then, just over a month after Mr Bahçeli’s call, Bashar al-Assad unexpectedly fell from power in Syria – thanks in part to Turkey’s backing of the victorious rebels, Hayat Tahrir-al Sham. The US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are nowfighting to maintainthe autonomous region they established in north-east Syria, aware that Donald Trump’s return to the White House is unlikely to be helpful. Iraq’swarming relations with Turkeyhave seen an agreement to work together to counter the PKK.That has left the PKK feeling isolated. This time, it looks as if the motivation on the Kurdish side is less about potential gains than the hope of a reprieve from military pressure and, in Turkey, from political pressure on the DEM, which has had several mayors removed and municipalities investigated – part of a broader pattern ofincreasing repression.The PKK’s demands long ago morphed from an independent Kurdish homeland to greater autonomy in Turkey and more rights forKurds, who account for as much as a fifth of the country’s population. Yet a deal may not necessarily bring much progress on these more modest demands. Ankara may prefer economic inducements: it recently announced a development plan for the Kurdish-majority south-east.One question is whether thousands of PKK fighters – mostly outside Turkey itself now – will be persuaded. Another is the cost to the Kurds and Turkey. After so many deaths and so many false starts, moves towards peace must be welcomed. But the price should not be the indefinite extension of the president’s strongman rule, and any lasting resolution would surely require proper democratic representation for Kurds, as they are demanding.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Genuine creativity is not about full potential – it is about imagination and learning, about continually asking and answering questions; it is a process.Creativity is a source of wellbeing and comfort even for those whose work may never be seen, heard or read by anyone else. Creativity needs to be valued, protected and encouraged as ahumanactivity.I suggest that all those involved in this AI-biased consultation spend time away from their screens, make something with their own heads or hands, and then listen to those deeply involved in creativity to understand what they are stealing, repackaging and, more disastrously, offering: AI-manufactured pseudo-creativity. This is junk food for the mind on the children’s shelf of some megalomaniac’s digital supermarket. A shortcut to “full potential” or yet another way to stop human beings thinking for themselves?I was brought up in a creative family – I am an illustrator and author – and quite apart from all of the above, my living depends on the selling of copyright.Helen WardStroud, GloucestershireEven as AI pushes from below, the top tier of artistic endeavour implicitly requires conscious authorship. We attend galleries and concerts to encounter communication from one mind to another about the experience of living. Truly conscious AI might be as worth listening to as any other individual, but that’s over the horizon. For now, a machine-generated production, while impressive, is of only novelty interest. But it’s small comfort to those further down the chain whose gig is up – jobbing artists, writers and composers. For their changing situation, the government needs to do a lot more than roll over. Impoverishing creatives to accommodate big tech’s latest overhyped wheeze is not progress.Jason MillsAccrington, LancashireAs the CEO of a UK-based tech company, I might be expected to disagree with your article. On the contrary: we share the concerns about the erosion of copyright protections that the proposed data (use and access) bill would bring.Our firm is deeply invested in AI technology, and our customers are writers, editors, artists and scientists. Without enforceable copyright laws that protect their work, they simply won’t be able to continue their work.Your article rightly highlights the moral and economic implications of the unchecked use of creative content. It’s essential that AI firms obtain consent and provide fair remuneration when using copyrighted materials. This respects the rights of creators and ensures the sustainability of the creative sector. It also supports British businesses that rely on the creative sector.I stand with you in urging policymakers to reconsider this bill.

Place Leicester in the certainty category. Defeat at West Ham extended their doomed, zombified lurch towards relegation to 11 league defeats in 12, 12 of 16 in all since Ruud van Nistelrooy replaced Steve Cooper in November.If Cooper was the wrong man at the wrong club then so, most probably, is the Dutchman. Perhaps nobody had a chance with the squad Leicester assembled to attempt survival. Their performance at the London Stadium was submissive. “That’s the situation we’re in,” said Van Nistelrooy. “The confidence in the run of form is low and then you end up in a mindset of trying not to lose.”Graham Potter, once linked with Leicester, is restoring order to West Ham. A revived Jarrod Bowen made things happen for both first-half goals, the first from Tomas Soucek, the second an own goal from Jannik Vestergaard the Hammers captain’s zest had enforced.West Ham United v Leicester City: Premier League – liveRead moreWest Ham were unchanged from afamous weekend win at Arsenalthat had handed legitimacy to Potter’s regime. “We played well against Arsenal and got the result but it counted for nothing if we didn’t show up tonight,” said Bowen.Much of Potter’s coaching reputation lies in improving players, though gradually. His has been a new-manager curve rather than bounce but the signs grow more positive. “There is a lot of potential, for sure,” he said. “Talent is one thing. The foundations have to be good.”A night that began with a tribute to the late Ronnie Boyce, 1964 FA Cup final hero, took time to catch alight. Leicester’s approach, that worked at Tottenham a month ago but nowhere else, was to defend in numbers and hope Jamie Vardy could win territory. The 2016 title survivor, 38, completed the full 90 with a grim expression of frustrated ennui.If Soucek’s 22nd-minute goal was created by anything it was Leicester’s complete and utter failure to clear their lines after Bowen began an attack. Goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, left unprotected, made a point-blank save from Mohammed Kudus. Soucek, played onside by Vestergaard, slotted in. “We showed, good spirit, good team effort,” said the birthday boy.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen’s shot is turned into the net by Jannik Vestergaard.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/ShutterstockIf that might be expected to stimulate survival instincts within Leicester there were scant signs of a dogfight. The quiet night air at the London Stadium was filled with away fans singing of past glories when returning to the Premier League has been to their desperate disappointment.The Hammers continued to dominate first-half possession. Over to Leicester for another helping hand: Bowen seized on a low James Ward-Prowse corner and his shot bounced off the hapless Vestergaard. “No defender wants an own goal,” said Bowen, claiming it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Could he inspire his team to play for their lives, their futures, their bank balances? A lack of genuine speed, Vardy’s greyhound days long gone, allowed West Ham almost as much comfort in the second 45 as the first. “The damage was done,” said Van Nistelrooy. “The first half we created absolutely nothing.”Ironic cheers greeted a Leicester corner and when Van Nistelrooy made his first changes, sending on Harry Winks and Stephy Mavididi. Leicester, briefly, pushed onwards. Potter’s subsequent trio of changes to bolster defence and midfield disappointed Hammers fans hoping to see Evan Ferguson.Potter wanted to lock down any glimmer of Leicester revival. Another facet of his reputation is that of steadying hand, though he need not have worried. “It wasn’t a champagne type of night,” he said. “Overall it was a professional performance. Not fantastic, but we are delighted with two wins, two clean sheets and six points.”Ferguson eventually arrived in the 73rd minute. Bowen broke away, the Irishman getting a chance, but deliberating too long. It may not be long until Leicester and probably Van Nistelrooy are called time on. “I keep working. I keep going,” said the beaten manager.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Newly hired as director of men’s cricket, Key recognised that the players, good enough but grossly underperforming, had been ground down by the pandemic and its joyless treadmill of fixture fulfilment.In cameBrendon McCullumas the antipodean antidote to their negativity on and off the field. He was not a technical hire – although he analyses more information than the golf-bro image suggests – rather a relentlessly positive one who would double down on the aggressive outlook of Ben Stokes, his new captain, and not meet fire with ice.Washout leaves Australia set for last four but potentially short of game time | Geoff LemonRead moreGranted, England blew the 2023 Ashes, only getting serious when 2-0 down and incensed by the Lord’s stumping. They also scuppered any shot at the latest World Test Championship by not bowling their overs quickly enough. But for all the memes generated, for all the brain fades and ill-judged public statements, a record of 22 wins and 12 defeats is a ratiobettered only by Australiaduring this time.The question now, as England’s white-ball side limp to their third successive group stage exit at a global event in the past 18 months, is whether expanding McCullum’s role to all three men’s teams – an attempt to breathe life into Jos Buttler’s previously hangdog captaincy – is the same medicine being prescribed for some very different ailments. Buttler has smiled throughout this latest ordeal but his mood was never the issue.These are early days for McCullum in the all-format role, while English misery on the subcontinent is hardly a new phenomenon. But nine defeats from 10 since starting last month has been less of a new coach bounce and more of pavement pizza. And as inspired as Afghanistan were on the day,the eight-run defeat in Lahorethat extinguished England’s Champions Trophy campaign felt like an accident waiting to happen.Buttler’s time as white-ball captain is surely overafter the South Africa game in Karachi on Saturday. Aged 34, but with hopefully a few more miles on the clock, England need his wristy batting to crackle once again. Michael Vaughan’s batting average, for example, dropped from 51 to 36 as Test skipper but the man management and tactical acumen more than made up the shortfall. Buttler is still popular in the group but, averaging 18 across the past two 50-over tournaments, he cannot remotely say the same.Buttler’s culpability risks being overplayed, however. For one, the squad he was handed was not nearly rounded enough, contrasting wildly with Afghanistan’s wonderfully varied lineup. Where Hashmatullah Shahidi could call on left-arm and right arm-options – both wrist-spin and seam – and a seasoned, orthodox offie in Mohammad Nabi, Butter was dealt an all right-arm pace attack and one frontline spinner in Adil Rashid.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler is likely to be rerplaced as white-ball captain.Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/ReutersIn one sense McCullum is unlucky. His old New Zealand side were blessed with Trent Boult’s class but English cricket is suffering from a dearth of left-arm quicks. The stock of Reece Topley and Sam Curran typically rose on the outer. But Topley struggles once the ball stops swinging, while the more all-round Curran, not quite one thing or the other, is hard to accommodate.McCullum has instead looked to blast teams out but on subcontinental pitches England’s opponents have been more than equal to it. The upshot is that in the middle 30 overs of the five ODIs this year, England have gone at 6.4 runs per over and managed only one wicket every 60 balls. Given this is 60% of the time spent in the field, it has handed sides a platform for late hitting.The death bowling, a longer-standing achilles heel, hinged on whether Jofra Archer could deliver, but in both outings here the fast bowler faded as the innings went on. Right now, as much as everyone is still willing it, the rigours of Test cricket still feel some way off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no genuine all-rounder either, with the nearest England have, Liam Livingstone, still to win a match with the bat acrossany of his five global tournaments. Against Afghanistan, despite a rapid outfield that Joe Root was nicely exploiting through touch, he fell with 94 needed off 64 trying to marmalise a cut.This feeds into a sense that, beyond Root’s enduring class and Ben Duckett’s frisky accumulation, England have forgotten how to pace a 50-over innings, all while the more impressionable members of the team such as Phil Salt and Jamie Smith are being horse-whispered to go hard from the start.Twenty20 cricket has this clarity, while the County Championship provides some – not all – of the grooving for Test cricket. But with the 50-Over Cup undercard to the Hundred, the next generation of English white-ball talent is not being exposed to enough of the format in between and is learning on the job.The route out is not straightforward for Key and McCullum but with the Hundred going nowhere, more 50-over Lions cricket could be scheduled at home and abroad. The looming captaincy vacancy is not simple either, with Harry Brook the man in waiting and yet a three-format cricketer with a workload to manage. However much McCullum likes a tight unit, separation of the attacks may also be needed, as shown by Brydon Carse and Wood, both central to the Ashes moonshot next winter, limping out of the tournament.Having originally turned down the chance to take on the white-ball set-up in 2022 under a belief it was too well-oiled a machine, McCullum has discovered it is anything but.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamBrendon McCullumICC Champions TrophyCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This will be the 40-year-old’s 19th season in F1 and comes after 12 years at Mercedes with whom he won six of his seven titles.Speaking in aninterview for Time magazine, he addressed criticism he has received from the former F1 team chief Eddie Jordan and the sport’s former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone.Rejuvenated Lewis Hamilton enjoys red-letter day in his new FerrariRead more“I’ve always welcomed the negativity,” he said in the interview. “I never, ever reply to any of the older, ultimately, white men who have commented on my career and what they think I should be doing. How you show up, how you present yourself, how you perform slowly dispels that.”Jordan questioned the wisdom of Ferrari signing Hamilton and letting Carlos Sainz go to bring him in. Similarly Ecclestone queried Hamilton’s motivation and stated he doubted the British driver would see out even two years at the Scuderia. Hamilton has endured similar brickbats throughout his career and has insisted he has been reinvigorated by the switch to Ferrari and that he was motivated like never before to return their first drivers’ title since 2007.“Don’t ever compare me to anybody else. I’m the first and only Black driver that’s ever been in this sport. I’m built different. I’ve been through a lot. I’ve had my own journey,” he said. “You can’t compare me to another 40-year-old, past or present,Formula Onedriver in history. Because they are nothing like me. I’m hungry, driven, don’t have a wife and kids. I’m focused on one thing, and that’s winning. That’s my No 1 priority.”The British driver is on a multi-year contract with Ferrari where he will drive alongside Charles Leclerc. He is looking to secure his record-breaking eighth world championship and said he felt there were many years of racing still left in him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After building on five perfect darts and with Littler’s scoring levels having dropped, Humphries took out 92 to secure a first Premier League win over the world champion at the seventh attempt.“It felt like hard work, but felt good,” Humphries said on Sky Sports. “I felt like my game was in a good way after I struggled. “My finishing was good in moments and it wasn’t so good in moments.“Luke played fantastic tonight, [but] he didn’t play that great in the final and I managed to put my foot in the gas right at the end of the legs. It’s the first time I’ve beaten him in the Premier League. It gets harder every time you lose.”Humphries, who also won the opening night in Belfast, sits top of the table on 15 points, seven clear of Littler. “It’s a great start. I would love to win the group, it’s a dream start and I need to keep pushing,” Humphries said.In his semi-final, Humphries dug deep to find two stunning finishes of 167 followed by 116 in the deciding leg as he saw off Rob Cross, who had battled back from 3-1 down to lead 5-4.Littler had beaten Humphries to win on night two in Glasgow but then failed to follow that up as he went out in the quarter-final stage in Dublin.The 18-year-old, though, had earlier produced a clinical display to beat Stephen Bunting 6-3, landing 10 maximums with a match average of 112 – and leaving The Bullet still in search of a first win in this year’s event – before then seeing off Nathan Aspinall 6-2 to book his place in the night’s final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Probably just Netflix. If you’re thinking about how do I launch a global product, you do it in partnership with content like this.Premier League could be forced to have two summer transfer windows because of Club World CupRead more“If you really think about what it could do to unlock a global media platform, there’s nothing like this. I’m not saying that is the direct answer right this minute, but I think that’s where we’re headed.”Boehly, who was speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London, also mooted the idea of issuing shares in the Premier League to its member clubs each year, to give all promoted clubs a stake in the competition should they be relegated again. Asked about his tenure at Chelsea, however, he said he did not want “to look in the rear-view mirror” as he acknowledged a bumpy ride.“If you look at the foundations that are being built: a new management team, new academy leadership, new sporting director leadership, new player mindset. Those things are all apparent in there. Now it’s about: how do you continue to cultivate the development of the team?” Boehly said.“The reality is that the sooner you learn you’re not going to keep all the people happy all the time, the freedom shows up from that. I think you’re just trying to get on a plan and execute a plan and recognising that things aren’t linear, but as long as you’re trending in the right directions, in general, you feel better.”View image in fullscreenChelsea fans call for Todd Boehly to leave the club before the Premier League match against Southampton.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAlso a co-owner of the current World Series champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boehly said that the Premier League could learn from US sport as it seeks to move beyond a period of discord, with the competition subject of legal action from its clubs.“The [Premier League] are figuring out how to get everyone to row simultaneously, and really be pulling for each other,” Boehly said. “Because I think if you look at what makes the NFL so special it’s that the owners are in lockstep and the commissioner is very good at recognising how valuable the NFL content is.

But Parish did strongly criticise the imminent arrival of an independent regulator for the game, claiming it had “paralysed” investment in the Premier League.“There are people that make the issues to be so much more than they are. But we do have a problem,” Parish said. “We’re now in a complete paralysis because the government has put the spectre of a regulator in front of us, basically paralysed the game, driven it into the courts. I don’t think that’s good.”“The Premier League is growing its media value, growing its appeal globally, and we need to take care of that. If we built the game from the ground up, you could have had a more American model, you could have pooled more revenue, but we don’t, that’s where we are. And you can see that clubs are using other ways to bridge that competitively. The game is getting more exciting because of that. So I think we’d all like to be more financially sustainable, and everybody’s working towards that.

Asked if he could become a better full-back than a fly-half, Sinfield said: “I’d like to think so. If we could get him into a position where he’s world class at both, it gives us some options.“You look at how the game is played now and how valuable a second ball player can be. Marcus’s big strengths are when he is in space. We know he can do it when it is tight and there are lots of bodies around, he is able to move laterally very, very quickly so he puts defenders under a lot of stress. So clearly it makes sense to try and get him a little bit wider where the gaps tend to be a little bit bigger. It was never going to be an easy transition because he doesn’t play there for his club a lot, although they have used him a bit.View image in fullscreenFin Smith has impressed at fly-half.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“He has not had a great deal of time there, not a massive amount of minutes. We have all seen the reports how he loves playing 10, he is an outstanding 10 but I think he is a very, very good 15 as well. Clearly there are some elements that we all need to be better at, and I think Marcus would agree.“Some of his 10 play and his 15 needs to improve, so I think if we all looked at the game from the weekend there will be some bits that are not as good as we could be, but if we throw it in the bin now it’ll be a wasted opportunity.”England have decamped to York for the Six Nations second fallow week to prepare for their final two matches against Italy on Sunday week and Wales the following Saturday.The second row George Martin has been ruled out of the remainder of the championship with a shoulder injury to go with his knee problem, but England are confident Tom Curry, Ollie Lawrence and Ben Earl – all of whom are nursing bumps and bruises – will be fit to face Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the financial imperative of playing at Twickenham – where matchday revenues can reach £10m – means that, against the backdrop of record losses, the Rugby Football Union is unlikely to take Tests on the road any time soon, Sinfield would welcome any move in the future.“I love it up here, I love playing at the Allianz, I love the feel of the big stadium and being there and I know games previously have been played up north, I’ve been to a couple of them,” he added. “I know England football do it. I’d certainly be an advocate for it, to have a game somewhere up north would be fantastic. We’re representative of everybody across England, not just London, so from that point of view … I get some of the counter arguments, why it’s important for us to be at the Allianz and it’s our home. But I also understand as well that if we want more boys and girls to pick up a ball across the country, we have to do a bit of this. We have to. We have to let kids and adults, but kids in particular, see the role models and the players close up and not everybody gets the opportunity to come down to London, so I think in that regard it would be great.”Meanwhile, Felix Jones has returned to South Africa as an assistant coach, just six months after handing in his shock resignation from Borthwick’s staff, ruling the Irishman out of a place on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia. Jones stunned the RFU by resigning eight months into his tenure as England defence coach and will reunite with Rassie Erasmus on 1 March. He was widely tipped to be one of Andy Farrell’s assistants for the Lions tour but it is understood he will not tour Australia.Erasmus said: “After spending some time in England, his experience of working in the UK and studying the opposition teams in the Six Nations and other international tournaments will add immense value in assisting us to adapt and improve as we cast an eye on a tough international season ahead.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu was visibly distressed, hiding behind the umpire’s chair early in the contest after spotting the man in the first few rows of seats.The 22-year-old, who had ended a four-match losing run in the first round, opted not to press charges after the man was detained but he has been banned from future tournaments.Raducanu had been weighing up whether to take a longer break after returning home but has decided to play Indian Wells, one of the biggest tournaments of the year, as planned. According to reports, the world No 55, who has performed strongly in the Californian desert in the past, will be offered extra security.Raducanu’s search for a new full-time coach goes on and she will be supported in Indian Wells by her fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura and Tom Welsh. Welsh has formerly worked with Leylah Fernandez, the player Raducanu beat to win the US Open in 2021, and joined the National Academy at Loughborough three years ago. It is understood his involvement is limited solely to this one tournament.View image in fullscreenLearner Tien celebrates after defeating Alexander Zverev during the Mexican Open.Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/APMeanwhile, Alexander Zverev’s hopes of overtaking Jannik Sinner as the world No 1 were dealt a blow by a second-round loss to the teenager Learner Tien at the Mexican Open.Zverev is best placed to take advantage of Sinner’s three-month doping ban, with the Italian not eligible to return to the tour until May. He is more than 3,000 points behind but the 500 available for the winner in Acapulco would have given him a solid boost. However, Zverev fell 3-6, 4-6 to the 19-year-old American Tien, who has built on his breakthrough run to the fourth round of the Australian Open last month.Stomach problems took out the rest of the leading four players in Mexico, with the second seed, Casper Ruud, and third seed, Tommy Paul, both giving walkovers to their opponents, while the fourth seed, Holger Rune, withdrew trailing the American Brandon Nakashima 3-0.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanuUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, by recommitting to their partnerships with BP, the British Museum and Science Museum have done the same.“The boards of both institutions must urgently think again [about] the huge harm to their reputations that will be brought about by choosing to back BP.”The British Museum has faced renewed scrutiny of its relationship with BP since signing a 10-year, £50m partnership to fund one of the biggest redevelopments in its history, a move climate campaigners said was“astonishingly out of touch”.Culture Unstained said the decision was “indefensible when it was announced just a year ago” but had now become “clearly untenable”.View image in fullscreenThe Science Museum said sponsorship from its funders was ‘vital to our mission to inspire millions of people every year’.Photograph: Dave Rushen/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockBP has a long history of sponsoring arts institutions in Britain, but many – including theRoyal Opera House,National Portrait GalleryandTate galleries–have cut ties with it in recent years after pressure from climate campaigners.A British Museum spokesperson said significant financial support was vital to complete the most ambitious restoration project of its 270-year history. They said it would need “corporate and private donations from companies like BP to ensure that the magnificent collection stays on display to the public for centuries to come”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is expected to write to BP’s board of BP to outline its own plan for the company.BP has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBPBritish MuseumOil and gas companiesMuseumsLondonOilnewsShareReuse this content"

Its adjusted earnings rose to £1.06bn last year, narrowly above its profits of £1.01bn the year before.The profits are largely built on the billion-pound subsidies given to Drax for burning biomass, which is considered a form of renewable energy despiteclaims from climate scientiststhat it may increase emissions in the short term.The new support payments from 2027 will be halved from the current level after the energy minister Michael Shanks saidthe previous subsidy arrangementhad allowed Drax to make “unacceptably large profits”. He said the new deal would be a “step-change in value for money and sustainability”.The government insisted that Drax, which supplies about 5% of the UK’s electricity, would be used only as backup for when wind and solar power was in short supply, playing a “much more limited role” in future.Drax has claimed that burning biomass is carbon neutral because growing trees absorbs as much carbon dioxide as they release when burned as biomass pellets. It believes fitting carbon capture technology to the flues of the power plant would make its generation “carbon negative”.The claims are disputed by climate scientists, who have questioned the company’s carbon accounting. Drax also faces growing concerns over the sustainability of the wood it sources for its biomass. It agreed last year to pay a £25m fine after the energy industry regulator found it had submitted inaccurate data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The university says it will equip students with a blend of expertise in climate politics, activism and environmental human rights.The university says this will be combined with the practical green skills needed to drive change.Will Lock, coconvener of the new course and a lecturer in international development and anthropology, says the university is already focusing on a more hands-on approach to environmental study which will be included in the new BA, including use of the university’s campus forest food garden.Lock said: “We’re integrating lots of new forms of assessment, new forms of getting students engaged in real-world challenges. As an example, my third year module that I’m teaching at the moment, which is part of the [new] course, is a modular political ecology and environmental justice to disciplines that are really focused on public communication and surfacing injustice stories from around the world.“Rather than having a 5,000-word essay at the end of the module, we have a podcast that students are working on in groups and think about how they would convey the complexity of the case studies and examples to a wider audience.”It comes after a Future Forum survey found that 72% of 14- 18-year-olds want more relevant and rigorous climate change education, with a demand for more humanities and social sciences-based climate education.Lock said students are coming into classrooms already engaged with climate justice due to the real-life changes they have experienced. “Now the world is changing around them, and it feels urgent, and they feel like they want to be involved,” he said. “Climate change is at the centre of so much of politics today.

I know what it needs. Don’t cut aid to fund defenceAletha AduPolitical correspondentThu 27 Feb 2025 12.16 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 13.13 ESTShareKeir Starmer’s decision to reduce the foreign aid budget in order to pay for increased spending on defence is a “strategic mistake” that will ultimately add to the burden on Britain’s armed forces, a former head of the British army has warned.Gen Lord Richard Dannatt, who is one of a number of former military chiefs and figures who have called on the governmentto boost its defence spendingabove the 2.5% GDP target, said the prime minister’s decision was “shortsighted” and “dangerously counterproductive”.While he welcomed the overall increase in defence spendingin an op-ed for the Guardian, Dannatt described the cut as a “failure of our values” which “risks making us weaker, not stronger”, and said it was a “moment for leadership” in a world where the US was “stepping back from underwriting European security”.He wrote: “It is time for a rethink. If we are serious about security, we must recognise that diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities – they are complementary. A well-funded aid programme, alongside increased defence investment, will ensure that Britain remains a global leader – both in strength and in moral authority. We cannot afford to get this wrong.“If the government is serious about taking defence spending to 3% in the next parliament, it may well have to break its own fiscal rules and either raise taxes or increase borrowing. We may all have to share in the cost of doing the right thing.”The former army chief argued it was a false premise that aid and defence were in competition.Ministers had learned of the move four days before Starmer madethe announcement on Tuesday. However, the advance warning did not prevent some fromraising their concernsabout the plan during a cabinet meeting.Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said aid cuts could allow China to step in and further its global influence, although on Wednesday night he said the cut was one of “the hard-headed decisions you make when you are in government”.Dannatt said: “As General Jim Mattis, the former US secretary of defence, famously put it: ‘If you don’t fund the state department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.’ That same logic applies to Britain. Every pound we cut from development aid today risks costing us far more in future military operations. Complacency kills – both in war and in strategic planning.“The decision to reduce aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income [in 2021] was already a mistake, weakening Britain’s global standing and reducing our ability to shape international affairs. Now, slashing aid further to fund defence spending is not just shortsighted – it is dangerously counterproductive. Weak states become breeding grounds for terrorism, organised crime, and mass migration crises.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was recorded offering access to ministers during discussions about the sponsorship of a commercial event in parliament run by his son, a deal worth tens of thousands of pounds.Lord Evans of Watford: long-serving peer facing cash-for-access questionsRead moreThe peer told undercover reporters, who posed as property developers looking to lobby government, that he would make introductions to ministers and explained how to approach Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary. He said he was happy to support them because he was keen to help the government build more social housing.Lord Evans has not received payment in connection with the events he sponsors in the House of Lords.Lord Evans’ involvement was part of discussions about £25,000 sponsorship of a House of Lords event on construction organised by a company run by his son and in which Lord Evans is a one-third shareholder.Lord Evans denied breaking the rules. He told the Guardian: “To my knowledge, I have not broken any House of Lords rules and I have NOT taken any personal benefits.”The revelations have prompted calls from campaigners for the Lords commissioners for standards, who are responsible for examining alleged breaches of the rules, to open an investigation.Susan Hawley, the director of the transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said: “It is essential that the House of Lords commissioners for standards conduct a thorough review into whether Lord Evans may have benefited his son and even himself.“As a peer, Lord Evans clearly has the right to seek meetings with ministers to talk about important issues like housing. But it is seriously damaging to trust in parliament if peers are seen to be using their public position to gain financial benefit either for themselves or family members.”Rose Whiffen, a senior research officer at Transparency International UK, said there were “serious concerns about potential breaches of parliamentary standards”.She said: “The House of Lords exists for members to scrutinise legislation and contribute expertise from outside parliament, not to help them or their family make money off their privileged position.“The code of conduct clearly states that peers should not be hosting events in return for any sort of reward, even if that benefit is not reportable itself. These allegations, if proven, undermine public trust in our democratic institutions and highlight the urgent need for reform of the Lords to ensure proper accountability.”She said a review that is scrutinising the Lords’ code of conduct, which peers are due to discuss next week, offered an opportunity to tighten the rules.Should the standards commissioners find that Evans has breached the rules, the most senior minister in the Lords has suggested that the conduct committee, which may then rule on a sanction, should consider expulsion.Lady Smith told the BBC: “If he’s broken the rules then he should not be a member of the house. That’s a matter for the conduct committee to look at. I’ve seen some of the reports, I don’t know the details of it, but obviously the commissioner can investigate that and a complaint can be made.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debatenewsShareReuse this content"

A jury found that his death was suicide.Olugosi’s wife spoke to her husband at about 9pm on 27 March and believed he was suicidal, according to a prevention of future deaths report by Richard Furniss, an assistant coroner for westLondon.Olugosi’s wife, Cambridgeshire police and the Metropolitan police were all unable to contact the men’s prison in west London by telephone to warn them because “calls were being diverted to an unmanned or obsolete number”.Instead, she drove for two hours from Cambridge to Wormwood Scrubs where she banged on the main gate for some time, calling out and pressing a buzzer which promised to connect her to an intercom through which she could speak to prison staff, the hearing was told.Furniss said in his report that the intercom was out of action and had been “for several years”.As a result, Olugosi’s wife and police could not contact the prison all night and Olugosi killed himself. Furniss ruled “there is a risk that future deaths will occur” unless the Wormwood Scrubs governor, Amy Frost, takes action.He said: “The buzzer intercom system must have been provided because it was thought important to provide that additional means of communication between the prison and the outside world.“In this case, a working system would have enabled the deceased’s wife to warn the prison of his impending suicide.“It is difficult to understand why the intercom system has not worked for several years.”Furniss added: “There was evidence that it is irreparable. But the proposed solution appeared to be either to leave it as it is or to remove it altogether. It is a matter of concern that the prison and the Ministry of Justice still considers that it is unnecessary.”Frost has been asked to respond to Furniss’s report by 21 April with details of measures taken or proposed action to be taken.In 2014, prison inspectors said spending cuts had reduced Wormwood Scrubs to afilthy, overcrowded and dilapidated state.Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons at the time, said his office found that the jail had “declined in almost every aspect”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We will carefully consider the coroner’s findings and will respond to the report in due course.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He will learn a very painful lesson.”Amesbury pleaded guilty in January to assaulting Paul Fellows, 45, after a row in the street in Frodsham,Cheshire, in the early hours of 26 October.Footage played again in court showed Amesbury punching Fellows to the head, knocking him to the ground, then following him on to the road and punching him again at least five times.Amesbury was then heard saying: “You won’t threaten your MP again will you, you fucking soft lad?”The judge said it was “a very fine line” on sentencing, adding: “We came to the conclusion that, without in any way criticising the original sentence of 10 weeks, because of the important change in the last three to four days you are a realistic prospect of rehabilitation and therefore we will suspend the sentence for two years.”The appeal hearing was told Amesbury initially claimed he had been approached by a man “shouting and screaming” about local and national matters, including a local swing bridge and immigration.In a statement, he told police: “I thought I was about to be physically assaulted by this male. I was terrified and felt vulnerable and cornered by the male and others in the group.”He said the man’s “arms were swinging” and he thought there was no option but to “defend” himself.The judge said: “What he said to police doesn’t seem to fit in with the CCTV in pretty well any respect.” He said Amesbury had told police a “pack of lies”.The former Labour MP has been sitting as an independent for the Cheshire seat since he was suspended by Labour after his arrest last year. There is no automatic suspension for MPs serving a custodial sentence, although there have been calls for Amesbury to resign so that a byelection can be held.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said on Tuesday she wanted Amesbury to resign or face recall “so that we can have a new MP in place”. She told the BBC: “I want to see the people of Runcorn get new representation as swiftly as possible.”Amesbury arrived at Chester crown court in a prison van and was led into the building in handcuffs by an officer.He had been jailed at Chester magistrates court by the deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram, who told him: “You were out drunk in the early hours. The attack was unprovoked. Being in drink is no excuse and as a member of parliament you could reasonably expect robust challenge from constituents and members of the public.“You continued the attack whilst the victim was on the ground. This incident may well not have come to an end had the bystander not intervened. Your conduct would have had impact on others watching on. You continued to rant as you left.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeCheshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Limited research has been conducted on the number of birds killed this way, butestimates range from four to 18 per turbine per year.In the US, Donald Trumphas signed an executive order pausing all wind energy projectsand pushed for deregulation of the fossil fuel industry, and has previously expressed concern about wind turbines’ impact on birds. In December he told the prime minister, Keir Starmer, he was making a “very big mistake” by imposing a windfall tax on the North Sea oil and gas industry. He also told him to “get rid of windmills”.In the UK,energy minister Ed Miliband has vowed to support wind poweranddescribed the transition from fossil fuels to renewables as “unstoppable”. In July, the Climate Change Committeeestimatedthat by 2030, the number of annual offshore wind installations needed to at least triple and found onshore wind should double in that time.News of the trial emerged just beforeStarmer’s visit to Washington to meet the president.Trump has been raising concerns about wind turbines since 2011, when North Sea windfarms were first proposed in view of his golf course in Aberdeen.A studyin Norwaywhich examined the effects of dyeing one wind turbine blade black found it resulted in a 70% fall in associated bird deaths.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She signed a retraction at 1.15am and wasarrested for “committing public mischief”.The Strasbourg-based court, which referred to the Briton as “X” in its judgment, said: “The Cypriot authorities failed in their obligation to effectively investigate the applicant’s complaint of rape and to adopt a victim‑sensitive approach when doing so.”It noted “numerous shortcomings” in the investigation and awarded the student €20,000 in damages.“In conclusion, the court observed that the case revealed certain biases concerning women inCypruswhich impeded the effective protection of X’s rights as a possible victim of gender-based violence,” the judges said.Timeline: the British teenager convicted over rape claims in CyprusRead moreThe Briton had resorted to the continent’s highest human rights body after the Cypriot attorney general, the island’s top legal authority, rejected her lawyers’ request to open a new inquiry with external investigators who could consider the rape complaint “fairly and dispassionately”.The EHCR judgment was hailed as a “huge vindication” for the Derbyshire student.The British barrister Michael Polak, who heads the London-based legal aid group Justice Abroad, and represents the woman, said: “The result couldn’t be better. It’s a monumental victory for our client but also for the rights of women, other victims of sexual violence, and their access to justice.”Cyprus, he said, had been found in breach of the European convention of human rights by refusing to order a fresh inquiry into the rape allegations after the island’s supreme courtthrew outthe case, acknowledging the Briton had not been given a fair trial.Lawyers in Cyprus who had represented the complainant said the European tribunal’s decision was a triumph against a system that frequently did not take victims seriously.“This is a big win,” said Nicoletta Charalambidou, a leading human rights lawyer in Cyprus. She observed that the credibility of victims of rape in the country was “very often questioned by a system built on patriarchy and discrimination against women and girls”.In 2019 the woman was made to give testimony over several hours in the absence of a lawyer or psychologist. She described how she had been attacked by the tourists while she and her boyfriend had been having consensual sex.She claimed the night began to go horribly wrong when the other men, at her partner’s behest, barged in, attacking her “one by one”.The Briton’s defence team argued that her decision to withdraw the complaint was made under duress after seven hours of police questioning and accepted despite their client’s highly distressed state. “Overnight, she was turned from being treated as a victim into a suspect,” Polak told the Guardian.The retraction allowed the alleged assailants, who were aged between 15 and 22 and included the sons of senior Israeli officials, to immediately return home.Womens’ groups in Cyprus and Israel deplored the handling of the case. Activists from both countries who gathered outside the courts as legal proceedings unfolded said the Briton had fallen victim to a macho culture and to the desire of the two eastern Mediterranean nations to maintain close diplomatic ties.Polak said Thursday’s landmark ruling reinforced the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence should be properly investigated “without institutional obstruction”.“Our client has shown immense resilience in her pursuit of justice,” he said. “We hope this outcome will empower others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The grant rate for Afghan cases has gone down from 98.5% in the last quarter of 2023 to 36% in the last quarter of 2024.However, theHome Officehas said it cannot send anyone back to Afghanistan, which has been ruled by the Taliban since 2021. This means those whose cases are refused will be stuck in limbo, without the right to work or move on with their lives and at risk of destitution.A recent internal Home Office document about returns toAfghanistanseen by the Guardian states: “Enforced or voluntary removals are currently paused and cannot be progressed at present. This is due to the Taliban informing the UK that they will no longer accept travel documents issued from the Afghan embassy in London.“The UK government’s position is that they do not recognise the Taliban as an accepted foreign government. There is currently no timescale for when this will be resolved.”While campaigners have welcomed the news that the backlog of asylum claims has been reduced in the last few months – falling from 97,170 cases at the end of September 2024 to 90,686 cases by the end of December 2024 – they questioned the logic of refusing asylum claims of people who cannot be returned to their home countries.Louise Calvey, the executive director of Asylum Matters, said: “This is a huge jump in refusals for people whose need for sanctuary ought to be obvious. No one could look at the situation in Afghanistan and think it’s safe to return people to the Taliban, so all these refusals do is consign people to years of destitution and limbo while they attempt to appeal, denied safety and support in the UK but with nowhere else to go.”Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who has represented Afghan asylum seekers, said:“The consequence of this startling policy change is that thousands will remain in limbo for years, unable to work whilst their cases are decided by the overburdened court system. Afghans are now in a new hostile environment.”Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “The reality behind these numbers is men, women and children who have fled Afghanistan for fear of their lives being left in further distress, trapped in limbo in hotels. This is not only expensive, but it also prevents people from being able to move on with their lives, get into work and integrate into communities here in the UK, or, when it’s safe, be returned to Afghanistan with dignity and respect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A shift in circulating strains means that those who have already been ill with norovirus this winter are at risk of catching it again.Amy Douglas, a lead epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: “Norovirus levels are still exceptionally high, and now with multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season.”Laboratory-confirmed cases in the two weeks from 3 to 16 February were 29% higher than the previous fortnight and more than double the five-season average (168%) for the same two-week period, thelatest UKHSA datashows. This puts the prevalence at the highest level since the agency began reporting data this way in 2014.The impact is particularly severe in hospitals and care homes, with cases highest among people aged 65 and over.Douglas said: “We are seeing the biggest impacts in health and social care settings, such as hospitals and care homes. Symptoms of norovirus can be more severe in older adults, young children and those who are immunocompromised.”The latest data also shows a shift in circulating strains. Cases of a strain known asGII.4, which has dominated in previous years, have sharply risen, now representing 29% of cases compared with just 10% three months ago. So far this year the recently emergedGII.17strain has dominated, but now accounts for 59% of cases, down from 76% of cases in November.Common symptoms of norovirus include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, high temperature, stomach pains and aching limbs. Some people, particularly young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, are more likely to develop severe symptoms, which can cause dehydration. Anyone with these symptoms is advised to drink plenty of fluids to avoid this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For every case reported to national surveillance, approximately 288 cases occur in the community, suggesting about 3m cases annually in the UK.Explore more on these topicsNorovirusNHSHealthHospitalsOlder peopleInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday there were tariffs on offer that meant an average household could save up to about £230 a year.The average energy bill in Great Britainwill rise by £111 from April to £1,849a year for a typical household, it was announced on Tuesday. This is the third increase in a row. That amount is for a dual-fuel customer who pays by direct debit.However, many people could lop a decent chunk off their costs by switching. Visit the price comparison websites to see how much you can save. Check out two or more of the sites if possible, as they sometimes have exclusive or “limited-time” offers. When using these sites, though, make sure they are showing you all the available deals, not just some of them.How to complain effectively about UK energy bill problemsRead moreThe industry regulatorOfgemhas announced a 6.4% increase to the energy price cap, which is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of energy.The cap affects about 22 million customers in England, Scotland and Wales who are on standard variable tariffs.Since Ofgem’s lastprice cap announcement in November, four million customers have moved over to a fixed deal.Some of that is likely to be down to consumer champions such as Martin Lewis and articles in the Guardian and elsewhere last autumn that wereurging people to switchto a better deal. In October, Lewis declared that you are “ripping yourself off” if you stay on your supplier’s default tariff, adding: “Nobody should be on the price cap.”There are now 11 million people on a fixed-energy deal, and the current advice is very much that this is the way to go. Even Ofgem says that fixing now could “help to bring costs down and provide certainty over coming payments”.Richard Neudegg, at the price comparison site Uswitch, says that if you are still sitting on a standard variable tariff, now is the time to act.“There are plenty of fixed deals available that are cheaper than today’s rates, let alone the higher April prices. A fixed deal could protect you from further price increases for 12 months or longer,” he adds.At the time of writing, one of the cheapest fixes on the market was from Ecotricity. This 12-month tariff is called Domestic Smart 1 Year Fixed Green Tariff Feb 25 and costs £1,620 for households with average usage, which is £229 less than the April price cap annual figure.Close behind was Outfox the Market, which was offering a number of competitively priced deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You may be looking at a fee of between £25 and £75 for each fuel. So check when you sign up to a deal.Emily Seymour, energy editor at the consumer body Which?, says that when shopping around, “as a rule of thumb we’d recommend looking for deals cheaper than the price cap, not longer than 12 months, and without significant exit fees”.Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsEnergy industryOfgemnewsShareReuse this content"

They come in at a low level and work their way up. That’s how we renew ourselves,” said Alsup, a Bill Clinton appointee.Alsup handed down the order in a case brought by labor unions and non-profits filed last week.The complaint filed by five labor unions and five non-profit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration’s efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce.Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired. Just on Thursday, hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency,learnedthey had lost their jobs.The plaintiffs say the OPM had no authority to terminate the jobs of probationary workers who generally have less than a year on the job. They also say the firings were predicated on a lie of poor performance by the workers.The Trump administration has maintained that the memo and email from the OPM merely asked agencies to review their probationary workforces and decide who could potentially be terminated, and did not require them to do anything.“An order is not usually phrased as a request,” Kelsey Helland of the US Department of Justice told Alsup during the hearing.But the judge said it was unlikely that virtually every federal agency independently decided to decimate its staff.“How could that all happen with each agency deciding on its own to do something so aberrational? I don’t believe it,” Alsup said.There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers – generally employees who have less than a year on the job – across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans’ care, the complaint says.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew Tate spoke briefly to reporters to profess his innocence after the brothers emerged from an executive terminal about 90 minutes later, and before they were driven away in a large SUV.Authorities in Romania said prosecutors had approved the brothers’ request to travel. The anti-organised crime unit, Diicot, said the pair remained “under judicial supervision” and would have to “appear before the judicial authorities at every summons”.It added that any violation “may lead to a higher custodial measure”. Romania’s justice minister, Radu Marinescu, said the brothers, who are dual British and US nationals, must return to Romania for their next court appearance on 24 March.In Florida, meanwhile, state officials said they were launching a “preliminary inquiry” into the Tates. In apost to X, the state’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, wrote: “Florida has zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women. If any of these alleged crimes trigger Florida jurisdiction, we will hold them accountable.”It followed comments from the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, at a press conference earlier on Thursday: “Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct in the air.”In a separate development, a Tate representative said an appeal court had “restored ownership of properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares” to the brothers. Authorities seized several luxury cars, land and property in 2023.The pair are outspoken supporters of Donald Trump, and several members of the US president’s inner circle havespoken out publiclyagainst their treatment, including Donald Trump Jr who described their detention as “absolute insanity”.Elon Musk responded to a suggestion from Andrew Tate that he would “run for prime minister of the UK” by saying “he’s not wrong”, while one of Tate’s lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, is the White House liaison official for the US Department of Justice.According to Ingrassia, the Tate brothers were “sacrificed on the altar of the Matrix under the banner of egregious crimes they never committed”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has appeared on a pro-Tate podcast.Asked by reporters in Washington if there had been any US involvement in their departure, a Trump administration official said they had “no insight right now on anything related to the Tate brothers”.Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer, and his brother, 36, had been under a travel ban since theirarrestalong with two Romanian women on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.Diicot launched asecond inquiry in Augustinto alleged crimes including forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.The brothers were among six people taken into custody then, when authorities ordered them to be placed under house arrest. The Tates and their suspected accomplices have denied all of the charges against them in both cases.The brothers are also wanted by UK authorities who have filed an extradition request over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012. A Romanian court has ruled that proceedings in Romania must be concluded first.In a joint statement, four British women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they felt “retraumatised” when they found out he had left Romania.“It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania,” the women said. “He will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.”The women had warned last week that the US government might push Romania to ease their travel restrictions, and the Financial Times has said Washington raised the Tates’ case with Romanian authorities.The women’s lawyer, Matthew Jury, told the BBC that they had been “the victims of the most horrible and horrific alleged crimes … And to see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser is incredibly traumatising.”The Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, confirmed that Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, had spoken to him about the brothers’ travel ban at this month’s Munich security conference.Hurezeanu said Grenell told him he was “interested in the fate of the Tate brothers”, but he said there was “no form of pressure, no threat” from the US side and that “things are perfectly clear as far as we are concerned”.Romania’s prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu, has also denied that the US made any request to Bucharest regarding “the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by Romanian authorities”, either during the conversation or after it.Tate has been banned from several social media platforms for misogynistic views and hate speech but has more than 10 million followers on X, where he promotes an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.In its second case against the brothers, Diicot alleges they used the so-called “loverboy” method – convincing people they are in a romantic relationship – to force 34 women into making pornography that was sold online for almost $3m (£2.1m).Diicot alleges one of the defendants forced a 17-year-old to produce pornography in Britain and Romania, creating profits of $1.5m, and also alleges that the defendant repeatedly had sexual relations with a 15-year-old.Speaking to journalists in Florida, Andrew Tate did not respond to a question about whether he and his brother intended to go back to Romania. Instead, he attacked what he said was a conspiracy against them, and blamed “media spin, smears and lies” for their position.“We’ve yet to be convicted of any kind of crime in our lives ever. We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said.“Our prosecutor recently decided, because we have no active indictment in court, to let us go. In the democratic society, it’s supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, as my brother and I are.”It was not immediately known where the Tate brothers were heading after leaving the airport.It is also unclear whether they will meet with Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach is about 45 miles (72km) north of Fort Lauderdale. The US president is scheduled to arrive in Florida on Friday for a weekend visit.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement was made a day after Hamas handed over the bodies of four Israeli hostages, the last due to be released under the terms of the six-week first phase of the deal agreed in January.Six hundred Palestinian prisoners and detainees who were supposed to be released over the weekendwere freed overnight on Wednesday, 46 of them women and children. Some had had limbs amputated while in Israeli custody, and many were emaciated.Stage one of the ceasefire is due to end on 2 March. Negotiations on how to implement the second stage – which would lead to a permanent end to the war – were supposed to begin weeks ago, but have been repeatedly postponed as the fragile truce has lurched from crisis to crisis.Both sides have accused the other of repeated violations of the agreement, which paused 15 months of fighting, allowing for a massive increase in aid supplies and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all positions other than border areas of the Gaza Strip. More than 48,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the conflict, which has reduced the territory to ruins and created a dire humanitarian crisis. About 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage in theHamasattack that prompted the war.Israel wants an extension to phase one of the deal in the renewed talks, government officials told Israeli media on Thursday. It is unclear what will happen if stage one expires on Sunday without an agreement on prolonging the first stage, whether the weekly batches of hostage swaps of stage one will continue, or for how long any extension will last.Opinion polls show that most Israelis are in favour of continuing the ceasefire in order to free the remaining 59 hostages, at least 39 of whom are believed to be dead. However, Netanyahu is loath to commit to the second stage of the truce because of pressure from most of his rightwing government to fulfil the war’s stated objective of “total victory” over Hamas. An extremist coalition partner has threatened to quit and collapse the government if Israel does not return to fighting, which would make the Israeli prime minister more vulnerable to corruption charges.In a statement on Thursday, Hamas said it was ready to begin talks on the second phase, and that the only way remaining hostages in Gaza would be freed was through “commitment to the ceasefire”.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, told reporters that the delegation would travel to Egypt to see whether there was common ground to negotiate an extension. “We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible, we’ll do that,” he said.The Associated Press reported on Thursday that Israeli officials had confirmed the country would not withdraw its forces from the Gaza-Egypt border zone, as per the ceasefire agreement, which could once again plunge the truce’s future into jeopardy.Hamas, responding to comments from Israel’s energy minister, Eli Cohen, in which he demanded the Israeli military remains on Gaza’s southern border, said that any Israeli attempt to maintain a buffer zone in the corridor would be a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement.In stage two of the deal, of uncertain duration, Israel is supposed to completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war, and talks on future governance of the strip should begin. Reconstruction is due to begin in stage three, but there are huge differences on both sides about Gaza’s future.Hamas has said it is willing to give up control of the Gaza Strip to other Palestinians, but its leadership refuses to go into exile. Israel maintains that it will not allow Hamas or the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to administer the territory when the war ends.Also on Thursday, a car-ramming in northern Israel injured 14 people, one critically, in an attack police said had been carried out by a 53-year-old Palestinian from Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The suspect was shot dead at the scene.Overnight, dozens of Palestinians were arrested by Israeli troops as part of an extended military operation across the West Bank that began two days after the truce in Gaza went into effect.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

They were arrested in 2013, but US authorities hadaccused themof continuing to run the Cartel del Noreste, the successor of Las Zetas, from prison.The extraditions come as Mexican delegations visit their counterparts in the US to negotiate another delay of Trump’s tariffs, the deadline for which is 4 March.Mexico will not stand US ‘invasion’ in fight against cartels, president saysRead moreRoughly 80% of Mexican exports go to the US, and experts say the tariffs could send the country into recession – though they would also hit the US economy and business interests too.Mexico won a one-month reprieve from the previous deadline by agreeing to send 10,000 soldiers to the US-Mexico border – even though it was unclear how the extra soldiers would reduce the flow of fentanyl, given that it is so potent that only relatively small volumes are moved, and that the great majority istrafficked through ports of entryby US citizens.Since then, the US has designated six Mexican organised crime groupsas foreign terrorist organisations(FTOs), ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure between the countries.While the designation of cartels as FTOs itself does not authorise US military action inMexico, some fear it is a first step towards it.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, warned that her countrywould not toleratean “invasion” of its national sovereignty by US forces.Mexico has stepped up its own actions against the Sinaloa cartel, one of the groups now considered a terrorist organisation by the US, arresting several significant figures in recent weeks.US spy drones have been operating over Mexico, feeding Mexican security forces information that assisted in the arrests, according to Gen Ricardo Trevilla, Mexico’s defence secretary.Explore more on these topicsMexicoDrugsTrump administrationDonald TrumpClaudia SheinbaumFentanylUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Police later discovered that he was a Brazilian national who had been attempting to retrieve drugs from a cargo ship’s hull.Both cases were eventually traced back to a crime syndicate founded more than 30 years ago in a São Paulo prison, which has become one of Brazil’s most powerful criminal organisations.The First Capital Command (PCC) now has a growing crime portfolio, with interests across Latin America including cocaine markets and illegal goldmines, and it controls a key drug-trafficking market to Europe.But it has also “significantly expanded its operations into Australia”, according to a newreportby theAustralian Strategic Policy Institutethinktank.And where once it confined itself to supplying drugs to local traffickers, “the PCC’s management of its Australian operations now appears to be markedly more hands-on”, the report found.“I wanted to understand how Brazilian criminal organisations are reaching so far,” said the report’s author, Lt Col Rodrigo Duton, a senior Brazilian police officer. “If organised crime knows no borders, we, as law enforcement, must follow the same path.”Australia’s illicit drug market, Duton said, presents a “compelling opportunity for transnational organised crime groups due to its high profitability and relative market stability”.Duton identifies the 2020 banana pulp seizure as the country’s first recorded instance of PCC activity. “But that doesn’t mean it hadn’t started earlier,” he said.ThePCC emerged in 1993as a prison gang in São Paulo – formed in response to a massacre in which police killed 111 inmates at theCarandirupenitentiary. In the following years, it expanded its operations through retail drug sales, eventually reaching the rest of the country.How a Brazilian prison gang became an international criminal leviathanRead moreOver time, it secured access to cocaine producers in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, and began exporting. “In the past 15 years, the PCC’s primary source of profit has shifted to cocaine exports,” said Bruno Paes Manso, a journalist and researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Centre for the Study of Violence.Although Europe remains the PCC’s primary consumer market, it has rapidly expanded into Africa and Asia due to its “very intelligent way of operating”, said Paes Manso.“Of course they use violence – and they’re just as cowardly as other criminal groups when there is conflict – but they also have a clear understanding that it’s a huge and highly profitable trade of billions of dollars … So they do not aim to control markets or territories beyond Brazil; they seek business partnerships,” he said.And that is what happened in Australia, where the PCC was attracted by an “emerging market”, said Duton, whose report notes that a kilogram of cocaine valued at £2,400 ($3,000) in Colombia can sell for £8,000 in Brazil, £37,000 to £50,000 in Europe, and £127,000 to £159,000 ($160,000 to $200,000) in Australia and New Zealand.The further the drugs are from the producing countries, the harder it is for them to reach their destination, prompting the PCC to diversify its methods of shipment. In addition to shipping containers – preferably with frozen goods, which makes inspections more difficult – they also use divers who attachwaterproof packagesto the hulls of ships and later retrieve them at the destination.The diver found dead in 2022 was later identified as Bruno Borges Martins, who, before the expedition, worked performing underwater repairs on vessels in Santos, the Brazilian city home to the largest port in Latin America – through which thePCC exportsa significant portion of its drugs.Police are still seeking another Brazilian, Jhoni Fernandes Da Silva, identified as Martins’ accomplice in the operation. James Blake Blee, a superyacht tourism operator from Queensland, was charged with organising and facilitating their illegal entry into the country. He pleaded guilty to importing the drugs and wasconvictedin November by an Australian court.Duton believes the PCC’s presence in Australia is still in its early stages but he cautioned that it has significant potential for growth. He believes the group’s expansion can only be contained through strengthened cooperation between Australian and Brazilian police, enhanced border security and a focus on money-laundering operations.Paes Manso argued that the only solution was drug regulation. “Simply banning drugs and imprisoning criminals is not working, and the state never wins because people keep consuming drugs,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeBrazilOrganised crimeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But he expressed hope that businesses in Canada would not want to be seen giving in to trends started in Trump’s US.“They know that diversity is important for innovation and creativity and key to gaining a competitive advantage,” he says. “Employers, however, need to better understand how to leverage a diverse workforce simply having diversity is not enough.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTorontoAmericasLGBTQ+ rightsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A group of older Kurdish peace activists ululated as the call to lay down arms was read out.“This is the breaking point of history and it is a positive one,” said Sırrı Süreyya Önder of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party. “We are here with a compass to find a possible route out of these dark, chaotic days.”Önder hinted at some of the potential problems to come, adding that while Öcalan called for the PKK’s dissolution and to lay down arms, this “requires the recognition of democratic politics”, and legal support for a sustained peace.DEM politicians said they were hoping for a reprieve in government pressure after the announcement. Authorities in Ankara have sought to replace politicians and mayors affiliated to the group, particularly in the majority-Kurdish south-east.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government has sought unilateral disarmament from the PKK, publicly quashing suggestions that Öcalan’s announcement would herald the start of peace talks.Some in government responded to Öcalan’s announcement with caution. “We will look at the result,” said the deputy head of Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party.The PKK has been responsible for a string of attacks since its founding in 1978, notably car bombings and shootings primarily aimed at Turkish military and security targets. The group claimed responsibility for an attack on a state-owned arms company near Ankara last October, killing at least five people and wounding 22 more.A ceasefire between the PKK and Turkey collapsed in 2015, prompting Ankara to renew attacks on the group using drones and airstrikes, targeting fighters across the mountains of northern Iraq. The International Crisis Group thinktank estimates thatmore than 7,152 people have been killedin clashes or attacks in Turkey and northern Iraq in the years since, including 646 civilians, more than 4,000 militants, and almost 1,500 members of Turkish security forces.Öcalan’s message will ripple across factions of Kurdish armed groups spread across north-eastern Syria and northernIraqwith links to the PKK, particularly the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who battled IS militants and remain in control of a swath of territory including two large cities in eastern Syria.The group is in talks with the new authority in Damascus after theoverthrow of the former president Bashar al-Assad, negotiating control over north-eastern Syria as well as their future role in a nationwide military force. Öcalan’s announcement is likely to further pressure and isolate the SDF, who have clashed with Turkish-backed militias in Syria and long been targeted by Turkish strikes.“The announcement for PKK to dissolve and lay down its arms, to be clear this only concerns the PKK and is nothing related to us here in Syria,” the SDF commander-in-chief, Mazloum Abdi, told a press conference.Even so Abdi said should peace flourish between Ankara and the PKK, it would remove any pretext for Turkish attacks on areas under SDF control. Negotiations with Damascus remain their “top priority,” he added.Gönül Töl, an analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said Öcalan most likely decided the time was right to call for an end to hostilities as “he thinks things are not going well for the PKK right now”.“It’s about his legacy,” she said. “He wants to be the one who ended this fight, and the PKK doesn’t have many options. There is a new authority in Syria, and the SyrianKurdsdon’t have a strong hand. In Iraq, there’s a new central government that is more willing to work with Turkey to squeeze the PKK.”Berkay Mandıracı, of the International Crisis Group, said the PKK appeared to be “weakened” after a decade of intensive fighting.“Turkish officials now appear to assess it is a good time to end the 40-year conflict with the PKK through a mix of military force and political manoeuvring,” he said, spurred by regional shifts across the Middle East. With Ankara poised to play a major role in Syria and the wider region, he said, Turkish officials wanted to remove any potential impediments.Rumours of a declaration have rumbled for months while the DEM party shuttled between different Kurdish factions and Öcalan’s island prison for negotiations.How the different factions within the PKK might respond to Öcalan’s call also remained opaque. Thehead of the Syrian branch of the PKK told Al Arabiyathat disarmament must be accompanied by the group being “allowed to work politically”.“If the reasons for carrying weapons disappear, we will lay them down,” he said, adding that Turkish attacks necessitated the group carrying weapons. The group would consult among themselves about how to implement Öcalan’s call, he said.Earlier this month,one PKK commander told a television channelclose to the faction that much of the group would only regard the command as serious if Öcalan demanded they disarm after walking free from prison.“This work cannot be done only through a call,” he said. “We are a movement with tens of thousands of armed people. These fighters are not on a payroll to be sacked. These are ideological fighters.” Öcalan, he said, “has to speak while free. If not, how can [PKK militants] be convinced to lay down their arms?”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyKurdsIraqSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The singerKaty Perrywill join the television host Gayle King, the civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, the movie producer Kerianne Flynn, the formerNasarocket scientist Aisha Bowe and Bezos’s fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, on a short hop from a west Texas launchpad this spring.The 11th crewed mission of its New Shepard capsule, which the billionaire’s space company announced ina press release, will mark the first time since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova’s solo flight in 1963 that no men have been aboard a human-crewed spaceflight leaving Earth, Blue Origin said.Sánchez, a former journalist, author and pilot who became engaged to Bezos last year, picked the crew and has been instrumental in arranging the 10-minute flight, according to the statement. Perry, one of the bestselling musical artists of all time, is also a philanthropist and United Nations goodwill ambassador for children.Space station’s lack of dirt may damage astronauts’ health, says studyRead moreKing, who co-hosts the CBS Mornings news show,played a videoon the program on Thursday to preview her flight. “You can’t possibly go up there and not come back unchanged,” she said.Nguyen and Bowe, meanwhile, have both previously worked for Nasa. Bowe is now chief executive of the engineering company STEMBoard and founder of Lingo, an initiative to provide technology education and equipment to students.Since leaving Nasa, where she worked in research and on the final space shuttle mission in 2011 as an intern, Nguyen, an astrophysicist, has become a vocal advocate for survivors of sexual violence, and has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize and Time’s person of the year.Describing her as the first Vietnamese and south-east Asian female astronaut,Blue Originsaid Nguyen’s flight was “a symbol of reconciliation between the US and Vietnam, and will highlight science as a tool for peace”.The flight for Sánchez means both she and Bezos will have flown aboard New Shepard.

The private swimming pool; the lush, landscaped terrace with firepit; the long dining table with its expansive balcony view; the pingpong table; the piano.But the jewel in the crown, according to the Airbnb listing, is the experience of watching the sun rise over the nearby mountains from the luxury of the generous master bedroom.The villa with views of the Judean mountains is in a settlement located on land seized from Palestinians and considered illegal under international humanitarian law.Only a handful of Palestinians are allowed to enter this, and other, Israeli settlements in theWest Bank, usually as labourers with special permits.Exclusive analysis carried out by the Guardian found 760 rooms being advertised in hotels, apartments and other holiday rentals in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on two of the world’s most popular tourism websites.Taken together, the listings that appear on either Airbnb or Booking.com could host more than 2,000 people as of August 2024. The villa was just one of them.“Tekoa is a quiet, respectful and diverse, residential community,” reads the listing. There is no mention of the recent confrontations just outside the town, involving guns, clubs, knives and dogs, which have forced neighbouring Palestinians off their land. In a four-mile radius around Tekoaat least 100 Palestinians have been forced outsince 2023. The rate of violence and land grabs in the area has escalated dramatically since the start of the war in Gaza.Despite the recent violence, Tekoa – an area known for its natural beauty, organic farms, the nearby Israeli-administered Nahal Tekoa nature reserve and Herodion national park – was the settlement in the West Bank with the highest number of listed holiday rentals on Airbnb outside East Jerusalem.Loading...In total the Guardian identified almost 350 properties – 321 of them houses, apartments or rooms listed on Airbnb, and 26 hotels on Booking.com – across the West Bank including East Jerusalem, as of 30 August 2024.Hotel rooms or holiday rentals listed on both sites were counted only once. Duplicates were removed by assigning holiday lets (those in apartments and houses) as Airbnbs and hotel rooms asBooking.com. Looking at listings instead of properties, there were 402 in total across the West Bank including East Jerusalem – 350 on Airbnb and 52 onBooking.com.The Airbnb listings found by the Guardian analysis include 18 situated in outposts – settlements considered illegal under international law and also not officially authorised by the Israeli government and against Israeli law.‘War crimes are not a tourist attraction’By operating in settlements, multinational companies including Booking.com and Airbnb are violating international law, human rights activists warn. Booking.com and Airbnb are among16 non-Israeli companies identified by the UNas having ties to Israeli settlements in the West Bank.“Any company doing business in Israel’s illegal settlements is enabling a war crime and helping to prop up Israel’s system of apartheid,” Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s crisis response manager, said in response to the Guardian’s findings.“With Israeli military forces and settlers having killed and injured huge numbers of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank including East Jerusalem in the last 15 months, tourist companies are making themselves complicit in a blood-soaked system of Israeli war crimes and systematic repression.“War crimes are not a tourist attraction – Airbnb, Booking.com and the wider business community should immediately sever all links with Israel’s illegal occupation and ongoing annexation of Palestinian territory.”Sari Bashi, programme director at Human Rights Watch, said that, in allowing properties in Israeli settlements to be listed on their sites, “Airbnb and Booking.com are contributing to land grabs, crippling movement restrictions and even the forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, abuses that Israeli authorities commit in order to maintain oppression and domination over Palestinians as part of the crime against humanity of apartheid”.“Businesses should not enable, facilitate, or profit from serious violations of international law. The time has come for both companies to stop doing business in the occupied territories on stolen land.”The companies’ hosting of listings on occupied Palestinian territory has also attracted legal challenges. Dutch prosecutors are continuing to investigate a criminal complaint against Booking.com over its listing of rental properties in Israeli settlements, with no decision made as to whether to take further action.The Dutch non-profit organisation the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (Somo) filed the complaint with the Dutch public prosecutor in November 2023. In the complaint Booking.com is accused of “profiting from war crimes by facilitating the rental of vacation homes on land stolen from the indigenous Palestinian population”.Last month the group submittedfresh evidenceto Dutch prosecutors alleging that since filing the initial complaint, Booking.com had “significantly expanded” its listings in the occupied West Bank.Lydia de Leeuw of Somo, who leads the complaint, told the Guardian: “We can see from the continued [Booking.com] listings … in the occupied Palestinian territory that they have no intention whatsoever of stopping doing what they are doing.”In a landmark advisory opinion in July 2024 theUN’s international court of justiceordered Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territories, saying that its presence there violated international law. It also advised member states not to recognise the occupation as legal, or to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation.West Bank tourism in the holiday rental eraThe settler claim that the stolen land is now Israeli can be seen in the Airbnb listings. Two in five Airbnb properties on Israeli settlements listed their location as Israel – not the occupiedPalestinian territories– in their title, addresses or location details, and only two listings explicitly mentioned they were on Palestinian land. Three-quarters of them mentioned the name of the settlement in the title, name or location.As of 30 August, just five of the 26 hotels listed in Israeli settlements on Booking.com explicitly mentioned in their address or description that they were located on Palestinianterritory.Airbnb announced in November 2018 it would remove about 200 listings in theoccupied West Bank, but the companyreversed its decisionmonths later after Israeli lawyers filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of hosts and others against removing the listings. The company has said it donates profits from the areato aid organisations.A 2019Amnesty Internationalreport said the Israeli government had been increasing its support to the tourism industry linked to settlements and it has constructed “many of its settlements close to archaeological sites to make the link between the modern state of Israel and its Jewish history explicit”.“The designation of certain locations as tourist sites is also used by the Israeli government to justify the takeover of Palestinian land and homes”, resulting in forced evictions and restrictions on Palestinians to expand their homes or cultivate the land, the report said.Israel’s policy of exploiting historical and religious sites as well as areas of natural beauty, designated nature reserves and national parks on the West Bank for international tourism went hand in hand with de-developing the Palestinian tourism industry, said a2017 report on the Israeli tourism sectorby the Israeli NGO Who Profits. For example, only 0.3% of licensed tour guides permitted to lead tours in Israel and the West Bank are Palestinians, despite nearly 40% of tourist sites visited by international tourists to Israel in 2014 being located in occupied Palestinian territory.Violence in the West Bank since October 2023Since the 2023 Gaza war began,violence has increasedsignificantly in the West Bank. A total of 881 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank in the 10 years before 7 October 2023, and 877 have been killed in the 16 months since to 11 Feb 2025, according toUN data. Out of that number, 857 were killed by the Israeli military. That compares with 32 Israeli deaths in the West Bank since October 2023, 21 of them soldiers.The destruction of Palestinian properties in the West Bank has also escalated in the past two years,data from B’Tselemshows. Between 2006 and 2024, Israel made 9,700 people homeless in the West Bank by demolishing their houses, a number that reached its highest yearly total in 2024, when 841 properties were demolished and 953 people made homeless.Airbnb and Booking.com’s responsesAirbnb has refused to disclose how much it has donated to humanitarian organisations since 2019, when it reversed its decision to remove rental listings of homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Announcing the reversal, the US company said it would transfer all proceeds from all rentals in the West Bank to humanitarian organisations. The proceeds have gone to the Institute for Economics and Peace, an international thinktank headquartered in Sydney, Australia.An Airbnb spokesperson said: “Since 2019, Airbnb has donated all profits generated from host activity in the West Bank to an international nonprofit. We will continue this approach as part of our global framework on disputed territories.”A spokesperson for Booking.com said: “The war in Gaza and the increasing violence in the West Bank, Lebanon and Israel are heartbreaking, and we have been terribly saddened by the extreme pain, suffering and losses that so many people in the region are enduring. Our thoughts are with all those impacted and we sincerely hope for an end to the violence.“Our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and as such we believe it’s up to travellers to choose where they want and need to go. It’s not our place to decide where someone can or cannot travel.“Unfortunately, there are many parts of the world where there are conflicts or disputes, which is why we want to make sure travellers are well-informed when making their plans. If a particular region can be categorised as disputed or impacted by conflict, we add information to our platform to help ensure that travellers can make a well-informed choice, or at least consult their government’s official travel advisories as part of their decision-making process.”Additional graphics work byTural AhmedzadeandPablo Gutiérrez"

He has about as much sex appeal as your balding brother-in-law. He dreams fondly of retiring. He’s aware that somebody, somewhere made a big mistake.Never mindThe French Connection, and Hackman’s Best Actor Oscar. ForgetThe Poseidon Adventure, top grosser of 1973. Hackman doesn’t believe it for one minute. He works hard, humbly and honestly on about three pictures a year, which is about three times what the average star does. He can’t believe he’s already got the brass ring, so he keeps on going round and round.“I’ve made six films in the past two years. I gotta stop that. I need six months rest. You start drying up after a while. It all seems like the same movie.”Gene Hackman and pianist wife Betsy Arakawa found dead at home with their dogRead moreHackman runs a hand through his hair and leans forward in his canvas chair. He can’t really relax even when he allows himself a few minutes off duty. He warns he won’t be talking very candidly. “I’m afraid I’ll waste it. It’s all supposed to be going into the movie.” He adds apologetically, “Whatever it is I have to offer.”Melancholic, serious, weary, Hackman is taking five at three o’clock in the morning in the courtyard of a deserted factory in Marseille, where he’s on location shooting a sequel to TheFrench Connection. The sequel is unashamedly titled French Connection II.Since filming the Cannes film festival first prize winnerThe Conversation, last year, Hackman has made Zandy’s Bride, playing the husband of mail order bride Liv Ullmann; The Dark Tower, a private eye picture directed by Arthur (Bonnie and Clyde) Penn; Bite The Bullet, a western; and now French Connection II.So here Hackman is being man-handled down a rickety three-fight fire escape in the custody of a couple of Marseille thugs. The villains commit unspeakable acts upon his person and then shove him in a car and drive him away. This sequence is repeated over and over, so the camera can catch it from several angles. It isn’t an easy way for anybody to make a living.“I would prefer not to be making this picture. I was contracted to do the sequel over two years ago, when I was making Poseidon. As they say, it seemed like a good idea at the time.”“I don’t mean to do a poor-mouth job on the sequel. Three years ago, after the original French Connection was completed, I talked toBilly Friedkin, the director, about what kind of film we’d made. Either it was a masterful art film or it was an adventure film. Yet somehow it was both. This one may very well be as good as the first one. Even if it’s better, there will inevitably be comparisons, since the first one was so fresh. Since then there have been many number of police films, and some were good ones.”Back when Hackman agreed to do the sequel, he didn’t rate script approvals. “That doesn’t mean they haven’t taken my advice when I gave it. Reasonable deals are made by reasonable men. At that point in my career I only had director or cast approval, whichever I desired.”Hackman desired director approval and he ended up approving John Frankenheimer, formerly well known as an egomaniac, even now has trouble keeping his tongue in check except with Hackman, who is consulted on every camera set-up.Hackman had a hard time of it after he made The French Connection. For nine months he was out of work. Who knew this supposedly routine cops ‘n’ robbers pic would gross $38m domestically? “I was waiting for something to happen.” Nothing happened, so he did Prime Cut, playing a meat-packing baddy who ground his opponent into frankfurters.When The French Connection came out and immediately caught fire, Hackman became the man of the hour. Studios waved contracts in his face and he signed a few of them. But he resisted what he calls “the star thing”.Gene Hackman: the star of every scene he was inRead moreThe “Gene who?” problem plagued Hackman most of his life. He ran away from home at age 16 to join the Marines. He served two years in China, “I made corporal several times,” he says wryly of his uneasy youth. He got out of the Corps and immediately was called back during the Korean war. Afterwards he went to Illinois University and then into the television industry as an administrator and technician. Eventually he attended school in Pasadena, California; a relic of 30 in a classful of youngsters. Dustin Hoffman was there at the same time.Hackman went to New York to get on the stage. “In those days l had only small goals. To go from $48 a week off-Broadway to $90 a week as a supernumerary on Broadway seemed like stealing. Actually I missed one step – I went straight into a supporting part on Broadway. Wow. Life was simpler then and full of wonderments.”Life got a little more complicated, but not much, when he played a one scene part in Lilith with Warren Beatty in 1964. Three years went by before Beatty cast Hackman inBonnie and Clyde, a movie that made a star out of everybody connected with it. Hackman got the first of his two Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominations. But he had to wade through nine more “Gene who?” pictures before getting the part of Popeye Doyle in The French Connection in 1971.Now that he’s one of the half-dozen best-paid actors in Hollywood, Hackman has an enormous temptation to become remote and unapproachable. By all accounts he doesn’t. He behaves like the guy next door who’s always dropping in with a six-pack can of beers on warm summer evenings. Not exactly a barrel of fun, Hackman, but a good citizen.“At moments it’s kinda fun to be acclaimed, and all that,” says Hackman, picking up a wire coat hanger and twisting it in his hands. Maybe it’s because of the ungodly hour, but he talks as if acclaim is just another chain to drag along behind him. He is a man of few smiles. Unlike most people, he is too objective about himself for comfort. As he says on the subject of playing the part of the quiet, troubled eavesdropper in The Conversation, “Every time I had fun, I knew I was wrong.”“Most people who really want to be stars had that personality to begin with. That enormous monster was there all the time – it was one of the things that drove them to success. It didn’t with me. For a long, long time I was very naive about what was possible.”Gene Hackman: a life in picturesRead moreTo a compulsive like Hackman, attaining stardom simply meant that more was asked of him. “The responsibility for the film falls on the leading actor. If people don’t like the picture they blame it on him. It’s unfair, but it’s a fact.”Hackman’s coat hanger is now knotted into a double figure of eight. “I wouldn’t mind retiring. Maybe it’s not entirely fair to say that, if I was completely rested. I only had 10 days between the end of the last picture and the start of this one”.“I’d like to do just one picture a year. But it’s very difficult to stay hot enough and still do the one picture you want to do at the price you want. I don’t really know if I am what they call ‘hot’ ‘You don’t know where you are. You only know what people tell you.”Bart MillsView image in fullscreenGuardian interview with Gene Hackman, 21 October 1971.Photograph: The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanFrom the Guardian archiveFrench ConnectionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The weather still rages outside, but it’s calm within the cavern that lies at the end of the path. You can tell, from the environment, what kind of creature lives here: the Rey Dau, a horned wyvern that commands the elements.You’ve seen it before, when it appeared unexpectedly while you were out on another expedition, descending from lightning-streaked skies to sink its claws into an unfortunate pack of shaggy, lion-like creatures. You weren’t strong enough to face it then, but you are now. Hopefully.The fight that ensues is nail-biting. You have to pull out every trick you know to wear it down, trying to dive out of the path of powerful bolts of electricity, as well as the wyvern’s horns and teeth. You fire your grappling hook at a rocky outcrop hanging from the ceiling, bringing it down on the creature. You whistle for your mount, leaping from its back on to the dragon’s head, clinging on and stabbing with a dagger as it tries to smash you against the walls. You are sent flying, you are fried, you are stomped upon, but you cling on and keep fighting, chugging restorative potions at every opportunity.Watch the trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds.Then an even bigger predator appears from nowhere, takes the monster you’ve just fought desperately for 25 minutes in its jaws and tosses it around like a rag doll. Take a good look at it: that’s what you’ll be fighting next.Monster Hunter Wilds’ 15-hour story is a series of escalating epic battles against ever bigger and more ferocious creatures. It does not let up for a second. Within a few hours, you will have fought an awful giant spider, a sinuous sand-dragon and a disgusting, overgrown oil-chicken. Later, you will face a furious fire-ape and a dragon that shoots lightning from its face, plus particularly nasty and dangerous versions of beasts from the previous 20 years’ worth of Monster Hunter games. It’s quite literally all killer, no filler, a far cry from the slow and ponderous older games, in which you had to spend hours gathering mushrooms and fighting raptors before you got anywhere near a wyvern.The battles are relentlessly awesome; when a monster fell, I would let out a breath that I didn’t even realise I had been holding in. No game has ever made me feel like Monster Hunter does, with the possible exception of Dark Souls and its brethren. The adrenaline of these fights, the peerless, perfectly balanced feel of the oversized weapons and the sheer viciousness and majesty of the creatures makes this game feel incomparably thrilling, even though I have been playing it in some form since I was a teenager. And it is just so much better-looking than it was back then: not just the monsters, but also their huge natural habitats, which ripple and teem with life.View image in fullscreen‘The monsters’ huge natural habitats teem with life.’Photograph: CapcomI must admit that towards the end of Wilds’ story I felt some disappointment start to creep in. I had enjoyed nearly every one of these creature clashes, which are wrapped in dramatic, beautifully rendered cutscenes that spin a cool-looking if rather insubstantial story. But I hadn’t had much of a challenge. Admittedly, I have a lot of experience with these games, but I am used to getting eaten or torn to bits a few times by a new monster before I conquer it; in the entirety of Wilds’ campaign, I was knocked out only twice.It turns out, however, that Wilds’ story is essentially a 15-hour interactive tutorial on what makes Monster Hunter awesome, a rollercoaster of fighting thrills presumably designed to sell newcomers on the concept and give veterans a taste of the scale and visual splendour that Capcom’s modern game engine has brought to their favourite series. The real fun starts afterwards.After taking on the biggest, baddest creature I had ever seen, in the final quest of the story, I was dumped back into a base camp in the jungle and sent out to capture a small, fire-spitting raptor. I was immediately humbled; embarrassingly, it knocked me out, because I had become lazy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about teaming up with other hunters, complementing each other’s play styles, as more experienced players help the rookies through. Being a friend’s Monster Hunter mentor is one of the most rewarding multiplayer gaming experiences out there.This game can’t be reduced to a series of fights. It is a world, an ecosystem, a community of players. You are part hunter, part nature researcher. Wilds leans too far towards frictionless fun in its story, but once I was free to explore more I started to feel more connected to the habitat. Instead of being guided by the nose – or by my ostrich-dino steed – from battle to battle I was climbing up into the canopy and scouting for creatures, getting my binoculars out, discovering hidden corners for campsites and underwater caves full of useful materials. I found I had to switch weapons more frequently, upgrade my armour, reacquaint myself with the baffling array of jewels and doodads that gave my hunter useful extra skills.You could pick Wilds up as a newcomer and have a tremendous time playing through the story. You could stop there and it would still be worth the price of admission. But I will be playing it for alongtime yet.Monster Hunter Wilds is out on 28 February; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Solo, he has variously spawned an entire sub-genre more or less singlehanded (the sample-heavy sound of his acclaimed 2007 albumPerson Pitcheffectively gave birth to chillwave), collaborated with Daft Punk,Solange, Paramore and Jamie xx, commissioned dub albums from On-U Sound’s Adrian Sherwood, and dabbled in a stark acoustic sound on 2019’sBuoys.View image in fullscreenPanda Bear: Sinister GriftLennox and Kember’s collaborative album,Reset, united two generations of psychedelic experimentalists in a charmingly playful musical dialogue. Among its delights was a track called Whirlpool. It sounded beatific and blissed-out, but on closer examination seemed to depict a failing relationship: Lennox later confirmed that his marriage to fashion designer Fernanda Pereira – who directed the videos that accompanied Reset – had collapsed.It’s tempting to view Whirlpool as a starting point for Lennox’s new album, Sinister Grift. Much as Lennox has cautioned against viewing it purely as an album about divorce – a kind of lysergicBlood on the Tracksfor Pitchfork readers – it’s hard not to. Lennox’s voice is stripped of the echo and electronic effects it’s frequently been coated with in the past: rather than simply one part of a disorienting wash of sound, it renders what he has to say very clear and direct, and there’s no getting around the fact that what he has to say sounds pretty despairing.“I can’t let go, can’t say goodbye / A residue in spite of you,” he sings on Anywhere But Here, while his daughter adds spoken-word vocals in Portuguese. “Thought we’d be friends again … we can, but we don’t,” go the lyrics to Ferry Lady. “The days we spent, now we don’t care … weren’t we saying our vow?”Initially at least, the lyrics are pitched against music that’s not just richly melodic, but incongruously sun-kissed. On Praise, bright melodies are thick with Beach Boys harmonies; there are relaxed rhythms that are Latin-infused (Ends Meet) or tinted with reggae (50mg), and the occasional hint of city pop, the lush disco-adjacent Japanese AOR of the early 80s. Just As Well features Lennox struggling to “get unstuck from the dark side” over a backing that sounds like a jaunty but forgotten mid-70s pop hit, the kind of thing that might have been belatedly exhumed for the soundtrack of Guardians of the Galaxy.But then, just after Sinister Grift’s midpoint, the album begins to shift: the tempo dramatically drops, the vague hint of melancholy that underpins even Animal Collective’s most euphoric moments – the slight scent of sadness that you catch during My Girls’ lovestruck paean to fatherhood, or Fireworks’ giddy chaos – seems to gradually overwhelm its sound.Venom’s In pitches a tune that sounds like a sigh against a backdrop of hazy guitar textures; Left in the Cold is foggier and chillier still. They turn out to be merely preparation for the six minutes plus of Elegy for Noah Lou, which recalls the late 60s albums on which the psychological wreckage wrought by the psychedelic era began washing up. Based around a repeated guitar figure that occasionally turns discordant, or threatens to break down amid splashes of synthesised white noise, it carries something of the fragile, halting quality of Skip Spence’s Oar or Syd Barrett’s The Madcap Laughs, and like those albums it has the uncomfortable feel of overhearing something rather than listening to it.This is a bold, risky way to sequence an album: listeners entranced by the pop smarts of its opening tracks may give up and turn Sinister Grift off as the whole thing dissolves into mournful, introspective and abstract territory, returning only to cherry-pick the more user-friendly moments for a playlist. But if you pay attention to the words, you can’t say Lennox didn’t warn you, and for those minded to stick with it, there’s something striking and believable about its emotional arc: you don’t have to be recently divorced to recognise the sensation of trying to gee yourself through tough times but instead being consumed by darkness and doubt.Psych-pop utopians Elephant 6: ‘Our plan was to humiliate the corporate rock industry’Read moreThe journey leaves the listener in an uncertain place. Closing track Defense is more muscular than the ghostly tones that immediately precede it, but something of Elegy for Noah Lou’s haunted, halting quality remains. The beat lumbers, and there’s a great guitar solo courtesy ofCanadian indie sensation Cindy Leethat would sound uplifting were it not slightly buried in the mix. “I’m trying to reset what’s inside my mind, the best place I can occupy,” Lennox sings. Then he repeats the line “here I come” over and over, a flicker of optimism at the end of a turbulent journey: tagging along is a curious and curiously powerful experience.This week Alexis listened toThe Limiñanas – Space BabyThe French duo’s latest album reaffirms their garage/psych credentials – it even includes a version of Louie Louie – while Space Baby has guest Jon Spencer on fabulously bug-eyed form.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockPsychedeliaAnimal Collectivealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Wu-Tang Clan hint at breakupByAlexis PetridisThu 27 Feb 2025 10.05 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 17.10 ESTShare20. Method Man – Tical 2000: Judgement Day (1998)Method Man’s second album is preposterously long, hopelessly uneven and featuresnineskits (one featuring a guest appearance by – uh-oh – Donald Trump). But make a playlist of the best 12 tracks – including Dangerous Grounds, Judgement Day and Break Ups 2 Make Ups – and you’ve got a minor classic.19. Ol’ Dirty Bastard – Nigga Please (1999)As chaotic and scattered as its author’s life had become by the time of its release, Nigga Please is the kind of album that requires the listener to let go and submit to its bizarre internal logic: garbled off-rhythm rhymes and jarring sonic leaps from taut Neptunes productions to grimy RZA-isms and more. It’s a mess, but it’s never boring.18. Czarface – Every Hero Needs a Villain (2015)Teaming up with underground Boston duo 7L & Esoteric seemed to reinvigorate Inspectah Deck after years of diminishing solo returns. They deal in understated (and audibly RZA-influenced) boom-bap beats and richly entertaining battle rapping, while Method Man and GZA turn in superb guest verses. Nothing unexpected, but preposterously good, dirty fun nonetheless.17. RZA – Bobby Digital in Stereo (1998)Released to a muted response – and currently unavailable on streaming – RZA’s left-turn into a keyboard-based and less sample-heavy production style deserves reconsideration. The concept makes no sense and the lyrics of Domestic Violence are indefensible, but its highlights shine very brightly indeed: the slinky Love Jones and My Lovin’ Is Digi, plus the killer NYC Everything, featuring Method Man.View image in fullscreenSign o’ the times … Wu-Tang’s Raekwon, GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, RZA and Method Man in New York, 1993.Photograph: Al Pereira/Getty Images16. Masta Killa – No Said Date (2004)If Masta Killa had released his solo debut in the mid-90s, it might have been acclaimed among the great Wu-Tang masterpieces. A decade on, the main criticism was that it was old-fashioned. That is not strictly true – see the synthy, dancefloor-focused Digi Warfare – but when it’s defiantly retro, it’s high-quality retro: pared-down RZA production underneath skilled and urgent rhymes.15. Method Man & Redman – Blackout! (1999)Devotees of the stoner movie How High might disagree, but the Meth-Redman partnership never functioned better than on their collaborative debut. Rugged, straight-ahead beats, ultra-aggressive rhymes, a plethora of lyrical references to old school hip-hop – EPMD, LL Cool J, MC Shan, Run DMC – and the sense of two artists meeting at the top of their game.14. Ghostface Killah – The Pretty Toney Album (2004)The first Wu Tang solo album without an appearance from another member, but no matter: this is an underrated masterpiece, thick with lush, emotive soul samples (Holla is basically the Delfonics’ La La Means I Love You with Ghostface rapping over the whole thing, vocals and all) and abundant on-point rhymes.13. Wu-Tang Clan – The W (2000)Stripped back compared with its 27-track predecessor, The W still could have used a nip and tuck. That said, there is far more good than bad, and when it’s good – Do You Really (Thang Thang), Let My Niggas Live – it’s startlingly intense. Also, the relatively poppy Gravel Pit was the last truly incredibleWu-Tang Clansingle.View image in fullscreen(From left) U-God, Ghostface Killah and Inspectah Deck on stage, 2008.Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns12. Ghostface Killah – Ironman (ft Raekwon and Cappadonna) (1996)Ghostface seemed willing to share the limelight here – he isn’t even on Assassination Day – but Ironman feels like a project distinct from contemporary Wu-Tang releases. The sound is dominated by 70s soul (Motherless Child presages Kanye West’s early “chipmunk” productions) and the lyrics consistently lash out.11. Raekwon – Only Built 4 Cuban Linx … Part II (2009)Most sequel albums smack of desperation: an artist frantically trying to regain the form that made them special. But the sequel to one of the greatest Wu-Tang albums doesn’t shame the original. Its return to the crime empire saga is dazzling in scope, its production so strong that Dr Dre’s tracks are the weak link.10. Inspectah Deck – Uncontrolled Substance (1999)“Weak MCs – take me to your leader!” Overshadowed by his better-know bandmates, his debut solo album – thick with freestyle interludes – fully revealed Inspectah Deck as an intricately skilled rapper who blended underworld storytelling with a homespun philosophical bent. The guests are largely drawn from Wu-Tang’s fringes and the music – frequently Deck’s own work – slaps throughout.View image in fullscreenRaekwon performs in Brooklyn, 2011.Photograph: Al Pereira/WireImage9. Gravediggaz – 6 Feet Deep (1994)You wouldn’t expect an album that, at heart, consists of kvetching about the music business to be so captivating. But RZA and Prince Paul’s Gravediggaz project turned their dissatisfaction into a series of lurid blackly comic slasher-flick metaphors set to dark, minor-chord soundscapes, helping to birth horrorcore in the process.8. Wu-Tang Clan – Wu-Tang Forever (1997)The epitome of late 90s hip-hop grandiloquence? Maybe. Wu-Tang Forever lasts more than two hours. Nobody is good enough to maintain your interest for that long – you could live without ODB’s dispiritingly titled Dog Shit – but Wu-Tang Forever is surprisingly focused, socially conscious, cinematic and worth revisiting (time permitting).7. Ghostface Killah – Fishscale (2006)By far the most consistent member of Wu-Tang, Ghostface was making fantastic albums long after his bandmates’ quality control had slipped. There is nothing original about Fishscale’s crack dealer concept, but from J Dilla’s and MF Doom’s beats to the sophistication of the storytelling, the execution is magnificent.6. Method Man – Tical (1994)One theory suggests that Tical wasn’t meant to sound the way it does; it was rushed or poorly mastered. But the foggy sound works, amplifying its star’s gritty approach. Bring the Pain is the characteristic classic, while All I Need is gruffly romantic, an aspect highlighted by the superb remix featuring Mary J Blige.View image in fullscreenRZA(centre)with other members of the Wu-Tang Clan in 2000.Photograph: Ken Hively/LA Times/Getty Images5. Ol’ Dirty Bastard – Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (1995)The cocktail of mental instability and drug abuse that ultimately led to his death looms large over ODB’s legacy: it’s worth remembering what an incredible, unique rapper he was. His slurred, unpredictable approach was groundbreaking and his solo debut is the best way to hear it. The instrumentals are a perfect complement.4. Ghostface Killah – Supreme Clientele (2000)Just as Wu-Tang faltered, Ghostface unleashed his greatest album. Inspired by a trip to Africa – and a flood in RZA’s studio that caused a production reset – it was a defiant restatement of intent in a climate dominated byMurder Inc’s softer approach. Ghostface is hilarious and hard-hitting; just check the awesome Apollo Kids.3. Genius/GZA – Liquid Swords (1995)“We were on a roll,” offered GZA of his contribution to the triumvirate of unimpeachable Wu-Tang classics, in which the collective’s most finessed and methodical MC – alongside RZA at his most atmospheric – conjure up an authentically eerie album, its lyrics packed with elaborate metaphors. Utterly compelling from start to finish.2. Raekwon – Only Built 4 Cuban Linx … (1995)When Raekwon’s solo debut arrived weeks before Liquid Swords, it seemed Wu-Tang could do no wrong. Its mobster fantasy concept works perfectly; the rhymes are vivid and complex; the creative sparks between Raekwon and Ghostface fly; and RZA’s production is risky but impeccable. It’s one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever made.1. Wu-Tang Clan – Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993)Any of the top three albums here could occupy the No 1 spot: qualitatively, there is nothing between them; they are as extraordinary as each other. Enter the Wu-Tang edges it simply for the gamechanging shock it delivered on release. A blast of dank New York air at the height of the super-smooth G-funk era, everything from its complex mythology to its rule-breaking production to its idiosyncratic MCing felt unprecedented and electrifying: nothing else sounded like it. Packed with career-defining classics – Protect Ya Neck, C.R.E.A.M., Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit – it still sounds remarkable today.Explore more on these topicsRankedWu-Tang ClanRapHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As those two shows indicate, her career defied easy generalisation – what to say of the woman who had her breakout role aged 11 in Harriet the Spy, before moving on to the racy teen raunchfest EuroTrip and the wholesome Disney banger Ice Princess?Trachtenberg managed to rack up a dizzying string of major performances before she had even turned 20 years old – indeed, Gossip Girl’s Georgina was one of the few big roles that showed her past her teenage years. She started acting early, a natural who did not receive any formal training, beginning her career with a role in Law & Order when she was six. By all accounts she showed herself to be precocious and extremely hard-working.View image in fullscreenMichelle Trachtenberg in Harriet the Spy.Photograph: NICKELODEON/AllstarAlthough Trachtenberg was widely liked off-screen, she convincingly played mean-spirited characters. On Gossip Girl, Georgina excelled at delivering cutting remarks with a surgical precision that was truly pleasing to watch, all the while remaining so composed and self-possessed as to not displace a single hair.And on Buffy, Trachtenberg’s Dawn was almost the anti-Georgina: a maturing girl struggling to find herself, occasionally a little bratty, but fundamentally showing a good and evolving soul. She was able to have the kind of deeply emotional, vulnerable, and reciprocal relationship with Buffy that would have been poison to a woman like Georgina.Dawn worked so well precisely because she lacked the extreme self-possession that Georgina seemed to have in endless quantities – two characters as distant from each other as Gossip Girl’s icy socialite New York is from Buffy’s funky, supernatural California.View image in fullscreenLeighton Meester and Michelle Trachtenberg in Gossip Girl.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyTrachtenberg fans tend to have very distinct preferences for either Dawn or Georgina, and probably for most people this is a very instinctual thing. Do you side with the young woman still figuring herself out, or the grown up mean girl who has long since decided she likes being a bitch? The answer is something of a personality test.That Trachtenberg could contain these multitudes over the course of her career probably says as much about the fact that she essentially grew up on screen as it says about her capacious acting skills. She was the fortunate child star to make a successful pivot into an adult career, although in the years after Gossip Girl her career slowed, landing fewer roles as the millennial culture that she helped shape gave way to gen Z.In her tribute on Wednesday, Trachtenberg’s Gossip Girl co-star Blake Lively feted her as someone who lived life with exuberance. “Everything she did, she did 200%. She laughed the fullest at someone’s joke, she faced authority head on when she felt something was wrong … she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself,” Lively wrote. It was a fitting tribute, from one millennial to another, to a woman who clearly understood what a privilege it was to act, who had relished her time in the spotlight.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBuffy the Vampire SlayercommentShareReuse this content"

This is a very difficult time. It is not my job to be political but, every time you open a newspaper – oh my God! My job is to think about what clothes a woman can wear. About what kind of femininity makes sense in a moment like this.”View image in fullscreenPrada’s Milan show: ‘Glamour is not a sexy dress … Glamour is about feeling important.’Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockSkirt suits, dresses and coats were generously cut, allowing the body within to move freely. “When we think of feminine beauty in clothes, our minds go straight away to something constricted,” said Prada’s co-designer, Raf Simons.“I look around now and see so many corsets. I see women with so much work. Our idea of feminine beauty is often about constricting movement, so we wanted these clothes to be about liberation. Which is about fashion, but it is not just about fashion.”To emphasise the message of liberation, the roomy cut was in contrast to styles that spoke to the ladylike 1950s and 1960s. There were Audrey Hepburn collars and rows of pearl buttons, trapeze line silhouettes and chain handle bags. Sweaters were pinned with jewelled brooches, coats swagged with (fake) fur collars.Unusually, there were no evening dresses in the show. “This is not a time for decadence,” said Miuccia Prada. Instead, there were gestures of glamour – jewels, bows, high heels – among woollen dresses and cotton shirts. “Glamour is not a sexy dress, it’s an interior point of view. Glamour is about feeling important.”Max Mara presented a more down-to-earth vision, with a show that gave a clear picture of what contemporary chic looks like. Coats are getting longer, so that ankle-length now looks more modern than knee-length. Tastefully oversized trousers belted at the waist have taken over from pencil skirts as the smart daytime uniform. Sleeveless layers, in the form of chunky gilets and knitted tank vests, are increasingly part of the fashion vernacular.Ian Griffiths, the British creative director of Max Mara, starts with what real women wear and builds fashion out from there, rather than the other way around. This season, he wanted to do big skirts.View image in fullscreenA model in the Max Mara show.Photograph: Alfonso Catalano/SGP/REX/Shutterstock“So I thought: what story do I attach to this, to give it drama? We all have our dramas going on inside, so our clothes should, too.” A weekend in Yorkshire led him to the Brontë heroines Catherine Earnshaw and Jane Eyre, and a collection of rustling greatcoats, hardy layers with bellow pockets, chunky boots, stiff tweeds and grand velvets.There was nothing Victorian about the clothes on the catwalk. “I’m not doing costume drama,” Griffiths said backstage. On his moodboard, an image of a woman looking out of a plane window was pinned next to a portrait of the Brontë sisters, “because I never forget that the woman I’m designing for is more likely to be getting on a plane to New York or marching through the corridors of power than marching across the moors. She’s probably a corporate lawyer.”Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekPradaMax MaraWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So how did they become so popular with fitness enthusiasts and lifestyle gurus?Zoe WilliamsThu 27 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 09.14 ESTShareHow did something as transparently dirty as cured meat enter the temple of clean? The American “meat stick” industry – mainly cured beef sticks that are awesomely calorific – hit $3bn last year. In the UK, processed meat snacking products havegrown in sales by 38%since 2020, and are projected to pick up another 49% percent by 2027. The puzzle is not “are they tasty?” or “are they convenient?” We know they are, but so is a Snickers. Rather, how did a category that we’ve known for years is actively bad for your health come to be the snacking choice of gymgoers and lifestyle gurus alike?Scientifically questionable meat-heavy diets come and go (remember theAtkins diet?) but in 2018, conservative guru Jordan Peterson went on Joe Rogan’s podcast to talk about his book 12 Rules for Life, and – complimented by Rogan on his physique – said in passing he now ate only beef, salt and water. And he never cheated. The “animal products only” Carnivore Diet, by orthopaedic surgeon Shawn Baker, was published at the same time.View image in fullscreen‘In the world of fitness, protein targets are nudging towards the impossible.’Photograph: PM Images/Getty ImagesA year later, the Annals of Internal Medicine in the US published an astonishing study which recommended “that adultscontinue current processed meat consumption”. It was astonishing because, in the maelstrom of conflicting dietary advice – red wine prevents cancer, it gives you cancer, tomatoes are good for you, they also give you cancer, etc – science had long been pretty settled on processed meats. There were still question marks overnitrates and nitrites, which are so prevalent in meat processing, and whether or not they could be isolated as the root of the problem. But until that study, most people agreed that processed meat was bad for you. Federica Amati, head nutritionist at the Zoe app, and nutrition topic lead at Imperial College London School of Medicine, gives a whistlestop tour of the health risks of processed meats: “Dextrose is a high-glycemic ingredient that increases blood sugar levels and can lead to dehydration in high amounts. N-nitroso compounds are cancer-causing substances believed to be responsible for some of the adverse effects. They are formed from nitrite (sodium nitrite) that is added to processed meat products. They’re high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and they’re a class one carcinogen, known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer.”View image in fullscreenMen are said to struggle between convenience foods and healthy eating.Photograph: Hispanolistic/Getty Images“The mechanism is less interesting than the certainty,” says Chris Van Tulleken, author of Ultra-Processed People. “The evidence is very clear that processed meats elevate your risk of heart disease and other negative outcomes. It’s dose-dependent: the more you eat, the greater the harm. That is mediated, probably, through saturated fat, which is seriously bad for you; salt, which is seriously bad for you; and their energy density. We know that energy-dense soft food promotes weight gain. It’s probably not simply because they’re tasty – ‘tasty’ is not a very formal word, so we can’t answer that precisely with research; it’s because they’re not satisfying. So you’ll eat them quicker than you could feel full.” The data was in, in other words, and yet the debate remained alive.In fact, doubts were cast on that journal article pretty fast, when it was discoveredthe same week(October 2019) that one of the authors hadties to the meat industry. But TikTok and the wider manosphere – social media spaces populated by young bros looking for answers – didn’t seem to care about conflicts of interest. The “lion diet”, for example, which entails eating only the meat of ruminant animals, gained prominence online as the answer to everything: it could reduce inflammation, promote weight loss, solve skin complaints, improve mood. Basically, it could give you the constitution of a lion, and have you ever truly looked at one of those creatures in his own habitat? Is he not majestic? Does he look depressed to you? He does not. The videos, particularly from the UK, are often unbelievably gross: pale young men frying up boxes of the cheapest imaginable mince with cubes of beef fat (and who the hell knows where they came from), proclaiming that it kept them going all day for £1.30.View image in fullscreen‘Beef jerky can be quite lean, so that’s OK,’ says author Chris Van Tulleken.Photograph: Juanmonino/Getty ImagesBut it was not all gym bros. High-protein, zero-carb diets were still discreetly popular in what we might call the Anna Wintour constituency –she famously only atesteak and caprese salad, minus the tomatoes, for lunch. Amati describes these different generational attitudes: “My female clients over the age of 40 struggle to stop pinning their health on how thin they are. Thin equals healthy for them, and they often don’t eat enough food. My younger female clients are often fearful of food; many have tried elimination diets, undertaken unnecessary fasting regimes or removed food groups without a nutrition professional advising them or supporting them, and it’s sad to see how much fear certain influencers can cause.” So that’s the female meat-snack market in a nutshell: gen X still chasing the keto dream, while millennials and gen Z take a more … well, “neurotic” is a strong word; let’s call it the quest of the terminally online for everything to just work better.Amati continues: “My male clients have less of a divide between generations, but they struggle with convenience and are often set unnecessarily high protein targets, which they then struggle to achieve without eating protein snacks and drinking high-protein drinks. What’s worrying is that more often than not, even young men in their 30s already present with cardiovascular risk factors like high LDL [a type of cholesterol] or elevated blood pressure.”View image in fullscreenAndy Rogers, who runs North by Sud-Ouest charcuterie.Photograph: Andrew & Dot RogersWhat’s extraordinary about this picture is not so much how our social and existential anxieties are mediated through food – although for sure, that’s something to think about – but how it all drives inexorably towards one single food: the processed meat stick or nugget. If you’re cutting out carbs to stay thin, there are very few foods you can eat as a snack. Even many vegetables areverboten. There is a side-category of twitchy gen X-er the kids call the “almond mum” (short version: whatever you ask for, you’ll get almonds), but really, all roads lead to chorizo (which saw a28% increase in saleslast year, in the UK).Meanwhile, in the world of fitness, protein targets are nudging towards the impossible: if you take a weight-based approach, medics agree that 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is fine, but most muscle-building advice would take one gram per kilo as a bare minimum, going up to two grams if you’re younger and training for an event, or if you’re older and trying to build muscle. You often see calculations based on men weighing 70kg and women weighing 60kg, but average weights are much higher than that: per the NHS’s figures in 2021, themean weights of men and women, based on adjustments to self-reported weight, were 85.1kg and 71.8kg respectively. And 170g of pure protein a day is not easily done – a classic service-stationbeef stickis only 16% protein, and almost all the rest is fat.Van Tulleken is more fair-minded, and points out: “Beef jerky can be quite lean, so that’s OK. It’s proteinatious, and protein is not bad for you, although people don’t need as much protein as the fitness industry often implies. It’s better than a chocolate bar; it might not have too much salt. The problem is, the lean, fairly low-salt dry beef becomes the poster child for the shitty, fatty version that’s covered in maltodextrin and sugar. So you can have a product that’s fine, and it ends up representing a category that is not fine.”View image in fullscreenSpanish pigs grazing among oaks and acorns.Photograph: Ivanb-photo/Getty ImagesIt would be outrageous, though, to brush past those products thatarefine. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall makes his own charcuterie and has run courses doing so at River Cottage. He says, “These are, at their best, irresistible products.” There’s something about the time and imagination that goes into meat curing that unlocks the mystery of taste itself. You can tell what kind of life the animal lived, what it ate, where it hung out, who it was. “A slower grown animal,” he continues, “you’ve got more fat on it to play with, because it will have needed to put that on to protect it from the weather. That’s why you turn to old breeds that are well bristled and grow slowly. You’ll get marbling on that meat – the eye of a loin on an outdoor pig will have marbling, flecks of fat, like beef.”The lean, fairly low-salt dry beef becomes the poster child for the fatty version that’s covered in maltodextrin and sugarAndy Rogers, who runsNorth by Sud-Ouestwith his wife in New Ferry, Wirral, won the World Charcuterie award in 2023 and the BBC Food Programme’s best producer last year. He works on whole pigs, one at a time, “because it means they’re not part of some industrial production line. They’ve been rooting around and having a nice life.” He makes two products from the head alone, afromage de têtenose-to-tail terrine, “a fancy French brawn that I ripped off my old boss in France”. And then on through the length of the loin, which he makes into a coppa, to the tougher, sinewy hock parts, that’ll be cooked into a cotechino. If he sells out, which he did after the food awards, it’s two months before he can restock, because these products take as long as they take. Although Rogers is reluctant to mythologise the complexity of the cured meat – “I’m not sure you can taste the acorns they’ve been eating” – he falls into an elegy when he tries to describe it. “That Spanish stuff is a class apart. The actual Bellota pigs who’ve been trotting round in a massive range, eating acorns in season, having to walk five miles to get water, they’ve got a really distinct, musty, nutty thing going on. They can age that so long because it’s so suffused with fat. That product is unrecreatable.”View image in fullscreenNorth by Sud-Ouest charcuterie’s nose-to-tail terrine.Photograph: Andrew & Dot Rogers“Curing meat privately, or at restaurant scale,” Fearnley-Whittingstall says, “you don’t have to use any additives at all, you can do that with salt.” It’s still going to have high amounts of many of the wrong things, but you just wouldn’t sweat it, any more than you would “try to regulate homemade brownies”, Van Tulleken says. “You can’t make them delicious enough and you don’t make them often enough, and when you want to binge on them, you have to make them. The issue is the industrial process. The cheap ham and bacon is a massive source of saturated fat, salt, a lot of it is quite sugary, and it’s probably also associated with other harmful factors like low incomes and generally poor diet.” Plus, you couldn’t make yourself long-term ill on high-quality cured meat because you’d go bankrupt first.What’s happened with processed meat is a microcosm of how the risk-aversion of regular capitalism in fact creates greater risk, insofar as the “health and safety hoops to sell meat commercially demand the nitrates”, Fearnely-Whittingstall says. “If it’s going off the premises and into the world, it can only do that with the belt and braces of additives.” Meanwhile, the anxieties of late capitalism drive completely counter-productive behaviours; fixated on finding individuated answers to an obesogenic and carcinogenic environment created by corporations, we end up eating the very thing that makes us fat and gives us cancer. It’s actually pretty wild! But also, very tasty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in dark corners hidden from guests is its cruel and seedy underbellyHannah SelingerThu 27 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 10.10 ESTShareIwas working at Jean-Georges, the petite and bourgeois restaurant tucked into Trump’s building on Columbus Circle, just off Central Park, where the sounds and smells ofNew Yorkfaded into the austere dining room. It was a room of extravagances small and large.There’s no pleasure in a four-star dining room, no joviality. You can’t be jocular with your fellow servers. There’s no room for error. A server is not permitted to do the following: wear colored nail polish; cross hands in front of the body; slouch; speak on the floor; carry a glass from the bar to the table without a tray; show visible tattoos; wear hair in an inappropriate manner (this can be at the discretion of a manager); touch a glass by any part except the stem; pour wine in the incorrect order; spill; laugh.One of the more arresting displays took place when Philippe Vongerichten, the restaurant’s general manager and brother of its executive chef, came through with a pineapple. There, in the gray light, Philippe would pierce the end of the fruit with two forks and hoist it into the air, carving ravines into its sides before setting it ablaze with kirsch.This was the kind of performative act that looked better than it tasted. It was, after all, just a very expensive pineapple, and that’s how I felt about most of the food at the restaurant: it was pretty, if a little uninteresting.I had landed a two-week stage as a sommelier, and hoped the job would lead to a full-time gig at the group’s downtown restaurant, Perry St, a cooler, more chic spot that very much felt like a place where I would fit in. But here, the mood was stodgy. In the dining room: no leaning. Business was conducted at a whisper. If a guest got up to use the restroom, one did not fold a napkin in absentia, as was protocol in nearly every other restaurant in fine dining. Instead, that napkin was removed. This dirty thing! A new one appeared, folded beside the plate, as if by magic, before the guest re-emerged.There is a difference between restaurants that receive two or three stars from the New York Times and restaurants that receive four. At restaurants that receive four, like Jean-Georges, waiting tables is a career because the money allows it. The job was demanding, but it offered rewards in return. This was not an entry-level restaurant job, and people in the industry understood the level of discipline and professionalism required. If you’re used to working in fine dining, like I was, the transition to top-tier can be brutal.But if you love service – or are, as I was, addicted to the inherent charms of restaurants – you couldn’t help but love this one, with its old school customs and extreme technique. To enter the dining room was to enter another world, which is, at its core, what fine dining is all about: transportive experience. To be in there, among the most expensive wines in the world, with the carts and tableside plating, the French-style service and the whisper-quiet, was to be in elite company.He wanted me to accompany him into his secret, private life, away from the restaurant. How could I possibly decline?Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the critically acclaimed Alsatian chef responsible for the restaurant, was himself a perfectionist. Had I ever seen another place like this, where food was produced, yes, but where, in truth, there was no grimy proof of it, no accidental leak of ketchup, no grease trap overflowing on occasion, no tipping over of a tray or sticky floor that betrayed months – if not years – of old food? There was no cacophony, no clang of pots, no shouting or anger or indication of the stress that comes when the printer is operating on overdrive.For all its formality, Jean-Georges set its pastry chef, Johnny Iuzzini, loose in the final course. The Dover sole was still deboned, plated and sauced tableside. But the dessert? It flew off in a million directions, a weird symphony of flavor and colors.It was always a surprise when it was plated on a square vessel with four quadrants, the most avant-garde part of the meal. Sometimes these quadrants were ingredient-themed, and other times they were seasonally inspired. Consider a rumination on rhubarb: in one quadrant, a birch beer soft-serve ice cream, served in a tiny glass with carbonated strawberry-rhubarb consommé. In another, a rhubarb panna cotta with dried rhubarb powder. Then, a jade green matcha cake, surrounded by hibiscus and red wine–poached rhubarb. Finally, an orb of crispy rhubarb cheesecake, topped with a dollop of raspberry puree.Guests lost their minds over these desserts. New York Magazine’s profile fawned over the chef, who admitted to such an aggressive sugar addiction that, by 2003, he had worn down his teeth and was replacing his veneers every year; he was only 29 at the time. Unlike the straitlaced servers on the floor, he was slick, with a gelled pompadour, a Ducati and a gig spinning as a DJ downtown.Johnny Iuzzini began his career at Jean-Georges in 2002 after working under François Payard for several years at Daniel and Café Boulud. A year after beginning at Jean-Georges, Iuzzini won the James Beard award for outstanding pastry chef. Two years later, he would publish his first book, calledDessert FourPlay: Sweet Quartets from a Four-Star Pastry Chef. That was one year after I met him in the basement of the restaurant, where he operated a glossy pastry kitchen, as well as a fully refrigerated chocolate locker, where he created the final tastes of the evening: handcrafted chocolates.On the first or second day of my stage, I had been sent downstairs to meet with him by the director of operations to learn more about the restaurant’s pastry program, down to the bowels of the seemingly endless restaurant.The prep kitchen, pastry kitchen, chocolate unit, employee dining cafe and lockers constitute an underground maze, never-ending passageways of hidden spaces that hide staff from guests. In the chocolate room, I was meant to learn about the procedure of making the tiny petits fours that go out to guests as the final gift each evening. Instead, in the room so cool that my breath took on the condensed look of smoke, I stood statue-still as Johnny grabbed me from behind. Maybe I didn’t mind.“Come downtown with me,” he said.Chocolate must be kept cool because it is such a shapeshifter. Chocolate-making involves rules. It involves process. You have to temper chocolate. If you fail to control chocolate, it will turn chalky. It will lose its texture and sheen, break prematurely, turn grainy. Such a delicate material, chocolate, far more delicate than pastry, or even pastry cream.That Johnny had chosen chocolate, this most temperamental of ingredients, as his passion project, felt meaningful. Why choose the thing that is hardest, I wondered? It must take a patient person – a person with delicate hands and constitution – to choose to work with something so infinitely fickle. Here was an artist, I thought. Here was someone who had chosen such a difficult medium. And he wanted me to accompany him into his secret, private life, away from the restaurant. How could I possibly decline?“We have to go separately,” he said. “No one can see us.”That should have been my first red flag.All employees at Jean-Georges leave through a separate entrance, so that the guests don’t have to mingle with them; this is another rule of fine dining. When service has ended, and you are in your plain clothes, you must disappear into the night, through a porter’s entrance or side door, a performer who has played the role. No one can see you in this real life of yours, this city life, where you wear jeans and sweaters and carry a backpack or purse.Outside, it was spring, or maybe early summer. Johnny got on his Ducati, a fast bike that would beat me downtown. I hailed a cab on Central Park West, and headed into the velvet night.The invitation felt precious, and I felt unworthy.In his East Village apartment, Johnny talked about his mother, who had died the year before at 56. I would think about this later, from time to time, about what it had meant for him to lose her, about whether it made him a sympathetic character in the wake of my own loss. My own father died at 57 from ALS.Johnny led me into his bedroom.There were things that I agreed to and things that I did not agree to. What I agreed to: sex. What I did not agree to: the camera that appeared out of nowhere. There was no permission to grant. Johnny had already started filming. I looked up from the bed and was greeted by the cold, blank stare of a camera, and not of a partner.I told him to stop. In my head, I thought about the things that I could do, or the things that I could say, about the obvious betrayal. I thought about how disgusting it was, about how I could end up on the internet, about how I could never run for president, and about how ridiculous that thought was, since I had never planned to run for president in the first place.My brain ran on hyperdrive, firing at a million thoughts a second, and my mouth ran dry. “Stop” came out, a pathetic, one-syllable word. You can feel two things at once, and I did, pulled in two directions, like a dog toy that has been ripped at the seams until it barely exists anymore. Stop. Don’t stop. Stop this, but stay here, with me, because, please, I do not want to be alone.“If you don’t want your face in it, you can put a pillowcase over your head,” he said.He didn’t put the camera down. He was staring at me from above, holding the camera in one hand and holding his hair back with another. He wasn’t exactly standing upright; it was more of a kneel. Still, he could have pinned me down if he wanted. I wasn’t free to leave, the position said. This image is mine, the position said.I didn’t agree to the pillowcase, either. I didn’t want to be a floating sphere, a headless apparition. His foreplay was a woman without a head, appearing in his bed without a face. A bag over my head.It wasn’t just me; it was any girl. Every girlI don’t know why, but I didn’t leave. I felt like I couldn’t somehow, like I was pinned by an invisible hand. Johnny didn’t press the issue of the pillowcase again, but his face twisted up, and the version of him that had been with me until then – the chocolatier who was fun and pleasant and who missed his mom – had vanished.It didn’t feel like any ancient betrayal, being photographed without consent. It felt like the same thing as always, just another person whom I had trusted who had let me down a little. Johnny was another power imbalance to negotiate, another calculated loss. I often think that I stayed in restaurants because restaurants were the natural place for a person like me, a person who was constantly seeking affection in places where affection was simply unavailable.The morning after my night with Johnny, I went back to my apartment to change before work. The subway cars, they looked very, very clean, and I felt very, very dirty, a situational crisis that I realized was not exactly my fault – or was it? I had to wonder if I had put myself in a position of vulnerability. It’s not just trauma that walks with you in the haunting moments after a night like this. The true feeling, if I were to pinpoint it, is shame, and the best way to overcome deep shame is to make yourself believe that it was always your idea: the sex, the drinks, that you had agency, that you were the one who wanted it in the first place. Somehow, that feels less shameful than the truth.At work the next day, I told a server that we had been out at the club together – nothing about the apartment, the sex, the camera, the pillowcase. Later, Johnny pulled me into the chocolate room, seething.“You weren’t supposed to tell anyone we went out,” he said.Something about his wrath made me feel even worse. Was it not my fault that I had been treated like garbage by this celebrity chef, after all? I had gone to his apartment of my own volition. I had made the choice to commingle work and pleasure. Johnny had not coerced me or taken advantage of me in any real way. I could have put the pillowcase over my head. It would have made no difference.There was a fundamental part of me that felt turned upside-down. Was it wrong to be grabbed by a chef during work hours in a chocolate room, even if I liked it? Was it wrong, in the aftermath, for him to have requested my silence and complicity, for him to have issued blame, claiming that if I had said anything that I would be jeopardizing his career? And surely it was wrong for him to have asked me to put a pillowcase over my head, even if it was only some infantile execution of his male fantasy?The truth – I would learn later – was that Johnny Iuzzini had a long-term girlfriend, and the casualty, in all of this, was me. When he suggested that I put a pillowcase over my head, he really did not want to see my face, the reality of me, the person behind the sex. I was just a girl in a basement who looked good in a uniform. I was just a girl at a bar after a shift. I was just a girl on a couch listening at the right time. I was just a girl whom he could ask to put a bag over her head. I was just a girl.There were other girls, too. In 2017,four women came forward to say that they had been sexually harassed by Iuzzini at work. It wasn’t just me; it was any girl. Every girl. It was my friend, Tia, whom he had propositioned at her midtown restaurant, even though she was dating his co-worker. It was a woman from work, who claimed that he stuck his tongue down her throat without permission. It was probably women who hadn’t come forward, too, or women like me who were not quite sure if there had been a violation or not, but who had spent years thinking that something about it had felt wrong.Johnny wasn’t an artist. He was something more twisted, more grotesque. Deep within me, there was a black, hardened tree, the branches of which had been growing almost my entire life, the angry scars of mistreatment. There it was: anger. I was so fucking angry. Angry in the way that women are not permitted to be.Why be afraid to say it, anyway? Probably because a public figure – that’s who Johnny was – can make your life a living hell if you dare betray your own humanity. Probably because a woman isn’t allowed to be angry if she was a part-willing participant. I should have been thankful for the attention, thankful to be temporarily on the arm of such a hot commodity. He took me downtown, into his weird, little world. That should have been enough for me, but it wasn’t. I should have been grateful, but I wasn’t. Instead, I was seething, a roiling pot, ready to overflow.Good chocolate, I think, is both bitter and sweet, at least the way that I prefer it. I don’t know whether or not Johnny loved the ingredient for this quality, but it’s what I like about it – that it can be two things at once, that it can straddle the palate and remind us of how high a dessert can climb.The artistry that people found so obsessive when it came to Johnny – that he could stew over an ingredient and turn it into four composed desserts – is exactly what I find uninteresting. In the end, those desserts didn’t actually taste that good. They were bombastic, and they were visual, and they drew you in. They were tricky and manipulative, the way that restaurants and the people in them can be. But they weren’t the kind of desserts that keep you up at night, pierced with longing.We never needed those four desserts, not any of us.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

How can I regain confidence on the dancefloor?Dancing in the dark can restore a sense of fun in your body without anyone watching, writes advice columnistEleanor Gordon-Smith.You’re never too awkward or sober to startRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 27 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 18.09 ESTShareI am in my early 30s and happily married with two young children. I have never been an amazing dancer. It has always been painfully awkward. I feel mortified whenever there’s a requirement to dance, even if it’s as silly as when the grownups join in during a kid’s party! I’ve had strangers offer well-intentioned help; people try to teach me to dance while on the dancefloor (clearly they decided I needed help). I’ve had a friend comment that my dancing is “cute” and strangers mock my dancing by mimicking it in front of me.When I was in my 20s, I made up for this in the only way I knew how – by drinking a lot and losing all inhibition. I loved letting go and just losing myself on the dancefloor, enjoying the music and not caring what people thought. I’m now at a stage in my life where I’ve got young kids, I work a million hours a week in an intense job and I like making the most of my weekends with my family, so getting extremely drunk to enjoy a night of dancing isn’t an option. Even when the option has presented itself, I feel so saddled emotionally with responsibility and physically with my larger, squidgier mum body that I just avoid dancing altogether.I would love to be able to get up there and enjoy the music with my friends, but how?I want to find my ‘thing’. How can I work out what I want to do with my life? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:I’m so serious about this: do it in the dark.I went to a dance nightin the darkclose to 10 years ago, intending to just oblige the person who took me, but smash cut to me an hour later looking as though I’d walked through a car wash, drenched in sweat, beaming. Since then it’s the silliest, most fun thing I do on a regular basis and I’m now the person who drags others. “You’ll feel like a nincompoop for the first three songs but by the last one you’ll think ‘It’s over already?!’” and they always do.Obviously the darkness means nobody else is watching. That frees up a lot of people. You can try stuff or change your mind without having any effect on anyone. Maybe this is a pogo dance kind of song. Maybe I’m sexy now. I wonder if I can dothatthing – never mind. Nobody can tell.But it’s also that you’renot watching yourself. In the dark you feel a bit like you recede until you’re just a pair of eyes, and the only feedback you get from your body is how it feels instead of how it looks.We’re so used to seeing our bodies in a limited set of roles. Is it attractive, is it physically fit, can it perform the tasks I need it to? Even when you’re dancing in front of people, you’re evaluating it. But there’s a whole spectrum of physical funout there we don’t play around in much as adults. Never mind successful dancing, I mean just fun – reminding yourself that you can be silly and big and spontaneous and energetic the way kids are.Feelings often follow behaviour, not the other way around. It might be that asking yourself to stand up and dance at a wedding is asking to take too many big leaps at once. You have to put together the physical coordination with the past feelings of embarrassment and the present ambivalence towards your body and it winds up like trying to pat your head and rub your belly at the same time.It might be useful to do one bit at a time. “Restore a sense of fun in my body” is one thing you can accomplish by dancing in the dark, even if it’s by yourself, even if it’s in your bathroom with theheadphones up loud. Once physical fun and looseness stops feeling silly or impossible, thenyou could think about what might make it fun to do with other people or with the lights on. There will be halfway transition points (just goof and lip-sync on the dancefloor with someone you like? Request and then dance to songs with pre-made dances such as the Macarena?). Trying to change one thing at a time might help change the whole package over time.You’re not too awkward or too sober or too “mum” to get to enjoy this part of life.

Plus: your wardrobe dilemmas solvedChloe Mac DonnellThu 27 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 12.04 ESTShareThey think it’s bizarre not to take a two-hour lunch break, and consider the show Emily in Paris“worse than cliche”. Next on the list of things that irk the French? The suffix: “core”.Earlier this week, the Commission for the Enrichment of the French Language (CELF) called on French speakers to stop using it. Writing in the Journal Officiel, a site that publishes the legislative and regulatory texts of France, it said that, while “terms formed with the English ending core, such as cottagecore, royalcore, Barbiecore, or gorpcore, are widely used to describe a clothing style and, by extension, a lifestyle inspired by idealised vision of a particular universe”, it is preferable to use the word “style”. Instead of Barbiecore, it suggests Barbie style. In place of gorpcore? Hiker style.This isn’t the first time that the infiltration of an English word or phrase into the French language has caused outrage.In 2018CELF asked French speakers to replace “fake news” with “information fallacieuse”. Two years later, the wordsclickbait and podcastcame under scrutiny.Olivia Walsh, an associate professor of French and Francophone studies at the University of Nottingham, says she is not surprised core has now been targeted – but describes concerns about anglicism use as “generally overblown”.“Those who oppose anglicisms often do not demonstrate awareness of the etymological history of terms,” Walsh says. “There are many borrowings which are termedaller-retoursbecause they were originally borrowed into English from French and then back again into French, sometimes centuries later.”View image in fullscreenShould ‘Barbiecore’, as modelled by Margot Robbie in the film, be renamed ‘Barbie style’?Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyHow did a word that stems from the French language (it is derived from the word cœur, meaning heart) come to be so prolific in fashion?In fashion terms, a core is a trend. But it also goes beyond the clothes, describing an aesthetic, encompassing everything from music to moods. The beloved gen ZAesthetics Wiki pagecurrently features 149 cores, from blokecore (think British football culture and 1980s jerseys) to witchcore, where tarot, crystals and vintage wedding dresses are key.The first use of the word core can be traced to the early 20th century. In the 1920s, “hard core” was used to describe people committed to a political party or political cause. Lynne Murphy, professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex, says during the 70s it was treated as “a bit suffixy”, with the use of the word softcore in relation to pornography. Fast forward to 2003 and the Oxford English Dictionary added it as a suffix. But things really took off in 2013 with theemergence of normcore, a catchall term for describing someone who wears “normal” clothes such as a fleece, dad jeans and New Balance trainers.2020 was dominated by cottagecore (baking, crochet) following the pandemic lockdown. Greta Gerwig was to blame for Barbiecore, in 2023, while Zendaya in the 2024 film Challengers saw the emergence of tenniscore. There has also beengoblincore(think mushroom motifs and mossy greens)corpcore(basically workwear), balletcore (ballet flats and wrap cardigans) and mermaidcore (long wavy hair and seaweed greens) For 2025, fishermancore (cable knit jumpers and lobster platters)is being championed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Murphy credits the importance of the fashion industry toFrancefor turning the focus to the word core but thinks the latest advice is unlikely to be followed. “If they use imported words, it could look like the French are following Anglo-American trends rather than making their own,” she says. “But, of course, we also know that such decrees about language are often ineffective.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterFranceLanguagesEuropenewslettersShareReuse this content"

At Kentucky State, close to 40 of the scholars have enrolled since the project’s inception in 1992. Nationwide, the program has supported more than 800 students,according to the USDA.The 1890 scholarships have created a pipeline for rural and underrepresented students to pursue studies in fields such as animal science, botany, horticulture, nutrition and forestry. Upon graduation, they are placed in USDA positions around the nation.The news of the program’s suspension – explained in a single sentence that briefly sat atop theprogram’s USDA page– sparked a flurry of inquiries at Kentucky State. Bernard said the university had been notified that incoming fall 2025 scholarship selectees would not be funded. Without the federal funds, Kentucky State couldn’t pay for those students’ education or continue current students’ scholarships.Bernard, anxious students and families got some small relief late on Monday when the program reopened – a change noted on the website. It said that applications for the scholarship, which gives full rides to the institutions created from federal lands, would be accepted until 15 March.However, the future of the scholarship remains unclear as much of the funding that supports the students’ research and fieldwork has been halted.The reopening of the scholarship program also does not necessarily mean it will be funded, said a USDA representative who requested anonymity. The newly reopened application period was “probably something to appease the public from all the fires that have been lit in the last week”, the official said.View image in fullscreenThe North Carolina representative Alma Adams attends a US House hearing in Washington DC on 5 February 2025.Photograph: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty ImagesThe move to suspend the scholarships drew criticism from various sources, including the 1890 Foundation, the Association of 1890 Research Directors and the Association of Public Land-Grant Universities. In a statement, the representative Alma Adams of North Carolina called the suspension “a clear attack on an invaluable program that makes higher education accessible for everybody, and provides opportunities for students to work at USDA, especially in the critical fields of food safety, agriculture, and natural resources that Americans rely on every single day. This program is a correction to a long history of racial discrimination within the land-grant system, not an example of it. I demand USDA immediately rescind this targeted and mean-spirited suspension and reinstate the 1890 Scholars Program.”The participating universities had been founded as part of the second Morrill Act that in 1890 gave federal lands to establish historically Black colleges that specialized in agricultural and vocational education.Alumni speak outAlvin Lumpkin was an 1890 South Carolina State University scholar who graduated in 2012. He started as an education major but switched during his sophomore year to study family and consumer studies under the department of agriculture and environmental sciences. He then became eligible to participate in the 1890 program.While he had various experiences as a scholar, one of his most memorable was being a student firefighter.The 1890 Land Grant Institution Wildland Fire Consortiumconvened students from across the land-grant universities to obtain basic firefighting training skills and were placed in small towns across the south. “It was students from Alcorn [State University], Fort Valley [State University], South Carolina [State University], and we all went down to [Florida A&M University]. And it was just a beautiful thing to have people from all different fields of study come together and train together,” said Lumpkin.Lumpkin worked for a month with the National Forest Service in Mount Rogers national recreation area. He gained skills in water sampling and treatment; rescue efforts; and strategic field burns, an Indigenous practice of controlled, intentional fire. “We were on four-wheelers and torched sides of the mountain to burn vegetation so that when lightning strikes, it would not cause a fire,” said Lumpkin.For Kermit Shockley, being an 1890 scholar at Florida A&M broadened his understanding of what was possible for him. As an engineering major, he prepared trails and bridges across the Appalachian Trail during his summers. Alongside Lumpkin, he learned how to lay gravel, clear paths, administer first aid and patrol the forest to act as the first eyes for law enforcement.Lumpkin and Shockley responded to natural disasters such as the2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest accidental marine-based spill in history. “It was not a ‘stand back and watch’ moment. It was a ‘let me show you, make your mistakes, and let me teach you,’” said Shockley. With therecent mass terminationof thousands of National Forest Service and National Park Service workers, 1890 scholars may be relied upon again to help fill the gaps.Both men went into public-service careers. After graduation, Shockley went to work for the Department of Defense at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, decommissioning buildings used to enrich uranium during the second world war. Lumpkin’s exposure to law enforcement as an 1890 scholar led him to become an officer with the South Carolina department of juvenile justice. He is now an assistant principal in the Sumter, South Carolina, school district.A ripple effectLumpkin stressed that the impact on the larger 1890 ecosystem will be profound. “There’s so many programs that are going to be affected by not having 1890 scholars doing research in these communities,” he said.Other education programs have been affected by cuts. Across the 19 land-grant universities, agricultural research and urban agriculture grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and workforce training funding from the USDA’s Next Generation of Agriculturalists (NextGen) program have been paused. “All of this is going to be affected until grants have been unfrozen or until we know whether the grants will be cut completely,” said the USDA official.Aside from the scholarship program, Kentucky State is grappling with another huge loss. Last month, the university was awarded a$1.2m research grantfrom the 1890 Foundation with funding through the National Forest Service to launch a comprehensive project to increase the tree canopy across Louisville to reduce the impacts of urban heat stress. The funding also prompted the university to launch a robust urban-forestry program. Last week, the university was officially notified that the grant had been terminated.Defunding the 1890 National Scholars program stands to hurt Kentucky and the larger southern region, where most land-grant universities are located, said Bernard: “We are in communities across the state doing programs that are helping farmers, helping our rural communities, and providing assistance to disaster victims and more.”Explore more on these topicsBlack farmersOur unequal earthUS universitiesAgricultureAgriculture and forestryUS educationRaceCollegesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They also mentioned illegally hunting a mountain lion, a specially protected species in California, and told the officers about a relative’s “trophy room” full of taxidermized mountain lions, a wolverine and other animals.View image in fullscreenThe turtle skull that the subjects showed the officer.Photograph: California department of fish and wildlifeAfter the flight, the CDFW officers asked to see the sea turtle skull. The couple waited until TSA officers weren’t looking before pulling it out from inside a jacket in their carry-on bag. The skull belonged to a green sea turtle, an endangered species that is illegal to own or transport.Within two days, the officers got search warrants for the couple’s home in Chico and their relative’s home in Napa county. When they searched the Chico home, they found the couple processing a deer they killed illegally that same day. Deer season was closed, and they had no permits.Inside the home, wildlife officers also found mountain lion claws, a ringtail cat, a mounted barn owl and several deer taken without proper tags. Ringtail cats are a fully protected species in California and it is illegal to own a mounted raptor or raptor parts without state and federal permits.At the Napa county home, authorities found two full-bodied taxidermized mountain lions and a wolverine, which are both illegal to possess in California. All the animals were taken as evidence.View image in fullscreenThe residence in Napa.Photograph: California department of fish and wildlife“This case shows how important it is for our wildlife officers to be alert at all times,” said the CDFW’s chief of law enforcement, Nathaniel Arnold, in astatement. “Like human and narcotics trafficking, wildlife trafficking of both live animals and animal parts is known to fund transnational criminal organizations and their violent activities all over the world.”Byron Lee Fitzpatrick, 24, and Shannon Lee Price, 28, were convicted of violating state wildlife laws, received a one-year probation prohibiting them from hunting or associating with hunters, and were fined $1,865 and $1,015, respectively. They face an additional $1,000 each for violating federal wildlife laws.Harry Vern Fitzpatrick, 64, pleaded guilty in Napa county to possessing protected species, and was placed on six months of probation. He also received a $605 fine and forfeited his illegal collection.Global wildlife trafficking is the third-largest illegal trafficking activity in the world, behind drug trafficking and counterfeit foods, according to a 2023reportfrom the ratings firm Moody’s. The US is the “source, destination and transit location” for illegal trafficking in wildlife and animal products, the report says.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

A local guide and mountaineer, she has grown up drinking water that runs down from the snowy peaks above. As she stands up, however, the landscape that greets her is markedly different from that of her childhood.“We used to think the ice would be eternal,” says Ibañéz, 45. “Now it is not so eternal. Our glaciers are dying.”View image in fullscreenGuide and mountaineer Edilsa Ibañéz Ibañéz has seen the effect unpredictable weather patterns have had on the glacierThe Sierra Nevada del Cocuy is one ofsix remaining glaciers in Colombia. Although it has lostmore than 90%of its ice since the second half of the 19th century, Ibañéz says it containsabout 36%of the country’s total glacial coverage.Swathes of dry rock are exposed in areas once carpeted in snow in the high Sierra Nevada peaks. On the trail leading to the Cóncavo peak, stone markers have been placed like gravestones to indicate the position of the snow line in years past. The farthest marker, dating from the end of the 19th century, is several kilometres from the nearest ice.The peak itself presents a similarly grim picture. Fingers of greying ice slide towards the rocky mass below, where frozen boulders soften and thaw in the harsh sun. Deep within the glacier, the shifting ice emits loud cracks that rattle through the thin air above.Although the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy is home to the largest glacial mass in the country, it is far from alone in its fate. Rising global temperatures and increasingly unpredictable weather patternsare devastatingall six of Colombia’s remaining glaciated areas.View image in fullscreenA marker near the peak of Cóncavo on the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy glacier shows where the snow line was in 2018In 2024, neighbouring Venezuela became the first country in modern history tolose all its glaciers, and some predict that Colombia could go the same wayin as little as 30 years.“Even if we were to very aggressively over the next 10 to 20 years reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it wouldn’t be enough,” says Mathias Vuille, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany, who has been studying the climate crisis in the Andes for more than 30 years. “They aren’t accumulating any fresh snow and ice any more – they are doomed.”Colombia’s lowest-lying glacier, Santa Isabel in Los Nevados national park, far west of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, will probably be the first to disappear. According to data from the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (Ideam), it willprobably be gonewithin five years.View image in fullscreenOn Cóncavo, ice loss has hollowed out this once-pristine section of the glacierMatteo Giraldo, 32, from the nearby city of Pereira, has been walking in the mountains around Santa Isabel for the past 16 years. “I’ve cried for the situation with the glacier,” he says. “To see it before and after has been something I’ve felt in my heart.”Along with others who have frequented the glacier in recent decades, Giraldo has seen firsthand the changes that caused one section, Conejeras, to disappear entirely between December 2023 and February 2024.The loss of Colombia’s glaciers poses a ticking timebomb for those living in the country’s high-altitude regions.The glacier is an alarm that is sounding. It is saying that the mountain is changingJorge Luis Ceballos, IdeamVuille says: “Glaciers are constantly melting in the tropics – that means they constantly release water. That’s why they are essential, like a reservoir. It is your only water source if you live very close to the glacier.”The ability of glaciers to retain and release vast quantities of water makes them a vital source for communities living across the Andes. The Sierra Nevada del Cocuy alone contains the equivalent ofabout 256,000 Olympic swimmingpools of water.View image in fullscreen‘Very soon we will be the first to run out of water – most people here aren’t aware of this’: Edilsa Ibañéz IbañézUnlike their counterparts in higher-latitude regions, such as Europe and North America, Colombia’s tropical glaciers are relatively constant in temperature. This results in a shorter period of ice accumulation and a longer, year-round period of water release. People living in Colombia’s mountains rely heavily on the swiftly diminishing glaciers for their main water supply.View image in fullscreenHernando Ibañéz Ibañéz, a community leader in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, says 250 families are at risk of losing their water supplyIbañéz and her relatives, who live at the foot of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, consider themselves part of this group. “Very soon, we will be the first to run out of water,” she says. “Most people here aren’t aware of this.”Hernando Ibañéz Ibañéz, Edilsa’s brother and a community leader, fears for the future of his community. “Right now, I have 250 families dependent on one aqueduct,” he says. “According to what we observe daily, in 10 years we will no longer have this aqueduct. This is a concern for future generations.”As Colombia’s glaciers hurtle towards extinction, they serve as an alarm bell signalling a much broader pattern of environmental degradation already straining the entire country’s water supply. Afterhistoric droughts across Latin America, the country’s capital ofBogotá is still zonally rationing water– residents were asked to “shower together” to preserve diminishing water supplies in 2024.Colombia’spáramos– unique, high-altitude ecosystems – are intimately tied to the country’s water supply system. These act as natural reservoirs, storing and releasing water due to the presence of endemic plants known as frailejones.View image in fullscreenFrailejones plants exist in ecosystems known as páramos, which act as reservoirs due to their ability to store and release waterDue to their high altitude, some of Colombia’s páramos are partially fed by glacier meltwater, though the impact of glacier loss on these already threatened habitats is unknown.“The glacier is an alarm that is sounding,” says Jorge Luis Ceballos, a glacier researcher at Ideam. “It is saying that the mountain is changing. The páramo is also changing – but we don’t know how.”The disappearance of Colombia’s glaciers adds to the uncertainty over the long-term future of its páramo ecosystems, which are already severely affected by the climate crisis, unsustainable agricultural practices and forest fires. In January, a fire in the Boyacá region destroyedmore than 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of páramo.Beneath the mountains of Santa Isabel lie acres of páramo. Some areas are distinctive for their lack of the characteristic frailejones plant, which is crucial for the ecosystem’s ability to retain water. Residents say this is due to cattle being grazed in the area.View image in fullscreenBurned frailejones in La Cortadera, after a forest fire devastated more than 200 hectares of páramoAs Colombia heads toward a future without glaciers, Ceballos and his colleagues continue to climb them to gather images and data that play a vital role in documenting their decline – and to understand more about how to adapt.“We haven’t been able to answer the question of how to prepare ourselves for a future without glaciers,” he says. “We are still missing investigations.”View image in fullscreenDoris Ibañéz Cristancho in a cabin on the estate she owns with her familyThe one certainty, Ceballos says, is that Colombia’s glaciers will disappear – and relatively soon. For those living in their shadow, the impact runs deep. “We feel this loss,” he says. “When we lose a glacier, it’s not just water. It is also a loss of environmental heritage.”Families who have lived in the region for generations, such as Doris Ibañéz Cristancho’s, are helping to support the scientific studies. Sitting on her property in the Sierra Nevada, Cristancho looks out across the snow-dusted peaks that have dominated the landscape since her childhood. She wonders how much longer she will be able to enjoy this view – soon, the only evidence of the Sierra Nevada’s white peaks may be pictures and old maps showing trails to the glacial summits.“Every peak you can see from here, you see it diminished. I feel deeply nostalgic seeing how they are deteriorating,” she says. “The mountain doesn’t speak. Yet, it is alive and feels.”Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanGlaciersClimate crisisColombiaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TheXandFacebookaccounts promote their presidents, but have tended to stop short of full-fledged propaganda.Not any more. UnderTrump’s presidency the White House’s digital communications have blasted past mere propaganda, to a level of bad taste and sycophancy that has shocked observers and prompted concerns that Trump sees himself as a monarch.“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!” the White House blasted out onXthis month. The post featured a fake Time magazine front cover which showed a grinning, svelter-than-real-life Trump wearing a bejeweled gold crown.The post referenced the Trump administration’s move to stop New York City’s congestion pricing scheme, introduced by the state’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, in January. But the reaction mostly focused on the idea that the White House was promoting the president as a king – something which, for a country that fought a war to escape monarchy, represented a bold move.Trump faces Truth Social backlash over AI video of Gaza with topless Netanyahu and bearded bellydancersRead more“Revoltingly un-American”, Adam Keiper, executive editor of the conservative Bulwark news site, wroteon BlueSky. JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor,reactedin a speech in his state’s capitol: “As governor of Illinois, my oath is to the constitution of our state and our nation. We don’t have kings in America, and I won’t bend the knee to one.”Hochul rebutted both the monarchist aspect and the argument that Trump will overturn the congestion pricing.“New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to start now,” Hochulsaidin a press conference.“The streets of the city where battles were fought, we stood up to a king and we won. In case you don’t know New Yorkers, when we’re in a fight, we do not back down, not now, not ever.”But the regal proclamation was the tip of the iceberg for the White House’s output.On Wednesday, Trump faced a fresh backlash afterhe shared an AI-generated videowhich showed Gaza being from transformed into a glittery coastal city and depicted a topless Trump sipping a cocktail with Benjamin Netanyahu.Set to a dance track with the lyrics “Trump Gaza is finally here”, the video showed, among other things, a gigantic statue of Trump in the center of a roundabout in the reimagined Gaza, some children being showered in paper money, and a man who looks like Elon Musk eating a sandwich.It comes after Trump said he wanted the US to “own” Gaza, claiming the strip, which has been devastated by Israeli bombardment, could become the “Riviera of the Middle East”.It might not even be the most offensive footage Trump has posted in recent weeks.A videoposted this month, captioned “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight”, featured officials laying out chains and shackles beside an airplane, before attaching them to faceless individuals.“‘YAY! Other people suffering!’ This from the White House official page? America has fallen,” was one of the most likedresponses.ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, a tingling sensation triggered in some people by soft noises, such as whispering, the tearing of paper, or the crinkling of chip packets. The video represented an effort by the White House to get on board with a trend – although ASMR creators were among those unimpressed.Amy Kay, an ASMR YouTuber,told Huff Postshe believed the video was an attempt to “own the libs”.“Many go to ASMR for the human connection it provides in a disconnected world. It’s a caring and accepting corner of the internet, so seeing it perverted to ‘own’ anyone who happens to have empathy hurts my heart,” Kay said.View image in fullscreenThe White House posted an image of Donald Trump wearing a crown with the words ‘Long Live the King’ on Elon Musk’s platform X.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockAnotherX post, published on Valentine’s Day, showed a scowling Trump and his “border czar” Tom Homan on a pink card. “Roses are red violets are blue come here illegally and we’ll deport you,” the text said.In the comments, some pointed toa Washington Post storythat reported Musk, who was born in South Africa, worked illegally in the US, andan Associated Press articlethat alleged Melania Trump, the president’s wife, was paid for modelling jobs in the US before she was legally allowed to work in the country.Voto Latino, a non-profit organization which encourages Latinos to vote,saidthe post had been “deliberately crafted to provoke and sow division”, but the struggles of immigrant families were not a joke.The organization added: “Using a lighthearted holiday to demean and target communities is not only irresponsible – it is beneath the dignity of the presidency.”The same Trump-as-king photo was also posted to theWhite House Facebook page– “this is absolutely insane” is currently the most liked response –along withthe Valentine’s image.Kate Berner, who was the White House principal deputy communications director under Biden, told the Associated Press that Biden “never would have allowed us to use language like that”.“You can communicate aggressively, clearly in the way that real people talk around the country, and not in the way that’s disrespecting or degrading or something that we wouldn’t want our kids to mimic,” she said.The branding is different from the White House feed under Trump’s first administration. That account was archived on 20 January 2021 after Trump left office, but isstill availablefor viewing. The feed still championed Trump’s achievements, along with regular retweets of Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump. There were favorable media clips and flattering photos of the president. However, there were none of the aggressive memes that have characterized the new feed.The 2025 style instead fits with the pugnacious first month of the Trump administration, which has been characterized by bombastic gestures which have excited and energized Trump’s base. A second benefit has been to upset, and distract, Democrats –a point madeby the Fox & Friends host Lawrence Jones on air.“He is making fun of them! He doesn’t really think he is a king,” Jones said.“He has mastered making them go crazy. He gives them a little bait, and he knows they’re not gonna focus on the issue. They’re going to focus on the name ‘king’.”Just one month into Trump’s second term, there will probably be plenty more bait to come.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsSocial mediaXFacebookfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her predecessor as party chief, Ricarda Lang, shared the picture, sarcastically echoing previous comments by Merz: “Quotas primarily hurt women themselves.”Others asked why the CSU’s Dorothee Bär, one of the few women deemed likely to join Merz’s cabinet, had not been included after winning an absolute majority in her constituency, the strongest result in the country.View image in fullscreenDorothee Bär might have been expected to be included in talks as an experienced politician who won her seat with the strongest result in the country.Photograph: Heiko Becker/ReutersThe CDU politician Lilli Fischer attempted to defend the party on X, saying the general secretary pictured “could have been a woman – if all the women asked hadn’t said no. That’s part of the truth too.”Germans electedfewer women to the parliament as a whole this time, making up 32.4% of the new class of MPs – down from 35%.The Greens will have the most female representation in their parliamentary group with 61%. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland has the least, about 12%, although it chose a woman,Alice Weidel, as its candidate for chancellor.The CDU and CSU are in the middle at about 23% and 25% respectively. The CDU has produced two of the most powerful women in recent European history:Angela Merkeland the European Commission chief,Ursula von der Leyen.But as Merz, 69, pledges a rightwards restoration to pull the party back from the centre after the Merkel years, many observers fear women will take a backseat in the process.The outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, put a premium on gender parity in his centre-left-led government, maintaining a near 50/50 balanceuntil the coalition imploded in November.His predecessor, Merkel, rejected quotas but steadily included more women in her cabinets during her 16 years in power. Her last cabinet had nine male ministers and eight women, including herself.Merz, by contrast, has ruled out a gender-balanced cabinet. “We wouldn’t do women any favours with that,” he said last year, pointing to the “crass miscasting” of a female defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, who wasforced to resign in January 2023, as a reason not to explicitly seek out women.Nevertheless the CDU leader introduced a gender-parity quota in 2022 for his party’s executive board “to show the outside world that we take the issue seriously”.Commentators have long asked whether Merz’s old-school image will prove to be a liability while leading a Germanyriven by deep divisions. Does Merz, they wonder, have aFrauenproblem?An Ipsos poll this month showed thatonly one in six women thought Merz had the qualities necessary to be chancellor. The figure was higher among men, at about one in five, reflecting the biggest gender divide among the candidates in the race.Matthias Jung, a political analyst at the Forschungsgruppe Wahlen institute, called Merz “more of a liability than an asset” for his party in the run-up to the vote, noting an exodus of traditionally conservative older female voters from the party not seen since the 1980s.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz and Angela Merkel in 2001. Merkel is considered to have had a cut-through with politically unaligned women that Merz does not.Photograph: Eckehard Schulz/APSpeaking to Der Spiegel magazine, he called it the “Merkel gap”, referring to the former chancellor’s appeal among educated, politically independent female voters over 45.Analysts say Merz’s weak favourability ratings will prove a challenge after he turned in the CDU/CSU’s second-worst general election result since the second world war with 29%.Exit polls showed 30% of men voted for Merz’s bloc compared with just 27% of women. The gender split wasparticularly stark among younger voters, who abandoned the traditional centrist parties for the fringes.Who is Friedrich Merz, the pilot politician tipped to be German chancellor?Read moreAfter losing a power struggle with Merkel in the early 2000s, Merz took a decade-long hiatus from politics in which he made a fortune in business. During the campaign, opponents picked up decisions he made long ago as an MP to attack him.One of the most high-profile examples was a 1997 vote against making rape in marriage punishable by law. Merz said he had favoured a more limited, conservative-backed version of the bill and has said he would vote differently now.Serap Güler, a CDU board member who has clashed with Merz on migration, admitted during the campaign that the party had been unsuccessful in “liberating” him from the “cliche” of being more retrograde than today’s mainstream.But she called on Merz to take that perception into account when forming his new coalition government, most likely with the Social Democrats. “I would find it more than regrettable if out of 14 or 15 ministries only five were filled by women,” she told Zeit Online.Merkel, who had been tight-lipped about her old rival during the campaign, congratulated Merz on his win by text message, wishing him “luck in forming his government”, a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzWomen in politicsWomenAngela MerkelEuropeGendernewsShareReuse this content"

I pray in particular for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change for our country.”Walters sent the video, in which he announces a new department of religious freedom and patriotism, to all public school superintendents in the state and told them to play the prayer for their students and send it to parents. Schools pushed back, as did the Republican state attorney general, who said Walter had no authority to require students to watch it and that it ran contrary to “parents’ rights, local control and individual free-exercise rights”.Walters’ efforts exemplify attempts to erode the separation of church and state – an increasingly powerful push on the right, with elected officials at the local, state and federal level explicitly stating they don’t believe there is or should be a separation, and that they intend to govern that way.Oklahoma has become a laboratory for this effort, and Walters, as state superintendent overseeing policy for K-12 schools, one of its most prominent proponents. He has pushed to create the country’s first Catholic public charter school. He boughtTrump-branded Biblesthat he wants to put them in classrooms. He has installed prominent rightwing figures such as the activist behind the anti-LGBTQ+ group Libs of TikTok and the leader of the Heritage Foundation onstate education committees.This is whatChristiannationalism looks like in governance – rejecting church and state separation and installing Christian viewpoints – and it’s on the rise with Trump back in the White House.View image in fullscreenAs part of the 50501 Defense of Democracy protests across the US, protesters gather outside of the capitol chanting “impeach Ryan Walters”, on 17 February.Photograph: September Dawn Bottoms/The Guardian“If you support LGBTQ equality, if you are for inclusive and thriving public schools, if you believe science should dominate during a public health crisis, if you are for fighting climate change in necessary ways for human survival, then you are for church-state separation,” said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO at Americans United for Separation of Church and State.Oklahoma is not alone in pushing these kinds of policies. Louisiana passed a law that would require theposting of the Ten Commandmentsin classrooms, which ison holdafter a legal challenge. Texas lawmakers havesignaledthey want to pass a similar law. An Idaho lawmakerintroduced a bill, written by a Christian lobbying group, to require daily Bible readings. A few states, starting with Texas, havepassed lawsto allow schools to hire chaplains. Someargueabortion bans passed in states such as Missouri violate church-state separation by imposing the religious view that life begins at conception.TheUS supreme courtagreed in January to hear a case assessing the ability of the Oklahoma charter school board to create the country’s first public religious charter school, a closely watched test of church-state separation. Oklahoma’s supreme court ruled against the school.After the high court decided to take the case, Walters, who did not respond to requests for an interview,toldthe rightwing Real America’s Voice: “There is no separation of church and state. Good luck finding that in the constitution or declaration of independence.”Is the US a Christian nation?Several groups have coalesced to provide an intellectual justification for the erosion of the separation of church and state – but few have found more success than David Barton, the founder of the Christian group WallBuilders and a longtime proponent of the idea that the founding fathers sought to create a Christian nation.Through WallBuilders, which was founded in 1988, Barton offers churches and activists a trove of materials with historical examples of US leaders who were outspoken Christians – evidence, Barton argues, that the US is a rightfully Christian country.Barton’s claim that the separation of church and state is not a legal guarantee has been widely embraced by the Christian right. Activists including Barton focus on a few historical details to craft their case, like the fact that the phrase “separation of church and state” does not appear in the “free exercise” clause of the first amendment, which prohibits the state from establishing a religion.View image in fullscreenThe First Unitarian church in Oklahoma City keeps a handful of banned books on hand in the youth room.Photograph: September Dawn Bottoms/The GuardianBut scholars reject that claim and point to the establishment clause in the constitution, which prevents the government from creating a state religion.“If you go back to the actual constitution, clearly the founding fathers did not want to privilegeChristianity– or any religion for that matter,” said John Fea, a professor of American history who focuses on the role of Christianity in the country’s founding.The 1947 landmark case Everson v Board of Education of Ewing Township established that not only federal but also state and local governments were required to adhere to the establishment clause of the first amendment. “The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable,” wrote Justice Hugo Black, siding with the majority. The court eventually adopted a three-part test to determine whether the government had violated the first amendment’s establishment clause.In doing so, Barton wrote in a 700-word statement to the Guardian, the court had “unilaterally imposed on America a national religion of public secularism”.A series of recent cases decided by the conservative-controlled supreme court have eroded that standard. In back-to-back rulings in 2022, the court determined that in some cases, state governments are required to fund private religious education and that a Christian football coach at a public school could lead his athletes in prayer.The story of Christian nationalism in the United States is a story of white Christian conservatives terrified of being replaced by a more secular, non-white population, and scrapping with all of their might to make sure that that doesn’t happenSam Perry, Christian nationalism professor at the University of OklahomaView image in fullscreenSam Perry, a professor at the University of Oklahoma who studies Christian nationalism, in Norman, Oklahoma, on 18 February.Photograph: September Dawn Bottoms/The GuardianThe rising tide against church and state separationBehind the current effort to erode the separation of church and state is a constellation of lawmakers, activists, thinktanks andwealthy donorspouring funds into initiatives todivert public dollarsinto private religious education and chip away at abortion access and LGBTQ+ rights.Organizations such as the National Association of Christian Lawmakers (NACL) arecreatingmodel legislation for Christian-based laws, including banning abortion and overturning same-sex marriage, the latter of which Jason Rapert, the group’s founder, thinks the current supreme court could do.“We’ve allowed the ungodly leaders in this country to go too far,” Rapert said. “They’ve led our nation down an ungodly road that has led to ungodly destructive policies.”View image in fullscreenThe Oklahoma state department of education in Oklahoma City, on 17 February.Photograph: September Dawn Bottoms/The GuardianThose wanting to erode church-state separation see Trump as an ally.

He hasreportedlycourted City Elders, a reconstructionist sect based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that, according to its website, aspires to create a “Biblical model of City Governance” and claims to have recruited numerous political “elders” to implement biblical law in local government.Walters’ rise and the broader movement behind it disturbed the Rev Shannon Fleck, the director of the interfaith group Oklahoma Faith Network.“It is the epitome of Christian nationalism in a very blatant and aggressive way,” Fleck said. “There’s no attempt at masking it at all. That has gone completely away, and it’s just a full fledged implementation.”Fleck and a coalition of faith leaders in Oklahoma have launched initiatives to offer religious Oklahomans an alternative to the ultraconservative and anti-LGBTQ+ theology that has come to characterize many churches in the state.View image in fullscreenThe Rev Shannon Fleck at the Oklahoma History Center, in front of the capitol in Oklahoma City, on 17 February.Photograph: September Dawn Bottoms/The GuardianBut her battle is an uphill one: Christian dominionism and the far-right ideas have seeped into Oklahoma politics, with a local “Freedom Caucus” rising to prominence within the statehouse and the City Elders groupgaining influencewithin the state Republican party.And it isn’t only state lawmakers who have come to embrace a radical view of the role of Christianity in government.“There’s a lot of pressure on clergy,” said Fleck, describing the way the pandemic radicalized people online, congregants moving to the right of their pastors.

But she disagreed. Mother Animal, a personal account of Jukes’ pregnancy and early years of motherhood, details her growing realisation of how contaminated her body, and her baby, have become. And it’s something she thinks all would-be parents should be more aware of. There are chemicals from human industry in breast milk, amniotic fluid and bones, she writes. Toxicologists have found “forever chemicals” in embryos and foetuses at “every stage of pregnancy … in lung tissues, in livers”. It is inescapable.Yet it is spoken about far too little. “I find it quite disrespectful to think that mothers wouldn’t be capable of handling [this] information,” she says when we meet at her home on the edge of the Peak District.Around the time she got pregnant, Jukes actively wanted to know what kind of world she was bringing her child into, reading, for example, David Wallace-Wells’ The Uninhabitable Earth,about the scale of the climate crisis and how devastating its effects are and will become. But it wasn‘t until she had her daughter that she realised how much she had missed; how much pregnancy and breastfeeding manuals had left out. “I did not learn about the human studies that found that high exposure to forever chemicals was significantly related to early undesired weaning, or not initiating breastfeeding at all – or that they might be present in the makeup I applied to my skin, and the waterproof coating on my raincoat and the stain resistant fabric on my sofa,” she explains in the book.It’s the disbelief at all she didn’t hear about that seems to drive forward her research and writing, which moves between a wild, controlled anger that is so intimately conveyed you feel you’re in it with her and an unceasing determination to understand the state of play.Jukes says she took inspiration from Sandra Steingraber’s, ​​Having Faith: An Ecologist’s Journey to Motherhood, which looks at the environmental hazards in pregnancy, and Lucy Cooke’s Bitch:A Revolutionary Guide to Sex, Evolution and the Female Animal, which paints a picture of different animals’ sexual identities and sexualities to challenge gender stereotypes. She also spoke to a lot of different experts, including a toxicologist who just so happens to be trying to have a baby. She asks the toxicologist an inevitable question: how does she hold motherhood and pollution in her mind at the same time? Her immediate answer is that she can’t; they have to remain separate. “In asking the question, I realised that I had been looking for reassurance: it’s not as bad as you think. But it is that bad,” Jukes writes.If you look at her setup, Jukes’ life might seem miles away from all of this. She picks me up from a small train station not far from her house. It feels remote in comparison to London, where I’ve come from. The train station is deserted, it looks as if it has not long ago rained, the air feels fresh and you can see lush greenery all around. I imagine the peace you might find living nestled among the trees. I wonder if she feels this, having moved here from Oxford and before that London (there was also a brief stint in Italy and the Welsh borders). Leaving behind her job in the third sector, now she works amid this rolling countryside as a writer and a teacher of writing. But I’m reminded when we speak not to romanticise the natural world as a place of purity. Part of the book is about showing this view of nature as a con, she says, an image that’s created by culture.Jukes is softly spoken and carefully weighs up her answers to my questions. But her frustration is still palpable, sitting in the living room of the former worker’s cottage she lives in with her daughter. What bothers her are the misconceptions around naturalness and motherhood. “I don’t think that had really landed for me before I became pregnant and suddenly I began to find some of the images and advertisements and the discourse [around pregnancy and breastfeeding] really horrifying,” she says. If the connection between mother, baby and contamination is mentioned at all, it’s chalked up to personal responsibility: avoid cigarette smoke, eat less seafood.Mother Animal could have easily turned into a how-to book, and it isn’t difficult to imagine how popular a guide to parenting amid the pollution might be. But Jukes knows individualism is not the answer; making the right choice, even if it were possible, she says, assumes a level of information and financial capability not available to everyone.Being a mother is not about creating a small environment where everything is safe, calm and pure, she explains. This doesn’t exist. Take feeding your baby. There is not comprehensive global data on the likely level of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas, also referred to as forever chemicals) in different peoples’ breast milk, with studiessuggesting it varies internationally and domestically. If you are in an area of high exposure, for example through contaminated drinking water, somepeoples’ breastmilk can have a huge amount of toxins in it.Another recent study of Dutch infants, found a higher level of daily intake of Pfas were influenced by, among other things, exclusively breastfed babies, maternal age and if it was the mother’s first-time breastfeeding. The other feeding option, formula, has problems too.One investigation found 85 chemicalcompounds defined as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are chemicals that interfere with how hormones work, or suspected EDCs in different formula milks and containers, meaning individual low exposure to each substance. At the same time, polypropylene infant feeding bottles release high levels of microplastics, and it seems this increases when they’re exposed to sterilisation and high-water temperatures.Owning up to her culpability was important for Jukes. “Yes, on the one hand I was feeling achingly kind of full of care,” she explains, “and on the other hand … I was causing harm.” She isn’t only referring to the chemical burden she was passing on to her child; she was bringing stuff into their home, throwing it in the bin and from there it was going to affect other creatures and other parts of the world too.Nature, humans, other animals, she believes, are all intertwined. Jukes recounts taking some comfort in learning about the way other animals parent, detailing the wild complexity in how they care for their young in the book. She tells me about the caddis flies, whose larvae don’t have any parental care; they create cases for themselves out of flotsam they find in their environment. Or the Australian three-toed skink, which can have eggs and live young in the same litter. These accounts make moments of this urgent book joyful and expansive. “Who am I to say these simple creatures are not complex? The world is diverse and dynamic,” she says. “These creatures are amazing”.But they are vulnerable too. There are pesticides in seabirds, flame retardants in humpback whales and industrial solvents in penguin eggs. Just like the pregnancy books, the research that she read about other animals parenting techniques often didn’t cover this part. “Mothering creatures evolve to fit the needs of their niche, but those niches are changing, and the extent to which the mothering creatures are able to adapt (rather than remain steady andunchanging) will be a key factor in determining which species survive into the future”, she writes.With all that she knows, I wonder, how does she cope? How do you raise your child amid the toxicity, especially if you know you can’t control it all? She says we have to channel our energies into collective change. “We need to be writing to MPs,” she says. “We need to be making the case that these chemicals should not be circulated at all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In Mother Animal, we rejoin her when she’s embarking on motherhood, we assume with the same person. But over the course of the book, she subtly indicates that their relationship has broken down. It feels like she’s searching for a light in a storm; one of which might be all the animals who show mothering can be much more flexible than we realise.Rare though it might be in the animal world, she writes about mother lions branching off from their prides to raise offspring together and emperor penguins putting their young together in a “communal creche” when they’re out hunting. Maybe we take this variety seriously. Maybe all the responsibility need not fall on the mother. Maybe we think of raising children collectively.Despite this tentative hope, there is one part of Mother Animal I can’t stop thinking about. Jukes speaks to a veterinary epidemiologist in Edinburgh who led a necropsy on an orca, Lulu, who came from a population where there hadn’t been any offspring in 25 years. They found that Lulu had scar-like ovaries, which prevented her from having calves, and she had a level of polychlorinated biphenyls – a group of toxic chemicals used in paints, glue and other industrial products – in her body a hundred times over what is considered safe. These orcas may go extinct within our lifetime. In a world of such toxicity, a world where the climate and our natural world is in crisis, the epidemiologist admitted to Jukes that he’d chosen not to have children.I ask her about this; how did she feel when he said this? She explains that she respects this decision, and understands why people make it. But for her, despite all she knows, all she has learned and all she has written, she maintains that we cannot just stop. “If we do”, she says, “they’re winning”.Mother Animal by Helen Jukes is published on 27 February by Elliott & Thompson.Explore more on these topicsPFASPollutionParents and parentingFamilyPregnancyHealth & wellbeinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, Harris is spending his 90th year ensuring this beloved local facility isn’t lostEmine SanerThu 27 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 03.08 ESTShareThe battleground at the heart of a struggle between an 89-year-old man and a multi-billion pound multinational is a small junction in aNorfolkvillage, where a red phone box stands. And at the red phone box, sheltering from the wind, is Derek Harris. Last month, he learned that BT (formerly British Telecom) was threatening to close the phone box in the village of Sharrington, where he has lived for 50 years, when he saw it on the agenda of the parish council meeting. “I thought: ‘I’d better do something about this,’” says Harris.He has described it as a “David and Goliath” campaign. It is that, and – as becomes clear on this sunlit but biting February day – so much more. We will talk mortality and reprieves, heritage and value. I’ll leave with a renewed sense of how it’s possible to feel real affection for an inanimate object, and why having a mission matters.First, though, some field mice. Sharrington is in a picturesque part of East Anglian countryside. “We’re surrounded by open, rolling, wonderful fields – arable, beautiful,” says Harris, “except they’re inhabited by field mice – and field mice have developed a penchant for the PVC that protects the copper cabling [of phone lines]. Opposite the church, which is just up the road, there is a telegraph pole, and in it, there are three mice nesting.” His eyes sparkle. The rodents gnawed through the wires, disrupting villagers’ phone lines and internet. He knows about the mice, he says, because an engineer from Openreach, the BT-owned company that looks after the network, told him.Harris keeps an eye on Openreach, because there is a green junction box, connected to the new fibreoptic cables, barely a couple of metres from the phone box. It wouldn’t take much to connect the payphone to fibreoptic, insists Harris – as with the whole telephone network, phone boxes will need to be upgraded to digital lines by the time the analogue network is switched off in 2027. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be connected, and so I’ve set my heart on it.” He says engineers visit most weeks anyway. “So maintenance [of the phone box] would be no problem. It’s cost-effective.”The approach we’ve taken is to say that boxes that we think are essential are protected from removalThe UK has 14,000 working phone boxes, down from 20,000 three years ago; at their peak in the 1990s, there were 100,000. Of these, around 3,000 are the iconic red design. When about 95% of households have a mobile phone, it’s perhaps a wonder that phone boxes survive at all.Owned and run by BT, and costing millions of pounds each year, they are required by the regulator Ofcom under the quaintly named telephony universal service obligation. In the year to May 2020, almost 150,000 calls were made to emergency services from phone boxes, as well as 25,000 and 20,000 calls made to Childline and Samaritans, respectively.“We have a legal responsibility to make sure that phone boxes exist to meet the reasonable needs of citizens in the UK,” says Katie Hanson, senior consumer policy manager at Ofcom, who was part of its review on payphones, with new guidance published in 2022. “Obviously, what ‘reasonable needs’ looks like won’t be the same today as it was before everyone had a mobile phone. The approach we’ve taken is to say that boxes that we think are essential are protected from removal.”A phone box cannot be removed if it is the last in an area (more than 400 metres from another phone box), and if one or more of the following conditions apply: if it’s in an area without coverage from all four mobile network providers, or if at least 52 calls have been made from it in the past year, or if it is somewhere with a large number of accidents or suicides (Harris hopes his phone box’s proximity to the A148 is what might save it), or, finally, if there is a high social need – for instance, if it has a number of calls to helplines such as Childline or domestic abuse charities. If a phone box is the last at the site, and none of the other conditions apply, then if BT wants to remove it, it has to start the consultation process with the local authority, which is what has happened in Sharrington.View image in fullscreenThe crisis charities Childline and Samaritans receive thousands of calls from phone boxes.Photograph: Sally Anscombe/Getty ImagesLast year, fewer than 10 calls were made from Sharrington’s public phone box and it is one of 10 in the North Norfolk district council area earmarked for removal. The village, in a conservation area, has a church dating from the 13th century and a Jacobean manor house. Harris believes the phone box is “an iconic heritage asset” and the local MP, Steff Aquarone, has written to Historic England to try to get it listed. “Working K6 models are rare,” says Harris. The K6 (for Kiosk No 6), topped with its gilded Tudor crown, was designed by SirGiles Gilbert Scottto mark the silver jubilee of George V in 1935.Harris has lived in Sharrington for half a century; it’s where he and his late wife brought up two children. The phone box has been there for even longer. Both Harris and the K6 share a birth year – 1935 – which partly explains his affinity for it. He spent his early life in Surrey, near Croydon Airport, enjoying the sight of planes flying overhead.“Very interesting for a little boy,” he says. “It wasn’t such a good location when war started, because airports were targets.” The family evacuated to the south coast, but that wasn’t much safer – German fighter-bombers would attack the area in “tip and run” raids. When Harris was about eight, he survived one such attack while out playing with his brother. “We saw our friends falling wounded; a few got killed.” Years later, as a young man, Harris joined the army and was injured. “A field surgeon saved my life,” he says, but he was warned that he would need multiple operations in the coming years and not to expect a long life (he is, he reminds me a few times, in his “90th year”).View image in fullscreen‘It faced death in 2016; it’s still here’ … Harris with councillor Andrew Brown(left).Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianSharrington’s phone box has also fought off previous threats to its life. “They made an attempt to decommission it in 2016 and we resisted it successfully,” says Harris. “I’ve faced death before, passed through it. It faced death in 2016; it’s still here. Something tells me that it’s meant to stay.” Harris and those campaigning to keep it, including local councillor Andrew Brown, have been given an extra month to plead their case.“It can be a lifeline, and it’s a conservation asset,” says Brown, “a valuable communication resource, given the nature of mobile signalling being so poor around here.” The area is rural and isolated, some villagers have virtually no mobile signal, and North Norfolk has the highest proportion of older residents in England and Wales – the adults most likely not to have a mobile phone. And it has one of the highest proportions of second homes in the country. In an emergency, without a mobile signal or working payphone, try knocking on the door of an empty holiday home – one that probably doesn’t even have a landline anyway.Making their case in 2016, says Harris, “we said it was an animate part of the conservation area. It wasn’t just a museum piece, and people did use it.” But, he acknowledges, “probably more than they do now.”Many of the village elders, who relied on the phone box because they didn’t have mobile phones, have since died, but some elderly people still use it, insists Harris. If the box survives, one of the handful of calls it will have logged in 2025 will have been made by me. I lift the receiver and the crackle and deep hum of the dial tone takes me back to teenage calls, quick garbled ones you had to make before your money ran out. This phone box doesn’t take coins and doesn’t charge me, which I’m confused about. It turns out that there are some phone boxes that can’t take coins or cards, and offer free calls to UK landlines and mobiles.The few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s lifeI ring the only number I can remember without looking at my contacts list – my partner’s. He doesn’t pick up, because who, in this day and age, answers an unknown landline number? So I WhatsApp him to say it was me, ringing from a phone box! We’re both momentarily thrilled by the novelty, and the nostalgia.Mobile phones are everywhere, Harris admits, but he points out that in this part of the country, the signal is sketchy. “We live next to perhaps the most beautiful part of Norfolk, the tranquil Glaven Valley with a pure chalk stream running through it. It attracts ramblers, walkers, the lot, and everyone knows that there’s a working kiosk.” Think if there was an emergency and the mobile network was down – something that may happen more frequently as we increasingly experience extreme weather, he says. “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone said: ‘If only they had kept that working kiosk’?”It has been used in emergencies. “What you have to bear in mind is the few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s life. Not that long ago, there was a snowstorm.” The mobile network was down and the call someone made from the phone box “was the only way that rescue came to save this driver whose car was completely covered in snow – it fell off the top of the hedgerows on to his car, and he was trapped”. And not far away is the main road, known locally as the Sharrington straight – a rare straight stretch of road where Norfolk’s most reckless drivers tend to speed up. Last year, says Harris, “we had two accidents in one day, both serious hospital cases. It’s an accident hotspot.”He makes his case with justifiable, practical reasons why the phone box should be kept, but this isn’t the whole story, I realise, when we’re talking, out of the cold, at a nearby cafe.View image in fullscreen‘The nearer you get to the end, the more you want to see things live. I wouldn’t like to see it die’ … Derek Harris.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“Wouldn’t you like to see a working K6 retained by BT, just for the sake of it?” asks Harris. He is a good talker. He distrusts human rights lawyers, and misses the days when people respected the police. But he’s not all traditionalist – he spent much of his career working in energy conservation. I think he likes purpose and order – he is dressed impeccably in pressed jeans and shirt, and pristine traditional overcoat – which could be why he isn’t keen on the way red phone boxes have been repurposed in other villages. Under BT’s Adopt a Kiosk scheme, phone boxes have become libraries, or home to defibrillators. Why can’t Sharrington’s enjoy a new life as something like that?“It was not designed for that,” says Harris. “What it was designed for was communication. Why should it be changed into something else? It’s a telephone kiosk. It’s not some sort of library or whatever.”Change it into something else, and it becomes a quirky relic of British history. Another dial tone dead. As a functional phone box, says Harris, “it would be alive, wouldn’t it? That’s why I feel empathy – I feel an empathy for a living thing.”For Harris, it’s personal. There’s a comfort in continuity, and it’s about conserving what is worth conserving, leaving the world a better place, or at least not diminished. That includes a working, iconic red phone box in the village in which he has lived for so long. “It’s fighting for what is valuable, cherished.” The older he gets, he says, “there’s this thing about intimations of mortality. The nearer you get to the end, the more you want to see things live. I wouldn’t like to see it die. That’s the way to put it. That’s what I’m fighting for.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ashifa Kassam reportsWhen the Guardian’s European community affairs correspondent,Ashifa Kassam, first moved to Spain 14 years ago, the country was still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. “All they talked about was la crisis, la crisis. They couldn’t see a way out. There was just no light at the end of the tunnel.”Today, things are very different – businesses are opening up, restaurants are packed, and in Madrid “there’s just a buzz to the city that wasn’t there before”.Spain is now the fastest-growing economy in Europe and Ashifa tellsHelen Piddthat while much of the continent is turning against immigration, Spain’s socialist government is moving in a different direction. She explains the policies put in place to encourage people to migrate, the types of people coming, and the jobs they are filling – as well as other factors at play that are driving Spain’s economic growth.As many countries across Europe struggle to reconcile declining birth rates, ageing populations and faltering economies, can Spain make immigration a vote-winner?To see what your European country will look likewithoutimmigration, head to ‘Visualised: Europe’s population crisis’here.Photograph: Kumar Sriskandan/AlamyExplore more on these topicsSpainToday in FocusMigrationPopulationEuropeEconomics"

It was issued byPeter Marocco, a Trump loyalist who is spearheading the evisceration of the US overseas aid program throughUSAid.Marocco said in a letter to UNAids that its funding was being terminated “for the convenience of the US government”. The action was made “for alignment with agency priorities and national interest”, he said.White House demands agencies identify hundreds of thousands of potential layoffsRead moreThe Trump administration’s funding freeze on foreign assistance has already wreaked havoc on HIV treatment programs worldwide. A new UN report has revealed the impact of the cuts on 55 different countries.Before the funding freeze, the US government was responsible fortwo-thirdsof all international financing for HIV prevention in low- and middle-income countries. Much of it came through the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) which was founded by George W Bush in 2003 and which has financed about 70% of the global Aids response.The countries most heavily dependent on financial support from Washington for the fight against HIV/Aids are among the most stricken parts of the planet. They include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and Haiti.A study commissioned by the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation estimates that up to 500,000 people could die in SouthAfricaover the next decade as a result of the US funding cuts. A further half a million new infections might be recorded as a result of USAid grants being stopped to South African health groups.“We will see lives lost,” the foundation’s Linda-Gail Bekker said.Trump’s initial attack on foreign assistance led in the opening days of the administration to a total freeze on funding overseas. That was softened by a 1 February waiver that allowed some life-saving care and services to prevent mother-to-child transmission to resume, allowing 20 million people living with HIV to continue receiving medication.Trump administration cancels meeting on flu shots, fueling anti-vax concernsRead moreDespite the waiver, confusion and a sporadic flow of aid has already caused widespread suffering. Now, the new cut in funds to UNAids, which operates in 70 countries, will probably to add to the devastation.“UNAids has received reports from 55 countries experiencing disruptions in their HIV responses due to the US foreign aid pause,” the executive director of the agency, Winnie Byanyima, said onsocial media.“Any reduction could severely disrupt lifesaving prevention programs, risking new infections and reversing progress to end Aids.”The UN has reported the almost total collapse of services in Ivory Coast since the funding freeze began. US programs had brought life-saving help to 85% of the 265,000 people living with HIV in the country.The initial funding freeze led to a complete shutdown of services. Since the waiver was introduced, most US-funded HIV-prevention services for people at the greatest risk of infection remain closed.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUnited NationsAids and HIVUS politicsDonald TrumpAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In another video, bloodied bodies lay on the ground and injured people were being carried away.Thousands of people were present for the rally, which took place at Independence Square in the centre of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province and the second largest city in eastern DRC.Among the rebel leaders present was Corneille Nangaa, the head of the Congo River Alliance (AFC), a coalition of militias that includes M23. They were leaving the podium when two blasts occurred, a journalist told the Associated Press.Nangaa said at a press conference that 11 people had been killed and 65 injured. A similar toll was given by a hospital source to Agence France-Presse.In a statement, the rebels accused the Congolese authorities of orchestrating the attack, adding: “This cowardly and barbaric act will not be without consequences.”The DRC president, Felix Tshisekedi, called the attack “a heinous terrorist act that was perpetrated by a foreign army illegally present on Congolese soil”.Jean Samy, the deputy president of the civil society Forces Vives of South Kivu, told the Associated Press that the attack was “a sabotage” carried out by unknown perpetrators.Nangaa had earlier told the rally that M23 was bringing “change and development” to Bukavu, one of two key cities in the mineral-rich eastern DRC that it has captured this year. Last monthit seized Goma, the largest city in the region.View image in fullscreenPeople assist victims after the blasts.Photograph: Janvier Barhahiga/APThe M23 advance is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of the long-running conflict in eastern DRC, rooted in the spillover of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of DRC’s vast minerals resources.The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones.The Rwandan-backed M23 is among more than 100 armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the region, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. It is made up of Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than 10 years ago.DRC says Rwanda is directing the group in order to profit from the region’s mineral wealth. UN experts say Kigali is supporting the rebel effort with thousands of its troops. Earlier this monththe Guardian reportedthat hundreds of Rwandan troops had died in DRC in recent offensives.Until recently, Rwanda had denied backing the M23 group, though in recent months it has been more vague, saying fighting near the border threatens its security. It still denies it has a troop presence in its neighbour.M23 has said it is trying to protect Tutsis and Congolese people of Rwandan origin from discrimination, but analysts says these claims are pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement.In January, M23 started making renewed advances in eastern DRC, capturing swathes of territory as it fought against the Congolese army and allied forces.The conflict has exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region, killing thousands and displacing hundreds of thousands. DRC’s prime minister, Judith Suminwa,said on Mondaythat about 7,000 people had died in fighting.The conflict has also pushed people out of the country. More than 40,000 people, mostly women and children, havefled to Burundithis month, including more than 9,000 in a single day.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He cited economic hardship and the climate crisis as reasons for the rising prices of livestock and sheep shortage in the north African state.“Performing it in these difficult circumstances will cause real harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,” the king, who is also Morocco’s highest religious authority, wrote in the letter.Eid al-Adha, which this year takes place in early June, is an annual “feast of sacrifice” in which Muslims slaughter livestock to honour a passage of the Qur’an in which the prophet Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God, who intervened and replaced the child with a sheep.It is a major holiday for millions of Muslims around the world, with traditions so embedded that families have been known to take out loans to buy sheep.Their purchasing power has been reduced, especially in many parts of north Africa, where an enduring drought has intensified inflation in recent years. The price of the preferred domestic sheep can often exceed monthly household earnings in Morocco, where the monthly minimum wage is 3,000 dirhams (£240).Prices have become so exorbitant that 55% of families surveyed by the Moroccan Center for Citizenship, an NGO, last year said they struggled to cover the costs of buying sheep and the utensils needed to prepare them.The country has one of the highest red meat consumption rates in Africa and has lost a third of its national cattle and sheep population since 2016. In its 2025 budget, Morocco suspended import duties and a value-added tax on cattle and sheep to help stabilise domestic prices.On 20 February, the government announced a deal to import up to 100,000 sheep from Australia. It has previously imported cattle from Brazil and Uruguay.The king’s request is the first time in 29 years that Morocco has asked citizens to forgo holiday feasting. King Hassan II, Mohammed VI’s predecessor and father, issued similar decrees three times throughout his reign, during wartime, drought and when the International Monetary Fund mandated an end to food subsidies in the country.Activist groups including trade unions have protested against the costs of basic food items and decried the government’s efforts to curb rising prices as insufficient.Explore more on these topicsMoroccoEid al-AdhaFood securityAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

When I think of my country of Rwanda and what happened in 1994, seed banks were critical when it came to rebuilding after the genocide.”Ubalijoro said countries that had experienced disaster and conflict could emerge as leaders in the fight against climate breakdown.View image in fullscreenDr Éliane Ubalijoro: ‘I viscerally feel the need to preserve our planet’s biodiversity.’Photograph: Azzura Lalani/Cifor-Icraf“We understand the urgency,” she said. “We understand what it is to go through deep despair and having to rebuild completely. It also creates personal stories which people who haven’t gone through such collective traumas can relate to. It’s this idea of having a seed bank for the planet. How we care collectively for each other, how we care for the biodiversity of our food systems is critical.“We have areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America that go from drought to wetlands, so there’s a huge opportunity to learn from the knowledge of Indigenous peoples to create the resilience we need.”It was also important to nurture environments where native trees could thrive, Ubalijoro said. “If you plant trees in the wrong area, you risk creating what are called ecological deserts where local pollinators don’t recognise or feed on those trees, and that actually decreases biodiversity.”She said recognising the significance of women’s roles in agriculture was also important. “In many countries in Africa, 60% of women or more participate in agriculture. We must ensure the biodiversity that is needed to protect these ‘women’s crops’, and make sure they are prioritised,” she said.“I’m a mother. I viscerally feel the need to preserve our planet’s biodiversity. It’s about creating the possibility of a greener, more resilient future together, and making sure the landscapes we cherish today continue to thrive for generations to come.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They areforecast to becomethe leading cause of death in the region by 2030 – driven by factors such as unhealthy western-style diets, less active lifestyles and air pollution.“Aid is not charity” and will inevitably follow donor countries’ own interests such as stopping infectious diseases that could spread overseas, said Gitahi, who called for Africa’s leaders to step up their own work on controlling NCDs.Gitahi spoke to the Guardian at the Global NCD Alliance Forum in Kigali,Rwanda, earlier this month, a gathering of more than 700 delegates from 89 countries.View image in fullscreenDelegates attend the opening ceremony of the Global NCD Alliance Forum in Kigali, Rwanda.Photograph: Gilberto Lontro/NCD AllianceThe challenge is vast, according to Gitahi. “Africa has a big risk of collapse of health systems in the next few years because of NCDs […] 50% of all admissions in a typical African hospital are NCDs, yet 80% of NCD care is out of pocket. And governments don’t have money to actually take care of NCDs.”The blame lies with multinational corporations chasing profits, he said, and with governments failing to bring in regulations to put a brake on their activities. “Politicians think about the next election,” he said. “This issue is about the next generation.”Gitahi, from Kenya, said global health and foreign aid spending had historically focused on diseases that could affect the donors themselves.Less than 3%of development spending for health goes to NCDs.“That is why there is so much focus on TB, HIV, because when you keep HIV low in Kenya, you keep it out of your country because people travel, and people carry diseases,” he said. “But for cancer, for hypertension, for diabetes … that’s non-infectious.View image in fullscreenDr Githinji Gitahi, group CEO of Amref Health Africa.Photograph: Amref“The people who should care about that are their governments because [NCDs] are taking away people from active social and economic participation. Because the governments don’t have enough money […] it is likely to continue being a neglected problem.”The forum’s delegates were meeting as a result of decisions by the US administration tofreeze much of its overseas aid spendingand to issue stop work orders to current programmes. Amref’s work has been affected, Gitahi said.“We do about $250m [£197m] of work a year […] about $50m of that is actually US government partnerships,” he said, in areas including maternal and child health, HIV work and laboratory and health system strengthening.Some Amref staff have been placed on unpaid leave, Gitahi said, though he was optimistic that some of the work will restart after the90-day review periodannounced by Donald Trump’s officials.How will Trump and Musk’s freeze on USAid affect millions around the world?Read more“We hope that at the end of it, they will continue with programming, as they say, that’s aligned to their foreign policy, but actually protects communities and community lives and protects Americans themselves,” Gitahi said. “I keep saying aid is not charity. Aid is strategic investment by a country to protect its own internal interests. That’s what it has always been.”African governments will need to become more efficient and to tackle corruption, he suggested, and to embrace taxation of unhealthy goods, such as tobacco, alcohol and sugar, with the proceeds earmarked for health programmes. They will also need to work on the prevention of ill health, Gitahi said, suggesting they “copy and paste” regulations from western countries that ban things such as the advertising of foods high in sugar, salt or fat to children.View image in fullscreenA ‘call to action wall’ at the Global NCD Alliance Forum in Kigali this month.Photograph: Gilberto Lontro/NCD AllianceUS funding accounts for half of all development assistance in Africa, he said, or $6.5bn out of $13bn. African governments will not be able to completely replace lost funding, Gitahi said, because their economies are not large enough. It may mean reframing goals to provide universal health care to cover “100% of the poor” rather than the entire population.“Africa cannot raise enough money from its fiscal space, from its GDP, to actually take care of all social services,” he said. “Africa needs solidarity.”In the end, the international community should see that solidarity was important for global security, he said. “When you have a weak health system in any country, it is like having an insecure airspace in any country. That [poses] a risk to the entire world.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthA common conditionAidRwandaAfricaCancerDiabetesnewsShareReuse this content"

They were arrested in 2013, but US authorities hadaccused themof continuing to run the Cartel del Noreste, the successor of Las Zetas, from prison.The extraditions come as Mexican delegations visit their counterparts in the US to negotiate another delay of Trump’s tariffs, the deadline for which is 4 March.Mexico will not stand US ‘invasion’ in fight against cartels, president saysRead moreRoughly 80% of Mexican exports go to the US, and experts say the tariffs could send the country into recession – though they would also hit the US economy and business interests too.Mexico won a one-month reprieve from the previous deadline by agreeing to send 10,000 soldiers to the US-Mexico border – even though it was unclear how the extra soldiers would reduce the flow of fentanyl, given that it is so potent that only relatively small volumes are moved, and that the great majority istrafficked through ports of entryby US citizens.Since then, the US has designated six Mexican organised crime groupsas foreign terrorist organisations(FTOs), ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure between the countries.While the designation of cartels as FTOs itself does not authorise US military action inMexico, some fear it is a first step towards it.Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, warned that her countrywould not toleratean “invasion” of its national sovereignty by US forces.Mexico has stepped up its own actions against the Sinaloa cartel, one of the groups now considered a terrorist organisation by the US, arresting several significant figures in recent weeks.US spy drones have been operating over Mexico, feeding Mexican security forces information that assisted in the arrests, according to Gen Ricardo Trevilla, Mexico’s defence secretary.Explore more on these topicsMexicoDrugsTrump administrationDonald TrumpClaudia SheinbaumFentanylUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Police later discovered that he was a Brazilian national who had been attempting to retrieve drugs from a cargo ship’s hull.Both cases were eventually traced back to a crime syndicate founded more than 30 years ago in a São Paulo prison, which has become one of Brazil’s most powerful criminal organisations.The First Capital Command (PCC) now has a growing crime portfolio, with interests across Latin America including cocaine markets and illegal goldmines, and it controls a key drug-trafficking market to Europe.But it has also “significantly expanded its operations into Australia”, according to a newreportby theAustralian Strategic Policy Institutethinktank.And where once it confined itself to supplying drugs to local traffickers, “the PCC’s management of its Australian operations now appears to be markedly more hands-on”, the report found.“I wanted to understand how Brazilian criminal organisations are reaching so far,” said the report’s author, Lt Col Rodrigo Duton, a senior Brazilian police officer. “If organised crime knows no borders, we, as law enforcement, must follow the same path.”Australia’s illicit drug market, Duton said, presents a “compelling opportunity for transnational organised crime groups due to its high profitability and relative market stability”.Duton identifies the 2020 banana pulp seizure as the country’s first recorded instance of PCC activity. “But that doesn’t mean it hadn’t started earlier,” he said.ThePCC emerged in 1993as a prison gang in São Paulo – formed in response to a massacre in which police killed 111 inmates at theCarandirupenitentiary. In the following years, it expanded its operations through retail drug sales, eventually reaching the rest of the country.How a Brazilian prison gang became an international criminal leviathanRead moreOver time, it secured access to cocaine producers in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, and began exporting. “In the past 15 years, the PCC’s primary source of profit has shifted to cocaine exports,” said Bruno Paes Manso, a journalist and researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Centre for the Study of Violence.Although Europe remains the PCC’s primary consumer market, it has rapidly expanded into Africa and Asia due to its “very intelligent way of operating”, said Paes Manso.“Of course they use violence – and they’re just as cowardly as other criminal groups when there is conflict – but they also have a clear understanding that it’s a huge and highly profitable trade of billions of dollars … So they do not aim to control markets or territories beyond Brazil; they seek business partnerships,” he said.And that is what happened in Australia, where the PCC was attracted by an “emerging market”, said Duton, whose report notes that a kilogram of cocaine valued at £2,400 ($3,000) in Colombia can sell for £8,000 in Brazil, £37,000 to £50,000 in Europe, and £127,000 to £159,000 ($160,000 to $200,000) in Australia and New Zealand.The further the drugs are from the producing countries, the harder it is for them to reach their destination, prompting the PCC to diversify its methods of shipment. In addition to shipping containers – preferably with frozen goods, which makes inspections more difficult – they also use divers who attachwaterproof packagesto the hulls of ships and later retrieve them at the destination.The diver found dead in 2022 was later identified as Bruno Borges Martins, who, before the expedition, worked performing underwater repairs on vessels in Santos, the Brazilian city home to the largest port in Latin America – through which thePCC exportsa significant portion of its drugs.Police are still seeking another Brazilian, Jhoni Fernandes Da Silva, identified as Martins’ accomplice in the operation. James Blake Blee, a superyacht tourism operator from Queensland, was charged with organising and facilitating their illegal entry into the country. He pleaded guilty to importing the drugs and wasconvictedin November by an Australian court.Duton believes the PCC’s presence in Australia is still in its early stages but he cautioned that it has significant potential for growth. He believes the group’s expansion can only be contained through strengthened cooperation between Australian and Brazilian police, enhanced border security and a focus on money-laundering operations.Paes Manso argued that the only solution was drug regulation. “Simply banning drugs and imprisoning criminals is not working, and the state never wins because people keep consuming drugs,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeBrazilOrganised crimeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But he expressed hope that businesses in Canada would not want to be seen giving in to trends started in Trump’s US.“They know that diversity is important for innovation and creativity and key to gaining a competitive advantage,” he says. “Employers, however, need to better understand how to leverage a diverse workforce simply having diversity is not enough.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTorontoAmericasLGBTQ+ rightsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It was laterreferredto as “closer to The Hunger Games … than Coachella”.Its founder, Billy McFarland, described byVanity Fairas “the poster boy for millennial scamming”, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to six years in prison. He was later released after less than four years. A New York court also awarded $7,220 each to 277 attendees.But earlier this week McFarland appeared on TV to announce a kind of comeback.“Fyre 2 is real,”McFarland told the Today show. “My dream is finally becoming a reality.”View image in fullscreenBilly McFarland leaves federal court in 2018.Photograph: Mark Lennihan/APOn its website, Fyre was selling tickets for between $1,400 and $1.1m, with vague promises of luxury yachts, soon-to-be-confirmed headline acts and priceless experiences that could include diving with whale sharks, mixology sessions and, more credibly, survivalist challenges.Pushed on the lack of details, McFarland said that people who bought tickets knew they were “taking the risk”, apparently spinning the festival’s notoriety as a selling point.In fact, McFarland himself was not handling the details this time, with partners taking over the festival’s management. He said the festival “really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong.”Gasca was at a tourism fair in Bogotá, Colombia, with other officials from Isla Mujeres when they were blindsided by the Fyre festival announcement.Gasca said he had spoken with the minister for tourism in the state of Quintana Roo and also the hotels that Fyre listed as accommodation for guests on its website, and that none of them had heard about the festival.Impression Isla Mujeres, one of the luxury hotels at which Fyre promised accommodation, told the Guardian it had not received “any approach or enquiry with regards to the event” and that they were investigating it.In a public audience this morning, Atenea Gómez Ricalde, municipal president of Isla Mujeres, said she knew nothing more about the festival than what was online. “People are trying to use the peace and tranquillity we have created here for their own benefit,” she added.“The organisers didn’t even bother to approach the authorities,” said Gasca. “It’s very strange, because any manager knows that if you’re going to hold an event, let alone a massive event, you need municipal authorisation.“I think they thought they would just announce it and see if it got traction, then ask for the permits halfway down the path,” Gasca added. “It’s a bit of a naive way to think.”Given all the media attention the event was receiving, the local government put outa public denial, saying that no permit had been requested for the event.View image in fullscreenA still from Netflix documentary Fyre.Photograph: NetflixThe organisers of Fyre have since sent a statement to the Guardian, claiming to be in contact with local authorities and asserting that the festival will go ahead.Welcome back Billy McFarland and a new Fyre festival. Shows you can’t keep a good fantasist downRead more“We’re producing a highly exclusive, boutique and sustainable experience for FYRE Festival 2, set for May 30 - June 2, 2025,” said Lostnights, the producers behind the event. “Fyre Festival 2 has secured top-tier private venues and hotels in partnership with our local allies who have established communications with the corresponding authorities to ensure full compliance and flawless execution.“As a group, we have established contact with the municipal and state authorities to establish the certainty of a healthy event, and thus, obtained the respective official announces [sic] and collaborations that guarantee total compliance, support the local community, and offer responsibly a boutique event that raises the prestige and long-term value of the destination,” said UNIK Travel, another company involved in the organisation.The organisers did not respond to follow-up questions.“This festival is not going to happen,” said Gasca. “There are red flags all over the place.“If you go on their website and take the coordinates they provide, then put them in Google Maps, it takes you to the ocean – between Cancún and Isla Mujeres,” Gasca added, laughing incredulously.Explore more on these topicsFestivalsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Their future is uncertain as they wait to see whether they will be granted asylum in Panama or elsewhere.“Individuals, including families like our clients, are being sent to Panama without any screening for asylum and despite not having any connection to Panama,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).“And when they get there, they are disappearing into a black box without access to counsel,” he added.Gelernt is one of several lawyers challenging a 20 January executive order fromDonald Trumpthat broadly blocked people from claiming asylum at the Mexico border.In recent weeks, the US has deported some300 peopleto Panama, including people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. These flights are part of the Trump administration’s efforts to sidestep the fact that some countries refuse US deportation flights due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.The arrangement with Panama allows the US to deport these nationalities and makes it Panama’s responsibility to organize their repatriation.But the process, which in this case included an interim stop at a hotel in Panama City where the group was detained by armed guards, has been widely criticized by human rights groups who worry people could be mistreated and who fear for their safety if they were ultimately to be returned to their countries of origin.Police search for woman who escaped Panama hotel where US deportees are being heldRead moreWhen asked at a press conference on Thursday why the people at the camp had been denied access to legal counsel, Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, replied that he “didn’t know”.A US state department official said, “The governments of transit countries will make decisions about who is or is not removable from their countries in accordance with their laws and international obligations.”The National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) attorney Keren Zwick said she was “gravely concerned” about the safety of a Turkish woman and her daughter who were deported from the US to Panama and have since been sent back to Turkey, according to her husband.A copy of the legal complaint against the US government from the ACLU, NIJC and other rights groups said the Turkish woman and her daughter toldUS immigrationofficials they had come to seek asylum. They arrived to the US on 3 February, after the 20 January executive order, before being deported on a military plane to Panama nine days later.Neither Gelernt nor Zwick has spoken with them since they were in the hotel in Panama City.According to the complaint, the woman and her husband had been involved in a religious non-violence movement in Turkey before the government issued a warrant for his arrest, causing him to flee the country. The woman then fled Turkey with her daughter after repeated incidents of harassment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Costa Rica and Honduras have also received deportees from the US.The 112 people being held in the jungle camp initially refused repatriation, Panamanian authorities say. Mulino said that 113 people had already returned to their countries of origin, 16 were traveling on Thursday and another 58 were awaiting tickets for flights home.Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian lawyer representing a family from Taiwan that is being held in the jungle camp, said she had been asking the government for more than a week for access to her clients.“This isn’t normal, we have never seen this in Panama before,” she said. “I should be able to talk to my clients.”Ali Herischi, a lawyer in Washington DC representing 11 Iranians in the camp, said his clients were each given a three-minute phone call by the Red Cross in Panama on Tuesday to speak with their families, but were barred from calling their lawyer.Two other lawyers seeking to offer representation to the deported people said they had been barred access first to the hotel and then to the jungle camp, where they said authorities had also taken away cellphones from several migrants.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsPanamaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Duties will be applied “generally”, Trump said, “on cars and all other things”.The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil – with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening and the auto sector possibly suffering if the US’s two largest trading partners in Canada andMexicoare slapped with taxes.The prospect of higher prices and slower growth could create political blowback for Trump.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinanewsShareReuse this content"

There are no problems. They will be looked after well because they are their people,” Phumtham said. “There are undergoing health checks. After that, they will be sent home. Their relatives have received them.”China’s government had earlier announced that a group of 40 “illegal immigrants” had been repatriated from Thailand. China’s public security ministry said it attached “great importance” to their return and the “repatriation” was “in line with the laws” of China and Thailand and international practice.The security official did not mention that the group were Uyghurs, and many people who commented on social media appeared to presume they were linked to scam farms.At a separate press conference, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian rejected criticisms from “so-called human rights advocates” and said all ethnic groups in China enjoyed rights and freedoms as Chinese citizens.“Certain political forces have been spreading lies concerning Xinjiang in order to disrupt the order in Xinjiang. We are firmly opposed to such interference,” he said.The Thai prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, said only that “the law, international process and human rights” must be followed.The 48 detainees were among hundreds of Uyghurs who fled China in late 2013 and early 2014, travelling to south-east Asia with the help of people smugglers. Many had been told that if they could make it as far as Malaysia they could be resettled to Turkey.The groups were arrested in Thailand in 2014 and the following year109 were sent backto China, prompting global outcry. Photographs at the time showed some of them hooded, handcuffed and guarded by Chinese police. Others were sent to Turkey.The rest have remained in Thai custody for a decade. Five detainees died during that period, including a newborn and a three-year-old.The detained were part of an exodus of Uyghurs fleeing Xinjiang, where China is accused of committing human rights abuses, including the incarceration of about 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.Some governments have labelled the crackdown as a genocide and the UN found that it possibly amounted tocrimes against humanity. China denies the accusations.Elaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch said she feared the returned group now faced “a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance, and long-term imprisonment in China”, having already enduring a decade in immigration detention in Thailand.“Thailand’s actions constitute a blatant violation of Thailand’s obligations under domestic and international laws,” Pearson said. She said that until Wednesday, senior Thai officials had made public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.Last month UN human rights experts urged Thailand to halt the deportation, warning the detainees were at risk of “irreparable harm” if returned.Officials from the Chinese public security ministry claimed relatives of the group had asked for their return. “They and their families have suffered great harm. Their relatives have repeatedly requested the Chinese government to provide assistance so that they can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and reunite with their loved ones. Promoting repatriation is a reflection of the Chinese police’s effective protection of the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens,” an official said.Many relatives of the Uyghurs had pleaded with authorities not to return them to China. “The Chinese government doesn’t want the world to hear their stories,” the brother of one detaineetold the Guardian in January.“The Chinese government is always paranoid about Uyghurs going to a safe country in large numbers and living together,” said the man, who left China in 2016. “They always believe that’s a threat … That is the reason why the Chinese government wants them back.”Earlier this month Paetongtarn made an official visit to China and met Xi Jinping in Beijing. The two countries are marking 50 years of diplomatic relations.Peter Irwin, an associate director for research and advocacy at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said past experience suggested the 40 would be jailed.“I would imagine they will be in prison for the rest of their lives,” he said. “We know this because this has been the case for people who have been deported previously – you just don’t hear from them. The Chinese government treats people who try to flee the country as criminals … There is absolutely no way, from my perspective, that these people will be treated fairly.”Explore more on these topicsUyghursThailandChinaXinjiangAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Who knew what when?Read moreWong condemned thepoliticisation of the issue domestically, saying some politicians “seem to be insinuating” Australia was responsible for China not giving notice of its live fire drills last week.“We now see gunboat diplomacy being added to the litany of war talk from the opposition,” she said.“Such rhetoric does not make Australia safer.”But Paterson accused Anthony Albanese of contradicting the foreign affairs minister and defence officials, and questioned whether he was “across the details”.“It is in the public interest to understand why the prime minister has repeatedly inaccurately described the behaviour of a People’s Liberation Army-Navy task group in our region.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWong responded: “You’re not actually interested in the detail. If you were interested in how we are working to keep Australians safe, you would have asked for a briefing [sooner] than four days after the incident happened, but you’re only interested in trying to invest in a political attack.”No warning was given ahead of time that the Chinese ships were live-firing in the sea on Friday; thefirst alert came from a Virgin flightthat was warned by the Chinese ships over radio that a live-fire drill was already under way as it approached the ships’ position. The plane was forced to divert its course mid-flight.The civilian pilot alerted AirServices Australia which issued a hazard alert over an 18-kilometre zone to a height of 45,000 feet. Over the weekend, 49 commercial flights were forced to divert around the Chinese vessels.Australia andNew Zealandhave raised the lack of warning with Chinese officials, saying it was disruptive to flights and potentially dangerous, while noting the drills were conducted in international waters and in accordance with international law.NZ navy frigateTe Kahawas monitoring the Chinese flotilla at the time of the first live-fire drill on Friday morning, but its alert did not reach Australia until an hour after the first warning from the civilian flight.In a statement, the NZ defence force said: “HMNZSTe Kaha’s primary focus when the live firing notification occurred was ensuring the safety of all vessels and aircraft in the area, including civilian ships and aircraft.“Civilian aircraft and authorities were able to share information that enabled those aircraft to take appropriate action in response.“The key point is that while these live fire activities are allowed under international law, the manner in which the task group notified its intentions did not meet best practice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is being monitored by two NZ navy ships and by P8-A Poseidon aircraft.The chief of the defence force, Adm David Johnston, said this week that it was possible that the three ships are accompanied by an undetected nuclear submarine.“I don’t know whether there is a submarine with them.

The thefts were spread out over 47 incidents, the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis said, adding that the total was a dramatic jump from the $660m seized in 2023.“Hackers linked to North Korea have become notorious for their sophisticated and relentless tradecraft, often employing advanced malware, social engineering, and cryptocurrency theft to fund state-sponsored operations and circumvent international sanctions,” Chainalysis said in its report.UN officials monitoring sanctions imposed on North Korea believe that the proceeds from dozens of suspected cyber-attacks the regime carried out between 2017 and 2023 were used to improve its nuclear weapons programme.While his country’s economy has been battered by sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters, Kim Jong-un has in recent years overseen significant improvements to North Korea’s potential to strike distant targets, including the US mainland.Cybercrime is not the only means by which the regime earns foreign currency. Kim’s regime has supplied weapons, ammunition and troops to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine in exchange for cash and technological knowhow.South Korea’s spy agency claimed on Thursday that Pyongyang had sent more soldiers to Russia, with some deployed to the frontline in Kursk, in addition to about 11,000 North Korean troops already thought to be in the Russian border region.“The North Korean military, after a lull of about a month, was redeployed to the Kursk frontlines … with some additional troop deployments appearing to have taken place,” an official from the South’s National Intelligence Agency told Agence France-Presse, adding: “The exact scale is still being assessed.”Another source of foreign currency has returned to North Korea in the past week, as it welcomed a small number of international tourists, including from the UK, France and Australia, for the first time since the pandemic.Officials are reportedly hoping to attract large numbers of tourists from Russia, some of whom visited last year, and from China. The US, however, has banned its citizens from entering the country since 2017.The victim of the latest heist, ByBit, said an attacker had gained control of an ether wallet and transferred the holdings to an unidentified address.The exchange caters to more than 60 million users worldwide and offers access to various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether.Bybit had in recent days calledon the “brightest minds” in cybersecurity to help it recover the $1.5bn.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaHackingCybercrimeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Who knew what when?Read morePeters is in Beijing for a three-day visit after relations between the two countries became strained over the drills.New Zealand and Australian officials said that China had conducted live-fire exercises in international waters between the two nations, giving little notice and forcing commercial airlines to divert flights.China only gave “a couple of hours’ notice,” New Zealand’s defence minister Judith Collins told Radio New Zealand, rather than the expected 12 to 24 hours. A longer lead time would give airlines time to plan alternate routes.Australia has complained more vociferously about the lack of notification. Foreign minister Penny Wong said she sought an explanation from Wang when the two met in Johannesburg last Saturday following a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 nations.2:33Wong shares details about 'unsafe and unprofessional' Chinese firing exercises – videoChina’s official Xinhua news agency made no mention of the issue in an initial report on Peters’ meeting earlier in the day with Han.The three Chinese ships were south of Tasmania in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and were now moving west, the New Zealand defence force said on Wednesday.Peters said he also raised China’s missile launch test last September that landed near French Polynesia’s exclusive economic zone, of which “most Pacific Island nations got no warning at all” and New Zealand got “little warning.“China was considering the issue of providing earlier notice for future naval drills, he said.In his talks in Beijing, Peters said the return of President Donald Trump to the White House came up more than he had expected.He didn’t provide any details, but said that both sides agreed that “perhaps we should just wait and see what happens when the dust settles.”Peters has also voiced concerns that the Cook Islands, which is self-governing in free association with New Zealand, hadsigned a comprehensive strategic partnershipand other agreements with China, without satisfactorily consulting with New Zealand.China “needs to understand the constitutional arrangement” between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Peters told reporters, adding that New Zealand got more information out of China on the deals than it got out of the Cook Islands.Peters said last week his country must “reset” its relationship with its Pacific neighbour after its opaque dealings with Beijing.The agreement spans education, the economy, infrastructure, fisheries, disaster management and seabed mining. It set off alarm bells in New Zealand due to concerns over China’sgrowing presence in the Pacific regionand potential threats to the country’s national security.Wang said that China respects the traditional relations between New Zealand and the Pacific island countries.The Cook Islands is a self-governing nation and maintains free association with Wellington, sharing a head of state and citizenship rights. It is permitted an independent foreign policy, but the two countries are required to consult on security, defence and foreign policy issues.The two diplomats also discussed trade and economic issues during Wednesday’s meeting, with Wang calling for cooperation on new growth engines such as artificial intelligence and green economy.About a quarter of all New Zealand exports went to China in 2024.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandChinaAsia PacificWinston PetersnewsShareReuse this content"

The statement did not say when he died or from what cause.Spassky is best remembered for his duel with US player Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between east and west, and was later referred to as “the match of the century”.The cold war showdown has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit, which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.Spassky became world champion in 1969 and held the title until he played the match that would define his career, facing the eccentric American prodigy.The Soviet Union had dominated the game for years and Spassky faced a must-win situation, initially taking the lead.But the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.Spassky showed great sportsmanship, applauding Fischer after losing the sixth game.Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, Spassky admitted decades later it was a relief to be rid of a “colossal responsibility”.Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.Spassky, who was the oldest living world chess champion, represented France in three chess Olympiads in 1984, 1986 and 1988, and was seen playing in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris during the 1990s.His health deteriorated in the early 2000s, and he disappeared from Paris in August 2012 before resurfacing in Moscow in October that year.“It was my desire to return to Russia, because my time in France had run its course. It was time to start a new stage. I understood it was time to leave,” Spassky said at the time.Explore more on these topicsChessRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Andrew Tate spoke briefly to reporters to profess his innocence after the brothers emerged from an executive terminal about 90 minutes later, and before they were driven away in a large SUV.Authorities in Romania said prosecutors had approved the brothers’ request to travel. The anti-organised crime unit, Diicot, said the pair remained “under judicial supervision” and would have to “appear before the judicial authorities at every summons”.It added that any violation “may lead to a higher custodial measure”. Romania’s justice minister, Radu Marinescu, said the brothers, who are dual British and US nationals, must return to Romania for their next court appearance on 24 March.In Florida, meanwhile, state officials said they were launching a “preliminary inquiry” into the Tates. In apost to X, the state’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, wrote: “Florida has zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women. If any of these alleged crimes trigger Florida jurisdiction, we will hold them accountable.”It followed comments from the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, at a press conference earlier on Thursday: “Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct in the air.”In a separate development, a Tate representative said an appeal court had “restored ownership of properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares” to the brothers. Authorities seized several luxury cars, land and property in 2023.The pair are outspoken supporters of Donald Trump, and several members of the US president’s inner circle havespoken out publiclyagainst their treatment, including Donald Trump Jr who described their detention as “absolute insanity”.Elon Musk responded to a suggestion from Andrew Tate that he would “run for prime minister of the UK” by saying “he’s not wrong”, while one of Tate’s lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, is the White House liaison official for the US Department of Justice.According to Ingrassia, the Tate brothers were “sacrificed on the altar of the Matrix under the banner of egregious crimes they never committed”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has appeared on a pro-Tate podcast.Asked by reporters in Washington if there had been any US involvement in their departure, a Trump administration official said they had “no insight right now on anything related to the Tate brothers”.Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer, and his brother, 36, had been under a travel ban since theirarrestalong with two Romanian women on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.Diicot launched asecond inquiry in Augustinto alleged crimes including forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.The brothers were among six people taken into custody then, when authorities ordered them to be placed under house arrest. The Tates and their suspected accomplices have denied all of the charges against them in both cases.The brothers are also wanted by UK authorities who have filed an extradition request over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012. A Romanian court has ruled that proceedings in Romania must be concluded first.In a joint statement, four British women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they felt “retraumatised” when they found out he had left Romania.“It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania,” the women said. “He will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.”The women had warned last week that the US government might push Romania to ease their travel restrictions, and the Financial Times has said Washington raised the Tates’ case with Romanian authorities.The women’s lawyer, Matthew Jury, told the BBC that they had been “the victims of the most horrible and horrific alleged crimes … And to see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser is incredibly traumatising.”The Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, confirmed that Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, had spoken to him about the brothers’ travel ban at this month’s Munich security conference.Hurezeanu said Grenell told him he was “interested in the fate of the Tate brothers”, but he said there was “no form of pressure, no threat” from the US side and that “things are perfectly clear as far as we are concerned”.Romania’s prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu, has also denied that the US made any request to Bucharest regarding “the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by Romanian authorities”, either during the conversation or after it.Tate has been banned from several social media platforms for misogynistic views and hate speech but has more than 10 million followers on X, where he promotes an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.In its second case against the brothers, Diicot alleges they used the so-called “loverboy” method – convincing people they are in a romantic relationship – to force 34 women into making pornography that was sold online for almost $3m (£2.1m).Diicot alleges one of the defendants forced a 17-year-old to produce pornography in Britain and Romania, creating profits of $1.5m, and also alleges that the defendant repeatedly had sexual relations with a 15-year-old.Speaking to journalists in Florida, Andrew Tate did not respond to a question about whether he and his brother intended to go back to Romania. Instead, he attacked what he said was a conspiracy against them, and blamed “media spin, smears and lies” for their position.“We’ve yet to be convicted of any kind of crime in our lives ever. We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said.“Our prosecutor recently decided, because we have no active indictment in court, to let us go. In the democratic society, it’s supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, as my brother and I are.”It was not immediately known where the Tate brothers were heading after leaving the airport.It is also unclear whether they will meet with Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach is about 45 miles (72km) north of Fort Lauderdale. The US president is scheduled to arrive in Florida on Friday for a weekend visit.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And especially the German car industry, which will suffer a big drop in exports when many firms are already struggling.”The economic impact on the EU could be lessened by higher US fees on imports from rival markets. On Thursday,Trump announcedthat from 4 March he would go ahead with 25% levies on goods from Mexico and Canada and double the supplementary tariff on Chinese products to 20%.Canada and Mexico had understood that commitmentsmade earlier this monthto help secure their borders with the US had meant they would avoid Trump’s threats of extra tariffs.Hinz said he would be re-running the simulation exercise to take the new measures into account, but it was already clear that US consumers would be among the biggest losers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there will be a greater impact on imports from Canada, Mexico and China than we previously calculated, creating a bit more of a level playing field with the EU.”EU officials have indicated they will respond to any tariffs on goods exports to the US with their own protectionist policies.Hinz pointed out that even if the tariffs were called off, there would still be economic harm. He said: “The uncertainty surrounding which of these measures will actually be implemented makes it difficult for businesses to plan ahead.

She signed a retraction at 1.15am and wasarrested for “committing public mischief”.The Strasbourg-based court, which referred to the Briton as “X” in its judgment, said: “The Cypriot authorities failed in their obligation to effectively investigate the applicant’s complaint of rape and to adopt a victim‑sensitive approach when doing so.”It noted “numerous shortcomings” in the investigation and awarded the student €20,000 in damages.“In conclusion, the court observed that the case revealed certain biases concerning women inCypruswhich impeded the effective protection of X’s rights as a possible victim of gender-based violence,” the judges said.Timeline: the British teenager convicted over rape claims in CyprusRead moreThe Briton had resorted to the continent’s highest human rights body after the Cypriot attorney general, the island’s top legal authority, rejected her lawyers’ request to open a new inquiry with external investigators who could consider the rape complaint “fairly and dispassionately”.The EHCR judgment was hailed as a “huge vindication” for the Derbyshire student.The British barrister Michael Polak, who heads the London-based legal aid group Justice Abroad, and represents the woman, said: “The result couldn’t be better. It’s a monumental victory for our client but also for the rights of women, other victims of sexual violence, and their access to justice.”Cyprus, he said, had been found in breach of the European convention of human rights by refusing to order a fresh inquiry into the rape allegations after the island’s supreme courtthrew outthe case, acknowledging the Briton had not been given a fair trial.Lawyers in Cyprus who had represented the complainant said the European tribunal’s decision was a triumph against a system that frequently did not take victims seriously.“This is a big win,” said Nicoletta Charalambidou, a leading human rights lawyer in Cyprus. She observed that the credibility of victims of rape in the country was “very often questioned by a system built on patriarchy and discrimination against women and girls”.In 2019 the woman was made to give testimony over several hours in the absence of a lawyer or psychologist. She described how she had been attacked by the tourists while she and her boyfriend had been having consensual sex.She claimed the night began to go horribly wrong when the other men, at her partner’s behest, barged in, attacking her “one by one”.The Briton’s defence team argued that her decision to withdraw the complaint was made under duress after seven hours of police questioning and accepted despite their client’s highly distressed state. “Overnight, she was turned from being treated as a victim into a suspect,” Polak told the Guardian.The retraction allowed the alleged assailants, who were aged between 15 and 22 and included the sons of senior Israeli officials, to immediately return home.Womens’ groups in Cyprus and Israel deplored the handling of the case. Activists from both countries who gathered outside the courts as legal proceedings unfolded said the Briton had fallen victim to a macho culture and to the desire of the two eastern Mediterranean nations to maintain close diplomatic ties.Polak said Thursday’s landmark ruling reinforced the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence should be properly investigated “without institutional obstruction”.“Our client has shown immense resilience in her pursuit of justice,” he said. “We hope this outcome will empower others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a leftwing guerrilla movement, was founded in 1978 demanding that south-east Turkey become an independent Kurdistan.At least 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in on-and-off fighting that has spilled into other parts of the region.In the 1990s, the PKK dropped its demand for independence, calling instead for greater autonomy inside Turkey’s borders. Today it is still considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the UK, the EU and the US.Who is Abdullah Öcalan?Öcalan, now 76, is one of the founding members of the PKK. He was born in Şanlıurfa, in southern Turkey, and after the creation of the group he fled to Syria.After being forced to leave Damascus, he was arrested by Turkish intelligence agents in Kenya in 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment on İmralı island, off the coast of Istanbul, where he has been held incommunicado for long periods of time.Öcalan has advocated for a political solution to the conflict since 1993. He has continued to write books from prison and has been involved remotely in previous rounds of peace talks.Why has the announcement happened now?The imprisoned PKK leader has received three visits from members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party since the olive branch from the Turkish government last autumn.DEM’s co-chair Tuncer Bakırhan said earlier this month that Öcalan’s message would be “a roadmap for the democratic resolution of the Kurdish problem, taking it from an arena of violence to one of politics, law and democracy”.It is widely believed that Erdoğan is seeking to restart the peace process with the PKK because it is popular with voters. The Kurdish question is also linked to geopolitical tensions caused by the war in Gaza, the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, and rising hostility between Israel and Iran.What will this mean for Turkey, Syria and the rest of the region?The last peace agreement between Erdoğan’s government and the PKK, in 2013, was enthusiastically received across the country, but hostilities restarted two years later.A major question that remains is how Öcalan’s message will be received by the leaders of the PKK’s military wing, mostly based in northern Iraq’s mountains. The area has beenheavily bombedby the Turkish air force for several years.In Syria, a PKK offshoot known as the YPG, or People’s Protection Units, forms the backbone of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF controls the north-east of the country and has fought against the Turkish army and Turkish-backed Syrian Arab groups for years.If the PKK lays down its arms, an agreement between the autonomous Kurdish-led administration and the new Turkish-backed interim Syrian government will be easier.Explore more on these topicsKurdsTurkeyEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaexplainersShareReuse this content"

The announcement was made a day after Hamas handed over the bodies of four Israeli hostages, the last due to be released under the terms of the six-week first phase of the deal agreed in January.Six hundred Palestinian prisoners and detainees who were supposed to be released over the weekendwere freed overnight on Wednesday, 46 of them women and children. Some had had limbs amputated while in Israeli custody, and many were emaciated.Stage one of the ceasefire is due to end on 2 March. Negotiations on how to implement the second stage – which would lead to a permanent end to the war – were supposed to begin weeks ago, but have been repeatedly postponed as the fragile truce has lurched from crisis to crisis.Both sides have accused the other of repeated violations of the agreement, which paused 15 months of fighting, allowing for a massive increase in aid supplies and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all positions other than border areas of the Gaza Strip. More than 48,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the conflict, which has reduced the territory to ruins and created a dire humanitarian crisis. About 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage in theHamasattack that prompted the war.Israel wants an extension to phase one of the deal in the renewed talks, government officials told Israeli media on Thursday. It is unclear what will happen if stage one expires on Sunday without an agreement on prolonging the first stage, whether the weekly batches of hostage swaps of stage one will continue, or for how long any extension will last.Opinion polls show that most Israelis are in favour of continuing the ceasefire in order to free the remaining 59 hostages, at least 39 of whom are believed to be dead. However, Netanyahu is loath to commit to the second stage of the truce because of pressure from most of his rightwing government to fulfil the war’s stated objective of “total victory” over Hamas. An extremist coalition partner has threatened to quit and collapse the government if Israel does not return to fighting, which would make the Israeli prime minister more vulnerable to corruption charges.In a statement on Thursday, Hamas said it was ready to begin talks on the second phase, and that the only way remaining hostages in Gaza would be freed was through “commitment to the ceasefire”.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, told reporters that the delegation would travel to Egypt to see whether there was common ground to negotiate an extension. “We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible, we’ll do that,” he said.The Associated Press reported on Thursday that Israeli officials had confirmed the country would not withdraw its forces from the Gaza-Egypt border zone, as per the ceasefire agreement, which could once again plunge the truce’s future into jeopardy.Hamas, responding to comments from Israel’s energy minister, Eli Cohen, in which he demanded the Israeli military remains on Gaza’s southern border, said that any Israeli attempt to maintain a buffer zone in the corridor would be a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement.In stage two of the deal, of uncertain duration, Israel is supposed to completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war, and talks on future governance of the strip should begin. Reconstruction is due to begin in stage three, but there are huge differences on both sides about Gaza’s future.Hamas has said it is willing to give up control of the Gaza Strip to other Palestinians, but its leadership refuses to go into exile. Israel maintains that it will not allow Hamas or the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to administer the territory when the war ends.Also on Thursday, a car-ramming in northern Israel injured 14 people, one critically, in an attack police said had been carried out by a 53-year-old Palestinian from Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The suspect was shot dead at the scene.Overnight, dozens of Palestinians were arrested by Israeli troops as part of an extended military operation across the West Bank that began two days after the truce in Gaza went into effect.Explore more on these topicsIsraelHamasIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

A group of older Kurdish peace activists ululated as the call to lay down arms was read out.“This is the breaking point of history and it is a positive one,” said Sırrı Süreyya Önder of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party. “We are here with a compass to find a possible route out of these dark, chaotic days.”Önder hinted at some of the potential problems to come, adding that while Öcalan called for the PKK’s dissolution and to lay down arms, this “requires the recognition of democratic politics”, and legal support for a sustained peace.DEM politicians said they were hoping for a reprieve in government pressure after the announcement. Authorities in Ankara have sought to replace politicians and mayors affiliated to the group, particularly in the majority-Kurdish south-east.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government has sought unilateral disarmament from the PKK, publicly quashing suggestions that Öcalan’s announcement would herald the start of peace talks.Some in government responded to Öcalan’s announcement with caution. “We will look at the result,” said the deputy head of Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party.The PKK has been responsible for a string of attacks since its founding in 1978, notably car bombings and shootings primarily aimed at Turkish military and security targets. The group claimed responsibility for an attack on a state-owned arms company near Ankara last October, killing at least five people and wounding 22 more.A ceasefire between the PKK and Turkey collapsed in 2015, prompting Ankara to renew attacks on the group using drones and airstrikes, targeting fighters across the mountains of northern Iraq. The International Crisis Group thinktank estimates thatmore than 7,152 people have been killedin clashes or attacks in Turkey and northern Iraq in the years since, including 646 civilians, more than 4,000 militants, and almost 1,500 members of Turkish security forces.Öcalan’s message will ripple across factions of Kurdish armed groups spread across north-eastern Syria and northernIraqwith links to the PKK, particularly the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who battled IS militants and remain in control of a swath of territory including two large cities in eastern Syria.The group is in talks with the new authority in Damascus after theoverthrow of the former president Bashar al-Assad, negotiating control over north-eastern Syria as well as their future role in a nationwide military force. Öcalan’s announcement is likely to further pressure and isolate the SDF, who have clashed with Turkish-backed militias in Syria and long been targeted by Turkish strikes.“The announcement for PKK to dissolve and lay down its arms, to be clear this only concerns the PKK and is nothing related to us here in Syria,” the SDF commander-in-chief, Mazloum Abdi, told a press conference.Even so Abdi said should peace flourish between Ankara and the PKK, it would remove any pretext for Turkish attacks on areas under SDF control. Negotiations with Damascus remain their “top priority,” he added.Gönül Töl, an analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said Öcalan most likely decided the time was right to call for an end to hostilities as “he thinks things are not going well for the PKK right now”.“It’s about his legacy,” she said. “He wants to be the one who ended this fight, and the PKK doesn’t have many options. There is a new authority in Syria, and the SyrianKurdsdon’t have a strong hand. In Iraq, there’s a new central government that is more willing to work with Turkey to squeeze the PKK.”Berkay Mandıracı, of the International Crisis Group, said the PKK appeared to be “weakened” after a decade of intensive fighting.“Turkish officials now appear to assess it is a good time to end the 40-year conflict with the PKK through a mix of military force and political manoeuvring,” he said, spurred by regional shifts across the Middle East. With Ankara poised to play a major role in Syria and the wider region, he said, Turkish officials wanted to remove any potential impediments.Rumours of a declaration have rumbled for months while the DEM party shuttled between different Kurdish factions and Öcalan’s island prison for negotiations.How the different factions within the PKK might respond to Öcalan’s call also remained opaque. Thehead of the Syrian branch of the PKK told Al Arabiyathat disarmament must be accompanied by the group being “allowed to work politically”.“If the reasons for carrying weapons disappear, we will lay them down,” he said, adding that Turkish attacks necessitated the group carrying weapons. The group would consult among themselves about how to implement Öcalan’s call, he said.Earlier this month,one PKK commander told a television channelclose to the faction that much of the group would only regard the command as serious if Öcalan demanded they disarm after walking free from prison.“This work cannot be done only through a call,” he said. “We are a movement with tens of thousands of armed people. These fighters are not on a payroll to be sacked. These are ideological fighters.” Öcalan, he said, “has to speak while free. If not, how can [PKK militants] be convinced to lay down their arms?”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyKurdsIraqSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

By dawn on Thursday morning, three out of the four had been positively identified, according to a group representing the hostages.Meanwhile, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Khan Younis in Gaza and in Egypt, where 97 of the prisoners were deported. They will stay there until accepted by another country, Israeli officials said.Ambulances brought freed Palestinians to the European hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where they were set to undergo medical examination.Prisoners freedin previous exchanges have had limbs amputated while in Israeli custody and many were extremely emaciated.The Palestinian Prisoners’ Information Office said on Thursday morning that 642 prisoners had been released overnight in the seventh phase of the Gaza ceasefire, of whom 46 were women or minors. If confirmed, it means Israel freed more Palestinians than scheduled, after a four-day breach in the ceasefire agreement.‘No rules’: Gaza’s doctors say they were tortured, beaten and humiliated in Israeli detentionRead moreOn Saturday, Israel had been due to free 602 prisoners and detainees in exchange for six surviving hostages, but the government suspended the transfer of the prisoners at the last moment, in protest at what it complained were the propaganda ceremoniesHamasstaged to hand over hostages and the remains of the Israelis who had been killed while in captivity.View image in fullscreenRed Cross vehicles, carrying the bodies of four Israeli hostages, leave the pickup point after Hamas handed over the bodies without a ceremony in Gaza.Photograph: Abdallah F.s. Alattar/Anadolu/Getty ImagesSince then, Hamas agreed to hand over the four hostages’ bodies away from the cameras, and in return Netanyahu’s government said it would proceed with the prisoner releases, but implemented a new system of identity checks, first at the point of transfer in Kerem Shalom using dental records, followed by a more thorough check at a national forensics laboratory. The new measures followed an incident on Saturday when Hamas delivered the wrong body, apparently in error.Hamas said in a statement early on Thursday that the only way the remaining hostages would be freed was through commitment to the Gaza ceasefire deal. It said it had abided by the agreement and was ready to start talks on a second phase.The bodies handed over to the Red Cross just after midnight on Thursday morning were named by Hamas as Shlomo Mantzur, Tsachi Idan, Ohad Yahalomi and Itzhak Elgarat. The IDF said the identities of the bodies had not yet been verified.Relatives of Idan said that he was alive when he was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023, according to a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group representing families of the hostages.“Since Tsachi was kidnapped, we received several signs of life, and in the previous deal last November, Tsachi was alive and expected to be released,” wrote the family. “We are still waiting for the much-needed certainty, which we can only receive after his arrival in Israel and after all necessary examinations are conducted by the authorised state authorities.”The latest exchange came as the UN human rights chief accused Israel on Wednesday of showing an unprecedented disregard for human rights in its military actions in Gaza and said Hamas had violated international law.“Nothing justifies the appalling manner in which Israel has conducted its military operations in Gaza, which consistently breached international law,” said Volker Türk, while presenting a report on the human rights situation in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem to the human rights council in Geneva.“The level of devastation in Gaza is massive – from homes, to hospitals to schools,” Türk said, adding that “restrictions imposed by Israel … have created a humanitarian catastrophe”.Türk added: “Hamas has indiscriminately fired projectiles into Israeli territory – amounting to war crimes.”The exchange and the resumption of the ceasefire deal followa national day of grief in Israelwith thousands of Israelis waving flags, holding candles and singing the national anthem, lining the route of a funeral procession for two small children and their mother who were held hostage and died in captivity in Gaza.The bodies of the Bibases, who Hamas said were killed by airstrikes, were handed over last week. An Israeli autopsy report ruled the children had been murdered by their captors and then mutilated to simulate wounds from bombing.The funeral was held in the town of Tzohar, near the border with Gaza and Nir Oz kibbutz, where the family lived. The ceremony was private but mourners lined the road from the central city of Rishon LeZion holding Israeli flags and yellow banners, symbol of the hostage families and supporters, to watch the cortege go by.With the transfer of the four hostages’ bodies and the release of the Palestinians, the two side will have completed the obligations for the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. The second phase, due to start at the weekend, includes the release of all remaining hostages, and the complete withdrawal of the Israeli military from Gaza, but negotiations on the details are yet to begin just a few days before the weekend deadline.One possibility being studied to keep the ceasefire alive while the second phase is being negotiated is to extend the first phase, but it is yet to be agreed whether more hostages and prisoners would be released during the extension.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The board has required the executive to report back at the earliest opportunity on the outcomes of the work the director-general has commissioned.”The documentary waspulled from BBC iPlayeron Friday 21 February after it was revealed that Abdullah al-Yazouri, the film’s 13-year-old narrator, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.A spokesperson for the corporation said BBC News conducted an initial review which “identified serious flaws in the making of this programme”.“Some of these were made by the production company and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable. BBC News takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation’s reputation. We apologise for this.”The spokesperson added: “During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections [the boy] and his family might have with Hamas.“Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy’s father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government.“It was then the BBC’s own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.”The spokesperson added that the production company, Hoyo Films, told the BBC it paid the boy’s mother, via his sister’s bank account, a limited sum of money for the narration.“While Hoyo Films have assured us that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift, the BBC is seeking additional assurance around the budget of the programme and will undertake a full audit of expenditure,” the spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenHoyo Films said of the documentary: ‘We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.’Photograph: Ibrahim Abu Ashayba/BBC/Hoyo FilmsIn a statement, Hoyo Films said: “We felt it was important to hear from voices that haven’t been represented on screen throughout the war with dignity and respect – and to tell the story about the devastating impact of war on their everyday lives.“We are cooperating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made. We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.”The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, has asked for an independent review into the making of the documentary to be expedited. It will be undertaken by Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews.In response to the BBC’s statement, Danny Cohen, a former director of BBC Television, said: “The BBC must allow a full independent inquiry to investigate the processes that led to this documentary being produced, and the pervasive anti-Israel bias that allowed it to pass through the system unobstructed.”View image in fullscreenCharlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, is to take up a new job at Sony later this year.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/Shutterstock for Edinburgh TV FestivalArtists for Palestine UK, a network of creative workers, said: “We are appalled that the BBC has chosen to give credence to a politicised campaign that sought to discredit a documentary about children’s experiences of unspeakable Israeli military violence, because one child’s father was deputy agriculture minister in Gaza.“This disgraceful decision comes despite nearly 900 media figures having warned the BBC of the dangers of such an approach.”Earlier, the BBC announced the departure of its creative chief after five years in charge.Charlotte Moore, the corporation’s chief content officer since 2020, is to leave later this year to take up a job at Sony.There was no suggestion from Moore or the BBC that her departure was connected to the row over the Gaza documentary.Moore said: “It’s been a tough decision to leave a job I love and an institution I believe in. But I’ve decided the time is right for a new challenge and a new adventure and to follow my heart to return to making shows.”She said it had been an honour to “lead the BBC creatively as chief content officer at a time of unprecedented change” and she was “very proud of what we’ve achieved during my time at the helm”.She will become chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, owned by Sony, which made the Netflix royal drama The Crown and the Starz Scottish historical show Outlander.Davie said Moore was “a creative powerhouse and real visionary who has made a huge impact during her time at the BBC”.Last week a letter was sent to Moore, Davie, and Deborah Turness, the CEO of BBC News,asking challenging questionsabout the documentary.The documentary’s two UK-based directors, Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash, gave directions to two Palestinian camera operators based in Gaza over nine months of filming.The BBC initially added a clarification to the film, but last Friday the corporation removed it from its platforms, saying: “There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company.”The letter to Moore, Davie and Turness was signed by Cohen, a former BBC One controller, and more than 40 others. It asked if the BBC knew about the child’s father, what diligence checks were undertaken, whether Abdullah or his family were paid, and whether Hamas permitted or authorised the filming.On Wednesday aseparate lettersigned by 500 film, TV and other media professionals called on the BBC to reinstate the documentary, saying it was an “essential piece of journalism, offering an all-too-rare perspective on the lived experiences of Palestinians”. Among the signatories were Gary Lineker, Mike Leigh, Juliet Stevenson and Ken Loach.Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevision industryCharlotte MooreGazaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

That Ukraine will help shape. That’s backed by strength to stop Putin coming back for more.“I’m working closely with other European leaders on this and I’m clear that the UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal. Working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last.”Starmer stressed that any deal had to be one that lasted, and that was why security guarantees were so crucial. But Trump suggested that keeping the peace would be “the easy part” and the difficult bit was getting the deal done.Trump stopped short of providing a firm commitment on security guarantees, but instead suggested the US having a multibillion dollar stake in Ukraine’s rare earths sector would be enough of a deterrent for Russia.Starmer plays royal card as he tiptoes around the madness of King DonaldRead more“We’ll be working there. We’ll have a lot of people working and so, in that sense, it’s very good. It’s a backstop, you could say. I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.”Asked whether returning territory seized by Russia could play a part in any peace deal for Ukraine, Trump added: “We will certainly try and get as much as we can back.”The US president appeared to disagree with Starmer’s suggestion that, without a US military backstop, Putin would invade again. “I don’t think so. I think when we have a deal, it’s going to be the deal,” he said.“I think he’ll keep his word. I’ve known him for a long time now, and I think he will. I don’t believe he’s going to violate his word. I don’t think he’ll be back when we make a deal. I think the deal is going to hold now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think we’re gonna have any reason for it. I think we’re going to have a very successful peace.”He said that the British had an “incredible military” that “don’t need much help” and could “take care of themselves” very well but added that if UK peacekeeping forces came under attack “if they need help, I’ll always be with the British”.Trump also distanced himself from his previous remarks falsely calling Zelenskyy a dictator.“Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that,”he said, before admitting that the relationship between the two men had got a “little testy” over financial support but was now on firmer ground.0:18'Did I say that?': Donald Trump denies calling Zelenskyy a dictator even though he did – videoIn a further sign of a healing relationship between the two, Trump praised Zelenskyy as “very brave” and said he got along with him “really well”.He added: “We’ve given him a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure, they have really fought. Somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave in that sense.”A trade deal between the UK and the US, centring on technology, is also on the cards, although British officials suggested this might require further deregulation. Trump did not rule out imposing tariffs on the UK but said he had a “warm spot” for the country, which was in a very different place” from the EU, highlighting his own investments in Scotland.He added that Starmer had tried to persuade him not to introduce tariffs as the two countries had a balanced trading relationship. “We have a very good chance of arriving at a trade deal that could be really terrific for both countries.”In the only slightly terse exchange of the Oval Office session, Starmer pushed back againstJD Vance, Trump’s vice-president, after Vance repeated some of his criticisms of a supposed lack of free speech in European countries.Asked about this, Vance talked of “infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British – of course what the British do in their own country is up to them – but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens, so that is something that we’ll talk about today at lunch.”Starmer replied immediately: “Well, we’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn’t want to reach across US citizens, and we don’t, and that’s absolutely right, but in relation to free speech in the UK I’m very proud of our history there.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpRussiaTrump administrationJD VanceVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Marking deteriorated, returning to the hospital two days later. She underwent surgery for complications arising from a femoral hernia but died on 20 February 2024.Henderson said the PA had acted independently in the diagnosis, treatment, management and discharge of Marking without independent oversight by a medical practitioner.The coroner said: “Given their limited training and in the absence of any national or local recognised hospital training for physician associates once appointed, this gives rise to a concern they are working outside of their capabilities.”The coroner said the term physician associate was misleading to the public. “Mrs Marking’s son was under the mistaken belief that the physician associate was a doctor [and] no steps were taken by the emergency department or the physician associate to explain or clearly differentiate their role from that of medically qualified practitioners.”Henderson added that the lack of public knowledge about PAs “has the potential to hinder requests by patients and their relatives who would wish to seek an opinion from a medical practitioner”.At the end of Marking’s inquest last year, Henderson concluded the clinical management she had on her first visit to hospital – and later the issues with anaesthesia when she was operated on – “materially contributed to her death”.In November, the UK governmentordered a review of the role of PAsin the NHS, amid growing alarm in the medical profession about patient safety. It will examine the safety of their roles and how patients should be made aware that, despite their titles and ability to diagnose illness, they are not doctors and can only perform certain tasks.About 3,500 PAs and about 100 equivalents in anaesthesia – called anaesthetic associates – are working in hospitals and GP surgeries inEngland.PAs can take a patient’s medical history, conduct physical examinations, analyse test results, diagnose illnesses and help draw up the plan for managing a person’s condition. They do two years of medical training, far less than a doctor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A government review is ongoing but this tragic case already shows it must result in nationally agreed safe scopes of practice for these assistant roles.”A spokesperson forSurreyand Sussex healthcare NHS trust said: “We will continue to look carefully at the details of this case to ensure we learn any lessons.“Physician associates follow a nationally recognised programme of training and work within a very specific scope of practice under the direct supervision of a consultant, as was the case here. All of our physician associates wear designated scrubs with their job title, physician associate lanyards, and use the recommended introduction of their role when meeting patients.”An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS has always been clear that physician associates are not replacements for doctors and should only practise with appropriate medical supervision, but there remain legitimate concerns about the roles and so the [government-ordered] review will gather insight from across the NHS to ensure they are being used appropriately.”This article was amended on 27 February 2025.

He added: “I have a feeling it’s going to work out very well.”The apparent backing may be a surprise to British officials, who had been prepared for possible pushback against the idea.Speaking the day before, David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said Trump would have an effective veto over the plan, given the joint use of Diego Garcia.The Conservatives have raised repeated objections to the draft plan to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius, with the Diego Garcia base remaining under UK control ona 99-year lease, and some in the government arealso worried about the proposal.Asked about the plan as he sat alongside Starmer, Trump said: “We’re going to have some discussions about that very soon and I have a feeling it’s going to work out very well. They’re talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years, actually. It’s a long time. I think we’ll be inclined to go along with your country.”He added: “It’s a little bit early, we have to yet be given the details, but it doesn’t sound bad.”Starmer has argued that the talks with Mauritius, started under the last government, are vital to secure the future of the military base, given uncertainty about the future of UK control of the islandsafter international court rulings.But critics have questioned the need, with the Conservatives alleging the plan will see billions of pounds paid toMauritiusunder the terms of the lease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the early 1970s, between 1,500 and 2,000 islanders were forcibly deported so that Diego Garcia could be leased to the US to use as an airbase. The proposed deal with Mauritius has also been criticised for having no real provision for them to return.Speaking to ITV’s Peston show from Washington on Wednesday, Lammy had said the deal could be scuppered if Trump objected.“If President Trump doesn’t like the deal, the deal will not go forward,” Lammy said. “The reason for that is because we have a shared military and intelligence interest with the United States, and of course they’ve got to be happy with the deal, or there is no deal.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyDonald TrumpMauritiusUS foreign policyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Other government agencies have also seen huge staffing cuts in recent days.The firings specifically affected probationary employees, a categorization that applies to new hires or those moved or promoted into new positions, and which makes up roughly 10% of the agency’s workforce.“The majority of probationary employees in my office have been with the agency for 10+ years and just got new positions,” said one worker who still had their job, and who spoke to the Guardian under the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “If we lose them, we’re losing not just the world-class work they do day to day but also decades of expertise and institutional knowledge.”Another anonymous staffer called the laid-off workers “dedicated, hard-working civil servants who came to Noaa to help protect lives and keep our blue planet healthy”.“These indiscriminate cuts are cruel and thoughtless,” the second worker said.It is not only laid-off employees who will be harmed by the cuts, the second worker said. Ordinary Americans who rely on Noaa’s extreme weather forecasts, climate data and sustainably monitored fisheries will also suffer.“Words can’t describe the impact this will have, both on us at Noaa and on the country,” the employee said. “It’s just wrong all around.”Andrew Rosenberg, former deputy director of Noaa’s National Marine Fisheries Service, said Thursday was a “sad day”.“There is no plan or thought into how to continue to deliver science or service on weather, severe storms and events, conservation and management of our coasts and ocean life and much more,” he said. “Let’s not pretend this is about efficiency, quality of work or cost savings because none of those false justifications are remotely true.”Among those who received the emails were workers hired through Schedule A, a hiring authority agencies can use to connect with diverse candidates including veterans and people with disabilities. Schedule A workers have a two-year probationary period in which they are at-will employees and enjoy fewer labor protections.All of the probationary employees at Noaa’s Environmental Modeling Center, which improves weather, marine and climate predictions, lost their jobs, one employeepostedon social media.The Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen called mass layoffs within the commerce department “flatly illegal” in a letter on Wednesday to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick.That same day, the climate non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists sent a separateletterto Lutnick, signed by more than 2,500 scientific experts calling for Noaa to maintain its funding and staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her comments were issued alongside Congressman Gabe Amo’s, the ranking member of the subcommittee on environment, after news of the firings broke.“By firing essential staff who work tirelessly on behalf of the American people, President Trump and Elon Musk are playing politics with our national security and public safety,” Amo said. “Leaving Noaa understaffed will inevitably lead to additional chaos and confusion – I call on them to rehire these public servants immediately before preventable tragedy strikes.”Lutnick assured Congress during his confirmation hearing that Noaa would not be dismantled under his watch. “It seems either Lutnick willingly lied to Congress and the American people or that he has caved in record-breaking time to the destructive agenda of the Trump-Musk regime,” said Dr Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Rick Spinrad, who served as Noaa administrator until January, said the cuts were “at best misguided and ill-informed”. At worst, he said, they would be “dangerously risky to the lives and property of Americans all around the country”.Craig McLean, the former director of Noaa research who served the agency for four decades before retiring in 2022 agreed, calling the firings “callous, insulting, vengeful and offensive”.“The nation will be compromised in safety, science and international standing by these reckless, blind acts,” he said. “This is not my America.”The Trump administration has not commented on the firings.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The plaque features the words “Magical, Alluring, Galvanizing and Adventurous” andthe city commission confirmedit was a reference to Maga. The former Minnesota Vikings player then made critical comments about the Trump administration before saying he would “engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience” and walked on to the meeting’s stage. He was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting an assembly.On Thursday Kluwe said he had been fired from his job as a football coach at Edison High School in Huntington Beach.‘Against everything this country stands for’: ex-NFL player Chris Kluwe takes his local anti-Maga protest nationalRead more“I knew it was a possible consequence,” Kluwe told the Guardian via email. “I think it just goes to show what Maga actually stands for – they don’t want to build anything, they just want to tear people and institutions down to make themselves feel better, regardless of what it costs the community. I sincerely doubt Edison is going to find another ex-NFL player to coach freshman football.” He said he was not given a reason for his dismissal but was told he had brought a lot of attention to the school.At the council meeting, Kluwe was highly critical of the Donald Trump’s Maga movement.“Maga is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and most importantly, Maga is explicitly a Nazi movement,” he said. “You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that’s what it is.”All seven members of the Huntington Beach city council are conservatives and one member, Gracey Van Der Mark, said there was “nothing peaceful” about Kluwe’s protest. She said he was guilty of “causing alarm among those in attendance, including two young students”.Last week,Kluwe told the Guardianhe has a court date in April over his arrest. “We’ll see what happens. There’s a possibility the ACLU might get involved. Some people have been telling me they’re looking to challenge this because they think it might not be legal.”Kluwe was outspoken on social issues during his NFL career, which lasted from 2005 to 2013, and heclaimed he was eventually releasedby the Vikings because of his beliefs and his support for same-sex marriage.Kluwe’s freshman team had a poor season in 2024. They finished with a 1-1-8 record and were outscored 297-47. The varsity team won the Division 1-A state championship.Huntington Beach High School District has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsCaliforniaWest CoastTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Over a quarter, 26%, believe it is worsening compared to 70% last May.69% of Democrats now believe the US economy is getting worse compared with 36% last May; 11% think it is getting better compared with 32% last May.Independent voters’ views have shifted the least with 12% believing the economy is improving (11% last May) and 56% thinking it is getting worse (59% last May).Official figures show little change in the nation’s finances. Unemployment remains low, stock markets are high and the rate of inflation has slowed. But many Americans still wrongly believe the US is in a recession.About 43% of Republicans currently believe that the US is in a recession, down from 67% in May last year. The rebound in Republican sentiment marks a noticeable shift compared with independents, 53% of whom thought the US was in recession last May compared with 46% now, and Democrats (49% now v. 50% in May ).A slope chart showing how Republicans are now less likely to believe the US is currently experiencing a recessionPoll after poll showed Democrats lost the 2024 election because people – especially Republicans – were unhappy with the economy. The latest Harris poll shows just how deeply Americans view the state of the US economy through a political lens.Harris found support for Trump’s tariffs also comes down to party lines, with Democrats the most worried about their impact on the US economy. But in bad news for Trump, the majority of independents and more than a quarter of Republicans also believe tariffs will have a negative impact.49% of all polled said tariffs will have a negative impact on the US economy.43% of Republicans, 17% of Democrats and 19% of independents said the impact would be positive.28% of Republicans, 63% of Democrats and 54% of independents said it will have a negative impact.While the staunch Republican supporters back the party, it’s clear not all Americans are feeling the euphoria of Trump re-entering the White House.“The public’s economic perceptions now resemble a kid’s game of tetherball – slamming back and forth from bad to good based on whose party is in office,” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “Now let’s see if the administration can hold their supporter’s confidence and swing middle voters as they enact their hypersonic agenda over the next two years.”The broad consensus that the US is in recession once again highlights the disconnect between official data and public sentiment. The US is not experiencing a recession and has not had one since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.But that hasn’t stopped Americans from feelinglike the economy is bad. Anger over inflation probably played a major role in the outcome of the US election, as many Americans reported frustration over rising prices.A line chart showing the latest figures on the rate of inflationTrump promised to be the change candidate in his second term, criticizing Biden and Kamala Harris for high prices and promising to bring strength back to the US economy. But so far, any positive sentiment has mostly been felt by Republicans. Democrats and even independents appear skeptical.This is especially clear when it comes to tariffs. Trump has called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” and has promised to overhaul US trade relations.Trump appears to be staying true to his word. He delayed the 25% tariffs he was planning to place on Canadian and Mexican imports, but implemented a broad 10% tariff on all Chinese imports. Trump also said his administration would implement reciprocal tariffs against countries his advisers deem are being unfair to the US.The president has said Americans could feel “some pain” due to the tariffs, but promised that the impact on the US economy will make it all worth it.Few Americans agree. Only 26% of Americans said that Trump’s tariffs will have a noticeably positive impact on the US economy. And the optimism wanes particularly when it comes to impact on personal finances. Only 33% of Republicans believe that tariffs will positively impact their personal finances. In comparison, over half (52%) of Democrats and 45% of independents believe the impacts on personal finances will be negative.Though tariffs have been making headlines since November, many Americans (40%) still wrongly believe that foreign countries exporting goods are the ones who pay tariffs. Tariffs are paid by companies that import foreign goods into America. But Republicans (48%) were more likely to believe that foreign companies pay the tax, compared with 32% of Democrats and 39% of independents who believed the same.Even with more support from Republicans on his tariffs, Americans have a pessimistic outlook on the future of the US economy. Over half (60%) think the US will experience a recession in 2025, that includes 43% of Republicans and 62% of independents.Views in the media’s coverage of the economy have also experienced a political U-turn. Democrats and independents believe the economy is worse than the media makes it out to be (69% and 66% v gen pop: 60%), Republicans think it’s better than the media make it out to be (56% v gen pop: 40%).The post-election shift in views is once again on display. Today, 56% of Republicans believe the economy is better than the media portrayal compared with 26% in May last year while 31% of Democrats think it is better compared with 55% last May.This survey was conducted online within the USbythe Harris Poll from 13 to 15 February2025, among a nationally representative sample of 2,131 USadults.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump administrationEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trade union leaders expressed alarm. “Hundreds of thousands of people, including hundreds of thousands of military veterans who are part of the federal workforce will be kicked to the curb, and this just says ‘no thank you for your service, we are not interested in you’,” said Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees.“There are so many agencies that are already understaffed and struggling, and there’s only two possible outcomes,” Simon added. “They’ll either be privatized, hiring contractors to do all the work at a much higher cost with much less accountability, or the programs will simply cease to exist and the services will not be delivered to the American people.”The Trump administration’s latest memo, issued on Wednesday, was sent by Russell Vought, director of the office of management and budget, and an author ofProject 2025.The federal civilian workforce ofabout 2 million peoplehas already been roiled by funding freezes, contract cuts, firings and employees placed on administrative leave.Lindsay Owens, the executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive thinktank, argued Trump and the billionaire tycoonElon Musk, whom he recruited to scour the federal government on an efficiency blitz, are “waging a war against your local postal workers, park rangers and Head Start teachers”.“They’re attacking the workers who help Americans access their social security benefits and ensure the chicken, vegetables and baby formula on grocery store shelves are safe,” she warned, disputing the administration’s claims of government efficiency behind these actions. “They are about funding billionaire tax breaks and making everyday people pay the price.”Trump administration ends funding for UN program fighting HIV/AidsRead moreThe latest moves are “dangerous to Americans”, said Suzanne Summerlin, a labor attorney and federal labor relations expert.Federal agencies “are created by Congress, historically in response to some harm that has befallen Americans”, she added, citing examples such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, founded in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression, and the Food and Drug Administration, created in 1904 in response to Upton Sinclair’s book The Jungle, which exposed dangerous conditions in meatpacking plants.“Each of these agencies exists because bad actors, whether corporations, financial institutions or government negligence, put the public at large at risk,” Summerlin said. “Dismantling them means repeating the same history of harm.”“Most of these changes are not only going to harm federal employees, but also everyone else who lives in the US,” said a current federal employee in the National Archives in Washington DC who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. “Cutting federal employees is not going to make inflation magically go down or their eggs become cheaper.”There will be “a domino effect” with increasingly tangible impacts, they warned. “It’s going to severely interrupt operations like getting tax returns, serving healthcare to veterans, receiving subsidies that often benefit people who run farms and so much more.”“This administration has targeted every single federal worker and does not seem to care how much turmoil they cause for either the employees or the American public. The chaos is the point,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. “What it will not do is result in any discernible savings for taxpayers – in fact, taxpayers likely will end up paying more as the essential work our government does is sold off to private, for-profit contractors.”Mal Loungway, an equal opportunity specialist with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in Minnesota since 2013, spent years working at the agency to improve resources for marginalized groups and people with disabilities, including under Trump’s first administration.But as soon as Trump took office for a second term, they were placed on administrative leave following Trump’sexecutive ordertargeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and accessibility in the federal government, along with several other colleagues.

The Department of Defense has alsoissueda memo to fire all transgender members of the military, which transgender rights advocates estimatedcould be as many as 15,000.“These are scary times we’re living in that this man [Trump] just willfully does whatever he wants,” said Loungway. “And the fact is, he essentially gets to because the supreme courtsaid that he could. That is where I think this is going to run into a lot of issues, because he’s just going to keep pointing back to ‘Oh well, my bad. But I have immunity.’”Nearly 25,000 probationary employees have been fired out of more than 220,000, though the office of special counsel (OSC) hasdeemedsome of the firings as unlawful. The Merit Systems Protection Board agreed to pause for 45 days the firing of six workers as the OSC is seeking ways to include more workers without filing individual cases.Scott Gagnon, regional director at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for six states in the New England region, was terminated on 14 February as a probationary employee.“I think it’s a real loss for the country to have us looking for jobs instead of doing the jobs we were hired to do,” said Gagnon. “Now states won’t have that go-to person when they’re running into any barriers or challenges implementing addiction and mental health services with federal funds in their region.”The hiring freezes enacted by theTrump administrationhave also affected workers who had already applied, interviewed and accepted job offers with federal agencies. Federal hiring under Trump’s first administration typically ranged from about 30,000 to 40,000 workers monthly.At the National Park Service, an employee currently at another federal agency had interviewed and accepted a job offer in environmental policy. But the offer was rescinded after Trump froze federal hiring on his first day in office.“The supervisor, who had been so kind throughout the process, sent me an email expressing his heartbreak, but he had no control over the decision,” they said. “I had worked so hard to get here, to finally feel like I was making a meaningful contribution, and now all of that had been ripped away without even a second thought.“The helplessness I felt was suffocating. This wasn’t just the loss of a job. This was the loss of everything I had worked for, everything that had shaped my identity and my purpose.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Voters have a right to know that government employees are serving the public interest and not their own personal interest.”Payne’s points are underscored by the potential financial gains for Musk’s businesses as he leads Doge. SpaceX, Tesla and other Musk companies, for instance, have won at least $18bn in federal contracts from Nasa, the defense department and other agencies during the last decade. Overall, six Musk companies have been investigated or fined 32 times by 11 agencies, according to the New York Times, raising more red flags about potential conflicts involving Musk’s businesses and Doge.“Musk is now a federal officer subject to the criminal conflict of interest statute, 18 USC 208,” said Richard Painter, George W Bush’s ethics counsel who now teaches law at the University of Minnesota. “He cannot own stock in Tesla which offers car loans and at the same time participate in dismantling the CFPB. Also he cannot have X [formerly Twitter] go into consumer finance and at the same time participate in dismantling the CFPB.”Likewise, given Musk’s artificial intelligence business xAI, Painter stressed: “AI will have a big role in making the government more efficient, However, federal officers working for Doge cannot legally have an equity stake in an xAI company that will very likely make money from the government shifting toward AI.”Meanwhile, Democratic state attorneys general have mounted legal challenges to Doge’s extensive agency operations and its efforts to obtain vast amounts of sensitive private data.A lawsuit by 19 Democratic attorneys general to block Doge from accessing US treasury systems with millions of private documents about social security and tax payments won a victory on 20 February, when a New York judge upheld another court’s temporary restraining order.Last weekend, Musk ignited a political firestorm that brought opposition from key cabinet officials at state and the FBI, when he sent an email to some two million federal employees demanding they explain what they had accomplished in the previous week by late Monday.Musk warned darkly on his social media platform X: “failure to respond would be taken as a resignation”, which sparked more chaos and criticism. Later, the office of personnel management indicated that employees didn’t have to comply with Musk’s dictum, but with Trump’s backing, he reiterated his demands.Other concerns about Musk’s work have been prompted by Doge claims of identifying $55bn in wasteful federal spending, a large chunk of which has been wildly exaggerated. Exhibit A: one Doge document boasted of cutting an $8bn program that turned out to be closer to $8m, according to multiple news reports.Musk’s cost cutting modus operandi seems to be generating public dismay, according to new polls. One Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed that Americans disapprove (52 to 26) of Musk “shutting down federal government programs that he decides are unnecessary”.Perhaps in response, Musk and theTrump administrationhave recently offered conflicting statements about Musk’s exact role with Doge that seem aimed at masking his unprecedented clout. One White House official in a sworn statement this month responding to a lawsuit against Doge, referred to Musk as just another “employee” with no decision-making authority.But Musk’s enormous sway with Trump was palpable when the mogul attended and spoke at length at the first cabinet meeting on Wednesday where both he and Trump talked up their far reaching cost cutting mission; Wearing a modest “tech support” tee shirt, Musk said deferentially that “I do what the president asks.”Earlier in a bizarre joint interview with Sean Hannity, of Fox News, on 17 February, Trump and Musk offered mutual admiration, while belittling concerns of conflicts of interest or the need for independent ethics oversight.When Hannity asked Trump how he would react if he saw a conflict for Musk, Trump said simply: “He wouldn’t be involved.” In turn, Musk blithely claimed if there are conflicts: “I’ll recuse myself. I mean, I haven’t asked the president for anything, ever.”At another well-choreographed event on 11 February, Musk popped up in the Oval Office with Trump nearby to boast with scant details that Doge is doing what “the people want”, with broad brush claims of cutting wasteful spending; Musk has also faced fire for making unproven and glib allegations that he’s cutting “corruption”.Despite their cavalier attitude about the need for transparency, experts say Musk’s myriad business ties while leading Doge merit strong oversight.“The power and influence Musk is exercising over government agencies and operations while his companies have billions of dollars in government contracts and have been subject to government regulation, financial penalties and oversight presents wide-ranging and dangerous conflicts of interest,” said former Federal Election Commission general counsel, Larry Noble, who now teaches law at American University.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which has fined SpaceX on numerous occasions for safety violations, is facing severe cutbacks championed by Musk,” he said.Holman added that “the SEC is seeking $150m from Musk companies for securities violations, and is now being neutered by Musk. The National Labor Relations Board is investigating labor conditions at Musk companies, and it is now being dismantled under Musk. The CFPB has been investigating safety violations with Tesla cars and that agency is now on the chopping block.”Payne voiced other concerns about Musk’s freewheeling Doge operation given his official role as a “special government employee”.“Criminal law prohibits special government employees from making government decisions where they have financial conflicts of interest,” Payne said.“Musk’s decisions may violate criminal law when they involve agencies that regulate or contract with his companies, [including] agencies such as the FAA, CFPB, EPA and defense department.”Payne noted too that “Musk’s conflicts of interest include the potential use of his AI company to support Doge’s review of sensitive government data. The problem is that he may personally benefit if he uses government information unavailable to competitors to train his AI system. He can also become the federal government’s primary AI service provider, leading to lucrative government contracts.”Likewise, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and a few other senators plus Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland wrote to Musk on 13 February calling for public disclosure of a confidential disclosure form that Musk was required to submit as a special government employee.The letter charged Musk was exploiting a loophole in ethics law to avoid disclosing his financial interests. The White House has said Musk will file a confidential financial disclosure report given that he is serving as an unpaid special government employee (SGE).But the letter stressed that “Given the scale of your power to carry out sweeping administrative policies and your vast personal financial interests, the American people deserve to know how you stand to profit from your role in the Trump Administration.”On Tuesday, the White House indicated that a former US digital service official named Amy Gleason was Doge’s acting administrator, but just last week, Trump at a Miami financial conference declared that he had “put a man namedElon Muskin charge” of Doge.Notably, Doge’s genesis seems to have come in a two-hour streamed interview that Trump did with Musk on X last August where Musk suggested a similar notion to Doge. Trump quickly voiced strong interest in the tech mogul’s idea as he was starting to donate a record $288m to boost Trump’s campaign.“I need an Elon Musk – I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts,” Trump said during their talk on X.The next month, Trump spoke about the need for a new efficiency commission in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, prompting Musk to write on X: “I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises. No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.”But the recognition Musk is now receiving has become much more critical, with calls mounting for tough oversight of his conflicts and serious questions about Doge’s operations.Matt Platkin, New Jersey’s Democratic attorney general, who has joined a few of the state AG lawsuits targeting Musk and Doge actions, said that he thinks Musk’s “conflicts are astounding and deeply concerning, and the disregard for the rule of law should scare every American”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskDogeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And especially the German car industry, which will suffer a big drop in exports when many firms are already struggling.”The economic impact on the EU could be lessened by higher US fees on imports from rival markets. On Thursday,Trump announcedthat from 4 March he would go ahead with 25% levies on goods from Mexico and Canada and double the supplementary tariff on Chinese products to 20%.Canada and Mexico had understood that commitmentsmade earlier this monthto help secure their borders with the US had meant they would avoid Trump’s threats of extra tariffs.Hinz said he would be re-running the simulation exercise to take the new measures into account, but it was already clear that US consumers would be among the biggest losers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there will be a greater impact on imports from Canada, Mexico and China than we previously calculated, creating a bit more of a level playing field with the EU.”EU officials have indicated they will respond to any tariffs on goods exports to the US with their own protectionist policies.Hinz pointed out that even if the tariffs were called off, there would still be economic harm. He said: “The uncertainty surrounding which of these measures will actually be implemented makes it difficult for businesses to plan ahead.

The low-cost airline attracted more customers during a time of heightened cost-of-living pressures.“Importantly, Jetstar was able to help more Australians take a holiday for less,” Hudson said.Jetstar’s earnings across all of its destinations grew 35% over the past year, with domestic growth even stronger at 54%. The budget carrier flew more seats to achieve this, with an 8% uptick in capacity, helped in part by the introduction of eight new aircraft.Qantas and Jetstar’s strong domestic growth since July 2024 coincided with the collapse of Rex’s domestic jet services between major capitals, as well as the disappearance of Bonza and its regional to regional airport holiday routes from the market, allowing the dominant airline group to further increase its market share.On Thursday, Hudson said “we were really sad to see Rex go” but insisted Jetstar was 20-30% cheaper than Rex’s airfares on competing routes such as the lucrative golden triangle between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Rex’s base economy fares, however, included check-in luggage, which Jetstar customers pay extra for.Qantas has announced changes to its loyalty program. But will they benefit frequent flyers?Read moreCapacity was also up on the international routes where Qantas and Jetstar compete with other carriers, with the added supply leading to a 6.6% average reduction in air fares.Japan has been a popular international market for both airlines, spurred on bythe weak yen. Qantas Group’s chief financial officer, Rob Marcolina, said the company paid close attention to the impact of global exchange rates on travel patterns.Marcolina said as budget travellers more likely to fly Jetstar cooled on its Honolulu routes due to the weak Australian dollar and high hotel costs in the Hawaiian city, the company shifted that capacity into more premium Qantas services. Qantas posted a 2.5% increase in demand for premium cabins across its international routes. And as Australia’s cost-of-living crisis continued, Jetstar customers continued to show interest in Bali.Qantas released its results hours after the federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, announced he had granted approvalfor Qatar Airways to take a 25% stake in Virgin Australia. The change will see Qantas’ domestic rival relaunch long-haul international services – initially through planes and crew leased from the Doha-based carrier – and be able to tap into Qatar’s global network.Qantas had opposed the Virgin-Qatar deal during government consultations, but on Thursday, Hudson said she was confident her company was up for the challenge.“I think that having more competition, that actually makes us better,” she said.Hudson announced the company’s first dividend payment since 2019, with $250m in base dividends, paying 16.5c a share, and $150m in special dividends, paying 9.9c a share – both fully franked.Qantas has recently sought to build hype aroundplans for non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourneto cities such as London, Paris and New York, but the ultra long-haul services were repeatedly delayed following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, a $120m penalty and compensation settlement with the consumer watchdog over selling thousands of tickets to already-cancelled flights, as well as the costs of ayears-long legal battle over illegally outsourcing ground handlers– which has so far included $120m in compensation payments, do not appear to have seriously dented the airline’s bottom line.Financial forecasts released Thursday show the airline increased its cost provision for the ground handler outsourcing matter by an additional $65m, as a court ruling on penalties for the behaviour is expected at some point this year.Qantas – which has long been criticised for employing staff on an array of different enterprise deals – also criticised the federal government’s same-job, same-pay legislation, which it said added about $65m to its wages bill in the 2024-25 financial year.The airline said it expects to spend $5.22bn on fuel over the financial year.Its net debt remained at $4.1bn at the end of December, in line with its previous expectations.Explore more on these topicsQantasTransportAirline industryBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

The plaque features the words “Magical, Alluring, Galvanizing and Adventurous” andthe city commission confirmedit was a reference to Maga. The former Minnesota Vikings player then made critical comments about the Trump administration before saying he would “engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience” and walked on to the meeting’s stage. He was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting an assembly.On Thursday Kluwe said he had been fired from his job as a football coach at Edison High School in Huntington Beach.‘Against everything this country stands for’: ex-NFL player Chris Kluwe takes his local anti-Maga protest nationalRead more“I knew it was a possible consequence,” Kluwe told the Guardian via email. “I think it just goes to show what Maga actually stands for – they don’t want to build anything, they just want to tear people and institutions down to make themselves feel better, regardless of what it costs the community. I sincerely doubt Edison is going to find another ex-NFL player to coach freshman football.” He said he was not given a reason for his dismissal but was told he had brought a lot of attention to the school.At the council meeting, Kluwe was highly critical of the Donald Trump’s Maga movement.“Maga is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and most importantly, Maga is explicitly a Nazi movement,” he said. “You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that’s what it is.”All seven members of the Huntington Beach city council are conservatives and one member, Gracey Van Der Mark, said there was “nothing peaceful” about Kluwe’s protest. She said he was guilty of “causing alarm among those in attendance, including two young students”.Last week,Kluwe told the Guardianhe has a court date in April over his arrest. “We’ll see what happens. There’s a possibility the ACLU might get involved. Some people have been telling me they’re looking to challenge this because they think it might not be legal.”Kluwe was outspoken on social issues during his NFL career, which lasted from 2005 to 2013, and heclaimed he was eventually releasedby the Vikings because of his beliefs and his support for same-sex marriage.Kluwe’s freshman team had a poor season in 2024. They finished with a 1-1-8 record and were outscored 297-47. The varsity team won the Division 1-A state championship.Huntington Beach High School District has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsCaliforniaWest CoastTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Stafford is set to earn $27m next season, putting him way behind the highest earners at the position. According to reports, Stafford is looking for a new two-year, $110m deal from the Rams that slices the difference between Dak Prescott (who will earn $60m in 2025) and Trevor Lawrence ($52m).Stafford is coming off an up-and-down season and the 37-year-old has dealt with multiple injuries over the past two seasons. Still, Stafford holds plenty of cards. He has dangled the threat of retirement before, unwilling to play on without what he deems an appropriate contract. Given the state of the quarterback market, Stafford knows he has a final chance to cash in. Outside Sam Darnold, there are few quarterbacks available who are real needle movers.Publicly, the Rams say that they want Stafford back. But if someone is willing to pony up, then the Rams may let Stafford walk and recover a first-round pick. If Stafford cannot command top of the market value, then the Rams can bring him back on a new deal that inoculates the team against an injury or further decline.‘Culture of fear’: Jets rank bottom of NFL players’ report cards as Washington improveRead moreThe list of potential suitors is long. The Raiders, Steelers, Browns and Giants have already discussed terms with Stafford, with the Giants and Raiders leading the wayaccording to the Athletic. You can add the Titans, Jets and the Colts to the list of quarterback-needy teams who may take a run at a veteran this offseason. Even at his advanced age, Stafford showed last season that he would be a significant upgrade for all those teams. Whether anyone is willing to put more than $100m on the table – and a valuable draft pick – for two years of a player approaching 40 is an open question.Will the league ban the ‘Brotherly Shove’?The Packers have proposed a banon the shove play synonymous with the Eagles. Green Bay’s proposal has plenty of support from the coaching ranks, who took to the podiums at the scouting combine in Indianapolis this week to bemoan the supposedly unstoppable play.Philly’s variation differs from other short-yardage sneaks, in which one player takes the ball and tries to dive for a first down. Instead the Eagles plant two teammates behind quarterback Jalen Hurts, have him dive forward and then drive him from behind to churn out first yards or scores. Over the last three seasons, it has become the closest thing to a guarantee in the sport.Brotherly Shove or Tush Push?Either way, it worked  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯@jalenhurts|#FlyEaglesFlypic.twitter.com/tu2LIl9ox2— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles)December 8, 2024Critics bemoan the play is dangerous or “not football”. Others see it as the game’s most physical play, a throwback to an earlier, tougher era. Bills coach Sean McDermott, who sits on the league’s competition committee, says that the push – and how defenses are forced to defend it – is a safety concern. “I just feel like player safety and the health and safety of our players has to be at the top of our game,” McDermott said. “It’s just that play to me [is] potentially contrary to the health and safety of the players.”McDermott’s argument is flimsy. The playlooksdangerous, but it has been run so infrequently that the league doesn’t have solid data on the injury rates compared to any other single play. Also: it’s theNFL, there is an injury risk on every play, including traditional sneaks or runs that turn into rugby-style scrums.Green Bay’s proposal smacks of trying to outlaw a strategy because one team has become too dominant at running it. The Eagles have successfully run the shove not because it’s a cheat code but because Hurts, who has incredibly strong legs, can push through a brick wall of defenders in a way other quarterbacks cannot. If it was a hack, the other 31 teams would all run it at the same rate as the Eagles and have similar success. But they don’t.What next for Aaron Rodgers?Huzzah! Prepare for another season of Rodgers headlines. Retirement seems off the table for the quarterback. There will be no podcast, gubernatorial run or a self-branded sun cream that keeps away space lasers – for now. After his release from the Jets becomes official, Rodgers will be free to canvass the market as a free agent for the first time in his career.The list of takers will be short. At 41, coming off a disastrous spell in New York, with all the noise and nonsense that swirls around him, quarterback-needy teams will probably look to the draft rather than drop Rodgers into their locker room. More than likely, Rodgers will sign a deal as a one-year bridge starter, whether to try to help reignite a fallen franchise or give a pseudo-contender the illusion that they can make a playoff run.The two likeliest teams to pull the trigger are the Raiders and Steelers. Vegas are all-in on trying to manufacture a winner quickly. Tom Brady is running the show, and his key decisions early in the offseason were to hire 73-year-old Pete Carroll as head coach and to retain the team’s defensive staff. Most of us know the Raiders are not a quarterback away from competing in the AFC, but every move and leak about their offseason suggeststheybelieve they are.If not the Raiders, then the Steelers make sense. Neither Russell Wilson or Justin Fields are viable short- or long-term options. Wilson was better in spurts than Rodgers last year, but the Steelers could talk themselves into Rodgers having a swansong in a better environment.The Rams are another option. If they trade Stafford, they will be in the market for a veteran quarterback. Trying to pinch Darnold in free agency would be their likeliest option, but Rodgers would be a solid enough fallback plan. He would be a stopgap that would allow the Rams to extend their championship window by another year.Rodgers will reportedly bringDavante Adams with himto his next spot, meaning that if the Rams dealt Stafford away and signed Rodgers to a one-year deal they would effectively be getting Rodgers, Adams and draft picks for the price they would have paid to retain Stafford. In a normal world, you could talk yourself into that being a savvy deal. But in Rodgers’s world, where you have to deal with the off-field noise and his diminished play, that isn’t a deal worth making.Rodgers finished 22nd in EPA/play last season, sitting behind the likes of Wilson and Kirk Cousins. Remove garbage time, and Rodgers fell to 29th in the league, behind Daniel Jones and Gardner Minshew. He no longer moves the same way, limiting the off-script creativity that made him the exceptional player he was in his prime. Last season, he looked immobile, hesitant to pull the trigger and fell apart when pressured. His on-field production is no longer worth the off-field chaos. But the Rams, Steelers or Raiders may be desperate enough to give him a final chance if the quarterback merry-go-round spins out of their control.View image in fullscreenMyles Garrett wants a trade away from the Browns.Photograph: Tommy Gilligan/USA Today SportsTrades, trades, tradesEvery draft prognosticator says this year’s class is weak. The free-agency crop is thin on difference-makers. That means one thing: prepare yourself for trades.The NFL is about to enter its NBA era, with some of the biggest names in the sport potentially on the move this offseason. The list of players who have already requested trades or who have been floated as being available by their franchise is as glitzy as it gets: Stafford, Cousins, Myles Garrett, Tyreek Hill, Cooper Kupp, Deebo Samuel, D’Andre Swift, Trey Hendrickson, Garrett Wilson, Kyle Pitts, DK Metcalf and Tyrann Mathieu could all be on the move. A year ago, that looked like an All-Pro roster. Now all of them are, to varying degrees, available for the price of a draft pick or two. Some of those are shiny names rather than impact players at this stage of their careers. But there are still gamechangers available at the most important positions on the trade block.No single offseason move could be as decisive as where Garrett lands. He requested a trade in early February, but the Browns have refused to engage in any serious trade talks for the All-Pro. Will they eventually acquiesce? If so, what will the cost be to land the best pass-rusher in the NFL, at the apex of his power? Can a Super Bowl contender – the Eagles, Bills, Chiefs, Packers or Ravens – find enough wriggle room in their salary cap to put a deal together?‘Against everything this country stands for’: ex-NFL player Chris Kluwe takes his local anti-Maga protest nationalRead moreGarrett says he would rather win a Lombardi than make the Hall of Fame. If the best defensive player in the league can force his way out of Cleveland, it will upend the championship race.Will the Bengals go all-in?The Bengals are at a crossroads. Do they run it back with their current core or let a pair of stars leave and retool their roster? Wide receiver Tee Higgins is a free agent. Hendrickson, the team’s only impactful defensive lineman, requested a trade last offseason and is expected to ask out again if he isn’t offered a new contract.The ballooning salary caphas given Cincy a chance to retain their key playersandadd much-needed talent along the offensive and defensive lines … if they’re open to finagling the contracts of their big earners. Such a move, however, would require a notoriously cheap franchise to stump up money they’ve been unwilling to invest in the past.If Higgins is allowed to hit free agency, he will be the top receiver on the market. And if the team is willing to trade Hendrickson, they will be left hunting for any kind of sizzle in their pass-rush.Letting both players leave would knock them out of contention in 2025, at a time when Burrow hasascended to a Hall of Fame level. Now is the time for the Bengals to push all their chips in on Burrow, retain their core, open up some cap room and refashion their defense to try to squeeze through a crowded AFC. But that would require a radical shift in philosophy.Burrow has put public pressure on the team, which may force their hand. “We all want to stay together, so we want to make it work,” Burrow said early in the offseason. “You don’t want to make a living out of letting great players leave the building.”The Bengals will enter free agency with the eighth-highest cap space and could open up plenty more with crafty contractual moves. But they are a franchise that has operated in a silo for 30 years. They rely on the draft. They let expensive players walk. They’re comfortable pushing for a playoff spot, and are fine if they fall short. But if they cheap out this offseason, they will continue to squander the career of an all-time great.Explore more on these topicsNFLAaron RodgersLos Angeles RamsPhiladelphia EaglesCincinnati BengalsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This will be the 40-year-old’s 19th season in F1 and comes after 12 years at Mercedes with whom he won six of his seven titles.Speaking in aninterview for Time magazine, he addressed criticism he has received from the former F1 team chief Eddie Jordan and the sport’s former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone.Rejuvenated Lewis Hamilton enjoys red-letter day in his new FerrariRead more“I’ve always welcomed the negativity,” he said in the interview. “I never, ever reply to any of the older, ultimately, white men who have commented on my career and what they think I should be doing. How you show up, how you present yourself, how you perform slowly dispels that.”Jordan questioned the wisdom of Ferrari signing Hamilton and letting Carlos Sainz go to bring him in. Similarly Ecclestone queried Hamilton’s motivation and stated he doubted the British driver would see out even two years at the Scuderia. Hamilton has endured similar brickbats throughout his career and has insisted he has been reinvigorated by the switch to Ferrari and that he was motivated like never before to return their first drivers’ title since 2007.“Don’t ever compare me to anybody else. I’m the first and only Black driver that’s ever been in this sport. I’m built different. I’ve been through a lot. I’ve had my own journey,” he said. “You can’t compare me to another 40-year-old, past or present,Formula Onedriver in history. Because they are nothing like me. I’m hungry, driven, don’t have a wife and kids. I’m focused on one thing, and that’s winning. That’s my No 1 priority.”The British driver is on a multi-year contract with Ferrari where he will drive alongside Charles Leclerc. He is looking to secure his record-breaking eighth world championship and said he felt there were many years of racing still left in him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Place Leicester in the certainty category. Defeat at West Ham extended their doomed, zombified lurch towards relegation to 11 league defeats in 12, 12 of 16 in all since Ruud van Nistelrooy replaced Steve Cooper in November.If Cooper was the wrong man at the wrong club then so, most probably, is the Dutchman. Perhaps nobody had a chance with the squad Leicester assembled to attempt survival. Their performance at the London Stadium was submissive. “That’s the situation we’re in,” said Van Nistelrooy. “The confidence in the run of form is low and then you end up in a mindset of trying not to lose.”Graham Potter, once linked with Leicester, is restoring order to West Ham. A revived Jarrod Bowen made things happen for both first-half goals, the first from Tomas Soucek, the second an own goal from Jannik Vestergaard the Hammers captain’s zest had enforced.West Ham United v Leicester City: Premier League – liveRead moreWest Ham were unchanged from afamous weekend win at Arsenalthat had handed legitimacy to Potter’s regime. “We played well against Arsenal and got the result but it counted for nothing if we didn’t show up tonight,” said Bowen.Much of Potter’s coaching reputation lies in improving players, though gradually. His has been a new-manager curve rather than bounce but the signs grow more positive. “There is a lot of potential, for sure,” he said. “Talent is one thing. The foundations have to be good.”A night that began with a tribute to the late Ronnie Boyce, 1964 FA Cup final hero, took time to catch alight. Leicester’s approach, that worked at Tottenham a month ago but nowhere else, was to defend in numbers and hope Jamie Vardy could win territory. The 2016 title survivor, 38, completed the full 90 with a grim expression of frustrated ennui.If Soucek’s 22nd-minute goal was created by anything it was Leicester’s complete and utter failure to clear their lines after Bowen began an attack. Goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, left unprotected, made a point-blank save from Mohammed Kudus.

Could he inspire his team to play for their lives, their futures, their bank balances? A lack of genuine speed, Vardy’s greyhound days long gone, allowed West Ham almost as much comfort in the second 45 as the first. “The damage was done,” said Van Nistelrooy. “The first half we created absolutely nothing.”Ironic cheers greeted a Leicester corner and when Van Nistelrooy made his first changes, sending on Harry Winks and Stephy Mavididi. Leicester, briefly, pushed onwards. Potter’s subsequent trio of changes to bolster defence and midfield disappointed Hammers fans hoping to see Evan Ferguson.Potter wanted to lock down any glimmer of Leicester revival. Another facet of his reputation is that of steadying hand, though he need not have worried. “It wasn’t a champagne type of night,” he said. “Overall it was a professional performance. Not fantastic, but we are delighted with two wins, two clean sheets and six points.”Ferguson eventually arrived in the 73rd minute. Bowen broke away, the Irishman getting a chance, but deliberating too long. It may not be long until Leicester and probably Van Nistelrooy are called time on. “I keep working. I keep going,” said the beaten manager.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was a highly anticipated game, the culmination of weeks of NBA drama after thebiggest blockbuster tradein league history, when the 25-year-old was traded for 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Davis was sidelined on the bench with an adductor strain on Tuesday, which slightly dampened the dramatic potential. But with both Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison and minority owner Mark Cuban joining Lakers GM Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss in attendance, the tension was palpable. There’s really no such thing as a clean breakup, but this one has been particularly messy, and as much as the basketball itself has started to round into shape for both clubs, the wounds from the parting have only just begun to heal.‘Vital and essential’: the film paying tribute to the weird world of NBA TwitterRead moreThe“wins” and “losses” of the tradehave been covered ad nauseam. The basketball of it all, the Xs and Os, what may work, what may not, have been dissected to death. The drama, trying to figure out what conspiracy theories could have been at play to set it into motion, has made for unassailably compelling television. But, as is the case in many sports sagas, the human element of it all seems to have become somewhat lost in the shuffle.As anyone who has been unceremoniously and unsuspectingly dumped can attest, even if it’s ultimately for the best in the long run, ithurts.Add to that the disorienting vertigo of being uprooted and sent to a new city overnight, and throw in some loud media discourse narrating the entire experience, and it’s easy to see why trades aren’t ever as simple as shuffling deck chairs. “When you move on, or they move on from you, it’s very emotional, obviously, and very taxing,”LeBron Jamestold reporters on Tuesday when asked how he thought his new teammate handled the emotionally charged circumstances. “There are probably a lot of things going on in his head that don’t even involve the game itself. And with that said, I thought he handled it tremendously.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Davis of the Dallas Mavericks talks with former teammate Dorian Finney-Smith of the Los Angeles Lakers before Tuesday’s game.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesThe Mavericks haveresponded to widespread criticismfor trading away their young perennial MVP candidate and franchise face by, in true post-breakup fashion, dragging Dončić’s name through the mud in what seems like an almost daily stream of targeted leaks, alluding to his alleged drinking, lack of dedication to fitness and work ethic, among other gripes. That has certainly fanned the flames of keeping the transaction in the public discourse, even as both teams involved purport to embark on their respective title chases.“Awkward as shit” was how Dončić’s former teammateKyrie Irving describedtheir first duel as opponents since the trade. And there were certainly plenty of awkward moments, like when a subset of the Crypto.com Arena crowd chanted “Thank you, Nico!” in reference to the maligned Mavericks GM. (Davis, fortunately, was sitting on the opposite side of the arena out of earshot on the Dallas bench.)Davis did get a touching tribute video on his return to LA, complete with a standing ovation from the crowd, and was visibly moved. Davis and his personal experience have been largely sidelined, with most of the discourse focusing on how the Mavericks could be so foolish as to trade away a young superstar who wanted to stay, and on the aforementioned bad-mouthing from the organization in the weeks since. But all reports indicate that Davis, a top-10 player in his own right, didn’t see the trade coming either, and, much like Dončić, expected to be the face of his franchise for the long haul.“I miss being around him every day,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said of Davis before Tuesday’s game. “He’s a wonderful human being.” James had similar sentiments. “Our friendship goes without saying,” he said after the reunion, where he and Davisshared a courtside laughfor presumably the first time since the swap. “He’s one of my best friends.”View image in fullscreenLuka Dončić finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in Tuesday’s win over the Mavericks.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesThe midseason transition to a new franchise likely wouldn’t have been easy regardless, but for Davis, he’s been handed the sisyphean task of trying to win over a fanbase that feels so slighted by their franchise’s decision-makers that they’vetaken to the streets. To his credit, Davis has handled the situation with grace, empathizing with the feelings of Mavericks fansfrom day one: “I understand it,” he said at his introductory press conference of the anger around the trade. “But it’s my job to play basketball and come in and do what I’m supposed to do and give the fans hope and reassurance on why Nico brought me here.”We asked Redick, who as the Lakers’ coach is not only at the nexus of this specific trade, but who has also experienced being traded against his wishes (ironically,to the same Mavericks teamthat moved Dončić), what the experience of being dealt away is like from a player perspective. He said that his first trade, from the Orlando Magic to the Los Angeles Clippers, was a bit easier as he and his now-wife hadn’t had kids at the time (both Dončić and Davis are parents). Of the eventual move to Dallas (by way of New Orleans), he said: “I wanted to be somewhere that I had a chance to win a championship. Ideally that would be somewhere that was closer to home [in Brooklyn, where his family stayed behind], ideally somewhere drivable. That didn’t happen. I got traded further away. But it was a blessing in disguise, and I didn’t realize it until [recently]. Because I got to play with Luka for two and a half months, and now I get to coach him.”Dončić and Davis will perhaps see such silver linings eventually, or maybe they’re already beginning to. But steadily progressing or not, the scars will take time to heal. “The closure is going to take a while, I think,” Dončić told reporters after Tuesday’s contest. “It’s not ideal, but I’m glad this game is over. It was a lot of emotions. We’ll go little by little, and every day is better.”Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsLeBron JamesKyrie IrvingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also offered an apology.“It devastates me to know that anyone I have worked with would not have felt respected and valued as a professional, but more importantly as a person, and to anyone who has felt otherwise, I am sorry,” Tuckersaid in a statement to Outkick on Thursday. “I want you to know I am committed to ensuring that everyone I interact with continues to feel that I respect them and care about them as a human being.”Ravens kicker Justin Tucker denies claims of sexual misconduct towards massage therapistsRead moreThe Baltimore Banner has reportedthat 16 massage therapists from eight spas and wellness centers in the Baltimore areahave accused Tuckerof inappropriate sexual behavior. Ravens general manager Eric DeCostacalled the allegations“serious” and “concerning” this week, and the NFL is investigating the claims.When the accusations against Tucker became public late last month, the five-time All-Pro released a statement saying he has never received any complaints from a massage therapist or been told he was not welcome at a spa or other place of business. In Wednesday’s statement, he called the allegations “shocking and heartbreaking”.“I maintain I did not act inappropriately at any point before, during, or after a professional bodywork treatment session, nor have I ever been told I am unwelcome at any massage therapy provider. These claims are simply not true,” Tucker said. “Throughout the last four weeks, I have spent countless hours replaying every interaction I have had with bodywork professionals over the last 13 years. I can assure whoever is reading this that I have never intended to disrespect anyone, cross any boundary, or make anyone feel uncomfortable in any way whatsoever.”The accusations include claims that Tucker exposed his genitals, brushed some of the therapists with his penis and left ejaculate on treatment tables. Two spas told the Banner they had banned Tucker from returning. One therapist who spoke to the Banner described Tucker’s alleged behavior as “really degrading”. Another said that: “I can’t watch sports anymore. I see his face everywhere.”Tucker is considered by many to be the greatest kicker inNFLhistory, and holds the records for longest field-goal and career field-goal percentage. He has been named to the Pro Bowl seven times since he joined the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. The 35-year-old is one of the few kickers to become a well-known name, and is also known for his performances as an amateur opera singer.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu was visibly distressed, hiding behind the umpire’s chair early in the contest after spotting the man in the first few rows of seats.The 22-year-old, who had ended a four-match losing run in the first round, opted not to press charges after the man was detained but he has been banned from future tournaments.Raducanu had been weighing up whether to take a longer break after returning home but has decided to play Indian Wells, one of the biggest tournaments of the year, as planned. According to reports, the world No 55, who has performed strongly in the Californian desert in the past, will be offered extra security.Raducanu’s search for a new full-time coach goes on and she will be supported in Indian Wells by her fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura and Tom Welsh. Welsh has formerly worked with Leylah Fernandez, the player Raducanu beat to win the US Open in 2021, and joined the National Academy at Loughborough three years ago.

He is more than 3,000 points behind but the 500 available for the winner in Acapulco would have given him a solid boost. However, Zverev fell 3-6, 4-6 to the 19-year-old American Tien, who has built on his breakthrough run to the fourth round of the Australian Open last month.Stomach problems took out the rest of the leading four players in Mexico, with the second seed, Casper Ruud, and third seed, Tommy Paul, both giving walkovers to their opponents, while the fourth seed, Holger Rune, withdrew trailing the American Brandon Nakashima 3-0.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanuUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Probably just Netflix. If you’re thinking about how do I launch a global product, you do it in partnership with content like this.Premier League could be forced to have two summer transfer windows because of Club World CupRead more“If you really think about what it could do to unlock a global media platform, there’s nothing like this. I’m not saying that is the direct answer right this minute, but I think that’s where we’re headed.”Boehly, who was speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London, also mooted the idea of issuing shares in the Premier League to its member clubs each year, to give all promoted clubs a stake in the competition should they be relegated again. Asked about his tenure at Chelsea, however, he said he did not want “to look in the rear-view mirror” as he acknowledged a bumpy ride.“If you look at the foundations that are being built: a new management team, new academy leadership, new sporting director leadership, new player mindset. Those things are all apparent in there. Now it’s about: how do you continue to cultivate the development of the team?” Boehly said.“The reality is that the sooner you learn you’re not going to keep all the people happy all the time, the freedom shows up from that. I think you’re just trying to get on a plan and execute a plan and recognising that things aren’t linear, but as long as you’re trending in the right directions, in general, you feel better.”View image in fullscreenChelsea fans call for Todd Boehly to leave the club before the Premier League match against Southampton.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAlso a co-owner of the current World Series champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boehly said that the Premier League could learn from US sport as it seeks to move beyond a period of discord, with the competition subject of legal action from its clubs.“The [Premier League] are figuring out how to get everyone to row simultaneously, and really be pulling for each other,” Boehly said. “Because I think if you look at what makes the NFL so special it’s that the owners are in lockstep and the commissioner is very good at recognising how valuable the NFL content is.

But Parish did strongly criticise the imminent arrival of an independent regulator for the game, claiming it had “paralysed” investment in the Premier League.“There are people that make the issues to be so much more than they are. But we do have a problem,” Parish said. “We’re now in a complete paralysis because the government has put the spectre of a regulator in front of us, basically paralysed the game, driven it into the courts. I don’t think that’s good.”“The Premier League is growing its media value, growing its appeal globally, and we need to take care of that. If we built the game from the ground up, you could have had a more American model, you could have pooled more revenue, but we don’t, that’s where we are. And you can see that clubs are using other ways to bridge that competitively. The game is getting more exciting because of that.

The new company has already had successes, securing a new five-year TV deal with Sky Sports and the BBC worth £65m, and a three-year title sponsorship for the WSL with Barclays worth £45m.Buoyed up by these new deals, and Chelsea’s recent landmark signing of the first $1m women’s player, Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave, WPLL is keen to explore its options for further growth.One of the proposals to be discussed today is understood to involve an expansion of both the WSL and Championship, with the proviso that there would be no relegation between the two divisions initially.A source who will be involved in Friday’s talks confirmed that radical proposals will be on the agenda, and the clubs are open to any ideas that could help grow the sport.The structural changes would not be introduced until the 2026-27 season at the earliest. It is unclear when the proposals will be put to the clubs for a formal vote, although it is unlikely to take place on Friday.The rationale behind the proposal is that removing the threat of relegation would encourage owners to invest and help develop a more competitive league, which is currently dominated by Chelsea, who have won the past five WSL titles.Another idea set to be discussed is maintaining promotion from the Championship without relegation from the top flight, so that the WSL would gradually expand by one club every season.In addition to the controversial removal of relegation, the mechanism for establishing which clubs join the expanded WSL will also be contentious.The ambitious and well-resourced Birmingham City and London City Lionesses currently fill the top two places in the Championship, but relative minnows Durham are third, while big Premier League clubs who have been late to women’s football such as Newcastle would also make a claim to be included in the top flight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn another change, the Championship is set to be rebranded as WSL2 in a move which could take place in time for the start of next season. There are only 11 teams in the Championship this season following the late withdrawal of Reading after owner Dai Yongge cut funding for their women’s operation.Initially created as a single-tier, eight-team breakaway league in 2011 with no relegation, the WSL expanded to include a second tier from 2014 onwards, originally named WSL 2. In the summer of 2018 there was another major expansion after a licence application process and the introduction of fully professional criteria for the top flight, so from the 2018-19 campaign onwards the top tier had 11 teams, while the semi-professional second tier – which was rebranded as the Women’s Championship – also consisted of 11 teams. The WSL grew to 12 teams a year later. The Championship remained at 11 teams for the 2019-20 campaign but only because Yeovil had been demoted from tier 1 to tier 3 because of financial problems.The Covid-19 pandemic then further delayed the addition of a 12th team into the second tier – because the lower leagues were declared null and void in the spring of 2020 and nobody was promoted.But since the 2021-22 campaign, the top two teams have each consisted of 12 teams, with a one up, one down promotion and relegation system. This term, only 11 teams have competed in tier two after Reading’s eleventh-hour withdrawal last June.WPLL declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde reminded us that officials are people too – just like us. If you prick Darren Cann, does he not bleed?“I’m not one to judge the referee,” Valverde said in the press conference beforeMadrid’s victory over Manchester City. “We are all human and we can make mistakes. Referees are also criticised a lot and when they do things well, they are not flattered either.”Pity, then, that within the hour he had gone on X to apologise, or at least clarify, why he had not (yes, had not) criticised referees during the presser.Galatasaray accuse Mourinho of ‘racist statements’ and vow to take legal actionRead more“I don’t want anyone to misunderstand me, but above all I want to clarify for our fans: if today I don’t talk about the refereeing we are suffering it is because I KNOW MYSELF, and I must focus on tomorrow. Everyone has seen what is happening to us in this league, and I don’t forget it, but now we have to focus on tomorrow, and I will be 100% as I have always been.”That pressure may have come from the angry bit of the Madrid internet fanbase – I do not know them well but I look forward to making their acquaintance after this article is published.Or it is not inconceivable that it came from the club. Madrid are convinced the refs are against them, to the point where they sent a letter to the Spanish Football Federation and the government claiming that the “Spanish officiating system is completely biased” and “structurally designed to protect itself” with backing from disciplinary committees under the federation.The decision that tipped them over the edge was Espanyol’s Carlos Romero only being booked for a pretty wild lunge on Kylian Mbappé before going on to score the winner in theirLa Liga game this month. If I supported Madrid I would have been annoyed, but for the club to write to the government – this is really helpful stuff, guys. What football really needs is some liquid paraffin poured on to the online conspiracy theories from probably the biggest club in the world.Madrid are not alone. TheMarseillepresident, Pablo Longoria, has just been given a 15-game ban for accusing French referees of corruption after a defeat by Auxerre last Saturday. “This is corruption! I’ve never seen anything like it. You can write it down: Pablo Longoria says it’s corruption.”It is hard to be sure, but it sounds as if he thinks it is corruption – at least he thought it was corruption. Longoria later backtracked: “Everyone explained to me what it [corruption] meant in French, because in Spanish it has a broader meaning.” Does chinny reckon have a broader meaning in Spanish too?In Turkey, the Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic was drafted in to officiate Monday’s Istanbul derby betweenGalatasarayand Fenerbahce. Subsequently Trabzonspor made an official request for Vincic to officiate their games against Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. The Besiktas president, Serdal Adali, also requested foreign referees for the same opposition. Fortunately for Vincic, Besiktas have not personally requested him. How much time does he want to spend in Turkey? Does he not have Slovenian games to ref? Slovenian places to be?It is clearly unworkable for clubs to request who referees their games – not to mention what it says about Turkish clubs’ attitudes to their own officials. The real-life consequence is referees being targeted online and in person.This is not new. Anders Frisk retired after receiving threats from Chelsea fans after the 2005 Champions League last-16, first-leg defeat by Barcelona. The Swiss ref Urs Meier spent 10 days in hiding after the Sun printed his email address after England’s defeat by Portugal in 2004.How many people who may want to take up refereeing, and who may be really good at it, will be put off by what is happening now?In late 2023, Uefa announced that across Europe there was a shortfall of about 40,000 referees. Meanwhile according to 2024 data published by the Football Association at grassroots level, allegations relating to the assault and attempted assault of match officials increased by 32% from 2022-23.So what should we do about it? Clearly there are sanctions that governing bodies can take. But the responsibility lies with all of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sure, you can fill hours with a former ref saying: “That should have been a red. Sam Barrott will be disappointed with that.” But who is doing the show on all the correct decisions?And some decisions are worth talking about: you cannot reviewlast weekend’s Everton v Manchester Unitedgame without talking about the Ashley Young penalty overturn. Sensible criticism of real issues – the implementation of VAR, diversity within the PGMOL, the handball law – are important.Supporters in the ground and online have to hold their tongues in the heat of the moment. Of course, that is virtually impossible – a ground full of 30,000 partial people is not a place of logic; you remember the injustices, you forget the luck.Amateur footballers have to take a beat when a ref makes a bad call. Say nothing. Just look up to the sky and think happy thoughts. I have complained countless times to refs – never abusively. Once, one stopped me to say he had just read a previous column I wrote on the Respect campaign. We both laughed but it is instinctive. I am an average player, I make bad decisions on the pitch all the time. I cannot expect the person officiating my game to be elite.People talk of the football family but attitudes to officials show just how much the game at almost every level is dictated by self-interest, exacerbated by bad-faith actors using their power or their platform or social media to deflect from their mistakes or shortcomings.There will be very occasional cases of referees fixing games, as there are with players, but that does not prove endless baseless accusations just because the VAR once went to a Watford game.It is simple: no ref means no game and if major stakeholders within football insist on putting themselves above the trust in the institution of refereeing, then this situation is only going to get worse.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

City have not commented on Tebas’s allegations but club sources are aware of them, and strongly refute them.Premier League sponsorship rules declared void in win for Manchester CityRead moreTebas claims City used related companies in the United Arab Emirates to hide losses and thus improve the club’s own balance sheet, and compared it tothe Enron scandal. Enron executives were found to have reaped millions by using a web of partnerships to generate false profits and hide the company’s true debt.Tebas said in a press conference at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit: “City have a lot of companies in their group which lie outside the City Football Group structure, extra companies where they put their expenses. These other companies lose the money but not the club itself. We have reported them to the European Union (sic). We have the facts and figures.“We asked for City to be checked. It’s very important that all clubs are subject to the same transparency rules and governance on both the sporting and financial side. The City case is one where we believe they have put the losses on the companies that are not officially part of City Football Group.“Do you remember the case in the United States? The Enron case. What they did, they got their losses and they put them into different companies. Well, it’s a similar case.”Tebas added: “They [City] have a scouting company, a marketing company. That’s where they have very high expenses. They invoice City for less money. City have costs that are less than if they didn’t have this circle of companies around.”Asked about the status of the complaint, Tebas replied: “I think it is in the investigation phase. We haven’t had a reply, so it must be in the investigation phase.”City declined to comment, but sources close to the club said Tebas has a long history of attacking City. The club are understood to strongly refute the allegations and sources pointed to the club’s accounts, which are a matter of public record, as proof of no wrongdoing. Details of La Liga’s complaint, seen by PA , allege City’s financing mechanisms cause a serious distortion in the internal market of the European Union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

La Liga alleges that allowed the club to enhance its competitive position and cause significant distortions across various national and EU markets.These foreign subsidies, La Liga alleges, enabled the club to sign top-tier players and coaches far beyond what would be feasible under normal market conditions and to secure sponsorship revenues at levels that do not align with fair market value. This, in turn, La Liga alleged, improved the club’s sporting performance while also affecting the recruitment capacity of rival clubs.The claims from Tebas come at a time when City are separately awaiting a verdict from an independent commission after being charged by the Premier League in February 2023 with more than100 breaches of Premier League rules, which they strenuously deny.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityLa LigaSport politicsEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

He returned in May 2021, when they were in the Championship.Frugal Liverpool’s WSL toils under FSG are testing supporters’ patience | Tom GarryRead moreThe 47-year-old is understood to have held talks with the club over a long period and a conclusion was reached that Beard had taken the team as far as he could. Liverpool finished fourth last season, breaking into the WSL’s so-called “big four” by finishing above Manchester United, but have been unable to repeat that form, partly because of a series of injuries.Beard has also had spells in charge of Bristol City, as an interim manager, West Ham, whom he led to the 2019 Women’s FA Cup final, and the US club Boston Breakers.A Liverpool statement said: “We have all experienced some fantastic moments with Matt as manager of LFC Women and we express our gratitude for his significant contribution. Our priority was to return this team to where it belongs and we collectively achieved that in 2022 by winning promotion to the WSL.“We need to build on that momentum and although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for future success on the pitch. The search for a new manager of LFC Women is under way, with Amber Whiteley stepping into the interim manager role with immediate effect.”Liverpool travel to face the WSL’s bottom side, Crystal Palace, on Sunday.Beard thanked Liverpool and their fans in a statement and said: “I am proud [of] what we managed to achieve over the last three and a half years, including promotion back to the WSL. I could not have asked for more from the players and staff, and thank them for all their sacrifice and support.”To a certain extent, Beard is the victim of his success from last season, because by overachieving relative to the team’s resources, expectations have been raised at Liverpool to a point where being mid-table – which would have been more fitting for the squad’s true level last season – evidently is no longer deemed sufficient.In terms of spending, Liverpool are a bottom-half club, illustrated by the most recent set of financial accounts, but more than that, they have a relatively youthful team that are still developing. Beard’s departure will seem harsh to many supporters, but it is also true that some fans have not always enjoyed his style of play and have been calling for something more modern.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beard is regarded as a good bloke and was said to be well thought of around the club.Supporters of Beard will lament many of the injuries to key players that hindered them earlier in this campaign, but Liverpool also missed opportunities to win games that were drawn against Leicester, West Ham and Crystal Palace at the start of the season.The team improved somewhat after the WSL’s winter break to claim creditable wins against Brighton and West Ham, but defended poorly in a4-0 defeat by Manchester Cityon 16 February and that game proved to be Beard’s last.Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

After building on five perfect darts and with Littler’s scoring levels having dropped, Humphries took out 92 to secure a first Premier League win over the world champion at the seventh attempt.“It felt like hard work, but felt good,” Humphries said on Sky Sports. “I felt like my game was in a good way after I struggled. “My finishing was good in moments and it wasn’t so good in moments.“Luke played fantastic tonight, [but] he didn’t play that great in the final and I managed to put my foot in the gas right at the end of the legs. It’s the first time I’ve beaten him in the Premier League. It gets harder every time you lose.”Humphries, who also won the opening night in Belfast, sits top of the table on 15 points, seven clear of Littler. “It’s a great start. I would love to win the group, it’s a dream start and I need to keep pushing,” Humphries said.In his semi-final, Humphries dug deep to find two stunning finishes of 167 followed by 116 in the deciding leg as he saw off Rob Cross, who had battled back from 3-1 down to lead 5-4.Littler had beaten Humphries to win on night two in Glasgow but then failed to follow that up as he went out in the quarter-final stage in Dublin.The 18-year-old, though, had earlier produced a clinical display to beat Stephen Bunting 6-3, landing 10 maximums with a match average of 112 – and leaving The Bullet still in search of a first win in this year’s event – before then seeing off Nathan Aspinall 6-2 to book his place in the night’s final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The statement did not say when he died or from what cause.Spassky is best remembered for his duel with US player Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between east and west, and was later referred to as “the match of the century”.The cold war showdown has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired Walter Tevis’s novel The Queen’s Gambit, which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.Spassky became world champion in 1969 and held the title until he played the match that would define his career, facing the eccentric American prodigy.The Soviet Union had dominated the game for years and Spassky faced a must-win situation, initially taking the lead.But the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.Spassky showed great sportsmanship, applauding Fischer after losing the sixth game.Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, Spassky admitted decades later it was a relief to be rid of a “colossal responsibility”.Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.Spassky, who was the oldest living world chess champion, represented France in three chess Olympiads in 1984, 1986 and 1988, and was seen playing in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris during the 1990s.His health deteriorated in the early 2000s, and he disappeared from Paris in August 2012 before resurfacing in Moscow in October that year.“It was my desire to return to Russia, because my time in France had run its course. It was time to start a new stage. I understood it was time to leave,” Spassky said at the time.Explore more on these topicsChessRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The rivals are now preparing to meet each other in a highly anticipated middleweight clash on 26 April and, during their on-stage face-off in Manchester this week, the IBO champion Eubank smuggled an egg inside his jacket and hit Benn on the side of the head with it, sparking a brawl.Hearn warns ‘boxing has changed’ after Eubank hits Benn with egg at face-offRead moreThe incident continued to be a hot topic on Thursday as the media tour returned to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the duo are due to meet each other in the ring for the first time. Eubank claimed: “Did I cross the line? During this whole process I think many lines have been crossed. So me throwing an egg at somebody who absurdly claims that was the reason why he failed two drugs tests, I think that’s light, I think he deserved the embarrassment of what happened, if I had an opportunity to do it again then I would.“Unfortunately I come unarmed today, I’ve been searched multiple times and I couldn’t sneak any in. In all seriousness, though, this is a real fight, this will be a bloodbath.

Asked if he could become a better full-back than a fly-half, Sinfield said: “I’d like to think so. If we could get him into a position where he’s world class at both, it gives us some options.“You look at how the game is played now and how valuable a second ball player can be. Marcus’s big strengths are when he is in space. We know he can do it when it is tight and there are lots of bodies around, he is able to move laterally very, very quickly so he puts defenders under a lot of stress. So clearly it makes sense to try and get him a little bit wider where the gaps tend to be a little bit bigger. It was never going to be an easy transition because he doesn’t play there for his club a lot, although they have used him a bit.View image in fullscreenFin Smith has impressed at fly-half.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“He has not had a great deal of time there, not a massive amount of minutes. We have all seen the reports how he loves playing 10, he is an outstanding 10 but I think he is a very, very good 15 as well. Clearly there are some elements that we all need to be better at, and I think Marcus would agree.“Some of his 10 play and his 15 needs to improve, so I think if we all looked at the game from the weekend there will be some bits that are not as good as we could be, but if we throw it in the bin now it’ll be a wasted opportunity.”England have decamped to York for the Six Nations second fallow week to prepare for their final two matches against Italy on Sunday week and Wales the following Saturday.The second row George Martin has been ruled out of the remainder of the championship with a shoulder injury to go with his knee problem, but England are confident Tom Curry, Ollie Lawrence and Ben Earl – all of whom are nursing bumps and bruises – will be fit to face Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the financial imperative of playing at Twickenham – where matchday revenues can reach £10m – means that, against the backdrop of record losses, the Rugby Football Union is unlikely to take Tests on the road any time soon, Sinfield would welcome any move in the future.“I love it up here, I love playing at the Allianz, I love the feel of the big stadium and being there and I know games previously have been played up north, I’ve been to a couple of them,” he added. “I know England football do it. I’d certainly be an advocate for it, to have a game somewhere up north would be fantastic. We’re representative of everybody across England, not just London, so from that point of view … I get some of the counter arguments, why it’s important for us to be at the Allianz and it’s our home. But I also understand as well that if we want more boys and girls to pick up a ball across the country, we have to do a bit of this. We have to. We have to let kids and adults, but kids in particular, see the role models and the players close up and not everybody gets the opportunity to come down to London, so I think in that regard it would be great.”Meanwhile, Felix Jones has returned to South Africa as an assistant coach, just six months after handing in his shock resignation from Borthwick’s staff, ruling the Irishman out of a place on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia. Jones stunned the RFU by resigning eight months into his tenure as England defence coach and will reunite with Rassie Erasmus on 1 March. He was widely tipped to be one of Andy Farrell’s assistants for the Lions tour but it is understood he will not tour Australia.Erasmus said: “After spending some time in England, his experience of working in the UK and studying the opposition teams in the Six Nations and other international tournaments will add immense value in assisting us to adapt and improve as we cast an eye on a tough international season ahead.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A series of on-track incidents, notably in Austria, Austin and Mexico, included the Dutch driver controversially forcing Norris off track. After the race in Mexico City, where Verstappen was penalised, Norris said: “Today was not fair, clean racing, therefore he got what he had coming to him.”Christian Horner unhappy that Max Verstappen was booed at F1 curtain-raiserRead moreThe pair have, however, long been friends and were clearly at ease – for now – as they sat next to one another in a press conference at the Bahrain International Circuit. When asked about their relationship in the wake of last season, neither could keep a straight face.“It’s a terrible relationship, we don’t get along any more,” said Verstappen. “It’s taken its toll. Big drama now, big problems.” A theme to which Norris warmed. “We had a fight the other day in a local pub,” he quipped. “I always say you should see the other guy, but actually he still looks good,” added Verstappen to appreciative chuckles from Norris.That there has been no carry over of any bad feeling from 2024 was palpable but Norris also maintained that he was expectant of a tough fight again. “We both look forward to more battles,” he said. “I don’t think it’s just going to be us. I think there’s going to be others involved, which will make it more exciting for everyone. I know they’re going to be tough battles and I’m sure some of them are not always going to end the way I want or hopefully Max wants.“We’re racing drivers. We get along. I know everyone tries to make their own points and say what’s correct and what’s not correct. But we respect each other a lot and we look forward to more racing on track.”The teams had been embarrassingly wrong footed by the weather in Bahrain on the second day of testing. When a light but persistent rain began falling on Thursday morning with only two teams having brought wet weather tyres, running all but ground to a halt for more than an hour.Unlike a race weekend where Pirelli bring a full selection of all tyres, for testing the teams choose their own allocation of rubber. Only two of the 10, Aston Martin and Haas, opted to have wet tyres supplied.As the light rain fell in the desert, while barely enough to trouble with an umbrella, it did stop play. Esteban Ocon ventured out for a couple of laps for Haas, a brief foray but enough for the team to put the boot in on social media.“Where’s everyone else at on track? Forget your inters did you?” the team posted on X.In the opening sessionLewis Hamilton topped the timesheets for Ferrari, putting in 45 laps and finishing four-tenths up on his former Mercedes teammate George Russell. In the afternoon, once more with sporadic rain, Carlos Sainz was quickest for Williams, three-hundredths up on Hamilton’s earlier time, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in third.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenLando NorrisFormula OneMotor sportRed BullMcLarennewsShareReuse this content"

The desert dust had barely settled on the NRL’s first trip to Las Vegas before the league boss Andrew Abdo was doubling down. With a longer runway to plan and prepare for the rugby league extravaganza the next time around, theNRLchief executive was soon promising to go even larger. Now that the league has arrived at its destination, there are more fans in town, more events on the ground, and teams from more countries putting the finishing touches on their own show. Twice as many matches as last year are still to come when all the off-field glitz and glamour are put to one side and the quadruple-header finally kicks off at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday (Sunday AEDT).The Penrith Panthers seem unbeatable. What does that mean for the NRL? | Alex McKinnonRead moreThe NRL was quick to talk up the wins, no matter how big or small, from its first foray on to the rocky terrain of the US sporting landscape last year. A crowd of 40,746 was the largest for a rugby league game on US soil. More than 23,000 of those tickets were sold in the US. Tickets were bought in a further 30 countries. New subscriptions to the international streaming app Watch NRL soared 167% – admittedly from a low base – compared with the same period leading into the previous season. And, most hopefully, an average of 61,000 US households watched the Sea Eagles’ win over the Rabbitohs, while 44,000 later watched the Roosters defeat the Broncos.The gamble to start the season in the US in the hope of attracting global attention instead found its biggest payoff closer to home. The Australian television audience smashed the record viewership for a season opener by 10.5% while also becoming the most watched regular-season game in history, as a combined 4.11 million watched the double-header. The hype surrounding the first jaunt to Las Vegas, and heavy support from a media contingent helpfully in tow, jolted the league into a record-breaking season and has since taken on a life of its own.“We were very, very keen on the event as a big stunt that starts the Australian season,” the Foxtel Group chief executive, Patrick Delany, tells Guardian Australia. “The extraordinary thing about this is it has become a massive Australian event even though it’s not in Australia.”View image in fullscreenCronulla Sharks train at James Regional Sports Park in Las Vegas.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesTicket sales to the four matches that will begin with Super League sides Wigan and Warrington squaring off have already surpassed the total number sold last year. Adding a pair of clubs from the rugby league hotbed of northern England to the program, as well as ahistoric women’s international between the Lionesses and Jillaroos, has ensured that twice as many fans are travelling from the UK this time. More than 20,000 Australians are making the much longer sojourn to Las Vegas, compared with 15,000 in 2024. Whether as many fans from the US, regardless of that number being boosted by expats originally from the competing nations, can push the crowd figure closer to the stadium capacity 65,000 remains to be seen.The NRL might be well on its way to creating a new destination event that Delany calls a “second Magic Round” but its hopes of expansion, long held up as a key pillar of the Las Vegas experiment, more likely rest on finding a way into more US homes. Foxtel, with its sporting arms Fox Sports and streaming platform Kayo, is a critical partner in that journey and helped leverage relationships to secure a spot on free-to-air channel Fox for the NRL opener between the Raiders and Warriors. It will be the first NRL premiership game shown freely on US television, though it was a misstep not to schedule the Panthers and Sharks in the time slot if only to showcase thefour-time premiersand the talents of their star playmaker Nathan Cleary to a fresh audience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Australian Rugby League Commission boss Peter V’landys this week talked up “a possibility that we’ll actually return a profit on Vegas” but, while ticket sales and streaming subscriptions are tracking in the right direction and new sponsorships have been announced, there has been little talk about reaching the promised land of the lucrative US sports betting market. For now the view seems to be; if you broadcast it, they will come.For all the backslapping after the NRL’s first visit to Las Vegas, and typically brash talk from rugby league bosses of putting on a bigger, bolder and better show this time, there is still much to be done to live up to their much grander plans.Explore more on these topicsNRLRugby leagueAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hardly anyone’s paying attentionMohamad BazziA deal between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-funded LIV league would directly benefit the US president’s family businessThu 27 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 09.55 ESTShareIn his first month in office,Donald Trumpdestroyed federal agencies, fired thousands of government workers and unleashed dozens of executive orders. The US president also found time to try tobroker an agreementbetween two rival golf tournaments, the US-based PGA Tour and the LIV Golf league, funded bySaudi Arabia.If concluded, the deal would directly benefit Trump’s family business, which owns and manages golf courses around the world. And it would be the latest example of Trump using the presidency to advance his personal interests.On 20 February, Trumphosted a meetingat the White House between Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, and Yasir al-Rumayyan, chair of LIV Golf and head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, along with the golf star Tiger Woods. It was thesecond meeting convened by Trumpat the White House this month with PGA Tour officials involved in negotiating with the Saudi wealth fund. A day before his latest attempt at high-level golf diplomacy, Trump travelled to Miami tospeak at a conferenceorganized by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which is managed by Al-Rumayyan but ultimately controlled by the kingdom’s de facto ruler and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Trump’s sports diplomacy in the Oval Office and cozying up to Saudi investors in Miami did not get much attention compared with his whirlwind of executive orders and new policies. But these incidents encapsulate Trump’s transactional and corrupt approach to governing – and the ways that wealthy autocrats including Prince Mohammed will be able to exploit the US president. While Trump will often boast he is making good deals for the US, his relationship withSaudi Arabiaand its crown prince is largely built on benefits for Trump’s family and its extensive business interests.Do Trump and co want a world reclaimed by straight white men? It’s not certain they’ll get it | Andy BeckettRead moreDuring Trump’s first term, the Trump Organization had dealings with Saudi Arabia that posed a potentialconflict of interestfor the president, especially after Saudi government lobbyists spent more than $270,000 on rooms at the Trump International hotel in downtown Washington. Now with no guardrails from Congress or the courts, the Trump family business is plowing ahead with new agreements that could reap tens of millions of dollars in profit from Saudi-linked real estate and golf ventures.In December, a month after Trump was elected to a second term, the Trump Organization announced severalreal estate projectsin Saudi Arabia, including a Trump Tower in the capital, Riyadh, and another $530m residential tower in the city of Jeddah. The projects are branding deals for Trump’s family business with Dar Global, an international subsidiary of Dar Al Arkan, one of the largest real estate companies in Saudi Arabia. While Dar Al Arkan is a private company, it relies on largeSaudi government contractsand the crown prince’s goodwill.While Trump will often boast he is making good deals for America, his relationship with Saudi Arabia is largely built on benefits for Trump’s familyAfter a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, the Trump Organizationlost a series of real estatepartnerships and other deals in the US. During Trump’s years out of power, Saudi Arabia became one of the few consistent sources of new deals and growth for the Trump brand, which was considered toxic by many US customers and businesses. Aside from real estate branding agreements with Saudi companies, Trump convinced the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund to host the LIV professional golf tour at several ofhis golf courses, including those in Washington, Miami and Bedminster, New Jersey. After the assault on the Capitol, the PGA of America, which is a separate organization from the PGA Tour and runs one of golf’s most important tournaments, the PGA Championship,cancelled a 2022 tournamentat Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. The LIV Golf tournaments brought Trump’s properties back into the professional golfing circuit and providedmillions of dollars in revenuefor the Trump family business.In November 2022, as Trump was preparing to announce his presidential campaign, the Trump Organization finalized a deal with Dar Al Arkan and the government of Oman to be part of a multibillion-dollarreal estate developmentin Oman. While the Trump Organization is not expected to contribute funds toward the project’s development, it will earn millions of dollars in licensing fees for a Trump-branded hotel and golf course – and will be paid millions more in management fees for up to 30 years. The project raised concerns that if Trump was re-elected, he would violatethe US constitution’s emoluments clauseby profiting from being in a partnership with the government of Oman, a longtime US ally, and a real estate firm with close ties to the Saudi government. (Areport released by Democratsin Congress last year found that Trump’s businesses had received $7.8m from at least 20 foreign governments during his first term as president.)As Saudi Arabia helped keep Trump’s family business afloat after the Capitol insurrection, it provided even more crucial support toJared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser during the first Trump administration. Six months after Kushner left the White House in 2021, his newly created firm,Affinity Partners, secured a $2bn investment from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. Prince Mohammed overruled a panel of advisers who hadrecommended against investingin Kushner’s company, citing its lack of experience and track record in private equity. The advisers warned that due diligence had found the firm’s early operations “unsatisfactory in all aspects”, but internal documents leaked to the New York Times showed that the prince and his aides were more concerned with using the investment as part of a“strategic relationship”with Kushner.Why was Prince Mohammed so eager to invest in Trump and Kushner’s businesses, even when they were out of power? The prince was betting on a second Trump term – and he was rewarding Trump’s steadfast support throughout his presidency. The Trump administration helped Prince Mohammed survive a severe challenge to his rule: fallout from the assassination of the Washington PostcolumnistJamal Khashoggi. In October 2018, Khashoggi was ambushed inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit team, who suffocated the Saudi journalist and dismembered his body with a bone saw.Mohammed bin Salman wants an alternative to Trump’s Gaza plan – but one that most benefits Saudi Arabia | Madawi al-RasheedRead moreAs the international outcry over Khashoggi’s killing intensified and members of Congress demanded sanctions against Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials, Trump and Kushner never wavered in their support for the prince and his regime. While Saudi officials at first tried to claim that Khashoggi had left the consulate alive, the crown prince eventually blamed rogue operatives for the assassination. But aUS intelligence report, which Trump refused to release, found that Prince Mohammed had ordered Khashoggi’s killing.The president later made sure to remind Prince Mohammed that he owed Trump for defending him after Khashoggi’s assassination. In interviews with the journalist Bob Woodward in early 2020,Trump boasted: “I saved his ass”– meaning he protected the crown prince from a backlash in Congress. “I was able to get Congress to leave him alone,” Trump told Woodward. “I was able to get them to stop.”Today, the president is trying to reap more benefits based on his protection of Prince Mohammed – beyond what Kushner and the Trump Organization have already amassed from Saudi investments during Trump’s time out of office. Trump is corrupting the presidency by using it to negotiate international golf agreements and other deals that will ultimately enrich his family – and hardly anyone is objecting.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGolfSaudi ArabiaPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportMohammed bin SalmancommentShareReuse this content"

Police have alleged that they found alprazolam – which is a benzodiazepine commonly sold as Xanax – at Colbert’s home after Manzano’s death.The drug had not been prescribed to either of them.Death of Telemundo reporter covering Super Bowl LIX leads to woman’s arrestRead moreBeside treating anxiety and panic, alprazolam can serve as a muscle relaxant or sedative. Mixing it with alcohol can be deadly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Nonetheless, as of Fitzmorris’s testimony, Colbert had not been charged directly in connection with the death of Manzano, a reporter for the Spanish-language channel Telemundo Kansas City as well as a 27-year-old widowed father of a toddler. His cause and manner of death remained unclassified pending the results of complete toxicology tests following up on a preliminary screen done on Manzano as part of his autopsy.Fitzmorris’s sworn testimony referred to the preliminary screen, the Jefferson parish coroner, Gerry Cvitanovich, said on Wednesday.“You always want to make sure you get an official reading,” Cvitanovich said. “That’s what we are waiting for.”Two government officials of Jefferson parish,Louisiana, which contains Kenner, confirmed the essence of Fitzmorris’s testimony.Authorities arrested Colbert, 48, on various criminal counts after they said surveillance video captured her entering Manzano’s hotel room with him the last time he was seen alive. They said they later caught her with his cellphone as well as the credit card he used to check into his hotel.And they also accused her of being in possession of alprazolam without a prescription – which is illegal – at her home in Slidell, Louisiana, anotherNew Orleanssuburb.Fitzmorris’s testimony came at a bail hearing for Colbert. A judge ordered her held without bail, with authorities having made it clear that they suspect she may have drugged Manzano shortly before his death and then robbed him, citing otherprevious casesin which she was formally accused of doing that to other men.One led toColbert’s conviction in October on charges that she drugged and incapacitated a man whom she met on New Orleans’s Bourbon Street – which is lined with drinking establishments – before robbing him of more than $134,000, much of it in cryptocurrency. She was sentenced to five years’ probation.Colbert’s attorney, Stavros Panagoulopoulos, told the Associated Press that authorities are making assumptions about Colbert’s connection to Manzano’s death.“We’re looking forward to our day in court to present all the evidence as necessary,” Panagoulopoulos said. “Assumptions and guesses are not enough to maintain criminal prosecution and we look forward to providing further information as this case moves forward.”Manzano arrived in Kenner on assignment with Telemundo Kansas City to report on the city’s football team, the Chiefs, as they prepared to play and ultimately lose to the Philadelphia Eagles in theSuper Bowlat New Orleans’s Caesars Superdome on 9 February.Hotel staff checked on Manzano and discovered his death after he missed a work meeting.Surveillance camera images released by police showed Manzano and Colbert together on Bourbon Street before they walked into his room at a hotel near New Orleans’s international airport in Kenner during the early morning of 5 February. Colbert eventually left alone, surveillance video established.The investigators who worked to arrest Colbert began theorizing relatively that she may have drugged Manzano for at least two major reasons.In addition to the presence of anti-anxiety medication both in Manzano’s body and at Colbert’s home, they also came across online news stories documenting allegations out of Las Vegas that she had drugged men and then robbed them after they slipped into unconsciousness.Colbert has fallen under law enforcement scrutiny as federal officials in Las Vegas pursue a case against a 43-year-old woman named Aurora Phelps, who wasrecently arrestedin Mexico on charges that she used online dating apps to lure at least four older men to meet her in person, drugged them with sedatives and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from them.Previous victim of woman linked to death of journalist says he tried to warn publicRead moreThree of the men died, and Phelps has been charged in one of their deaths, said authorities, who gave no indication that their case against her had any relation to that of Manzano and Colbert.Manzano was originally from Mexico and graduated from Kansas State University. He developed a reputation for covering the Kansas City area’s various sports teams with dedication and passion.His survivors include a two-year-old daughter whom he was raising with his wife, Ashleigh Boyd, an elementary school teacher who had been killed in a car crash in Topeka, Kansas, on 11 April 2024.A funeral mass in commemoration of Manzano washeldon 20 February at a Topeka church named after Our Lady of Guadalupe, who is venerated by Mexican Catholics as their country’s patron saint.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeLouisianaNew OrleansSuper BowlUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But his uncle Billy Joe Dupree – who played in three Super Bowls – will not even know his nephew is playing.Billy Joe Dupree joined Dallas in 1973 and immediately established himself in Tom Landry’s fabled team, taking Mike Ditka’s No89 jersey. A Super Bowl win against Denver Broncos in 1978 was sandwiched between two defeats to Pittsburgh Steelers. Dupree smashed records galore in Dallas, going 11 seasons without missing a game. His nephew Tyler has won two Super League titles, a World Club Challenge and a Challenge Cup in less than two seasons with Wigan. Yet Billy Joe is oblivious to his success.“My mum is coming over with her friends and my cousin, which will be good,” explains Tyler. “It would be nice to have my uncle in the stadium but we’re not really in touch with our American side. We did reach out to him but it’s hard to get in touch as he’s not big on social media. It would be nice to have a connection.“He doesn’t know about us really but I’ve done a lot of research about him. It’s only as I’ve delved into the family history that I’ve realised that I’m not the only Dupree to have something to do with sport. It’s nice to know I come from a decent bloodline. My mum and aunties are not very sporty people any more, so it had to come from somewhere.”View image in fullscreenBilly Joe DuPree played in three straight Super Bowls in the 1970s.Photograph: Getty ImagesTyler’s grandfather William – Jackie and Billy Joe’s father – lived a life so rich a play was written about it last year andan exhibitionwas held in Halifax last month. A New Orleans native, William Dupree had two identities. Encouraged to box by Joe Louis, he became known as Champion Jack and fought over 100 times.Meanwhile he continued to play piano, roaming the country asLips Dupree, becoming a face on the boogie-woogie scene and working with blues superstars such as John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton and BB King. He moved to Switzerland in 1960, lived in Halifax in the 1970s where he married Tyler’s grandma, before spending his final years in Denmark.“When my grandpa came over here he had my mum and my aunties but he was in his sixties by then,” explains Tyler. “Because of my grandpa’s profession I wouldn’t say he was a player, but he put it about a bit and he’s got loads of children.”At a glance Tyler seems typical rugby league stock: he was born in Halifax, honed by amateur club Siddal and then Leeds Rhinos, and is now playing for Wigan and England. Look closer and he’s anything but. Leeds let him go without making a first-team appearance and he worked as a labourer and in a children’s care home while seeking a second chance.Knowing his grandfather spent two years in a Japanese prison of war camp may have influenced Tyler to seek a place in the British Army. He was on his way to the interview when Oldham RLFC called offering him a chance. He signed up for the Roughyeds instead. It was a sliding doors moment. Within two years he was making his Super League debut for Salford.Having been in academies at Halifax, Salford and Leeds, played on loan at Featherstone, York and Batley, then had short spells at Oldham and Widnes and back to Salford, Wigan was the 10th stop on Dupree’s career journey. Now approaching two years at Robin Park, Dupree refutes the suggestion he has finally settled down.“I wouldn’t say it’s settled as I don’t think you can say you’re ever fully settled at a club,” says the 23-year-old. “That’s where complacency starts. I’m always striving to be the best version of myself and I definitely feel that I’m at the place where they’re going to help me do that. I feel like I’m getting towards that goal.”With a clean sweep of all four titles, 2024 was extraordinary for Wigan and Dupree. “Last year was big obviously, but I missed out on internationals [Dupree was dropped by England coach Shaun Wane for the Samoa series] so that’s what I’m striving for this year. This is the place to do that and I can’t imagine many other clubs could help me in that way.”Dupree also managed to graduate last year, completing his degree in sports science while starring for the Warriors. He’d been attending college two evenings a week and cramming his work in after training. “It was a bit surreal, but a massive weight lifted off my shoulders,” he admits. “Meeting deadlines as well as performing on the pitch was quite stressful. It was hard, but I’m glad I did it and I know I made my mum proud as well.”Dupree sees himself following his mum into the primary teaching profession. “Mum always told me that rugby is a second option so my education always came first,” he says. “At primary school I only had a handful of teachers who believed in me, so I’ve always wanted to repay that. I think I’d be a good advocate as a teacher.“I’ve always been pretty grounded but what helped most was when I was let go by Leeds. I didn’t think I’d made it but having that taken away was a massive reality check. Then being in the children’s home and seeing people who were in a much worse position made me wake up and smell the coffee. I appreciate things a lot more, take my time with a lot more people and have more patience. It’s definitely helped me understand other people in the team more.”View image in fullscreenTyler’s grandfather “Champion Jack” Dupree outside his home in Halifax, where he lived in the 1970s and 1980s.Photograph: Alain Le Garsmeur/AlamyPeet’s management has also helped. “We dedicate an hour each week to getting to know each other more, having an open floor and letting each other share our issues, whether it’s good or bad,” says Dupree. “We all get together and Matty just opens the floor. He’s great at getting people to open up. Everyone knows it’s a safe space. That’s been part of why we had a championship year.”That team spirit was epitomised in the dying seconds of their comfortable win at Hull on Friday when, with the game won an hour earlier, four Wigan players still raced to the touchline to ambush Liam Martin into touch. “The scoreboard is one thing but if we consistently see that togetherness, camaraderie and connection, that’s the main thing,” said Peet. “They’re the sort of clips we will be showing at our review before we look at the fancy stuff.”The coach is looking forward to the adventure in Nevada. “It’s going to be so different,” he says. “I’ve been to Las Vegas before and I’ve coached Wigan, but I can’t get my head around how I’m going to do them both together. It’s a challenge but what a privilege.”Forty players and staff flew out on Monday, with around 5,000 fans expected to follow. Dupree is ready. “Las Vegas had never really interested me, but the more I’ve delved into it and seen the adverts, it’s quite exciting. It will be a good experience for the club and fun. I’m looking at it from a different perspective: we’re going there to do a job. There’s a lot going on but we’ll deal with it. We are treating it as just another game but it’s been amplified by 10 because of the occasion.”One sub club: the players with the shortest careers in Super LeagueRead moreA seemingly introverted personality, Dupree is wary of the hype. “It will be the most exposure we’ve had, to different kinds of people, celebrities and sports people. It’ll be good for us. Everyone around Wigan asks you for a photo or talks about the game, but back home I’m just another person, no one is bothered who I am. I enjoy both. If I didn’t like it I wouldn’t be a rugby player. That’s what the job is. We love a big deal being made of us.”In many ways, Dupree seems to meet the criteria required for the NFL’s International Player Pathway; young, fearless, hungry, fit, aggressive, ambitious and adventurous. Would he be tempted? “I’d give it a go if someone came along and gave me the chance. I think it shows that rugby league is a sport that can be applied to a lot of other sports. If it came along I probably would take it but I wouldn’t be in that position if it wasn’t for rugby.”Follow No Helmets Required onFacebookExplore more on these topicsRugby leagueGuardian Sport NetworkSuper LeagueWigan WarriorsWarringtonNFLUS sportsDallas CowboysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The funds could also expand his media and packaged goods businesses, according to Bloomberg, which already generated more than $400m in sales last year.Talks over the potential fundraising are still in early stages and it is not yet clear who would invest and at what price. It would not be his first fundraising round – he previously clinched investment from firms including the New York-based Alpha Wave Global.If he is successful, fresh funding would help to further expand Donaldson’s business. He is already the biggest YouTuber in the world with more than 368 million subscribers to his channel.The 26-year-old from Wichita, Kansas, is mostly known for videos consisting of stunts or challenges, or giveaways of cash or prizes. One of hismost popular viral videosrecreated the sets from the Netflix series Squid Gameat a cost of $3.5m; he invited 456 people to compete in challenges to win $456,000 in prize money.He has since launched a reality competition show – Beast Games – through Amazon, which became the streaming platform’smost watched unscripted showlast month.Like many YouTubers, Donaldson started off posting videos in his bedroom, joining the video platform in 2012. He has since launched food brands including Feastables and MrBeast burgers, which have been distributed through “ghost kitchens” used by food delivery companies in locations across the US, UK and Australia.He reportedly makes tens of millions of dollars a year, hasa philanthropic organisation, and is generally seen as a positive influence on YouTube – investing much of what he makes back into his videos, as well as charitable efforts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It currently tracks approximately 186,000 immigrants using devices such as ankle monitors, smart watches and a facial recognition app, according to public Ice data. Due to increasing demand fromDonald Trump’sadministration, which has promisedmass deportations, company executives said that they expect that number to grow past its previous peak of 370,000 to 450,000 immigrants within the next year. The remarks were made during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday morning.Poor tech, opaque rules, exhausted staff: inside the private company surveilling US immigrantsRead more“A little over two years ago, the ISAP contract utilization peaked at approximately 370,000,” George Zoley, the executive chair of the Geo Group, said on an earnings call on Thursday, referring to the agreement between Ice and Geo. “Returning to that utilization level would generate incremental revenues of $250m and even more if the contract exceeds the prior peak of utilization.”While the company is still ramping up its production of additional GPS units in anticipation of an expanded Ice contract, executives said they are able to monitor “several hundreds of thousands” of people and are trying to position themselves to be able to monitor millions of people. Zoley said that the Geo Group, and its competitor in running private prisons and detention centers, Core Civic, are in expedited discussions with Ice to expand current contracts for detention facilities as well as electronic monitoring.“It’s a fluid situation, but it’s picking up pace, if I may say,” he said. “We’ve gone from conceptual proposals … to substantive pricing and operational discussions. But the procurement process is moving at a speed that is unprecedented. We’ve never seen anything like this before.”The company’s vast electronic monitoring program was instituted as an alternative to detention in 2004 and has been entrusted to Geo group subsidiary BI Inc since then. Many of those forced to wear the ankle monitors, designed and produced by BI, havecomplainedthe devices can overheat, shock them or have been put on too tightly. The company has pitched its smart watch location tracker and smart phone app, calledSmartLink, as a lower-level of surveillance than the monitor. Executives said on Thursday’s earnings call, however, that they expect a return to a reliance on the physical ankle monitors.“I think there is going to be a preference in the beginning for the ankle monitors which represents the high-security level of monitoring,” Zoley said.Though the company has yet to receive an indication from Ice on when the agency expects to reissue a new contract for the electronic monitoring program, called the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, executives say they believe the agency is focused on expanding the number of people being tracked through the existing program. The Geo Group is investing $16m into building out its inventory of ankle monitors in order to “be in a position to scale up the federal government’s utilization of ISAP by several hundreds of thousands to upwards of several millions of participants as required”, according to Zoley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The executives signaled their intent to expand the company’s surveillance program so that it could monitor an estimated 7 to 8 million people on the non-detained docket who entered the US through non-authorized pathways and then are released into the US. They are also building up capabilities to monitor the estimated 9.5 to 10 million people in the US who are otherwise undocumented in anticipation of Ice’s requests.“Given the size of the population our view is in addition to increased detention capacity … the Laken Riley Act will require significant ramp-up of electronic monitoring services to ensure proper trafficking of persons on non-detained docket and their compliance of the requirements of their immigration court proceedings,” Zoley said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyUS immigrationSurveillanceTrump administrationMigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s what we’ve done with Ocelot,” said Oskar Painter, the AWS head of quantum hardware.One of the greatest challenges in quantum computing is the sensitivity of qubits to environmental disturbances, such as vibrations, heat and electromagnetic interference, all of which can cause computation errors. The Ocelot chip addresses this through its design, which AWS claims could reduce the resources required for quantum error correction by five to 10 times compared with conventional approaches.Scientists at AWS have published their findings in the journal Nature.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The thefts were spread out over 47 incidents, the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis said, adding that the total was a dramatic jump from the $660m seized in 2023.“Hackers linked to North Korea have become notorious for their sophisticated and relentless tradecraft, often employing advanced malware, social engineering, and cryptocurrency theft to fund state-sponsored operations and circumvent international sanctions,” Chainalysis said in its report.UN officials monitoring sanctions imposed on North Korea believe that the proceeds from dozens of suspected cyber-attacks the regime carried out between 2017 and 2023 were used to improve its nuclear weapons programme.While his country’s economy has been battered by sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters, Kim Jong-un has in recent years overseen significant improvements to North Korea’s potential to strike distant targets, including the US mainland.Cybercrime is not the only means by which the regime earns foreign currency. Kim’s regime has supplied weapons, ammunition and troops to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine in exchange for cash and technological knowhow.South Korea’s spy agency claimed on Thursday that Pyongyang had sent more soldiers to Russia, with some deployed to the frontline in Kursk, in addition to about 11,000 North Korean troops already thought to be in the Russian border region.“The North Korean military, after a lull of about a month, was redeployed to the Kursk frontlines … with some additional troop deployments appearing to have taken place,” an official from the South’s National Intelligence Agency told Agence France-Presse, adding: “The exact scale is still being assessed.”Another source of foreign currency has returned to North Korea in the past week, as it welcomed a small number of international tourists, including from the UK, France and Australia, for the first time since the pandemic.Officials are reportedly hoping to attract large numbers of tourists from Russia, some of whom visited last year, and from China. The US, however, has banned its citizens from entering the country since 2017.The victim of the latest heist, ByBit, said an attacker had gained control of an ether wallet and transferred the holdings to an unidentified address.The exchange caters to more than 60 million users worldwide and offers access to various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether.Bybit had in recent days calledon the “brightest minds” in cybersecurity to help it recover the $1.5bn.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaHackingCybercrimeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, Harris is spending his 90th year ensuring this beloved local facility isn’t lostEmine SanerThu 27 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 03.08 ESTShareThe battleground at the heart of a struggle between an 89-year-old man and a multi-billion pound multinational is a small junction in aNorfolkvillage, where a red phone box stands. And at the red phone box, sheltering from the wind, is Derek Harris. Last month, he learned that BT (formerly British Telecom) was threatening to close the phone box in the village of Sharrington, where he has lived for 50 years, when he saw it on the agenda of the parish council meeting. “I thought: ‘I’d better do something about this,’” says Harris.He has described it as a “David and Goliath” campaign. It is that, and – as becomes clear on this sunlit but biting February day – so much more. We will talk mortality and reprieves, heritage and value. I’ll leave with a renewed sense of how it’s possible to feel real affection for an inanimate object, and why having a mission matters.First, though, some field mice. Sharrington is in a picturesque part of East Anglian countryside. “We’re surrounded by open, rolling, wonderful fields – arable, beautiful,” says Harris, “except they’re inhabited by field mice – and field mice have developed a penchant for the PVC that protects the copper cabling [of phone lines]. Opposite the church, which is just up the road, there is a telegraph pole, and in it, there are three mice nesting.” His eyes sparkle. The rodents gnawed through the wires, disrupting villagers’ phone lines and internet. He knows about the mice, he says, because an engineer from Openreach, the BT-owned company that looks after the network, told him.Harris keeps an eye on Openreach, because there is a green junction box, connected to the new fibreoptic cables, barely a couple of metres from the phone box. It wouldn’t take much to connect the payphone to fibreoptic, insists Harris – as with the whole telephone network, phone boxes will need to be upgraded to digital lines by the time the analogue network is switched off in 2027. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be connected, and so I’ve set my heart on it.” He says engineers visit most weeks anyway. “So maintenance [of the phone box] would be no problem. It’s cost-effective.”The approach we’ve taken is to say that boxes that we think are essential are protected from removalThe UK has 14,000 working phone boxes, down from 20,000 three years ago; at their peak in the 1990s, there were 100,000. Of these, around 3,000 are the iconic red design. When about 95% of households have a mobile phone, it’s perhaps a wonder that phone boxes survive at all.Owned and run by BT, and costing millions of pounds each year, they are required by the regulator Ofcom under the quaintly named telephony universal service obligation. In the year to May 2020, almost 150,000 calls were made to emergency services from phone boxes, as well as 25,000 and 20,000 calls made to Childline and Samaritans, respectively.“We have a legal responsibility to make sure that phone boxes exist to meet the reasonable needs of citizens in the UK,” says Katie Hanson, senior consumer policy manager at Ofcom, who was part of its review on payphones, with new guidance published in 2022. “Obviously, what ‘reasonable needs’ looks like won’t be the same today as it was before everyone had a mobile phone. The approach we’ve taken is to say that boxes that we think are essential are protected from removal.”A phone box cannot be removed if it is the last in an area (more than 400 metres from another phone box), and if one or more of the following conditions apply: if it’s in an area without coverage from all four mobile network providers, or if at least 52 calls have been made from it in the past year, or if it is somewhere with a large number of accidents or suicides (Harris hopes his phone box’s proximity to the A148 is what might save it), or, finally, if there is a high social need – for instance, if it has a number of calls to helplines such as Childline or domestic abuse charities. If a phone box is the last at the site, and none of the other conditions apply, then if BT wants to remove it, it has to start the consultation process with the local authority, which is what has happened in Sharrington.View image in fullscreenThe crisis charities Childline and Samaritans receive thousands of calls from phone boxes.Photograph: Sally Anscombe/Getty ImagesLast year, fewer than 10 calls were made from Sharrington’s public phone box and it is one of 10 in the North Norfolk district council area earmarked for removal. The village, in a conservation area, has a church dating from the 13th century and a Jacobean manor house. Harris believes the phone box is “an iconic heritage asset” and the local MP, Steff Aquarone, has written to Historic England to try to get it listed. “Working K6 models are rare,” says Harris. The K6 (for Kiosk No 6), topped with its gilded Tudor crown, was designed by SirGiles Gilbert Scottto mark the silver jubilee of George V in 1935.Harris has lived in Sharrington for half a century; it’s where he and his late wife brought up two children. The phone box has been there for even longer. Both Harris and the K6 share a birth year – 1935 – which partly explains his affinity for it. He spent his early life in Surrey, near Croydon Airport, enjoying the sight of planes flying overhead.“Very interesting for a little boy,” he says. “It wasn’t such a good location when war started, because airports were targets.” The family evacuated to the south coast, but that wasn’t much safer – German fighter-bombers would attack the area in “tip and run” raids. When Harris was about eight, he survived one such attack while out playing with his brother. “We saw our friends falling wounded; a few got killed.” Years later, as a young man, Harris joined the army and was injured. “A field surgeon saved my life,” he says, but he was warned that he would need multiple operations in the coming years and not to expect a long life (he is, he reminds me a few times, in his “90th year”).View image in fullscreen‘It faced death in 2016; it’s still here’ … Harris with councillor Andrew Brown(left).Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianSharrington’s phone box has also fought off previous threats to its life. “They made an attempt to decommission it in 2016 and we resisted it successfully,” says Harris. “I’ve faced death before, passed through it. It faced death in 2016; it’s still here. Something tells me that it’s meant to stay.” Harris and those campaigning to keep it, including local councillor Andrew Brown, have been given an extra month to plead their case.“It can be a lifeline, and it’s a conservation asset,” says Brown, “a valuable communication resource, given the nature of mobile signalling being so poor around here.” The area is rural and isolated, some villagers have virtually no mobile signal, and North Norfolk has the highest proportion of older residents in England and Wales – the adults most likely not to have a mobile phone. And it has one of the highest proportions of second homes in the country. In an emergency, without a mobile signal or working payphone, try knocking on the door of an empty holiday home – one that probably doesn’t even have a landline anyway.Making their case in 2016, says Harris, “we said it was an animate part of the conservation area. It wasn’t just a museum piece, and people did use it.” But, he acknowledges, “probably more than they do now.”Many of the village elders, who relied on the phone box because they didn’t have mobile phones, have since died, but some elderly people still use it, insists Harris. If the box survives, one of the handful of calls it will have logged in 2025 will have been made by me. I lift the receiver and the crackle and deep hum of the dial tone takes me back to teenage calls, quick garbled ones you had to make before your money ran out. This phone box doesn’t take coins and doesn’t charge me, which I’m confused about. It turns out that there are some phone boxes that can’t take coins or cards, and offer free calls to UK landlines and mobiles.The few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s lifeI ring the only number I can remember without looking at my contacts list – my partner’s. He doesn’t pick up, because who, in this day and age, answers an unknown landline number? So I WhatsApp him to say it was me, ringing from a phone box! We’re both momentarily thrilled by the novelty, and the nostalgia.Mobile phones are everywhere, Harris admits, but he points out that in this part of the country, the signal is sketchy. “We live next to perhaps the most beautiful part of Norfolk, the tranquil Glaven Valley with a pure chalk stream running through it. It attracts ramblers, walkers, the lot, and everyone knows that there’s a working kiosk.” Think if there was an emergency and the mobile network was down – something that may happen more frequently as we increasingly experience extreme weather, he says. “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone said: ‘If only they had kept that working kiosk’?”It has been used in emergencies. “What you have to bear in mind is the few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s life. Not that long ago, there was a snowstorm.” The mobile network was down and the call someone made from the phone box “was the only way that rescue came to save this driver whose car was completely covered in snow – it fell off the top of the hedgerows on to his car, and he was trapped”. And not far away is the main road, known locally as the Sharrington straight – a rare straight stretch of road where Norfolk’s most reckless drivers tend to speed up. Last year, says Harris, “we had two accidents in one day, both serious hospital cases. It’s an accident hotspot.”He makes his case with justifiable, practical reasons why the phone box should be kept, but this isn’t the whole story, I realise, when we’re talking, out of the cold, at a nearby cafe.View image in fullscreen‘The nearer you get to the end, the more you want to see things live. I wouldn’t like to see it die’ … Derek Harris.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian“Wouldn’t you like to see a working K6 retained by BT, just for the sake of it?” asks Harris. He is a good talker. He distrusts human rights lawyers, and misses the days when people respected the police. But he’s not all traditionalist – he spent much of his career working in energy conservation. I think he likes purpose and order – he is dressed impeccably in pressed jeans and shirt, and pristine traditional overcoat – which could be why he isn’t keen on the way red phone boxes have been repurposed in other villages. Under BT’s Adopt a Kiosk scheme, phone boxes have become libraries, or home to defibrillators. Why can’t Sharrington’s enjoy a new life as something like that?“It was not designed for that,” says Harris. “What it was designed for was communication. Why should it be changed into something else? It’s a telephone kiosk. It’s not some sort of library or whatever.”Change it into something else, and it becomes a quirky relic of British history. Another dial tone dead. As a functional phone box, says Harris, “it would be alive, wouldn’t it? That’s why I feel empathy – I feel an empathy for a living thing.”For Harris, it’s personal. There’s a comfort in continuity, and it’s about conserving what is worth conserving, leaving the world a better place, or at least not diminished. That includes a working, iconic red phone box in the village in which he has lived for so long. “It’s fighting for what is valuable, cherished.” The older he gets, he says, “there’s this thing about intimations of mortality. The nearer you get to the end, the more you want to see things live. I wouldn’t like to see it die. That’s the way to put it. That’s what I’m fighting for.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The weather still rages outside, but it’s calm within the cavern that lies at the end of the path. You can tell, from the environment, what kind of creature lives here: the Rey Dau, a horned wyvern that commands the elements.You’ve seen it before, when it appeared unexpectedly while you were out on another expedition, descending from lightning-streaked skies to sink its claws into an unfortunate pack of shaggy, lion-like creatures. You weren’t strong enough to face it then, but you are now. Hopefully.The fight that ensues is nail-biting. You have to pull out every trick you know to wear it down, trying to dive out of the path of powerful bolts of electricity, as well as the wyvern’s horns and teeth. You fire your grappling hook at a rocky outcrop hanging from the ceiling, bringing it down on the creature. You whistle for your mount, leaping from its back on to the dragon’s head, clinging on and stabbing with a dagger as it tries to smash you against the walls. You are sent flying, you are fried, you are stomped upon, but you cling on and keep fighting, chugging restorative potions at every opportunity.Watch the trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds.Then an even bigger predator appears from nowhere, takes the monster you’ve just fought desperately for 25 minutes in its jaws and tosses it around like a rag doll. Take a good look at it: that’s what you’ll be fighting next.Monster Hunter Wilds’ 15-hour story is a series of escalating epic battles against ever bigger and more ferocious creatures. It does not let up for a second. Within a few hours, you will have fought an awful giant spider, a sinuous sand-dragon and a disgusting, overgrown oil-chicken. Later, you will face a furious fire-ape and a dragon that shoots lightning from its face, plus particularly nasty and dangerous versions of beasts from the previous 20 years’ worth of Monster Hunter games. It’s quite literally all killer, no filler, a far cry from the slow and ponderous older games, in which you had to spend hours gathering mushrooms and fighting raptors before you got anywhere near a wyvern.The battles are relentlessly awesome; when a monster fell, I would let out a breath that I didn’t even realise I had been holding in. No game has ever made me feel like Monster Hunter does, with the possible exception of Dark Souls and its brethren. The adrenaline of these fights, the peerless, perfectly balanced feel of the oversized weapons and the sheer viciousness and majesty of the creatures makes this game feel incomparably thrilling, even though I have been playing it in some form since I was a teenager. And it is just so much better-looking than it was back then: not just the monsters, but also their huge natural habitats, which ripple and teem with life.View image in fullscreen‘The monsters’ huge natural habitats teem with life.’Photograph: CapcomI must admit that towards the end of Wilds’ story I felt some disappointment start to creep in. I had enjoyed nearly every one of these creature clashes, which are wrapped in dramatic, beautifully rendered cutscenes that spin a cool-looking if rather insubstantial story. But I hadn’t had much of a challenge. Admittedly, I have a lot of experience with these games, but I am used to getting eaten or torn to bits a few times by a new monster before I conquer it; in the entirety of Wilds’ campaign, I was knocked out only twice.It turns out, however, that Wilds’ story is essentially a 15-hour interactive tutorial on what makes Monster Hunter awesome, a rollercoaster of fighting thrills presumably designed to sell newcomers on the concept and give veterans a taste of the scale and visual splendour that Capcom’s modern game engine has brought to their favourite series. The real fun starts afterwards.After taking on the biggest, baddest creature I had ever seen, in the final quest of the story, I was dumped back into a base camp in the jungle and sent out to capture a small, fire-spitting raptor. I was immediately humbled; embarrassingly, it knocked me out, because I had become lazy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about teaming up with other hunters, complementing each other’s play styles, as more experienced players help the rookies through. Being a friend’s Monster Hunter mentor is one of the most rewarding multiplayer gaming experiences out there.This game can’t be reduced to a series of fights. It is a world, an ecosystem, a community of players. You are part hunter, part nature researcher. Wilds leans too far towards frictionless fun in its story, but once I was free to explore more I started to feel more connected to the habitat. Instead of being guided by the nose – or by my ostrich-dino steed – from battle to battle I was climbing up into the canopy and scouting for creatures, getting my binoculars out, discovering hidden corners for campsites and underwater caves full of useful materials. I found I had to switch weapons more frequently, upgrade my armour, reacquaint myself with the baffling array of jewels and doodads that gave my hunter useful extra skills.You could pick Wilds up as a newcomer and have a tremendous time playing through the story. You could stop there and it would still be worth the price of admission. But I will be playing it for alongtime yet.Monster Hunter Wilds is out on 28 February; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like hitting the “reveal codes” key on older computers that let you see everything.On Wednesday,Jeff Bezos, thethird-richest personin America, who boughtthe Washington Postin 2013,announced that the paper’s opinion sectionwould henceforth focus on defending “personal liberties and free markets”.Anything inconsistent with this view would not be published, according tohis statement. “Viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”The Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, promptly resigned, as he should have.When they speak of ‘freedom’, what they actually seek is freedom from accountabilityYou’ll recall that Bezos barred the Post fromendorsing Kamala Harrisin the last weeks of the 2024 election. Subsequently, the paper wouldn’t print its cartoonist’s drawing showing Bezos and other oligarchs bowing to Trump, leading thecartoonist to resign.Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, bought Twitter in 2022, laid off everyone who was filtering out hateful crap on the platform, renamed it X and turned it into a cesspool of lies in support of Trump.Mark Zuckerberg, the second-richest person, has followed suit, allowing Facebook to emit lies, hate and bigotry in support of Trump’s lies, hate and bigotry.All three of these men were in the first row at Trump’s inauguration. They, and other billionaires, have now exposed themselves for what they are.They are the oligarchy. They continue to siphon off the wealth of the nation. They are supporting a tyrant who is promising them tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks that will make them even richer.They are destroying democracy so they won’t have to worry about “parasites” (as Musk calls people who depend on government assistance) demanding anything more from them.When billionaires take control of our communication channels, it’s not a win for free speech.

But these games are riggedMJ CrockettResearch pitting people against AI systems gives AI an edge by asking us to perform in machine-like waysThu 27 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 13.42 ESTShareTechno-optimists are evangelizing a vision of “superhuman”artificial intelligence(AI). Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic,predictswithin a few years, AI will be “better than almost all humans at almost everything”.Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) isproposingreplacing government workers with chatbots in the name of efficiency. And some scientists are claiming that AI can already outperform humans even in domains previously thought to be exclusively human, such as empathy, creativity and conflict resolution.It’s true that in several prominent studies, researchers have staged “competitions” in which AI technology appears to outperform humans in these very human areas. But a closer look reveals that these games are rigged against us humans. The competitions do not actually ask machines to perform human tasks; it’s more accurate to say that they ask humans to behave in machine-like ways as they perform lifeless simulacra of human tasks.It’s no wonder we lose.Take, for example, recent studies claiming AI expresses empathy better than humandoctorsandtherapists. In these studies, researchers askedOpenAI’sChatGPTto generate written responses to posts on Reddit about physical and mental health struggles. Next, they compared the chatbot’s responses with those of human doctors and therapists responding to the same Reddit posts. Across these studies, the chatbot’s responses were rated as more empathetic than those of the human doctors and therapists.So, should we all turn toChatGPTthe next time we seek a sympathetic ear?The problem with this logic can be illustrated by a simple thought experiment. You’ve had a horrible day. Your boss yelled at you, your brother just filed for divorce and you’re waiting on results from a stressful medical test. You’re desperate for some support to help you deal. What do you do?All that these examples show us is that machines are better than humans at performing empathy and creativity in machine-like waysYou’re probably not logging into Reddit to receive a generic written response from a stranger – even one who is expertly trained to respond empathically to strangers. You want support from people who care about the story of your life and know the characters involved: your work buddy who’s also clashed with your bummer boss, your best childhood friend who was at your brother’s wedding, your partner who held your hand at the doctor’s office.Tests of AI empathy typically don’t compare a chatbot’s cold comfort with the kind of socially embedded care that truly nourishes us. If they did, the chatbots would lose.Or consider a recentpaperclaiming that AI can produce more novel ideas than human experts. In this case, the researchers asked computer science PhD students and postdocs to compete with a modified version of Anthropic’s Claude AI model. Their task: to come up with new research ideas. Each competitor was assigned a research topic (such as how to reduce bias in AI systems) and a template for writing out their ideas (to mask stylistic differences between human and AI writing). All the ideas were then judged by another group of PhD students and postdocs, who didn’t know whether the ideas came from AI or humans. The judges rated the AI-generated ideas as more novel, and in some cases more exciting, than the human-generated ideas.This seems impressive until you consider how scientific research actually works. Although stereotypes of scientists as lone geniuses persist, there is overwhelmingevidencethat science is a team effort and more diverse teams do more creative and impactful science. We’re most innovative when we draw on communities of knowledge, thinking together through complex problems. But that’s not the test that the researchers chose to pit humans against machines. The humans in the study had to come up with their ideas alone. Once again, the AI victory rings hollow when we consider that the humans in this game had to leave their best talents behind – in this case, their collaborative relationships.The same is true of a recentpaperclaiming that AI outperforms humans in resolving political disagreements. Researchers at Google invited small groups of British citizens to privately share their opinions on divisive issues like immigration and Brexit. The team built an AI system to act as a mediator, generating “group opinion statements” designed to maximize consensus among group members. They also trained human volunteers to perform the same task. The citizen groups reached more consensus when guided by AI mediators than human ones, rating the AI-generated statements as more clear, informative and fair than their human counterparts. Commentators suggested AI might hold promise for bridging our deepest political divides.Crypto and big tech’s backing pays off as Trump makes tech-friendly movesRead moreBut a closer look reveals how the study’s methods disadvantaged the human mediators. All communication took place over an online chat interface. Anyone who’s ever tried to resolve a disagreement by texting knows how much crucial information vanishes across a digital divide. Effective mediation involves attuning not just towhatpeople say, buthowthey say it: their tone of voice, facial expressions and body language are vital cues that help us distinguish grudging acceptance from hearty agreement. AI mediators might have an edge in online discourse that excludes these cues, but that’s no reason to assume they’re superior tools for healing our political rifts – not least because online discoursecontributedto those rifts in the first place.All that these examples of so-called “AI victories” show us is that machines are better than humans at performing empathy, creativity and conflict resolution in machine-like ways. Considering why these tests are unfair helps us better appreciate our distinctively humantalents. We build relationships thick with meaning and forge new knowledge out of trusting social bonds. We find common ground reflected in our faces, voices and postures, perhaps because embodied communication helps us recognize our shared mortality. No chatbot can achieve these feats, because chatbots don’t have bodies, and aren’t embedded in our social worlds the way our loved ones are.Techno-optimism is more accurately described as “human pessimism” when it assumes that the quality of our character is easily reducible to code. We can acknowledge AI as a technical achievement without mistaking its narrow abilities for the richer qualities we treasure in each other.MJ Crockett is a cognitive scientist at Princeton University.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionElon MuskOpenAIChatGPTComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

The US president also found time to try tobroker an agreementbetween two rival golf tournaments, the US-based PGA Tour and the LIV Golf league, funded bySaudi Arabia.If concluded, the deal would directly benefit Trump’s family business, which owns and manages golf courses around the world. And it would be the latest example of Trump using the presidency to advance his personal interests.On 20 February, Trumphosted a meetingat the White House between Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, and Yasir al-Rumayyan, chair of LIV Golf and head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, along with the golf star Tiger Woods. It was thesecond meeting convened by Trumpat the White House this month with PGA Tour officials involved in negotiating with the Saudi wealth fund. A day before his latest attempt at high-level golf diplomacy, Trump travelled to Miami tospeak at a conferenceorganized by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which is managed by Al-Rumayyan but ultimately controlled by the kingdom’s de facto ruler and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Trump’s sports diplomacy in the Oval Office and cozying up to Saudi investors in Miami did not get much attention compared with his whirlwind of executive orders and new policies. But these incidents encapsulate Trump’s transactional and corrupt approach to governing – and the ways that wealthy autocrats including Prince Mohammed will be able to exploit the US president. While Trump will often boast he is making good deals for the US, his relationship withSaudi Arabiaand its crown prince is largely built on benefits for Trump’s family and its extensive business interests.Do Trump and co want a world reclaimed by straight white men? It’s not certain they’ll get it | Andy BeckettRead moreDuring Trump’s first term, the Trump Organization had dealings with Saudi Arabia that posed a potentialconflict of interestfor the president, especially after Saudi government lobbyists spent more than $270,000 on rooms at the Trump International hotel in downtown Washington. Now with no guardrails from Congress or the courts, the Trump family business is plowing ahead with new agreements that could reap tens of millions of dollars in profit from Saudi-linked real estate and golf ventures.In December, a month after Trump was elected to a second term, the Trump Organization announced severalreal estate projectsin Saudi Arabia, including a Trump Tower in the capital, Riyadh, and another $530m residential tower in the city of Jeddah. The projects are branding deals for Trump’s family business with Dar Global, an international subsidiary of Dar Al Arkan, one of the largest real estate companies in Saudi Arabia. While Dar Al Arkan is a private company, it relies on largeSaudi government contractsand the crown prince’s goodwill.While Trump will often boast he is making good deals for America, his relationship with Saudi Arabia is largely built on benefits for Trump’s familyAfter a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, the Trump Organizationlost a series of real estatepartnerships and other deals in the US. During Trump’s years out of power, Saudi Arabia became one of the few consistent sources of new deals and growth for the Trump brand, which was considered toxic by many US customers and businesses. Aside from real estate branding agreements with Saudi companies, Trump convinced the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund to host the LIV professional golf tour at several ofhis golf courses, including those in Washington, Miami and Bedminster, New Jersey. After the assault on the Capitol, the PGA of America, which is a separate organization from the PGA Tour and runs one of golf’s most important tournaments, the PGA Championship,cancelled a 2022 tournamentat Trump’s golf club in New Jersey. The LIV Golf tournaments brought Trump’s properties back into the professional golfing circuit and providedmillions of dollars in revenuefor the Trump family business.In November 2022, as Trump was preparing to announce his presidential campaign, the Trump Organization finalized a deal with Dar Al Arkan and the government of Oman to be part of a multibillion-dollarreal estate developmentin Oman. While the Trump Organization is not expected to contribute funds toward the project’s development, it will earn millions of dollars in licensing fees for a Trump-branded hotel and golf course – and will be paid millions more in management fees for up to 30 years. The project raised concerns that if Trump was re-elected, he would violatethe US constitution’s emoluments clauseby profiting from being in a partnership with the government of Oman, a longtime US ally, and a real estate firm with close ties to the Saudi government. (Areport released by Democratsin Congress last year found that Trump’s businesses had received $7.8m from at least 20 foreign governments during his first term as president.)As Saudi Arabia helped keep Trump’s family business afloat after the Capitol insurrection, it provided even more crucial support toJared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser during the first Trump administration. Six months after Kushner left the White House in 2021, his newly created firm,Affinity Partners, secured a $2bn investment from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. Prince Mohammed overruled a panel of advisers who hadrecommended against investingin Kushner’s company, citing its lack of experience and track record in private equity. The advisers warned that due diligence had found the firm’s early operations “unsatisfactory in all aspects”, but internal documents leaked to the New York Times showed that the prince and his aides were more concerned with using the investment as part of a“strategic relationship”with Kushner.Why was Prince Mohammed so eager to invest in Trump and Kushner’s businesses, even when they were out of power? The prince was betting on a second Trump term – and he was rewarding Trump’s steadfast support throughout his presidency. The Trump administration helped Prince Mohammed survive a severe challenge to his rule: fallout from the assassination of the Washington PostcolumnistJamal Khashoggi. In October 2018, Khashoggi was ambushed inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member hit team, who suffocated the Saudi journalist and dismembered his body with a bone saw.Mohammed bin Salman wants an alternative to Trump’s Gaza plan – but one that most benefits Saudi Arabia | Madawi al-RasheedRead moreAs the international outcry over Khashoggi’s killing intensified and members of Congress demanded sanctions against Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials, Trump and Kushner never wavered in their support for the prince and his regime. While Saudi officials at first tried to claim that Khashoggi had left the consulate alive, the crown prince eventually blamed rogue operatives for the assassination. But aUS intelligence report, which Trump refused to release, found that Prince Mohammed had ordered Khashoggi’s killing.The president later made sure to remind Prince Mohammed that he owed Trump for defending him after Khashoggi’s assassination. In interviews with the journalist Bob Woodward in early 2020,Trump boasted: “I saved his ass”– meaning he protected the crown prince from a backlash in Congress. “I was able to get Congress to leave him alone,” Trump told Woodward. “I was able to get them to stop.”Today, the president is trying to reap more benefits based on his protection of Prince Mohammed – beyond what Kushner and the Trump Organization have already amassed from Saudi investments during Trump’s time out of office. Trump is corrupting the presidency by using it to negotiate international golf agreements and other deals that will ultimately enrich his family – and hardly anyone is objecting.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGolfSaudi ArabiaPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportMohammed bin SalmancommentShareReuse this content"

Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine, tensionsin the Indo-Pacific, and instability in the Middle East demand that Britain steps up. Our armed forces must be properly funded to meet these threats, and increasing defence spending to2.5% of GDPis a welcome and necessary move.But we need to go further and faster to meet the challenges we face. Britain’s military capabilities must be strengthened to deter aggression, safeguard our interests and maintain a credible global presence. Butcutting aidto fund it is a fundamental strategic error that risks making us weaker, not stronger. Funding one out of the money allocated to the other risks undermining the very security we are trying to ensure.Starmer’s cut to aid budget a ‘strategic mistake’, says former army headRead moreBritain’s security and influence on the world stage depend on a balanced approach – one that integrates our military strength with diplomacy and development. To wield power effectively, we need hard and soft power working hand in hand. Cutting development aid undermines our ability to stabilise fragile states, reduce the conditions for extremism and build alliances that enhance our security. Simply put, well-targeted aid prevents conflict and reduces the burden on our armed forces in the long run.As Gen James Mattis, the former US secretary of defence,famously put it: “If you don’t fund the state department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.” That same logic applies to Britain. Every pound we cut from development aid today risks costing us far more in future military operations. Complacency kills – both in war and in strategic planning.The decision to reduce aidfrom 0.7% to 0.5%of national income in 2021 was already a mistake, weakening Britain’s global standing and reducing our ability to shape international affairs. Now, slashing aid further to fund defence spending is not just shortsighted – it is dangerously counterproductive. Weak states become breeding grounds for terrorism, organised crime and mass migration crises. We need only look at Afghanistan, where reduced international engagement has allowed instability to flourish, with consequences for global security. Without well-targeted aid, instability in Africa and the Middle East will only worsen, leading to direct security threats for Britain and Europe. We are not only stealing from the world’s poorest and most vulnerable, but we are also stealing from British taxpayers by investing in a policy that will ultimately cost us more.Moreover, the premise that aid and defence are in competition is a false one. In reality, they are two sides of the same coin. Well-targeted development assistance helps to stabilise fragile regions, preventing crises before they require military intervention. It is aid that helps to rebuild war-torn societies, counter radicalisation and reduce the refugee flows that destabilise Europe. Without this investment, Britain will face an increased terrorist threat, more humanitarian emergencies and greater pressure on our borders. By neglecting this crucial component of security, we are setting ourselves up for greater instability, which will require even more military spending in the long term.Furthermore, the burden on Britain’s armed forces will only grow. If we cut aid, we will be forced to deploy military resources in areas where we could have mitigated instability through targeted development. History shows that intervention without stabilisation leads to drawn-out conflicts and increased casualties. The overstretch of our forces is already evident – our army is at itssmallest sizesince the Napoleonic wars, our navy isstruggling to maintaina credible global presence, and our air force is operating at capacity. If we do not take a comprehensive approach to security – one that includes aid as a core pillar – we risk overcommitting our forces and diminishing our overall defence capability.In a frightening new era, Starmer has made his move – and may have found his calling | Rafael BehrRead moreWe should also consider the moral imperative. Britain has long prided itself on being a force for good in the world. Turning our backs on the most desperate people, those who rely on British aid for survival, is not just a strategic mistake, it is a failure of our values. But beyond the moral argument, this decision will make Britain less safe. Weak governance and economic collapse abroad lead to radicalisation and conflict, and no amount of military spending can fully address those threats once they take root.Britain has long been a leader in Europe, not just in defence but in diplomacy and development. In a world where the US is stepping back from underwriting European security, this is a moment for leadership. Leadership means making the right choices – not false ones. Increasing defence spending should not come at the expense of cutting the very tools that help prevent the need for military intervention in the first place.It is time for a rethink. If we are serious about security, we must recognise that diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities – they are complementary. A well-funded aid programme, alongside increased defence investment, will ensure that Britain remains a global leader – both in strength and in moral authority. We cannot afford to get this wrong.If the government is serious about taking defence spending to 3% in the next parliament, it would be better to break its own fiscal rules and either raise taxes or increase borrowing. We may all have to share in the cost of doing the right thing.Gen Lord Dannatt is a former chief of the general staff, co-author of Victory to Defeat – The British Army 1918 to 1940 and author of Boots on the Ground – Britain and her Army since 1945Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not a bitThu 27 Feb 2025 09.34 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 11.30 ESTShare“Since 2016, Fyre has been the most talked about festival in the world,” organiser Billy McFarland told a US broadcaster whentickets for Fyre 2went on sale this week. McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison for wire fraud in 2018, related to his organisation of the first Fyre (he served only four). Whatever you think about the first Fyre – with its limp cheese sandwiches, its disaster-relief-tent accommodation, the absence of advertised headliners, the $26m of unpaid debt, the rats (were the rats influencer hyperbole? Perhaps, but on the other hand the festival happened on the parking lot of an abandoned resort development, and where else is a rat supposed to live?), you have to admit it lived up to one promise:it was legendary.Wire fraud is any swindling that happens electronically, whether by text, email, phone or social media. It’s so easy to fall on the wrong side of that – you could commit it just by sending a round robin, asking for a million dollars. Really, all that is standing between so many of us and jail is the sucker who will give us a million dollars. It’s really the suckers who belong in prison, if you think about it. Anyway, back to McFarland. “Obviously, a lot of that [talk] has been negative … but if it’s done well, I think Fyre has the chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry,”he said.View image in fullscreenThe infamous catering at the original Fyre festival in 2017.Photograph: NetflixTo throw the guy a bone, he built a huge amount of global notoriety over a very short time, and it would be a shame not to monetise this. Promotion for Fyre 1 started in December 2016, and by 27 April 2017, the festival had become auniversal analogyfor everything in the world that was bad. People who had flocked there, paying from $500 to $12,000 for tickets, had responded to the siren call of models and actors advertising the festival on Instagram. Within hours, it was the white-hot centre of schadenfreude.This tribe of festivalgoers had something deeper in common than merely being fools who had parted with their money. They had made certain assumptions about the festival, assuming it would form a backdrop for a fabricated life they could project on their socials. To witness their horror at sodden mattresses and cancelled flights, queues stretching hours to arrive at a wasteland, had the satisfying comeuppance of an Enid Blyton book. Look who got too big for their boots, and now their boots are full of untreated sewage.But this was only the overture. As the festival was cut short and the lawsuits began, the full hubris of McFarland unfurled. Professionals from every festival-related sector had lined up to tell him his investment wasn’t enough, his prep time was too short, he didn’t have the experience or skills or networks he needed, and he forged on anyway, becoming the poster boy for unhinged self-belief. In a world so dominated by the virtual, public shame has become the last line of defence against shitehawks faking it till they make it. What’s to stop a crypto bro simply saying he’s a billionaire until he is one? What stands between a very humble genius ascending to the point that he can assert his genius and humility by executive order? It’s a dicey old game. Sometimes, reality wins (Sam Bankman-Fried); other times, it loses (Donald Trump). So when the results land and it is Crowd 1 Naked Emperor 0, people really savour that.View image in fullscreenBilly McFarland leaves federal court in New York after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges in March 2018.Photograph: Mark Lennihan/APBesides the monsoon that arrived at Fyre 1, turning a bleak and comfortless event into one that posed an active hazard to public health, there was one other stroke of incredible bad luck for McFarland: his wasn’t the only enterprise mired in chaos. Trump had commenced his first term in office, splashing falsehood over everything, and firing cabinet members and staff during infantile tantrums. In Britain, we were in that nightmarish first phase of Brexit, when it was still impossible to believe that people so unprepared, so thoughtless and so histrionic could be steering the ship. Over time, “this is like the Fyre festival” became the standard expression of dismay to describe a range of political developments. For at least some of this long period, McFarland would have been in prison. Hopefully, for his own sake, he missed the extent of his gift to the English language, a shorthand for incompetence so profound that it defies analysis.But Fyre 2 “isn’t about the past”, McFarland says. This time he’s dreaming bigger, with the most expensive tickets priced at $1.1m. You have to love the audacity of that last $100,000. The so-called “Prometheus pass” gets you access to the fight team next to the “fight pit”, and really, who knows what that means – maybe you get to be beaten unconscious by Tyson Fury, or maybe it’s just a ringside seat to a thumb wrestle between two marketing managers, and the surprise is part of the point, guys, because “theorigin of the Prometheus passis shrouded in secrecy … Legend has it that it was inspired by the titan Prometheus”. Huh, yeah, sounds plausible. Can’t think of any other Prometheuses.Fyre 1 ignited because it was a harbinger of shitshows to come. The remake looks like the supremacy of the fantasists.

But then I look at the planet, its order and future upended by a trolling,extortionate, narcissisticwannabe kingand in moral hock totech broswho build gold castles on our own vanity and our kids’ online peril, and I think, well, maybe not.I’ve tried not to helicopter over my kids. To let them make their own mistakes while being there as a safety net when they’ve fallen. It hasn’t always worked. Learning the hard way that you can’t always protect your kids from profound pain and danger holds no lesson beyond that you can’t always protect your kids from profound pain and danger.But “be careful” to me was always such a red rag that I’ve tried hard not to say it to my own kids. Two of the three haven’t needed any more encouragement.“Go out and play but make sure you’re home for dinner. Andbe careful,” was the mantra to most of us on school holidays as we set out to roam neighbourhoods as full of mischievous possibilities as they were with unchipped, unvaccinated dogs.Taking a small motorboat out in heavy rain and wind at dusk without life jackets when we were 12 and surfing the storm-swell in it seemed like a very good idea at the time. Until we capsized and nearly drowned.I’m told there is an age at which falling over becomes ‘having a fall’. But I’m not nearly ready for that | Paul DaleyRead moreBut we didn’t. And, so, this left us alive to celebrateGuy Fawkes Nightwhich was never so much a single night but a week or two of wanton destruction and flirtation with danger involving vast quantities of legal explosives otherwise known as fireworks.The “penny-bunger” was a “cracker” (read finger-sized stick of compressed explosive powder in cardboard with a wick) that really packed a punch. From memory they were about five cents each in 1974. And if you taped four of them together, conjoined the wicks (you’d set the thing fizzing with the cigarette in your mouth; we all smoked from the age of perhaps nine), what you actually had was a small, very dangerous stick of sort-of dynamite.It seemed like a fine idea to covertly place these explosive devices in neighbourhood letterboxes, light them and run. You had to be quick. One kid in the ’hood, Tuddy, had a sort of “L” symbol semi-seared between his eyes for a while after the red-hot metal “7” of a house number was blown off a letterbox and struck him on the forehead.Meanwhile, take a piece of metal piping and seal one end with a hammer blow. Bingo – a perfect musket-style weapon. All you had to do was light the penny-bunger, drop it down the tube, insert a marble on top of it and point it at your foe. Boom. Ouch. Hilarious.We had teams: Goodies and Baddies. Nobody I know actuallylostan eye although I did suffer damage to my sight in one when the cracker prematurely exploded in my tube before I’d inserted the marble. Come the end of those cracker weeks we’d be covered in painful blue-black bruises.I can’t for the life of me think why the killjoys eventually banned cracker night!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like riding your bicycle down the very long, steep, straight path in our neighbourhood park … with a metal bucket over your head (it’s amazing how little you see beyond the path underneath without peripheral vision; who knew?) while your friends stood at intervals and lobbed stones at your protected head. “Buckethead” was a blast. If you got to the bottom of the path without crashing you didn’t have to do it again. You got to chuck the stones.At one point just about everyone in my neighbourhood seemed to have a bb rifle. These we did not shoot at birds or neighbourhood cats or dogs. No – we mostly seemed to shoot them at each other. From memory the only rule was you had to aim from the thighs to the ankles only.The danger seemed to heighten somewhat from the age of about 13 when skateboards and surfing (and surf-camping trips to the coast without adults; what were our parents thinking?) were added.Drugs, (legal) alcohol consumption, cars and motorcycles, rock’n’roll for some of my friends, intimate relationships and rivalries, journalism, dodgy foreign back streets and bars and trouble spots further challenged one’s fight or flight instincts.I’ve always thought my parents, alive until I was well into my 40s, didn’t know a tenth of the risks I’d taken as an adult let alone as a child. I think my dad didn’t want to. My mother always seemed to have an inkling, though.

This is the new political reality of 2025.We need to face up to it fully now and start preparing the ground for a campaign that won’t be a traditional choice from the lineup of the main parties but of two fundamentally different worldviews. The stakes are extraordinarily high.The world is changing at a pace we haven’t experienced before. Yet UK politics still, at times, seems frustratingly stuck in decades-old default positions. Going forward, avision for growthbased on London, Oxford and Cambridge –the “golden triangle” – and airport expansion in the south-east is only justifiable if balanced by a new deal for the north; one that offers at least an equal ambition for economic, social and environmental renewal.By my reckoning, Labour mayors and ministers have three months in which to write that new story for the north so that it can be signed off at the spending review in June and delivered over the rest of this parliament. By the time the country next goes to the polls, we need to be able to point to tangible results telling a compelling story of how the second quarter of this century will be better than the false promises of aNorthern Powerhouseandlevelling upin the first.This is a colossal challenge but I am confident we can rise to it – starting today with political and business leaders gathering in Preston forthe sixth Convention of the North.My confidence comes from the fact that the north is already in a unique position. With a set of devolution arrangements covering more than 80% of the population, rising to 90% in May 2026, we have a greater ability to deliver more quickly than other parts of England.It is also based on a belief that, for the first time in 50 years, there is a credible path towards the re-industrialisation of the north.View image in fullscreen‘UK politics seems frustratingly stuck in decades-old default positions.’Illustration: Islandstock/AlamyThe fight that is coming will not be won by pandering to the alternative worldview, as the Conservative party is doing. Instead, we must take it on directly.By setting its face against net zero, Reform UK is turning its back on the north’s best chance of bringing back high-quality, well-paid jobs in large numbers, and two things have happened this week that should give us courage to stick to our guns.First, theCBI reported on Mondayhow the net zero sector grew by 10.1% in 2024 and now has almost a million jobs, with an average annual wage paying higher than the national average. Encouragingly, the north is playing a real role in this growth story. With the right investment now, our unique geography means we could be a global player in the green economy and, in time, a net exporter of green energy.The second inconvenient truth for Reform is the main reason forthe rise in energy prices. According to Ofgem, it is more driven by gas than anything else. When you combine that with a privatisation that left the British public paying way more for energy than people in other countries, arch-Thatcherites Nigel Farage, Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe suddenly find themselves very much on the wrong side of the argument.The arch-Thatcherites were, of course, the same people who advocated the sell-off of council homes in the 1980s and this brings me to the second component of what could be a compelling Labour plan for the north.With more available land than other parts of England, we are in the position of being able to make a quicker and bigger contribution to the mission of1.5m new homes. However, rather than building just any homes, there is a clear case for making at least a third social homes and building the majority in the north by the next election as a new generation of council homes.Green homes that are cheaper to rent and cheaper to run would show a serious intent to improve the lives of our residents and remove our communities from the grip of the housing crisis. But this new drive would also reinforce the north’s green energy revolution and bring forward the reform of a broken energy market towards more localised solutions.The north of England had high hopes for this government. Why is it only offering us crumbs from the south? | Peter HetheringtonRead moreIt would also open up a huge number of new training opportunities for young people. In communities that have suffered de-industrialisation, there is a vacuum left by an English education system that has been too focused on the traditional university route. This is another Whitehall default setting that must be changed.In Greater Manchester, two-thirds of young people don’t take the university route. We need to do much better by them. Our Greater Manchester Baccalaurate (MBacc) is based on the principle of two equal paths at 14 – one academic, one technical – and lays out a clear path towards green construction and other priority sectors. If adopted across the north, it would change the perception that the left does not care about those who seek technical qualifications.If you add a commitment to fix our broken transport system and build the new rail infrastructure we need, this new deal for the north can be made to stack up. But, as the Convention of the North will no doubt make abundantly clear, it will require Whitehall to focus on the northin a way it never has before.

Perilously late in the day, the US president and special envoy to the Kremlin has alerted Germany and the rest of Europe that there is one fault line, and one alone, between democracy and autocracy. All other political issues facing the country pale into insignificance.It seems thatFriedrich Merz gets it, even if many in his country still don’t. Since winning Sunday’s election, the Christian Democrat (CDU) chancellor-elect has used every opportunity to warn of the dangers of the Trumpian new world order. He has not sought to provide reassurance, something that Germans tend to crave from their politicians.He is emphasising jeopardy for two immediate reasons: he needs the forlorn Social Democrats (SPD), whose third place in the election marked ahistoric low, to join him in a government not in their image. He also needs tounlock a borrowing facilitythat will allow him to spend big on defence. But it is more than that. The penny seems to have dropped.This was not his position before. He was one of those to argue that Germany needed to live within its means and that thereforethe “debt brake”should not be tinkered with. He now accepts that a special, longer-term fund is required to pay for enhanced defence. The problem is that to be reformed it needs a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, because the rule was absurdly enshrined into the constitution in 2009.Merz went into the election campaign last November confident in the view (he does not lack self-regard) that he could do business with Trump. An arch-Atlanticist, and a former chair of BlackRock investment house, he suggested he’d get along just fine with his fellow conservative in the White House; two fist-pumping men who were tough on immigration and all things “woke” and were eager to cut taxes and slash bureaucracy.View image in fullscreenActivists demonstrate in front of the CDU party headquarters in Berlin, on 23 February 2025.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAThen came Munichand the extraordinary assault on Europe, Ukraine, Germany and democracy led by Trump’s bilious vice-president, JD Vance, in front of the global establishment at the annual security conference.For the French and Brits, the US about-turn and warm embrace of Vladimir Putin is horrifying. For Germans it is existential – and challenges the bedrock of their post-1945 state (or at least the western part).Confronted by this crisis, many Germans have fallen into intense gloom. Last weekend, one acquaintance talked about the prospect of nuclear war. Another wondered whether he should sell his apartment “before the Russians invade, with the Americans’ blessing”. Berlin is one hour from the Polish border. The land is flat.There is another response, a healthier one, which is to accept that the status quo ante will never return and thatGermanyneeds to channel that anxiety into a more muscular approach towards defence and international relations.Uncomfortable political choices will have to be made; a psychological transformation is required. Germany needs to shed the two tropes that have dominated much of its thinking, particularly since reunification in 1990. One of these goes: “We are so terrible, we can’t be trusted with anything military – can’t someone else make these problems go away?” The second says: “Unlike you, we’re over all things military; we’ve reached a higher plane.” The former is based in inferiority, the latter in superiority. They may be diametrically opposed, but they are often espoused by the same people – the “salon pacifists” who have influenced all political parties.This complacency began to change whenPutin invaded Ukraine in February 2022(although days before, senior German diplomats were telling me he was “far too sensible” to take such an “irrational” step).In the only courageous act of his time in office, Olaf Scholz presaged a harder-edged approach to Russia. The termZeitenwende– an epoch-changing moment – was applied to his speech to parliament announcing a special €100bn (£83bn) defence fund and immediate assistance to Kyiv. Of all European states, Germany provided most military assistance to Ukraine – but it was always hesitant and late. Scholz and other leaders, including from the UK, are culpable in ensuring that, while Ukraine might not lose on the battlefield, it could never win. With the arms at its disposal, it would never have been able to take back the lands recently lost, let alone during the first invasion in 2014.That is all over. Ukraine’s betrayal is definitive. Trump and Putin will see to that. Many Germans wonder who is next.The 84%turnout last Sundaywas remarkable, suggesting a country that cares deeply about what happens next. Yet many voters, particularly those who consider themselves on the centre left, were in a terrible bind. As was I, voting here for the first time.Germany has swung to the right. What does that mean for the country – and Europe? Our panel respondsRead moreWith the SPD washed up, the Greens remained the alternative for some. Their priorities of climate and human rights (hence tough on Russia) retains an appeal. The surprise package was Die Linke (the Left), galvanised under younger leadership, with an uplifting, radical domestic agenda. But what about its position on Russia? Will it really side with the Putin-loving Alternative für Deutschland in voting against defence increases, in the name of a specious “peace”?Which leaves Merz. In his approach to migration, his social agenda, and in his often confrontational personality, he is seen as anathema by many liberals. But might he stand up to Trump? Might he deliver on some of the domestic issues that have led so many voters to feel aggrieved? After four years of indecision at home and invisibility abroad, hard times have led to this hard leader.John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin, Blair’s Wars and Why the Germans Do It BetterExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeFriedrich MerzDonald TrumpRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

Those clouds are too many, too dark and too dangerous. All the same, viewed from a domestic political perspective, there is a clear emerging British upside to Trump’s efforts at crashing the post-cold war order. It might even get a boost from Thursday’sWashington visitby Keir Starmer.In July 2024, when Starmer became prime minister, Labour was rigidly on the defensive about Europe. Brexit was seen as an electorally unstable issue for a party whose priority was to reconnect with leave voters. Everything about Europe was thus sidelined during the election. Only vague generalities were permitted. The only foreign leaders pictured in the party manifesto were Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Canada’s Justin Trudeau.Since July, Labour in government has continued to tread warily. Starmer’s personal goodwill towards Europe was clear in international meetings, especially bilaterals. But he remained circumspect and nervous about re-engaging on policy specifics, especially with the EU itself. For instance, a report last week that the UK would agree with the EU on youth mobility visas was quicklyknocked down by the government.Downing Street’s response here was explicit. Such a scheme, even though only applying to 18- to 30-year-olds, restricted to a three-year limit and subject to an annual numbers cap, would be depicted as a resumption of pre-Brexit freedom of movement. It was not going to happen, said No 10. The reason is simple. Starmer is determined to prevent any replay of the Brexit years from entering the domestic political arena. The Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s recent proposal for Britain torejoin the European customs unionalso got a similarly immediate brush-off.Importantly, the Conservative opposition is also cautious aboutEurope, although for quite different reasons. Brexit still remains part of the Tory party’s creed. But even some Tory true believers can see there’s a problem. Brexit is synonymous in the public mind with the chaos of the Johnson, Truss and Sunak years, which led to the party’s worst modern election defeat last year. Nor has Brexit delivered any of the advantages promised in 2016. The Tories are therefore content with the standoff too. Even Reform UK says little about Brexit. Only the Lib Dems and the Scottish nationalists feel unfettered by the issue.The politics of the UK-Europe relationship might have stayed quietly frozen there for the next two or three years, despite Trump’s return. That was, after all, the originalLabourgovernment plan. So much has happened in Washington so quickly that it is perhaps hard to remember that, just after the 20 January inauguration, the UK was wholly focused on trying to embrace Trump as much as practicable, as well as on keeping out of the developing US-EU tariff battle.That changed for ever with Trump’s volte-face on the Russia-Ukraine war. By embracing Russia, andtrashing Ukraine and Zelenskyy, Trump exposed the true scale of the security threat to Ukraine and Europe that would result from a deal between him and Vladimir Putin. JD Vance underlined the realities in Munich shortly after. As a result, Trump drove Britain and Europe closer together far sooner than might have happened if Kamala Harris had become US president. Starmer now talks almost daily with Zelenskyy and, just as importantly, with Emmanuel Macron.This change is the product of necessity. It has been brought on by Trump’s recklessness. But it has a positive side. It forces Starmer to engage far more actively with Europe on defence and security. This is desirable all round. One consequence was Tuesday’s defence spending hike announcement. But this may be only the start.A further paradox is that Trump has also forced Kemi Badenoch and the Tory party to support Starmer’s more Europe-oriented response. Having backed Ukraine so passionately under Boris Johnson from 2022, anything else would discredit the Conservatives further. Remarkably, the Tories have almost nothing to say about a shift that would have been anathema in Johnson’s day. Even Nigel Farage, though less heavily politically invested in support for Ukraine and Zelenskyy, has had to join the slipstream.All of which has gifted Starmer a new and previously closed space in British politics. Building up Europe’s defence effort is suddenly the patriotic course. In the past, it would have been depicted as divisive, anti-American and anti-Nato. Instead, with the US threatening to turn its back on Ukraine, Europe and even Nato, it is Trump who is now divisive. There is an echo here of modern Britain’s Churchillian mythology, and of the words uttered by a defiant British soldier who raises his fist to the gathering storm in David Low’s iconic 1940 cartoon: “Very well, alone.”Now, though, it is all Europe, not Britain, that stands alone. Trump deserves two sorts of credit for this amid all the justified condemnation. First, because all of Europe should have seen and acted earlier on the security need anyway – not exactly difficult after Putin’s seizure of Crimea and Trump’s first term. Second, because it pushes Britain closer to Europe more generally. This increases the possibility for other forms of European joint action, not just in defence, that will sometimes be based on nation states and not exclusively on the disturbingly unwieldy EU.Last weekend’s German election is potentially pivotal here. The likely German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has long been open both to stronger German defence and, like Macron, to what is known in EU-speak as “variable geometry” relationships. This is where the priority for Europe’s future lies, not just for Britain. Whether these things will happen, and whether they will be sustained by the Merz-Starmer generation of leaders, are different questions altogether. But Trump has given Europe a chance. There is a gleam in the dark.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsForeign policyOpinionDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEuropean UnionUkraineEuropeLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

But what happens when this conversation is flipped on its head and a senior bureaucrat is threatened with being terminated because they are seemingly actually allowing the independent institution they oversee to do its job?Watching it unfold in real time is fascinating as the Coalitionturns on one of their own and suggests Matt Kean could not be maintainedas the chair of the independent Climate Change Authority. Why? Because the political machinery of the Coalition has taken offence at the authority’s assessment that their nuclear energy proposal makes it “virtually impossible” for Australia to reach net zero by 2050.Coalition spokesninnies have lashed out at the nice man at the Climate Change Authority | First Dog on the MoonRead moreTo be clear: the Climate Change Authority is an independent statutory body established in 2011 to provide “expert advice to the Australian government on climate change policy”.Initially established under the Gillard government, the authority has survived numerous attempts to destabilise it, beginning with the Abbott government’s concerted campaign to abolish it and starve it of funding.Fast forward to 2025, and theCoalitionseems to be once again seeking to diminish this public agency by ensuring those appointed to key positions are not only political allies but also only believe in the same “facts” the Coalition does.Science be damned. Independence be damned. Does the Coalition just want a body that will simply repackage their preferred headlines and dish them up to the rest of us as fact?Herein lies the rub: surely we have a right to expect our politicians listen to facts and evidence as they develop nation- and life-changing policy rather than use our public agencies as political vehicles.I don’t know Matt Kean personally, but as someone who has lived in New South Wales her entire life and saw him in action as the NSW energy and environment minister from 2019 to 2023, I’m confident he is someone who respects scientific evidence and the important role it plays in developing sound policy.Unsurprisingly then, as the Climate Change Authority issued their dire warning earlier this week that delaying the overhaul of Australia’s grid to accommodate a switch to nuclear risks adding two billion tonnes of emissions to our atmosphere, I took that information on board as being grounded in fact.After all, our statutory bodies are legally required to report accurately, based on evidence, without fear or favour when it comes to political ideology.But as quickly as the report was released, the Coalition jumped to discredit the Climate Change Authority, arguing thefinding was politically motivatedrather than factually grounded.This Trumpian and genuinely dystopian approach to politics and policy development cannot be allowed to encroach any further into Australia. We must call it out for what it is: cynical politics that puts party ideology before people.Coalition nuclear plan hides a 2bn tonne ‘carbon bomb’ that puts net zero by 2050 out of reach, new analysis showsRead moreConcerningly, as someone who has now sat in our parliament as an MP for the past three years, this is not the first time I’ve witnessed, or been involved in, an argument with someone from a major party around what a fact is and is not. You need look no further than the concerted campaign against the CSIRO.Indeed, not that long ago I had a fellow parliamentarian argue with me that a fact is only relevant in the context that it is given – his exact words: “Facts are all situational.” My response: “The world is round: when is that not a fact?”As the 2025 election bears down on us, I can’t help but think this latest attempt to discredit and cast aspersions on an independent authority is the first of many similar attacks we will see as election day draws closer.With public trust in both politicians and our government at an all-time low, it is more important than ever to ensure we are doing all we can to build confidence in the bodies that are ultimately meant to be beyond political influence: because then, evidence from such a body would be something to be valued and celebrated. Rather than something to be questioned.As my grandmother used to say: we are all entitled to our own opinions. But we are not entitled to our own facts.Kylea Tink is the outgoing independent federal member for North SydneyExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionNuclear powerClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsAustralian politicsCoalitionLiberal partycommentShareReuse this content"

But a lasting resolution will require greater rights for KurdsThu 27 Feb 2025 13.28 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 13.34 ESTShareAfter four decades of violence that have claimed at least 40,000 lives, this was a momentous declaration. On Thursday, the leader of the Kurdish insurgency, Abdullah Öcalan, revered by his supporters, called on fighters tolay down arms. In a written statement from his prison cell – he has been held in isolation for a quarter of a century – he urged his Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) not only to disarm but to dissolve itself.Yet optimism must be tempered. Ten years ago, a two-year truce between the militant group and the Turkish state imploded and some of the worst violence of the long conflict ensued.More than 7,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, have died since then.That attempt at a deal with a group designated by both Turkey and its western allies as a terrorist organisation came amid a very different political context, before the contours of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s illiberal democracy were so clear. The need to end the violence endures. The difference is that this time, thepeace effortsare driven byboth domestic politicsand regional developments.In October, President Erdoğan’s hardline ally Devlet Bahçeli, who once called for the execution of the PKK leader, surprised observers by suggesting that his life sentence might be reconsidered if he told fighters to disarm. Mr Erdoğan’s ambitions to continue in office despite Turkey’s term limits are clear: he has generously indicated that he would be open to running again “if the people want it”. But this would require either early elections or a change to the constitution. In either case, he would need support from legislators beyond his coalition – perhaps from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy party (DEM).The Middle East’s instability alsostrengthened Turkey’s desirefor security solutions. Then, just over a month after Mr Bahçeli’s call, Bashar al-Assad unexpectedly fell from power in Syria – thanks in part to Turkey’s backing of the victorious rebels, Hayat Tahrir-al Sham. The US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are nowfighting to maintainthe autonomous region they established in north-east Syria, aware that Donald Trump’s return to the White House is unlikely to be helpful. Iraq’swarming relations with Turkeyhave seen an agreement to work together to counter the PKK.That has left the PKK feeling isolated. This time, it looks as if the motivation on the Kurdish side is less about potential gains than the hope of a reprieve from military pressure and, in Turkey, from political pressure on the DEM, which has had several mayors removed and municipalities investigated – part of a broader pattern ofincreasing repression.The PKK’s demands long ago morphed from an independent Kurdish homeland to greater autonomy in Turkey and more rights forKurds, who account for as much as a fifth of the country’s population. Yet a deal may not necessarily bring much progress on these more modest demands. Ankara may prefer economic inducements: it recently announced a development plan for the Kurdish-majority south-east.One question is whether thousands of PKK fighters – mostly outside Turkey itself now – will be persuaded. Another is the cost to the Kurds and Turkey. After so many deaths and so many false starts, moves towards peace must be welcomed. But the price should not be the indefinite extension of the president’s strongman rule, and any lasting resolution would surely require proper democratic representation for Kurds, as they are demanding.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The emergence later on Thursday of a search warrant, however, cast doubts about a possible gas leak and raised alternative questions about the discovery of prescription pills near Arakawa’s body.Gene Hackman and pianist wife Betsy Arakawa found dead at home alongside one of their dogsRead moreHackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found by deputies in their house in the Hyde Park area of Santa Fe on Wednesday. The sheriff’s spokesperson said that foul play was not suspected, “however exact cause of death has not been determined”.The spokesperson added that the cause of death was unlikely to be known until autopsies are completed.LiveA look back at Gene Hackman's acting career – video obituaryFurther questions were raised on Thursday in a search warrant, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian, which gave new details about what deputies found during their initial visit. The search warrant revealed that Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time before their bodies were discovered as “the body was in a state of decomposition with bloating in her face and mummification in her hands and feet”.A prescription bottle was also found on a countertop in the house, with pills scattered around.According to the search warrant, Arakawa was found on the floor of a bathroom near the countertop beside a space heater that the deputies believed could have toppled and knocked her over. Hackman’s body was in the mud room of the house, fully clothed in gray sweatpants and a long-sleeve T-shirt and with a cane.Deputies believed he might have had a sudden fall.The warrant indicated that in the initial search no problems with leaking gas were found. The search warrant concluded that the deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation”.“All I can say is that we’re in the middle of a preliminary death investigation,” the sheriff, Adan Mendoza of Santa Fe county, told theSanta Fe New Mexican. Three German shepherds were at the home at the time that deputies entered the property, one of which was found deceased inside a closet in the bathroom about 10-15ft from Arakawa’s body.Deputies reported that there were no signs of trauma to the bodies. No suicide note was discovered, according to theNew York Times.‘The greatest’: Hollywood pays tribute to Gene Hackman after actor’s deathRead moreThe couple had lived in New Mexico since 2004, when Hackmanretired from Hollywood. They had married in 1991.A longtime friend of the couple, Barbara Lenihan, told the New York Times that she had spoken with Arakawa in January. At that time, Hackman appeared to be becoming more frail but was still active.“They always were somewhat reclusive even though everyone loved to be around them,” she told the newspaper.Elizabeth Jean Hackman, the actor’s daughter and one of his three children with Faye Maltese, told TMZ that the family suspected that carbon monoxide poisoning might be to blame.She told the outlet they were not certain, but that they thought toxic fumes might be the cause of death.This article was amended on 28 February 2025, to correct Arakawa’s age at time of death.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Wu-Tang Clan hint at breakupByAlexis PetridisThu 27 Feb 2025 10.05 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 17.10 ESTShare20. Method Man – Tical 2000: Judgement Day (1998)Method Man’s second album is preposterously long, hopelessly uneven and featuresnineskits (one featuring a guest appearance by – uh-oh – Donald Trump). But make a playlist of the best 12 tracks – including Dangerous Grounds, Judgement Day and Break Ups 2 Make Ups – and you’ve got a minor classic.19. Ol’ Dirty Bastard – Nigga Please (1999)As chaotic and scattered as its author’s life had become by the time of its release, Nigga Please is the kind of album that requires the listener to let go and submit to its bizarre internal logic: garbled off-rhythm rhymes and jarring sonic leaps from taut Neptunes productions to grimy RZA-isms and more. It’s a mess, but it’s never boring.18. Czarface – Every Hero Needs a Villain (2015)Teaming up with underground Boston duo 7L & Esoteric seemed to reinvigorate Inspectah Deck after years of diminishing solo returns. They deal in understated (and audibly RZA-influenced) boom-bap beats and richly entertaining battle rapping, while Method Man and GZA turn in superb guest verses. Nothing unexpected, but preposterously good, dirty fun nonetheless.17. RZA – Bobby Digital in Stereo (1998)Released to a muted response – and currently unavailable on streaming – RZA’s left-turn into a keyboard-based and less sample-heavy production style deserves reconsideration. The concept makes no sense and the lyrics of Domestic Violence are indefensible, but its highlights shine very brightly indeed: the slinky Love Jones and My Lovin’ Is Digi, plus the killer NYC Everything, featuring Method Man.View image in fullscreenSign o’ the times … Wu-Tang’s Raekwon, GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, RZA and Method Man in New York, 1993.Photograph: Al Pereira/Getty Images16. Masta Killa – No Said Date (2004)If Masta Killa had released his solo debut in the mid-90s, it might have been acclaimed among the great Wu-Tang masterpieces. A decade on, the main criticism was that it was old-fashioned. That is not strictly true – see the synthy, dancefloor-focused Digi Warfare – but when it’s defiantly retro, it’s high-quality retro: pared-down RZA production underneath skilled and urgent rhymes.15. Method Man & Redman – Blackout! (1999)Devotees of the stoner movie How High might disagree, but the Meth-Redman partnership never functioned better than on their collaborative debut. Rugged, straight-ahead beats, ultra-aggressive rhymes, a plethora of lyrical references to old school hip-hop – EPMD, LL Cool J, MC Shan, Run DMC – and the sense of two artists meeting at the top of their game.14. Ghostface Killah – The Pretty Toney Album (2004)The first Wu Tang solo album without an appearance from another member, but no matter: this is an underrated masterpiece, thick with lush, emotive soul samples (Holla is basically the Delfonics’ La La Means I Love You with Ghostface rapping over the whole thing, vocals and all) and abundant on-point rhymes.13. Wu-Tang Clan – The W (2000)Stripped back compared with its 27-track predecessor, The W still could have used a nip and tuck. That said, there is far more good than bad, and when it’s good – Do You Really (Thang Thang), Let My Niggas Live – it’s startlingly intense. Also, the relatively poppy Gravel Pit was the last truly incredibleWu-Tang Clansingle.View image in fullscreen(From left) U-God, Ghostface Killah and Inspectah Deck on stage, 2008.Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns12. Ghostface Killah – Ironman (ft Raekwon and Cappadonna) (1996)Ghostface seemed willing to share the limelight here – he isn’t even on Assassination Day – but Ironman feels like a project distinct from contemporary Wu-Tang releases. The sound is dominated by 70s soul (Motherless Child presages Kanye West’s early “chipmunk” productions) and the lyrics consistently lash out.11. Raekwon – Only Built 4 Cuban Linx … Part II (2009)Most sequel albums smack of desperation: an artist frantically trying to regain the form that made them special. But the sequel to one of the greatest Wu-Tang albums doesn’t shame the original. Its return to the crime empire saga is dazzling in scope, its production so strong that Dr Dre’s tracks are the weak link.10. Inspectah Deck – Uncontrolled Substance (1999)“Weak MCs – take me to your leader!” Overshadowed by his better-know bandmates, his debut solo album – thick with freestyle interludes – fully revealed Inspectah Deck as an intricately skilled rapper who blended underworld storytelling with a homespun philosophical bent. The guests are largely drawn from Wu-Tang’s fringes and the music – frequently Deck’s own work – slaps throughout.View image in fullscreenRaekwon performs in Brooklyn, 2011.Photograph: Al Pereira/WireImage9. Gravediggaz – 6 Feet Deep (1994)You wouldn’t expect an album that, at heart, consists of kvetching about the music business to be so captivating. But RZA and Prince Paul’s Gravediggaz project turned their dissatisfaction into a series of lurid blackly comic slasher-flick metaphors set to dark, minor-chord soundscapes, helping to birth horrorcore in the process.8. Wu-Tang Clan – Wu-Tang Forever (1997)The epitome of late 90s hip-hop grandiloquence? Maybe. Wu-Tang Forever lasts more than two hours. Nobody is good enough to maintain your interest for that long – you could live without ODB’s dispiritingly titled Dog Shit – but Wu-Tang Forever is surprisingly focused, socially conscious, cinematic and worth revisiting (time permitting).7. Ghostface Killah – Fishscale (2006)By far the most consistent member of Wu-Tang, Ghostface was making fantastic albums long after his bandmates’ quality control had slipped. There is nothing original about Fishscale’s crack dealer concept, but from J Dilla’s and MF Doom’s beats to the sophistication of the storytelling, the execution is magnificent.6. Method Man – Tical (1994)One theory suggests that Tical wasn’t meant to sound the way it does; it was rushed or poorly mastered. But the foggy sound works, amplifying its star’s gritty approach. Bring the Pain is the characteristic classic, while All I Need is gruffly romantic, an aspect highlighted by the superb remix featuring Mary J Blige.View image in fullscreenRZA(centre)with other members of the Wu-Tang Clan in 2000.Photograph: Ken Hively/LA Times/Getty Images5. Ol’ Dirty Bastard – Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (1995)The cocktail of mental instability and drug abuse that ultimately led to his death looms large over ODB’s legacy: it’s worth remembering what an incredible, unique rapper he was. His slurred, unpredictable approach was groundbreaking and his solo debut is the best way to hear it. The instrumentals are a perfect complement.4. Ghostface Killah – Supreme Clientele (2000)Just as Wu-Tang faltered, Ghostface unleashed his greatest album. Inspired by a trip to Africa – and a flood in RZA’s studio that caused a production reset – it was a defiant restatement of intent in a climate dominated byMurder Inc’s softer approach. Ghostface is hilarious and hard-hitting; just check the awesome Apollo Kids.3. Genius/GZA – Liquid Swords (1995)“We were on a roll,” offered GZA of his contribution to the triumvirate of unimpeachable Wu-Tang classics, in which the collective’s most finessed and methodical MC – alongside RZA at his most atmospheric – conjure up an authentically eerie album, its lyrics packed with elaborate metaphors. Utterly compelling from start to finish.2. Raekwon – Only Built 4 Cuban Linx … (1995)When Raekwon’s solo debut arrived weeks before Liquid Swords, it seemed Wu-Tang could do no wrong. Its mobster fantasy concept works perfectly; the rhymes are vivid and complex; the creative sparks between Raekwon and Ghostface fly; and RZA’s production is risky but impeccable. It’s one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever made.1. Wu-Tang Clan – Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993)Any of the top three albums here could occupy the No 1 spot: qualitatively, there is nothing between them; they are as extraordinary as each other. Enter the Wu-Tang edges it simply for the gamechanging shock it delivered on release. A blast of dank New York air at the height of the super-smooth G-funk era, everything from its complex mythology to its rule-breaking production to its idiosyncratic MCing felt unprecedented and electrifying: nothing else sounded like it. Packed with career-defining classics – Protect Ya Neck, C.R.E.A.M., Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit – it still sounds remarkable today.Explore more on these topicsRankedWu-Tang ClanRapHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Also why the obsession with horror films?MrSOBaldrickRichard I loved because he was like a mentor to me. He’s probably single-handedly done more for my career than anyone else. Just taking me under his wing, putting me in Rada, especially coming off the back of my crazy run on television. I couldn’t tell you how he found me. I don’t think he ever really told me.Bruce was amazing. He was so great with the kids and a lot of fun. The Sixth Sense was a massive movie set; a huge production. When we went to do the indie film [2008’s Assassination of a High School President] together, he was always playing guitar in his trailer, so I look back very fondly on that. He lights up a room when he walks into it and he’s just a lovely guy.View image in fullscreen‘He lights up a room’ … Barton in The Sixth Sense, which she starred in alongside Bruce Willis.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyI’m probably the biggest Hugh Grant fan ever, not least because I got to work with him when I was little and he was so nice to me. We were also born in the same hospital in Hammersmith [in west London], which doesn’t exist any more, but I’ll take as my claim to fame. Every Halloween, The Sixth Sense seems to get watched. At Christmas,Notting Hillcomes back out, so always I look back fondly.Horror films are good for strong female leads. I’d rather be doing something serious and dramatic than I would fluffy. I think it’s just the nature of the scripts. I mean, you’ve got to have a strong female if she’s going to get out of there alive …Actors used to be like most other professions, but are now often treated as dispensers of wisdom, with a philosophy and insight above ordinary mortals. What changed?eamonmccI don’t think anything’s changed. I think people still hold actors in too high regard for their opinions. It’s an age-old question and I don’t know why. Actors are supposed to exemplify something we want to be like, but that doesn’t mean they know better than anyone else.When portrayingMiranda GreeninInvitation to Murder,did you draw inspiration from any particular murder mystery novels or films?VerulamiumParkRangerView image in fullscreen‘I really love growing with a character’ … Barton in Invitation to a Murder.Photograph: © 2022 INVITATION TO A MURDER, LLC.

She’s wearing the pants, running around solving mysteries. She’s incredibly well read and she’s great fun to play. This is the first of a trilogy, which I’m over the moon about. We’ve shot the second already. I really love growing with a character and getting to know them.You really stood out in your early roles inLawn DogsandLost and Delirious.

My family comes from different parts of England. I’m a proud Brit, but I’m also very proud of the Irish side of the family. My mom was so proud to see me at the Gaiety [theatre] in Dublin, she literally cried. I took her to see the Irish dancing and she loved that too. It couldn’t have been more typically Irish. We went to Cork, Galway and Limerick. In at least three of the theatres, somebody sent a note backstage saying: “I’m related to you. If you want to come up to the front and meet me, I’m your such and such cousin.” It was really cute.How have your views about fame and Hollywood changed over the years? What advice would you give young actors coming up todayon how to dealwith fame?EmmaStone andhhhhssssFame is not something everybody has to deal with, so that’s a very specific question. I would say: concentrate on your craft. Fame is something that generally comes to people who don’t particularly seek it. Just concentrate on what you’re in the business for in the first place, and try to take the rest with as much grace and humility as possible. I was a pretty introverted, shy child, so for me acting got me out of school and around cool adults, and I got to go cool places. I have always loved storytelling, and I still love being able to lose myself in a character.How did you end up doing the video forEverybody’sonthe RunforNoel Gallagher? Are you anOasisfan?

I think he knew I lived there and hoped I would be available. It was fun. I don’t know how I felt about getting my skirt ripped off.

In Siena, the magic year was 1226, the start of some 85 years of construction of the duomo, a remarkable gothic structure with an intricately complex, creamy pink facade and stripy, black-and-white campanile. “The scale of ambition is difficult to put into words,” says Laura Llewellyn, one of the curators ofThe Rise of Painting, the National Gallery’s new exhibition of Sienese art. “The extravagance of it: to appreciate it you need to unknow and unlearn later buildings like the duomos in Florence and St Peter’s in Rome.”But by the 1350s, Siena’s most glorious years in the raging Tuscan sun would be as good as over. After decades of rapid artistic transformation – a half century that saw the art of the city leave behind the distant, hieratic grace of Byzantine-flavoured painting for a world of dynamism, drama and emotion – the Black Death halved the city’s population from 60,000 to 30,000, stripped away its wilder ambitions and dulled its gleaming wealth. One of Siena’s more implausible plans had been to enlarge the already huge cathedral by converting its existing nave into a transept and tacking on to its belly a new, vastly oversized nave on the precipitous edge of one of the city’s peaks. The project was never completed, but ghostly unfinished arches remain as a monument to lost dreams and a raging pandemic.Medieval Siena was an oligarchic republic. Even so, it was emphatically ruled by the Virgin Mary. In the city’s art, she is omnipresent. Find her with “large eyes” (theMadonna degli Occhi Grossi, dating from about 1225; the work, by an artist known as the Maestro di Tressa, bestowed victory on the Sienese in the battle of Montaperti against the Florentines in 1260). Observe her inAmbrogio Lorenzetti’s Madonna del Latte, from which the infant Jesus, pressed to her breast, stares at the viewer with a watchful side-eye, bracing his tiny foot against the curve of her arm (this masterpiece will be in the London exhibition). Find her as a newborn, being lovingly washed by women who pour water from a ewer into a hexagonal basin, in an altarpiece signed by Ambrogio’s brother Pietro.View image in fullscreenPolyptych by Pietro Lorenzetti from around 1320.Photograph: © Gentile concessione dell’Ufficio Beni Culturali della Diocesi di Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro /  L.A.D. Photographic di AngelShe is there, too, reclining on a couch which makes her look like an Etruscan lady on a tomb, in Giovanni Pisano’s carvings on the side of Siena Cathedral’s pulpit, the still point at the heart of an arrangement so hectic, so crowded with sheep, kings, shepherds and other dramatis personae of the nativity, that one goat has to have its poor head forced upwards against the side of the relief in order to be accommodated by the composition.Even more magnificently, she presides over the Palazzo Pubblico – the political centre of Siena, the great stage set towards which the famous campo, or central square, rakes down. Here she is enthroned by Simone Martini on the wall of the chamber in which the city’s legislative body, the Consiglio Generale, debated; a decorous queen presiding over a court of saints, in turn hovering above a government of men.View image in fullscreenThe Annunciate Virgin, Simone Martini, circa 1326-34.Photograph: Collection KMSKA - Flemish Community / photo Hugo MaertensBut inside the cathedral itself is the grandest Virgin of all: theMaestà by Duccio, the glorious central climax of a magisterial altarpiece designed to enrapture its audience in a blast of detail and colour. So beloved by its commissioners was it that it was carried through the city in a triumphant procession before being installed in the church in 1311. Duccio signed the work with an inscription: “Holy Mother of God, be thou the cause of peace for Siena, and life to Duccio because he painted thee thus.” It’s a rare moment this, hearing the painter’s words fly towards us from seven centuries ago, a sentence that combines a plea for attention at the level of the state with a breathtaking claim to intimacy between painter and subject.After the worst of the Black Death, Florence was emphatically the winner of the rivalry between itself and Siena, and Siena’s art is often seen in relation to its neighbour’s. Siena: dreamy and emotional; Florence: intellectual and vigorous. Siena’s gold-encrusted artworks are very worldly paintings that speak of abundant wealth, the best materials, no expense spared for the Virgin in this city of medieval bankers – but they seem otherworldly, too, those glinting heavens deliquescing into a shimmering celestial haze. The Rise ofPainting, though, reasserts Siena as no pensive, hazy adjunct to Florence, but a centre of tumultuous innovation in the first half of the 14th century – a time of connectivity, trade, the influx of gorgeous materials and textiles and skill in goldsmithing and ivory carving.Most importantly, perhaps, it was a also a time of rapid religious change that saw art flexing to meet the needs of a new relationship with God, instigated by the flourishing of the new mendicant religious orders – Franciscans, Dominicans – who inserted themselves into cities, tending to the sick, filling barn-like churches with crowds for charismatic sermons, and insisting, according to Caroline Campbell, one of the exhibition curators, on a religious life that was “more about doing, less about observing”. In artistic terms, that translated into paintings of action, jeopardy and feeling – an art that insisted on drawing the viewer into its exciting, perilous high-stakes world.View image in fullscreenLa Maestà by Duccio (panel detail), circa 1308-11.Photograph: Museo Nacional Thyssen- Bornemisza, MadridOn the gothic facade of the cathedral, for example, the statuary is not co-opted to double up as load-bearing columns, as one would often see on a northern European equivalent. Instead, these are independent figures like actors on a stage – prophets and sibyls who incline and bend towards each other in dynamic conversation. It is hard now, at a distance of so many hundreds of years, to look at a Sienese polyptych and think: when this was painted, this was a new artistic form; what’s more, these now venerable-seeming saints were new too, their iconography up for grabs.In thePinacoteca Nazionalein Siena, there is a triptych painted by Simone Martini from around 1324 showing theBlessed Agostino Novello, a Sicilian-born hermit saint who’d died near Siena as recently as 1309. Agostino performed a number of thrilling posthumous miracles: he dived through the sky with incredible skill to soften the fall of a child from a collapsing balcony; swooped in from on high to revive an infant savaged by a dog; prevented a traveller in a lonely mountain pass from being crushed by his falling horse; most excitingly of all, resuced a baby whose hammock-like cradle had come free of its fastenings. Less than a generation separated the events from the painting. Agostino and his like were powerful new religious forces whose legacies could be promoted by painters.The Rise of Painting reasserts Siena as no pensive, hazy adjunct to Florence, but a centre of tumultuous innovationPerhaps the most dramatic artwork of all, though, was Duccio’s Maestà. It was a huge and complex structure, and double-sided: the Virgin took the central spot at the front side, facing the congregation: angels rest their hands and heads on the back of her throne, gazing at her and the infant Christ protectively, as a wider cordon of saints mass around her in reverence. Above and below, pinnacles and a predella show scenes from her life. On the reverse side, visible to the clergy and, perhaps only on holy days, by the wider populace, the focus is Christ, culminating in his crucifixion. The predella tracks his life from his temptations, via the wedding feast at Cana, through to the resurrection of Lazarus.View image in fullscreenThe Virgin and Child, ivory with polychromy, circa 1290-1300.Photograph: © Museo Tesoro Basilica di San FrancescoThe invention and the dazzle are wonderful: the Sienese insistence on the very best materials means the thing hums with energetic colour even now, and the whole work, with its narrative scenes, demands to be read and reread over months or years (it is the first surviving predella whose individual scenes link up to tell one larger story). It is a sobering reminder of the vagaries of taste, though, that in the 16th century this magnificent structure was demoted to a side chapel and in the 18th, sliced in half through its skinny middle, separating the two painted sides, then the whole thing chopped up into individual scenes with a view to selling them. Though most of the 33 parts are still in Siena, in theMuseo dell’Opera, the rest are scattered widely – into 10 collections in five countries. The reuniting of the surviving parts of the back predella for the National Gallery exhibition represents the first time they have been seen together since they were broken up.What cannot be seen in London, since it is a fresco that sits on the walls of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, and even now is closed for conservation work, is surely one of the most captivating artworks anywhere:Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good and Bad Government, which adorned the chamber in which the executive branch of the Sienese government held its meetings.One of the chief delights of this complex, remarkable work is its vision of a well-governed city – a walled city remarkably like Siena that in turn protects a countryside that is productive, safe, populous and unthreatening, complete with an elegant lady on horseback, donkeys, dogs and a contented black-and-white striped pig. In this well-governed city the buildings are well-maintained, the streets bustle with trade, a cat skitters along a high balustrade outside a window, and, most touching of all, a house martin, heraldically black and white like Siena’s coat of arms, tends to the nest it has made under the eaves of a house.In another part of the fresco, at right angles to the well-governed city, the Virtues sit – Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance and the rest, all personified into queenly women. The best of these is Peace, who reclines in her long white shift, head leaning on her hand, olive leaves crowning her head, her deep, richly embroidered cushion propped up by the armour she has taken off: a picture of repose and contemplation and somehow, despite all the philosophical density of the fresco, a real woman made of flesh and blood and thought and feeling.Siena: the Rise of Painting 1300-1350 is at the National Gallery, London, from 8 March to 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtPaintingArchitectureItalyReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s a big ask, in a very crowded field, but Ozon has got the back catalogue to back it up. From his 1998 feature debut Sitcom (notwithstanding 1997’s 52-minute See the Sea), early films such as Fassbinder adaptationWater Drops on Burning Rocksand star-stuffed crime musical8 Women, on to more recent works includingFrantzandSummer of 85, Ozon has ranged widely across styles and genres, offering something new and original wherever he’s gone. He’s even done an English-language period drama,Angel, starring Romola Garai.A distinctive feature of Ozon’s career is his ability to command great performances from top-notch female stars, often repeatedly working with them. Charlotte Rampling,Isabelle Huppert,Catherine Deneuve,Sophie MarceauandKristin Scott Thomasare just a few of the names who have popped up in his films.Ozon has completed an amazing 22 features in the 27 years since that 1998 debut, and won a string of awards:his 2012 drama In the House, about a teacher who becomes unhealthily involved in the life of a precocious and difficult student, is probably the most garlanded. His new filmWhen Autumn Falls (AKAWhen Fall Is Comingin the US) stars Hélène Vincent in a story that starts off gently bucolic, then heads somewhere darker and more dangerous. So now’s the time to ask Ozon a question in the comments below; we’ll publish his replies in a fortnight.When Autumn Falls is in UK & Irish cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe reader interviewFrançois OzonMusicalsComedy filmsThrillersFilm adaptationsComedycalloutShareReuse this content"

A regular game had an audience member sitting in the “pie chair” and given an almost impossible task – if they failed, they would be on the receiving end of extra-foamy custard pies delivered by extendable mechanical arms with hands on the end.Fans of the programme were also featured displaying their talents, among them a vicar giving a believable impression of Liberace, a laundry worker building a magnificent robot and a man devoted to decorating the inside of his house with old master-style paintings.View image in fullscreenHenry Kelly joined the Irish Times as a news reporter in 1968.Photograph: ITN/Rex/ShutterstockThe four original hosts – Kelly,Jeremy Beadle, Sarah Kennedy and Matthew Kelly (no relation) – presented the show seated on tall stools and were remembered for signing off each episode, inviting viewers to tune in the following week, with the catchphrase “Watching us … watching you … watching us … watching you” while the camera switched between each presenter and the audience as they delivered the words.Within two months of its launch in 1981, Game for a Laugh attracted more than 15 million viewers. Kelly, described by TV Times magazine as “the fair, skinny one with theTerry Woganaccent”, eventually left two years later after three series, along with Kennedy and Matthew Kelly.“I realised that comedy really is a serious business,” he told the Daily Express in 2016. “We had no script, no Autocue and no earpieces. It was a brilliant show. It changed my life … it opened doors for me.”Opportunities included the chance to host a BBC daytime quiz show, Going for Gold, featuring contestants from across Europe. When it was initially suggested, Kelly recalled, he regarded the idea as “nonsense”, but he took on the programme and it became a hit. The show was particularly popular with students, and Kelly was made honorary president of one student union. Going for Gold ran for 10 series (1987-96) and was later revived by Channel 5 with John Suchet presenting.View image in fullscreenHenry Kelly in the studio at the launch of the Classic FM radio station in 1992.Photograph: Times Newspapers/Rex/ShutterstockHalfway through his run on Going for Gold, Kelly – who had been a BBC radio reporter before moving into television – returned to radio to become one of the launch presenters of the Classic FM station. From 1992 to 2003, he hosted the mid-morning programme, then the breakfast show, building up an audience of more than 3 million listeners with a format that included recipes and racing tips as well as music, and he was named national broadcaster of the year in the 1994 Sony radio awards.Born in Dublin, Henry was the youngest of five children. His father, also Henry, was a civil servant who had been private secretary toKevin O’Higgins, the 1920s Irish politician responsible for the execution of 77 IRA members. “He once showed me notes he had written about 20 minutes after O’Higgins was assassinated,” said Kelly, who pronounced his father a “warm, lovable, generous man” while admitting to not having a close relationship with his mother.The family moved to Athlone when he was a baby and seven years later returned to Dublin. Henry was educated at the Jesuit school Belvedere college, where he was a friend of Terry Wogan’s brother, Brian, and a frequent visitor to the Wogan family home. “I was good at Latin and Greek and English, and talking, and not necessarily in that order,” he said.While studying English at University College Dublin, he wrote theatre reviews for the Irish Times. On graduation in 1968, he joined the paper as a reporter. When he became its northern editor in Belfast, Kelly reported on the violence that had reignited there. “I was privileged enough to be one of that small group who knew the north was a serious story long before it became fashionable,” he told the Irish Times. “It was a very exciting time. I loved it … I absolutely loved it.” Those years on the paper also included assignments in the Middle East and south-east Asia.Kelly’s book How Stormont Fell, an authoritative account of the dissolution of Northern Ireland’s parliament, was published in 1972. Four years later, he moved to London, joining BBC Radio 4’s The World Tonight as a reporter for a five-year stint. He was also a regular reporter on Woman’s Hour in 1979-80 before leaving to present Game for a Laugh.“My colleagues atRadio4 thought I was mad when I moved to light entertainment,” he said. Nevertheless, he continued on Radio 4 to host the Midweek morning show (1982-83) and co-presented the second and third series of the BBC TV programme Food and Drink (1983-84).In 1983, he joined the ITV breakfast service TV-am during its first year, to take over the Saturday edition of Good Morning Britain fromMichael Parkinson. He also sometimes presented the weekday show before leaving in 1987.Kelly’s regular return to radio came with his shows on Classic FM in the 1990s – and there was a storm of complaints from listeners after his breakfast programme was handed over to Simon Bates. He went back to the station to host a Sunday morning show (2006-08) after a stint presenting the drivetime programme on LBC (2003-04), which returned him to his news roots. He also had his own mid-morning programme on BBC Radio Berkshire (2005-15).He and his partner, Karolyn Shindler, a former BBC producer, wrote a travel guide to Connemara, titled Henry Kelly in the West of Ireland with Karolyn Shindler, published in 1996.Kelly’s marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Margery Conway, ended in divorce. He is survived by Karolyn, their son, Alexander, and a daughter, Siobhan, from his marriage.Patrick Henry Kelly, broadcaster and journalist, born 17 April 1946; died 25 February 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevisionRadioRadio 4obituariesShareReuse this content"

The necessity of this opulence was completely obvious to director Jon M Chu and production designer Nathan Crowley – otherwise they’d have to use CGI for the Munchkin Village. Is CGI lush? Does it recall the heady, future-facing surge of hope and optimism that the original Oz has come to represent for, goddammit, almost a century? It does not. While it isn’t for the production values alone that Wicked deserves the best picture Oscar – anyone can spend money if they have enough money – take a second to consider the commitment of this film, and its impossibility. It tries to remain true to the moment when the world discovered Technicolor (sure, sure, come at me withThe Toll of the Seasome other time); cheerfulness, magic, a naive faith in cinema and beyond – these are quite big asks in 2024, and Wicked went for it.It was partly in tribute to that quality of early musicals that Cynthia Erivo andAriana Grandeperformed all the songs live; lip-syncing as an innovation has brought increased slickness to a movie’s sound quality, but at the expense of stripping out jeopardy and emotion from the human voice. Clearly, Erivo and Grande could both lift a building off its foundations with their vocals – the last thing you’d describe them as being is “fragile” – but it’s a “whites of their eyes” thing. You never realised you needed to see the muscles move in a singer’s throat to believe that they really mean it – yet it turns out, you do.If it were just down to Erivo or Grande’s performances, then obviously the case would be for best actress/support. But forget screen chemistry, these two are like an actual chemical reaction together – hydrogen and oxygen fusing to become something entirely new, with its own properties. It’s not completely fanciful that TikTok is convinced they’vefallen in love in real life, nor that What Is This Feeling? is such a strong song, when it’s not actually the strongest song. They have multiple matching tattoos! They burst into tears whenever they see each other!To be honest, if ever there’s a musical on theOscarsshortlist, I would always lobby for that over a non-musical. People think the form is schlockier and therefore easier, but in fact it is better and therefore harder. The original musical which this adapts is a bit of a head-scratcher, to be honest – there are scores which you love instantly for obvious reasons (My Fair Lady, Cabaret), and ones that you love instantly for reasons you can’t figure out (Hamilton). Wicked is a grower, many of the melodies aren’t that catchy, often the motifs relate in ways you only realise after multiple listens. It’s the musical equivalent of going to a Pixies gig where they’re only going to play their latest album. You wouldn’t want to arrive at it cold. But, again, there’s that sense of confidence and commitment – let’s not make it shorter, to cater to the 21st-century attention span. Let’s split it in half, and make both halves unimaginably long. Everyone will fall for it, if they give it enough time. Time, we have (this first instalment is 2hrs 40min. I’ve seen it on the 22nd of every month since it came out, so I’m confident I could pass the GCSE).Wicked review – Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are a blast in sugar-rush Wizard of Oz fantasyRead moreThe dialogue is also sharp but unobtrusive. It’s not played for laughs, but when there is one (Jonathan Bailey, saying “I’ve been thinking”; Erivo replying, full of consternation: “I heard”), it stands out, elegantly. And Jeff Goldblum – whose high-camp shtick can be jarring to a plot, reminding you insistently that, whatever else is going on, that’s definitely Jeff Goldblum – has found his happy place, as the Wizard.Not wanting to be sacrilegious, the animal subplot didn’t make a whole lot of sense in the musical, which Stephen Schwartz, composer and lyricist, has acknowledged. Why would the Wizard want to empower the monkey army, in order to spy on the talking animals? Why not just maintain a monkey army in their non-flying state and just subjugate the rest of the animals some other way? “We wanted to ditch it because it was so confusing,” Schwartz said in 2000, adding “but so much of the plot hinges on it, so there is nothing that can be done.” The film has given Dr Dillamond, the talking goat, political resonance and emotional heft, introducing totalitarian overtones without which the central dilemma – does Glinda choose Elphaba or conventional society? – would fall apart. If it weren’t Elphaba v the fash, you’d automatically side with Glinda. She seems so nice, and Elphaba is green.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest picture Oscar hustingsWickedOscarsAwards and prizesMusicalsCynthia ErivoAriana GrandefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The number of visitors almost halved when it reopened its doors in 2022, before increasing in 2023 to 710,000 visitors. But in 2024 the attendance slumped to 622,000.Last year the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s annual reportsaid: “Public bodies may face financial sustainability issues due to several years of economic pressures.”The RA’sannual report for 2023-24states that it was “facing a material reduction in income from exhibition admission and other on-site sources of income for at least the next three years”, adding that “it would take longer to return to pre-pandemic levels of income”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The purpose-built, 1,200-seat Troubadour Canary Wharf theatre is operated by the company behind the venue for the successfulStarlight Expressreboot in Wembley Park, where singing roller-skaters whiz among the audience. The Hunger Games has been similarly designed to place theatregoers amid the action.Tristan Baker and Oliver Royds, joint CEOs and founders ofTroubadour Theatres, said the show would offer “a transportive, electrifying experience that fully captures the scale, intensity and spectacle of Suzanne Collins’ world. Every element – from the staging to the technology – has been tailored to transport audiences right into the heart of the Games like never before.”When McPherson was announced as the adapter in October 2023, the production was scheduled to open in London in autumn 2024. A theatrical version of The Hunger Games, promising “innovative and immersive staging techniques”, hadfirst been heraldedby the film studio Lionsgate 10 years previously.View image in fullscreenLiam Hemsworth, Sam Clafin, Evan Ross and Jennifer Lawrence in the film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2.Photograph: Murray Close/APMcPherson said it had been “a great pleasure to watch the theatrical language of this show evolving through explosive workshops”. Director Matthew Dunster and choreographer Charlotte Broom, who have previously worked together at Shakespeare’s Globe and Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, are collaborating on what should be a highly physical production. The set will be designed by Miriam Buether, whose recent credits includeStranger Things: The First Shadowin the West End.Collins said that the play’s “dynamic staging gives the audience a brand-new way to experience the story”. Dunster called McPherson’s adaptation “taut and dangerous” and added that it “honours the young voice of Katniss Everdeen”, the rebellious character played on screen by Jennifer Lawrence.“As a dad to a teenager myself,” said McPherson, “it is especially gratifying working on a story whose values of resilience and moral courage speak to young people in these uncertain times.” Tickets forThe Hunger Games: On Stagewill go on sale on 27 March.The four Hunger Games novels have sold more than 100m copies. The fifth, a prequel calledSunrise on the Reaping, will be published next month. Its film adaptation is slated for November 2026.Explore more on these topicsTheatreLondonHunger GamesThe Hunger GamesConor McPhersonnewsShareReuse this content"

Some removed titles included August Wilson’s Pulitzer-prize winning play Fences and Innosanto Nagara’s A is for Activist, a picture book for children about social issues.Books featuring people of color were disproportionately targeted in all banned-book categories, the report found, especially in removed historical and biographical titles. Of such banned books, 44% included people of color; more than one-fourth, or 26%, of those books featured Black people.Advocates with PEN America noted that at the same time as the onslaught of book bannings, more than 50% of young people in the US are children of color, according to 2021 datafrom the Children’s Defense Fund.“This targeted censorship amounts to a harmful assault on historically marginalized and underrepresented populations – a dangerous effort to erase their stories, achievements, and history from schools,” said Sabrina Baêta, senior manager for PEN America’s Freedom to Read program, in a press release about the report. “When we strip library shelves of books about particular groups, we defeat the purpose of a library collection that is supposed to reflect the lives of all people. The damaging consequences to young people are real.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 10% of all removed titles included characters with physical, learning or developmental disabilities or who were neurodivergent. Several affected books with disabled characters focused on “confidence, self esteem, or experiences with ableism”, PEN America reported.Meanwhile, only 13% of removed titles included “on the page” instances of sexual experiences. Inferred or “off the page” instances of sexual encounters were included in 31% of banned books.The vast majority of banned books (85%) were fiction, with 14% being non-fiction and 1% poetry. About 67% of removed books were for younger audiences, PEN America reported.The ongoing banning of books comes as theTrump administrationhas cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in US public schools and universities.

This was not an Instagram influencer’s Ibiza pool party, however – it was Hilda Jackson’s 105th-birthday rave in herDerbyshirecare home.“I’ve had a wonderful time. The people here are wonderful and I think we’ve had a really good time,” Jackson said, her face decorated with UV paint. “I’ve enjoyed every minute of it, and that’s everything.“I think it’s been absolutely fabulous. I never expected this at all. I knew there’d be some [people] but not the amount of all the people who have come. And I’m very, very grateful to everyone that has come, [it’s] lovely.”View image in fullscreenJackson puts her long life down to being dealt a good hand with her health – but also to her love of dancing.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJackson has lived at Holbrook Hall residential home, near Belper, for about two and a half years. She was born and grew up in nearby Ripley, where she went to school and married her late husband, Walter.For part of her life she worked at the police headquarters and in hospitality doing silver service, and also worked at a factory in Ripley during the second world war, ironing uniforms. But in her free time, she liked nothing more than a spontaneous road trip with friends.“We used to travel a lot, go to different places, which I loved,” she said. “I could drive and I’d got a car, my friends and I used to go out, spend the day out, go and have a meal somewhere, we didn’t book anywhere, we just used to say: ‘We’ll go in here and have a meal’.“I never thought I would reach 105. I’m very pleased I have, because I don’t feel any different to when I was 100.”Reflecting on the current state of the world, Jackson said it “could be better”. “I can’t tell [leaders] what to do or what not to do,” she said. “Sometimes I wish that I could.”Jackson puts her long life down to being dealt a good hand with her health – but also to her love of dancing. “I’ve been very lucky with my health, and that is very important, your health,” she said. “I’ve not abused myself. I have a drink and I love a drink, but that’s it. I love ballroom dancing. I do go twice a week. I’m still dancing.“OK, not as much as I used to, but I get up on the floor and have a bit of a twirl round, and I love it.”Her favourite dance move, she said, was a jive. “I‘m not saying I like it as much as I used to, but your age catches up with you a little bit.”View image in fullscreen‘Just keep on enjoying your life, while you can,’ Jackson said.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOne of the things she had most been looking forward to about her party, she added, was having “a bit of a jig”. And when she came into the room after a round of media interviews, Jackson was straight up on the dancefloor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So we’re just really excited.”1:19Care home throws 'rave' for resident's 105th birthday – videoThe Nottingham-based rapper Bru-C had the residents up and dancing to drum’n’bass tunes, after his manager heard about the party on local radio and convinced him to get involved. “That was epic,” he said. “I can’t lie, I didn’t know what to expect, but it was actually really good. I enjoyed it a lot.”Last summer, he played the main stage at Reading and Leeds festivals. In some ways, he said, Jackson’s birthday party wasn’t all that different. “A show’s a show,” he said, “and it’s like, if you’re getting a good reception, I feel the same. I think [Hilda’s] a certified drum’n’bass raver now.”Hilda’s nephew, David Durow, 81, a retired psychologist, said when he had heard his aunt would like a rave for her birthday, he had thought: “Well, that fits in with you, with your general personality and your general love of life, the kind of things that you like to do.”However, he said, he had not expected such a “mind-blowing” party. “It’s absolutely wonderful, isn’t it?” he said, “I mean, this is actually going to put another 10 years on everybody’s life, isn’t it?”And what advice does Jackson herself have for younger generations? “Just keep on enjoying your life, while you can,” she said. “Don’t give up.

The independent production company was a great match forThe Brutalist, Brady Corbet’s Holocaust drama, which won four Baftas and will be a strong contender at the Oscars on Monday with 10 nominations.“We couldn’t imagineThe Brutalistbeing shot elsewhere,” said Viktória Petrányi, the Hungarian co-producer of the three-and-a-half-hour hit and Proton’s co-founder.Proton Cinema is behind multiple international movies such asMidsommar, a 2019 award-winning horror featuring Florence Pugh, and its co-founder Kornél Mundruczó’sPieces of a Woman.But unlike in many countries where film companies producing such blockbusters would expect generous state funding or fiscal incentives for at least a portion of their financial backing, the company’s domestic films are “mainly self-financed”, Petrányi said.Hungary’s National Film Institute (NFI), a government-controlled body, overwhelmingly sponsors movies that align with the rightwing ideology of Viktor Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party. Dávid Jancsó, the Oscar-nominated editor of The Brutalist, said: “Governments can decide whether to spend taxpayers’ money on propaganda films or on films that will win awards. InHungary, the decision was for propaganda movies.”View image in fullscreenShia LaBeouf and Vanessa Kirby in a scene from Pieces of a Woman, by the Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó.Photograph: Benjamin Loeb/APThe golden years of post-socialist Hungarian film were shaped by the film producer Andy Vajna. He emigrated from Hungary after the 1956 revolution and worked on the Die Hard and Terminator franchises before returning to Hungary as the Fidesz government’s commissioner tasked with the renewal of the national film industry from 2011.Jancsó said it was partly owing to Vajna’s work that Hungary raised “surprisingly many talented film-makers”, including the film director and screenwriterLászló Nemes, whoseSon of Saul(2015) won a Bafta for best foreign-language film.But after Vajna’s death in 2019, the semi-independent establishment dispersing governmental funding was replaced by the NFI, which operates directly under the auspices of the prime minister’s cabinet office and is controlled by a state nominee.Now, although Hungary is a sought-after destination for US, Asian and European film-makers for its picturesque locations, relatively well-built infrastructure and a 30% tax exemption, Hungarian creatives say they struggle to get their own ideas off the ground.Gone Running, a film released last year about a grieving mother who sets out to run a marathon, proved the most popular Hungarian movie since the fall of the iron curtain. But its director, Gábor Herendi, said it was filmed with minimal funding patched together from donations, favours and below-market wages, as the NFI refused the script.Herendi, who suspects he has been blocked from state funding, said this model of alternative funding was not sustainable. “The film was definitely made on a very tight budget, which doesn’t make for a good atmosphere,” he said.View image in fullscreenGéza Röhrig in Son of Saul, which won a Bafta for best foreign-language film.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/AllstarJancsó said one group disproportionately affected by the centralised financing was young artists, who struggle to secure a place in the well-paid government-funded productions.Andor Berényi, a young director whose first movie has not received NFI support, agreed. “They say this is the golden age of independent film. But this model doesn’t work for new directors, who can’t ask for favours or funding,” he said.Berényi suspects political reasons for the refusal to back his film, about a man turning to illegal activities to fund a spot in a care home for his father. He is now looking for a way to shoot it, even if only as a short film.“If someone wants to create art and express something about society, they won’t be silenced. They will share their story, even if it means going broke in the process,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The largest sum, 2.7bn forints, was awarded to a drama based on a rescue operation for Hungarian soldiers in Kabul in 2022, Operation Sámán, which is being filmed in cooperation with the Hungarian army.Other recipients of state funding are often historical works, which Dorottya Helmeczy, a producer at Megafilm, said were important for national identity. “Through historical films, we can find ourselves and our roots in the past,” she said.View image in fullscreenHenry Cavill in a scene from The Witcher, for which Fót, near Budapest, served as a backdrop.Photograph: Katalin Vermes/APMany of Helmeczy and Megafilm’s productions received funding from NFI. They include Fairy Garden, a series about the history of Transylvania, which belongs to Romania, and Peace – Above the Nations, a docudrama about a 1920 peace treaty that detached the territory from Hungary after the first world war.“Hungarian film production is not a self-sustainable system but one that requires state support,” Helmeczy said of films made for the Hungarian audience. She said these seldom generated significant profit in a country of 9 million people who are used to the standards of Hollywood blockbusters.At the opening ceremony for a studio in Fót, 30 minutes from Budapest, Orbán celebrated the capital’s status as the second most sought-after filming location in Europe. The government had invested 42bn forints (£87m) to expand the Fót site, which served as a backdrop forThe WitcherandPoor Things.“Film is not only an industry but also an art, and art is free,” Orbán said, adding that every Hungarian film-maker would profit from the expansion.NFI did not return a request for comment.This article was amended on 27 February 2025. Transylvania formally became part of Romania in 1920, not 1921; and this was following the first, not second, world war.Explore more on these topicsFilmHungaryEuropeThe BrutalistSon of SaulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How would you get your family out of a seventh-floor flat? How fast could you run? These hypothetical questions take on chilling reality for a Palestinian woman living under Israeli occupation in Gaza.Khawla Ibraheem’s unnervingly funny (at first) and slowly searing monologue could not be more relevant, although it was first conceived in 2014. That it feels so urgent more than a decade on is all the more tragic.Developed and directed by Oliver Butler, who previously directed Heidi Schreck’s Pulitzer prize-nominatedWhat the Constitution Means to Me, this too is delivered as a solo female testimony, whimsical at first, then throttling in its grip.Mariam (Ibraheem) is living with her elderly mother and young son inGazawhen war breaks out. The title is taken from the Israeli military protocol of forewarning civilians, five to 15 minutes before a bomb is dropped on their building, with a knock on their roof. Mariam imagines what this warning will mean: what if her child is asleep? What if her mother is in the shower? The principle of forewarning civilians within this timeframe has been debated in the recent Israel-Hamas conflict. This play shows us, woefully, what it means for Mariam.Mariam begins rehearsing her evacuation drill playfully at first. She is psychologically terrorised by war but this is not apparent: she teases the audience, muses on marriage and motherhood. It is not far off standup but the tone imperceptibly slides into darkness until Mariam is trapped in her rehearsals, setting timers and training for the run of her life with weights representing her son. The drills, increasingly obsessive and interspersed with a fearful waiting, seem Beckettian in their existential terror.Ibraheem, a Syrian actor living under Israeli occupation in the Golan Heights, performs with such control, precision and truth that entire streets come to life. So does Mariam’s home, neighbours, and the weight of her son in her arms. In one abject moment, she describes children on the street who are play-acting a funeral procession and it sums up generational trauma in a single image.There is only a chair on stage, as if the play itself can be packed away at short notice, while lighting, designed by Oona Curley, expands to fill the space along with Rami Nakhleh’s music and sound design.Like Schreck, Ibraheem focuses on the domestic and intimate but her story draws a much bigger picture of the indignities of occupation (the checkpoints, waiting for electricity, rushing to have a shower) and the terrifying plight of women strategising for the survival of their families in war. If a central purpose of theatre is to play out difficult conversations and breach divides, this devastating show is absolutely essential viewing.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Solo, he has variously spawned an entire sub-genre more or less singlehanded (the sample-heavy sound of his acclaimed 2007 albumPerson Pitcheffectively gave birth to chillwave), collaborated with Daft Punk,Solange, Paramore and Jamie xx, commissioned dub albums from On-U Sound’s Adrian Sherwood, and dabbled in a stark acoustic sound on 2019’sBuoys.View image in fullscreenPanda Bear: Sinister GriftLennox and Kember’s collaborative album,Reset, united two generations of psychedelic experimentalists in a charmingly playful musical dialogue. Among its delights was a track called Whirlpool. It sounded beatific and blissed-out, but on closer examination seemed to depict a failing relationship: Lennox later confirmed that his marriage to fashion designer Fernanda Pereira – who directed the videos that accompanied Reset – had collapsed.It’s tempting to view Whirlpool as a starting point for Lennox’s new album, Sinister Grift. Much as Lennox has cautioned against viewing it purely as an album about divorce – a kind of lysergicBlood on the Tracksfor Pitchfork readers – it’s hard not to. Lennox’s voice is stripped of the echo and electronic effects it’s frequently been coated with in the past: rather than simply one part of a disorienting wash of sound, it renders what he has to say very clear and direct, and there’s no getting around the fact that what he has to say sounds pretty despairing.“I can’t let go, can’t say goodbye / A residue in spite of you,” he sings on Anywhere But Here, while his daughter adds spoken-word vocals in Portuguese. “Thought we’d be friends again … we can, but we don’t,” go the lyrics to Ferry Lady. “The days we spent, now we don’t care … weren’t we saying our vow?”Initially at least, the lyrics are pitched against music that’s not just richly melodic, but incongruously sun-kissed. On Praise, bright melodies are thick with Beach Boys harmonies; there are relaxed rhythms that are Latin-infused (Ends Meet) or tinted with reggae (50mg), and the occasional hint of city pop, the lush disco-adjacent Japanese AOR of the early 80s. Just As Well features Lennox struggling to “get unstuck from the dark side” over a backing that sounds like a jaunty but forgotten mid-70s pop hit, the kind of thing that might have been belatedly exhumed for the soundtrack of Guardians of the Galaxy.But then, just after Sinister Grift’s midpoint, the album begins to shift: the tempo dramatically drops, the vague hint of melancholy that underpins even Animal Collective’s most euphoric moments – the slight scent of sadness that you catch during My Girls’ lovestruck paean to fatherhood, or Fireworks’ giddy chaos – seems to gradually overwhelm its sound.Venom’s In pitches a tune that sounds like a sigh against a backdrop of hazy guitar textures; Left in the Cold is foggier and chillier still. They turn out to be merely preparation for the six minutes plus of Elegy for Noah Lou, which recalls the late 60s albums on which the psychological wreckage wrought by the psychedelic era began washing up. Based around a repeated guitar figure that occasionally turns discordant, or threatens to break down amid splashes of synthesised white noise, it carries something of the fragile, halting quality of Skip Spence’s Oar or Syd Barrett’s The Madcap Laughs, and like those albums it has the uncomfortable feel of overhearing something rather than listening to it.This is a bold, risky way to sequence an album: listeners entranced by the pop smarts of its opening tracks may give up and turn Sinister Grift off as the whole thing dissolves into mournful, introspective and abstract territory, returning only to cherry-pick the more user-friendly moments for a playlist. But if you pay attention to the words, you can’t say Lennox didn’t warn you, and for those minded to stick with it, there’s something striking and believable about its emotional arc: you don’t have to be recently divorced to recognise the sensation of trying to gee yourself through tough times but instead being consumed by darkness and doubt.Psych-pop utopians Elephant 6: ‘Our plan was to humiliate the corporate rock industry’Read moreThe journey leaves the listener in an uncertain place. Closing track Defense is more muscular than the ghostly tones that immediately precede it, but something of Elegy for Noah Lou’s haunted, halting quality remains. The beat lumbers, and there’s a great guitar solo courtesy ofCanadian indie sensation Cindy Leethat would sound uplifting were it not slightly buried in the mix. “I’m trying to reset what’s inside my mind, the best place I can occupy,” Lennox sings. Then he repeats the line “here I come” over and over, a flicker of optimism at the end of a turbulent journey: tagging along is a curious and curiously powerful experience.This week Alexis listened toThe Limiñanas – Space BabyThe French duo’s latest album reaffirms their garage/psych credentials – it even includes a version of Louie Louie – while Space Baby has guest Jon Spencer on fabulously bug-eyed form.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockPsychedeliaAnimal Collectivealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’d be funny if you care deeply about the sport … but shouldn’t a comedy be able to make you laugh regardless?Lucy ManganThu 27 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 03.15 ESTShareAre you in the mood for a basketball comedy that has some leaden jokes and some even more leaden things to say about sexism and prejudice in the US industrial sports complex? Of course you’re not. Nobody is. But it’s here, it starsKate Hudsonand it’s called Running Point so let’s deal with it.Hudson plays Isla Gordon, one of four siblings whose father owned the Los Angeles Waves basketball team. Despite being the only one of Daddy Gordon’s children who is knowledgable about the game, she has been overlooked all her life. Why? Because she is a girl and the rest of them are boys! Cue a cutesy flashback in which a child actor delivers a Sorkinesque monologue about the team’s chances and her recommended player trades while trotting beside her father down a corridor of power, before having the door shut in her face as he enters another meeting room full of men in suits. She describes him, in what passes for a zinger in this sitcom, as an old-school “sexist asshole”. So she rebels in her teens and 20s, with a 20-day marriage and a photoshoot for Playboy.Now she and the scions are all grown up, Daddy’s dead and the boys have all the top jobs at the family firm. Cam (Justin Theroux) is a competent president and a handsome figurehead for the brand, Ness (Scott MacArthur) is general manager (after Daddy got Donald Rumsfeld to help him flee Manila after drug charges) and half-brother Sandy (Drew Tarver) is chief financial officer – smart, unathletic and, thanks to Daddy’s thoughts on the matter, still not fully comfortable with being gay. Isla is coordinator of the Waves’ charitable endeavours – a nice little job for a woman.Then, president Cam ploughs into a roadside cafe, narrowly missing a family of tourists while under the influence of the crack to which he is, among other things, addicted. “Yes, I love it, OK?” He steps down on medical grounds. “I need to fix this. Or at least learn how to hide it better.” Theroux is the best performer and this is the best line in the opening episode. I can’t do sporting metaphors but I think I can safely say that if it were any kind of ballgame, most spectators would be slumped on the bleachers longing for half-time by now.Anyway. Guess who big brother appoints to run the franchise in his absence? Yes, his baby sister. Because Sandy only knows numbers, Ness is too friendly with the players and Cam knows that she was unfairly overlooked by the patriarch. And the patriarchy, ladies – amirite?!So off we go, watching Isla girlboss her way out of tricky situations involving sponsors, lunkhead players – such as Travis (Chet Hanks), who says things like “I guess it’s take your sister to work day!” when he sees her and makes his Black teammates listen to his raps – and disrespectful star players such as Marcus (Toby Sandeman), who sends his social media manager and triple-wick candles from his wellness range to meetings in his stead.Soon she is also battling Ness and Sandy’s growing resentment of her and their objections to her way of handling the team and planning for the season. She wants to invest in their underperforming players, not trade for others and toss them aside! And she’ll do a much cleverer deal than the one they drew up the contract for and are telling her to sign, because don’t underestimate a woman! Or try to organise a no confidence vote with the board without her finding out and sweeping your legs out from under you! Further conflict ensues when news of an illegitimate fourth son emerges who, it turns out, has been working as a vendor in the Waves stadium for the past three years. The boys want to pay him off but she insists on welcoming him into the family, even if it will mean splitting their inheritance five instead of four ways. Women! They can be annoying, but you know they’re always morally right!Running Point is a grind. Everyone is working hard but it’s hardly working. A few half-smiles may be raised here and there. Maybe if you understand or care about basketball it’s funnier? But any comedy should be able to rise above the need for a bond with the ostensible subject (see football and Ted Lasso). Running Point does not.Running Point is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKate HudsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Divisions are evidently rife in this close-to-home version of Verona, but it is harder to distinguish how political schism applies to the two warring houses of Capulet and Montague – and the lovers caught in the crossfire.Working in collaboration with local companyThat’s a Rapand a young cast, director Corey Campbell augments this production’s modern vision with song – mostly rap but also soul and R&B – alongside Shakespeare’s text. The iambic pentameter is in place but so are beats, spoken word and musical breakouts.View image in fullscreenDelivering darkness … Romeo and Juliet, designed by Simon Kenny.Photograph: Nicola YoungIt is a high concept, designed to appeal to a younger audience perhaps, but the show starts off bumpily, with verse and song not quite joining up at the seams. The songs are prefaced with dialogue in modern-day parlance, which although full of fire, come across like scenes from another drama.Other nifty touches lift it, some of them immersive. The programme is a newspaper delivering the latest news of feuding. An audience vote asks us who we think is to blame for the violence of act three, which results in the deaths of Tybalt and Mercutio (my audience pointed the finger at the Montagues). Simon Kenny’s two-tiered set design makes evocative use of a choir on its upper deck.View image in fullscreenEmphatic … Mia Khan as Juliet.Photograph: Nicola YoungBut too many ideas jostle for air. Mobile screens are brought on to recap the story or flash up words in blockish print such as “VENGEANCE”. Some characters are dressed in uniforms that have indistinct period touches, adding to general muddiness around the concept.Kyle Ndukuba makes his professional stage debut as Romeo and overspills with energy. Mia Khan’s Juliet is just as emphatic. Both race through their lines, as if in a rush to get them out. Other characters gesticulate extravagantly, but the amplification of their microphones flattens out any nuance.Many early scenes feel overplayed, sometimes shouted, and the central romance is unconvincing. But there is a harnessing of energy and emotion after the interval and, from here on, the company delivers the darkness of the play with conviction and intensity. The peculiar screens are disposed of and the delivery of verse is better paced. Performances, both spoken and sung, are stronger too, the rap adding to the drama rather than distracting from it. Andre Antonio is especially compelling as Benvolio, delivering the final, incensed song over the bodies of the dead teenagers.Suddenly, it gains traction as a story about generational clash, the young rebelling against elders voting for Farage, to turn neighbour against neighbour.AtBelgrade theatre, Coventry, until 8 March.

On the line is a drunk Tory MP, claiming to be stuck in a Bayswater brothel with a woman he thinks might be a KGB agent, who has just demanded £500 “and left me in a room with twelve naked women and CCTV”.It sounds like something fromThe Thick of It, but for the chief whip to the last Conservative government, calls like this were all part of a day’s (or night’s) work.“Amongst today’s HR joys,” he writes later “is the report from Emma [his special adviser] that a departmental spad went to an orgy over the weekend and ended up taking a crap on another person’s head. To make matters worse, in a separate incident a House employee went to a party dressed as Jimmy Savile and ended up having sex with a blow-up doll for which he has been subsequently dismissed.”That this was light relief compared with some of what he dealt with underlines the diaries’ central message: that something has gone so wrong with the system by which people are selected, mentored and trained for parliament that running the country well has become almost impossible. Hart, who lost his seat in 2024, wants to show how “a relatively small cohort of people … knowingly made things so hard that what tiny chances we had of a fifth term were extinguished”. He does not, I suspect, mean the brothel-goers so much as the band of Brexiters, “oblivious to the numerical realities of what they were demanding” who – along with the former home secretary Suella Braverman – emerge particularly badly from this account. And if the wrong people make it into the Commons, wait till you see the pipeline to the Lords: Hart almost called his diaries “About My Knighthood”, given the amount of time absorbed by MPs trying to wangle honours for themselves.This highly readable book is unusual in that, while its author served in cabinet for more than four years – as Welsh secretary under Boris Johnson and chief whip under Rishi Sunak – it is less an account of government than of what power did to the Conservative party, and thus to the rest of us. If you can’t quite place Hart, a One Nation-ish hunting and shooting type who used to run the Countryside Alliance, the portfolios he held were backroom ones taking him deep inside the plumbing and wiring of government. As Welsh secretary he was in on the big pandemic meetings, liaising with the devolved administration on lockdown rules. Later, as chief whip, he had a ringside seat on incessant plotting against various leaders, much of which sounds like something from a bygone age. (At one point during Johnson’s downfall, he writes of spiriting the chair of the 1922 Committee – keeper of the letters of no confidence from backbenchers which can trigger a leadership election – off shooting in Scotland “to keep [him] away from his inbox and buy some precious time”.)Hart has a brilliant eye for moments of high farce: Jacob Rees-Mogg descending a zip wire in a tweed three-piece suit; Thérèse Coffey wanting to wheel-clamp people for Covid non-compliance; Kemi Badenoch existing in a “permanent state of outrage” that’s exhausting for everyone; Liz Truss’s spad explaining “the mayonnaise situation” (apparently she won’t eat anything containing mayonnaise, and will only drink Pret coffee). As for Lee Anderson, crowned deputy party chair only to defect to Reform, Hart writes: “I have tried to avoid the conclusion that he is a total knob but he has made it nearly impossible.”Even allowing for the cabinet office’s red pen running through all ministerial memoirs, this one is remarkably discreet about both the substance and the deeper emotions of what actually happened inside government, skating strangely lightly over the surface of the pandemic in particular. Though Hart is plainly furious with Dominic Cummings over the latter’s not-quite-apology for his now infamous day trip to Barnard Castle, when the first stories start circulating about lockdown parties in Whitehall, he judges partygate “an odd story that I don’t think is resonating with the public”. Is having a beer with colleagues you’ve worked with all day really so bad, he wonders?Instead, what begins as a diary intended as a lighthearted record for his children descends into something infinitely darker: a succession of entries about serious sex offences allegedly committed by MPs, and distressed victims seeking help that whips patently aren’t trained to give. The whips’ job, he writes, is less dark arts than field-hospital surgery, constantly patching up damaged people and sending them back to the front.As an enforcer of discipline he seems empathetic, seeing most of the mess he has to sweep up as the consequence of “human frailties” and troubled people imploding under pressure. His is also one of the kinder portraits of working with Johnson I’ve read, presenting his downfall more as tragedy than scandal, though it still may not find favour in the former prime minister’s household. If you’ve ever wondered who started all those rumours about Carrie Johnson meddling, Lady Macbeth-like, in policy, it seems mostly to have been her husband, who in this account is forever moaning to colleagues behind her back. In one particularly wince-inducing vignette, Hart describes the PM chastising Scottish secretary Alister Jack for insisting that grouse shooting resume after lockdown because it’s led to wildlife-loving Carrie giving him grief: “to which AJ retorted ‘Well I’m sorry if you didn’t get your oats this weekend, PM, but this is the right decision.’”But to its key question of why so many rogues end up in parliament, the book offers few explicit answers. This is somewhat puzzling given that Hart was responsible for party discipline and candidate vetting, and his own deputy Chris Pincher resigned over having drunkenly groped two men – a scandal that ultimately finished off the prime minister. (What did for Johnson was MPs’ fury that he’d given a man he’d once allegedly described as “Pincher by name, Pincher by nature” power over other MPs: Hart thinks it “implausible” Johnson hadn’t heard the rumours, but doesn’t elaborate on what he himself knew, or how the appointment was agreed.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the diary, Hart writes that of course “it was stupid and inappropriate, but I can’t help thinking if he was a factory worker he would get a written warning and sent on a course”. If an MP watching porn in sight of female colleagues, when he’s meant to be representing his constituents, is not seen as a deal-breaker by the chief whip, is he halfway to answering his own question about why the wrong people get on?Though the diary entries are interspersed with short retrospective reflections, a perfect opportunity to suggest reforms, none are forthcoming.

This real-life drama may be cheesy at times, but it is a life-changing story that very much needs to be toldJack SealeThu 27 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareCorby, Northamptonshire, 1995: the disused steelworks that were once the heartbeat of the town are to be redeveloped into housing and a theme park. As the land is cleared, a crimson dust that will later be shown to contain cadmium and other highly toxic substances is stirred up; open-topped trucks full of the stuff career past unknowing residents to a messy landfill. And so the scene is set for Toxic Town, a true-story drama about a very British scandal.Susan McIntyre’s partner works at the site, while Tracey Taylor is an accountant there who has to sluice thick red sludge off her car every evening when she goes home. Susan (Jodie Whittaker) and Tracey (Aimee Lou Wood) meet on a maternity ward, before both give birth to children with disabilities. When Susan realises other women nearby have had similar outcomes, she starts a campaign for justice. Meanwhile, concerns raised within the council about poisonous soil are silenced with bribes and bullying by senior figures who won’t allow anything to jeopardise the construction project, which had a dodgy tendering process. It’s not until 2009 that Susan and co are able to demonstrate council negligence and achievea landmark court victory.In the darker moments here, there are flashes of the bleak malevolence of Red Ridingor Sherwood. Cause trouble for the greasy-lipped men in double-breasted suits and they will send thugs in donkey jackets to smash up your car; threaten them with legal consequences for corruption and the building with all the evidence in it will mysteriously catch fire.But, however distressing the facts of the case, Toxic Town feels a responsibility to ensure its audience sticks it out. So, ultimately, this is a bittersweet feelgood piece, more along the lines of Britflicks such asPride, Brassed Off and The Full Monty, where ordinary people suffer in deindustrialised towns that have intractable problems, but score a win by supporting each other. The shape of the drama is familiar; cosy, even.At times, it spoon-feeds us. At the end of a scene, where soon-to-be-pregnant Maggie (Claudia Jessie) hangs her husband’s discarded work jeans on the rotary airer in the back garden and beats the dust out of them with a badminton racket, perhaps we don’t need a slow-motion shot of malignant particles mushrooming into the air. When the dispute reaches court, the barrister representing the council doesn’t have to be so eyeball-swivellingly malicious. The property developer who makes his fortune while his home town suffers could be less of a grinning cartoon villain.Similarly, the wider importance of the story is not allowed to get lost in subtext. Toxic Town is about fighting back against politics that prioritises “profits over people” and if you didn’t twig that on your own, the script has one of the good guys use that exact phrase. It’s concerned with how “red tape” is a term used only by shysters, because it always means measures that hinder moneymen from shafting working people – again, this is spelled out in the dialogue.The show is moral about not letting greed trample community. Despite this being illustrated by a struggle that concluded a decade and a half ago, Toxic Town feels fresh. It arrives only a year afterMr Bates vs the Post Officeturned an against-the-odds fight for justice into the biggest drama on TV (the campaign’s first public meeting, where the mothers realise their strength in numbers, has heavy Bates vibes) and lands in a political moment where leaders of various stripes are pretending thatslashing regulationsis an urgent public concern.All that being the case, the occasional cheesiness of Toxic Town doesn’t matter, especially when the writer, Jack Thorne, is so careful to mine this dire situation for nuggets of precious humanity. The emotional journey undergone by parents of disabled children, as they fight the instinct to believe that they are at fault and try to improve their children’s lives without treating them as a problem, is sensitively sketched. The difficulty for wronged individuals in taking a stand, when powerful enemies have ensured that doing so will come at great cost, is explored and acknowledged. The friendship between the two central characters – the sharp, belligerent and often scathingly funny Susan orbiting around Tracey’s quiet wisdom – is perfectly performed by an obviously award-worthy Whittaker and a less demonstrative but equally brilliant Wood, who can convey all Tracey’s determination and smothered pain with a curve of a sad smile.For the people involved – while some characters are fictional, Whittaker, Wood and Jessie play real women – this was a life-defining fight that deserves to be celebrated. If Toxic Town turns it into an easy dramatic win, it is forgiven.Toxic Town is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJodie WhittakerAimee Lou WoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Carrion Crow may be set in a fetid late Victorian London and couched in lightly brocaded prose, but what lurks within is unmistakably red in tooth and claw, a creature nearer in kinship toKathy Ackerthan toSarah Waters.The body undergoing the horrors belongs, in this instance, to Marguerite Périgord, the daughter of a French noblewoman in reduced circumstances. When the wayward Marguerite attracts a suitor, a strenuously unromantic solicitor named Mr Lewis, Cécile Périgord isn’t taking any chances. In a show of aristocratic mettle, she imprisons Marguerite in the attic, there to acquire the complexion and manners her wifely vocation will require.It’s at this point that we begin to see what Parry is up to. InThe Madwoman in the Attic, scholars Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar distilled the whole of the 19th-century novel into a singularly potent archetype. This literary ideal of womanhood was embodied not in the sprightly piety of Jane Eyre but in the dark cipher of the former Mrs Rochester.This feminine ideal functions like negative space, demarcating the bounds of the permissible. As in the transgressive fictions of Acker, it is a domineering mother who provides the oppressive impetus, having long ago reached her own bitter accommodation with the patriarchy. Cécile shuts her daughter in with a copy of one of Mrs Beeton’s guides, and Marguerite – having little else to occupy her – is soon reciting entire passages from memory.If it oozes, flakes or erupts from the human frame, it is almost certainly described hereMrs Beeton proves an unexpectedly radicalising influence. Marguerite, you see, is a creature of robust appetites, and in Mrs Beeton’s more eye-watering recipes – for jellied calf brains, say – she senses the proximity of a kindred spirit. One can’t but form the impression, dipping into Mrs Beeton, that the civilising project is a curiously offal-centric business. And for the perpetually ravenous Marguerite, it’s a cause she can really get behind. Mrs Beeton has much to say, too, about nutritional requirements. When an animal is kept on a low diet, the guide warns, “the stomach soon becomes deranged”. This is no abstract point. Marguerite finds that her appetite has indeed diminished, since her lackadaisical jailer is often remiss about mealtimes. She grows emaciated, and soon enough even her bountiful monthly bleeds falter and abate. The loss is mournfully noted then briskly dismissed. After all, she will be free to gorge herself after the wedding.Marguerite is eager to marry because it will provide cover for an illicit liaison; the true object of her affections is a splendidly debauched demi-mondaine named Alouette. It is enough to win our sympathy, certainly, but Parry is soon hemmed in again by her own allusive schema. Marguerite may pine for her Alouette, but that is not her undoing. What drives her to madness, rather, is grasping exactly what is required of her. Far from being appalled at her own physical decline, Marguerite exults in the transformation: she had lost almost all of herself, “ready to fill her body up again in the shape of a married woman”. This is crazy talk, plainly, but it serves its programmatic purpose. The madwoman in the attic is a creature not of fiction but of literary theory. And if her madness is entirely the construct of her milieu, it cannot also be attributed to mere narrative pretext.This dissonance muddies Marguerite’s human motives, which seem to mingle with archetypal forces, but we are carried past this and other cavils by the sheer antic energy of Parry’s project. Deprived of any other agency, Marguerite tests the limits of her body’s mutability. Finding that her hairpins prick her as she sleeps, she eats and later expels them, “each one bringing a satisfied smile to Marguerite’s face as it tinged off the chamber pot”. By way of a wretched dirty protest, she then hammers the pins into the ceiling.There is much worse to come as Marguerite sets about her self-destructive rampage. Shorn of all dignity, she brings about a martyrdom of debasement and self-harm. If it oozes, flakes or erupts from the human frame, it is almost certainly described here, and in glistening detail. Parry can write with an easy grace, but for the most part she denies herself the luxury. All Marguerite wants is “to feel adult and fecund”, but all she hears is that she is “not quite delicate enough”. Carrion Crow isn’t anyone’s idea of delicate, either, but it is richly fecund and adult in every sense of the word.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s all perfect for contemplating ancient yarns, spotting wildlife and enjoying local fareKevin RushbyThu 27 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 08.01 ESTShareIn the silence of the chestnut woods, rays of sunlight ignite the patches of pink cyclamen and crocus. There are fungi of various kinds dotted around, including one that is a perfect sphere of bright orange pushing its way up out of earth. I sit on a rock and after a while I hear a gentle grunting noise, the sort of contented chunter made by a snorer having a light snooze. It’s not me. A pair of wild boar are approaching, moving through the shadows, noses down, short tails flicking continuously. It’s a mother and baby, so close I can see the dust on their backs. I move my hand towards the camera, but wily Old Ma spots the movement and they take off at a blistering pace, charging downhill, bristling with indignation.Map of western Cilento and SalernoI continue walking uphill, and after a mile or so stop at a paw print in a patch of mud. Large dog or wolf? There are no human boot marks that might accompany a canine. Nor is there anyone around to ask. Eventually, I reach a viewpoint on top of Monte Stella, the highest summit for many miles at 1,131 metres. Out west is the dark surface of the Tyrrhenian Sea whereOdysseus reputedly battled his way home from Troy, narrowly surviving temptation by the dreaded Sirens at an island, Isola Licosa, just hidden from my view by the curve of the coastline. I can see as far as the distant ragged peninsula of Amalfi on the northern horizon but there are no ships in sight. I am alone.Finding solitude in Italy is not always so simple. The population density is lower than Britain or Germany, but its 59 million residents are host to about the same number of tourists each year, most heading for some of the world’s most desirable honeypots, drawn in by the siren voices of social media.View image in fullscreenOn Monte Stella, Kevin Rushby met forest workers hauling chestnut logs with mules.Photograph: Kevin RushbyHigh on those selfie bucket lists is Amalfi, that same distant mountainous peninsula that I can see from my perch on the mountaintop. Out there, while I sit contemplating the chances of seeing a wolf, the locals leave home before 8am for most of the year because after that time the streets are too packed to walk anywhere. In the central beauty spot ofPositano, I am reliably informed, one entrepreneur is asking for €500 (£415) a day for the best beach location and umbrella. My shade, under a carob tree, comes free.I had started out a couple of days earlier at the pretty seaside town of Agropoli where old men were playing cards over their breakfast coffee on the beachfront. Before setting out on the footpath south, I stepped into the local supermarket expecting to find fast-food snacks in garish packaging. Instead, I found myself in a delightful family-run delicatessen serving a range of local produce from artichokes to courgettes. I stocked up on fresh bread, olives and cheese.The path I am following curls southwards through what isCilento national park, one of the largest in the country, covering a long stretch of craggy coastline, a mountainous interior and hundreds of small villages. It’s a fairly easy route to follow – I’m guided by travel firmOn Foot’s well-designed map app – and almost deserted as a path. In five days of walking, I meet only a few local people, plus one German couple and a solitary Canadian.AtSan Giovanni vineyard, I stop to sample the wine and get a plate of delicious local pancetta and cheeses. When I ask the name of the cheeses, I’m told: “We just know them by the name of the farm they come from.” The wine is organic and very good although production last year was low. “We had hot, humid conditions, which are not ideal.”View image in fullscreenPollica has glorious views of the Cilento coast.Photograph: Giulio Ercolani/AlamyI dispel any post-lunch fuzziness with a dip in the sea at the first beach I come to, then take a steep, twisting path inland, climbing to the mountain village of Castellabate, an outrageously gorgeous tiny village whose stony alleyways are so labyrinthine that I get disoriented, forcing me to ask the way and discover that I am standing next to my hotel, itself part of the lovely maze.The only sound in the woods is the cackle of jays. At one stream a grass snake slithers awayNext morning I refuse the offer of a lift back to the coast (the views are too good) which the path follows all the way to a point overlooking Licosa. The are no Sirens to be seen or heard, no sea-roving Greeks, either, in fact no one at all.I now leave the coast – not to return for a few days – and head up into the forest, passing a lovely avenue of ancient carobs, then climbing to a pair of 13th-century lookout towers. My final destination is Rocca Cilento, another mountaintop village with castle, this time in the guesthouse of Paolo and Concetta, who prove to be great informants on the history of the place – Paolo having grown up in the same house.“There used to be a lot of people in the village,” he says. “Maybe 1,000 all year round. Chestnuts were the big thing. We’d grind them up in the water mills to make flour. And we kept pigs to make prosciutto.” He tries to keep up tradition, making his own wine and growing most of the vegetables, but the population has plummeted to below 100.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This area has suffered from bouts of emigration, starting in the 19th century when people left for America and most recently in the 1950s when cities such as Milan and Naples lured them away. The only sound in the woods is the cackle of jays. At one stream a grass snake slithers away.When I climb up into the chestnut woods, I start to meet locals. There are two men riding mules up to wherethey are coppicing a groveof sweet chestnut trees. I watch as they hitch up the felled trees and the mules haul them away. They are friendly and I join in, running after the animals when they escape.Acciaroli was Ernest Hemingway’s favourite Italian resort and it’s easy to see whyI go over Monte Stella and down to an agriturismo, a farm that has a tourist element (the official rule is at least half the income should be agriculture). This one is run by Luisa, who came here 40 years ago, before there was a road, and built the business up.My last walk is down to the coast. Now the villages seem quieter, with more holiday cottages. In Pollica, I sit down for a coffee and bump into the local mayor, Stefano. “The problem here is that we get a massive influx of visitors in August, but very few otherwise. I’m trying to carry on the work of Angelo and make people realise that Cilento is wonderful all year round.”View image in fullscreenKevin Rushby walked down to the beautiful seaside village of Acciaroli from Pollica.Photograph: Giulio Ercolani/AlamyAngelo Vassallo was his predecessor, shot dead by a gunman in 2010. It’s thought he may have blocked the award of building contracts to Camorra-affiliated companies.Finally the footpath drops down to the coast road and I walk along a shingled beach into Acciaroli. In the 1950s, this wasErnest Hemingway’s favourite Italian resort and though the hotel he stayed in has long closed, it’s easy to see why the writer loved it. There’san old castle, a clutch of houses and several decent cafe-bars where the locals socialise. It feels rather old fashioned, as if the writer might stroll in and order one of his favourite Italian tipples, a Montgomery (15 parts gin, 1 part vermouth).Another American who came here, after the second world war, was Ancel Keys, a nutritionist drawn by discovery that the locals were extremely long-lived. Keys settled in Pioppi, a coastal village near Acciaroli, where there’s now a museum that includes his study and library. After careful analysis, he eventually concluded, rather disappointingly, that the key to longevity was “the Mediterranean diet”, rather than drinking Montgomeries.Kevin travelled to Cilento by train.

So how did they become so popular with fitness enthusiasts and lifestyle gurus?Zoe WilliamsThu 27 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 09.14 ESTShareHow did something as transparently dirty as cured meat enter the temple of clean? The American “meat stick” industry – mainly cured beef sticks that are awesomely calorific – hit $3bn last year. In the UK, processed meat snacking products havegrown in sales by 38%since 2020, and are projected to pick up another 49% percent by 2027. The puzzle is not “are they tasty?” or “are they convenient?” We know they are, but so is a Snickers. Rather, how did a category that we’ve known for years is actively bad for your health come to be the snacking choice of gymgoers and lifestyle gurus alike?Scientifically questionable meat-heavy diets come and go (remember theAtkins diet?) but in 2018, conservative guru Jordan Peterson went on Joe Rogan’s podcast to talk about his book 12 Rules for Life, and – complimented by Rogan on his physique – said in passing he now ate only beef, salt and water. And he never cheated. The “animal products only” Carnivore Diet, by orthopaedic surgeon Shawn Baker, was published at the same time.View image in fullscreen‘In the world of fitness, protein targets are nudging towards the impossible.’Photograph: PM Images/Getty ImagesA year later, the Annals of Internal Medicine in the US published an astonishing study which recommended “that adultscontinue current processed meat consumption”. It was astonishing because, in the maelstrom of conflicting dietary advice – red wine prevents cancer, it gives you cancer, tomatoes are good for you, they also give you cancer, etc – science had long been pretty settled on processed meats. There were still question marks overnitrates and nitrites, which are so prevalent in meat processing, and whether or not they could be isolated as the root of the problem. But until that study, most people agreed that processed meat was bad for you. Federica Amati, head nutritionist at the Zoe app, and nutrition topic lead at Imperial College London School of Medicine, gives a whistlestop tour of the health risks of processed meats: “Dextrose is a high-glycemic ingredient that increases blood sugar levels and can lead to dehydration in high amounts. N-nitroso compounds are cancer-causing substances believed to be responsible for some of the adverse effects. They are formed from nitrite (sodium nitrite) that is added to processed meat products. They’re high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and they’re a class one carcinogen, known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer.”View image in fullscreenMen are said to struggle between convenience foods and healthy eating.Photograph: Hispanolistic/Getty Images“The mechanism is less interesting than the certainty,” says Chris Van Tulleken, author of Ultra-Processed People. “The evidence is very clear that processed meats elevate your risk of heart disease and other negative outcomes. It’s dose-dependent: the more you eat, the greater the harm. That is mediated, probably, through saturated fat, which is seriously bad for you; salt, which is seriously bad for you; and their energy density. We know that energy-dense soft food promotes weight gain. It’s probably not simply because they’re tasty – ‘tasty’ is not a very formal word, so we can’t answer that precisely with research; it’s because they’re not satisfying. So you’ll eat them quicker than you could feel full.” The data was in, in other words, and yet the debate remained alive.In fact, doubts were cast on that journal article pretty fast, when it was discoveredthe same week(October 2019) that one of the authors hadties to the meat industry. But TikTok and the wider manosphere – social media spaces populated by young bros looking for answers – didn’t seem to care about conflicts of interest. The “lion diet”, for example, which entails eating only the meat of ruminant animals, gained prominence online as the answer to everything: it could reduce inflammation, promote weight loss, solve skin complaints, improve mood. Basically, it could give you the constitution of a lion, and have you ever truly looked at one of those creatures in his own habitat? Is he not majestic? Does he look depressed to you? He does not. The videos, particularly from the UK, are often unbelievably gross: pale young men frying up boxes of the cheapest imaginable mince with cubes of beef fat (and who the hell knows where they came from), proclaiming that it kept them going all day for £1.30.View image in fullscreen‘Beef jerky can be quite lean, so that’s OK,’ says author Chris Van Tulleken.Photograph: Juanmonino/Getty ImagesBut it was not all gym bros. High-protein, zero-carb diets were still discreetly popular in what we might call the Anna Wintour constituency –she famously only atesteak and caprese salad, minus the tomatoes, for lunch. Amati describes these different generational attitudes: “My female clients over the age of 40 struggle to stop pinning their health on how thin they are. Thin equals healthy for them, and they often don’t eat enough food. My younger female clients are often fearful of food; many have tried elimination diets, undertaken unnecessary fasting regimes or removed food groups without a nutrition professional advising them or supporting them, and it’s sad to see how much fear certain influencers can cause.” So that’s the female meat-snack market in a nutshell: gen X still chasing the keto dream, while millennials and gen Z take a more … well, “neurotic” is a strong word; let’s call it the quest of the terminally online for everything to just work better.Amati continues: “My male clients have less of a divide between generations, but they struggle with convenience and are often set unnecessarily high protein targets, which they then struggle to achieve without eating protein snacks and drinking high-protein drinks. What’s worrying is that more often than not, even young men in their 30s already present with cardiovascular risk factors like high LDL [a type of cholesterol] or elevated blood pressure.”View image in fullscreenAndy Rogers, who runs North by Sud-Ouest charcuterie.Photograph: Andrew & Dot RogersWhat’s extraordinary about this picture is not so much how our social and existential anxieties are mediated through food – although for sure, that’s something to think about – but how it all drives inexorably towards one single food: the processed meat stick or nugget. If you’re cutting out carbs to stay thin, there are very few foods you can eat as a snack. Even many vegetables areverboten. There is a side-category of twitchy gen X-er the kids call the “almond mum” (short version: whatever you ask for, you’ll get almonds), but really, all roads lead to chorizo (which saw a28% increase in saleslast year, in the UK).Meanwhile, in the world of fitness, protein targets are nudging towards the impossible: if you take a weight-based approach, medics agree that 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is fine, but most muscle-building advice would take one gram per kilo as a bare minimum, going up to two grams if you’re younger and training for an event, or if you’re older and trying to build muscle. You often see calculations based on men weighing 70kg and women weighing 60kg, but average weights are much higher than that: per the NHS’s figures in 2021, themean weights of men and women, based on adjustments to self-reported weight, were 85.1kg and 71.8kg respectively. And 170g of pure protein a day is not easily done – a classic service-stationbeef stickis only 16% protein, and almost all the rest is fat.Van Tulleken is more fair-minded, and points out: “Beef jerky can be quite lean, so that’s OK. It’s proteinatious, and protein is not bad for you, although people don’t need as much protein as the fitness industry often implies. It’s better than a chocolate bar; it might not have too much salt. The problem is, the lean, fairly low-salt dry beef becomes the poster child for the shitty, fatty version that’s covered in maltodextrin and sugar. So you can have a product that’s fine, and it ends up representing a category that is not fine.”View image in fullscreenSpanish pigs grazing among oaks and acorns.Photograph: Ivanb-photo/Getty ImagesIt would be outrageous, though, to brush past those products thatarefine. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall makes his own charcuterie and has run courses doing so at River Cottage. He says, “These are, at their best, irresistible products.” There’s something about the time and imagination that goes into meat curing that unlocks the mystery of taste itself. You can tell what kind of life the animal lived, what it ate, where it hung out, who it was. “A slower grown animal,” he continues, “you’ve got more fat on it to play with, because it will have needed to put that on to protect it from the weather. That’s why you turn to old breeds that are well bristled and grow slowly. You’ll get marbling on that meat – the eye of a loin on an outdoor pig will have marbling, flecks of fat, like beef.”The lean, fairly low-salt dry beef becomes the poster child for the fatty version that’s covered in maltodextrin and sugarAndy Rogers, who runsNorth by Sud-Ouestwith his wife in New Ferry, Wirral, won the World Charcuterie award in 2023 and the BBC Food Programme’s best producer last year. He works on whole pigs, one at a time, “because it means they’re not part of some industrial production line. They’ve been rooting around and having a nice life.” He makes two products from the head alone, afromage de têtenose-to-tail terrine, “a fancy French brawn that I ripped off my old boss in France”. And then on through the length of the loin, which he makes into a coppa, to the tougher, sinewy hock parts, that’ll be cooked into a cotechino. If he sells out, which he did after the food awards, it’s two months before he can restock, because these products take as long as they take. Although Rogers is reluctant to mythologise the complexity of the cured meat – “I’m not sure you can taste the acorns they’ve been eating” – he falls into an elegy when he tries to describe it. “That Spanish stuff is a class apart. The actual Bellota pigs who’ve been trotting round in a massive range, eating acorns in season, having to walk five miles to get water, they’ve got a really distinct, musty, nutty thing going on. They can age that so long because it’s so suffused with fat. That product is unrecreatable.”View image in fullscreenNorth by Sud-Ouest charcuterie’s nose-to-tail terrine.Photograph: Andrew & Dot Rogers“Curing meat privately, or at restaurant scale,” Fearnley-Whittingstall says, “you don’t have to use any additives at all, you can do that with salt.” It’s still going to have high amounts of many of the wrong things, but you just wouldn’t sweat it, any more than you would “try to regulate homemade brownies”, Van Tulleken says. “You can’t make them delicious enough and you don’t make them often enough, and when you want to binge on them, you have to make them. The issue is the industrial process. The cheap ham and bacon is a massive source of saturated fat, salt, a lot of it is quite sugary, and it’s probably also associated with other harmful factors like low incomes and generally poor diet.” Plus, you couldn’t make yourself long-term ill on high-quality cured meat because you’d go bankrupt first.What’s happened with processed meat is a microcosm of how the risk-aversion of regular capitalism in fact creates greater risk, insofar as the “health and safety hoops to sell meat commercially demand the nitrates”, Fearnely-Whittingstall says. “If it’s going off the premises and into the world, it can only do that with the belt and braces of additives.” Meanwhile, the anxieties of late capitalism drive completely counter-productive behaviours; fixated on finding individuated answers to an obesogenic and carcinogenic environment created by corporations, we end up eating the very thing that makes us fat and gives us cancer. It’s actually pretty wild! But also, very tasty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in dark corners hidden from guests is its cruel and seedy underbellyHannah SelingerThu 27 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2025 10.10 ESTShareIwas working at Jean-Georges, the petite and bourgeois restaurant tucked into Trump’s building on Columbus Circle, just off Central Park, where the sounds and smells ofNew Yorkfaded into the austere dining room. It was a room of extravagances small and large.There’s no pleasure in a four-star dining room, no joviality. You can’t be jocular with your fellow servers. There’s no room for error. A server is not permitted to do the following: wear colored nail polish; cross hands in front of the body; slouch; speak on the floor; carry a glass from the bar to the table without a tray; show visible tattoos; wear hair in an inappropriate manner (this can be at the discretion of a manager); touch a glass by any part except the stem; pour wine in the incorrect order; spill; laugh.One of the more arresting displays took place when Philippe Vongerichten, the restaurant’s general manager and brother of its executive chef, came through with a pineapple. There, in the gray light, Philippe would pierce the end of the fruit with two forks and hoist it into the air, carving ravines into its sides before setting it ablaze with kirsch.This was the kind of performative act that looked better than it tasted. It was, after all, just a very expensive pineapple, and that’s how I felt about most of the food at the restaurant: it was pretty, if a little uninteresting.I had landed a two-week stage as a sommelier, and hoped the job would lead to a full-time gig at the group’s downtown restaurant, Perry St, a cooler, more chic spot that very much felt like a place where I would fit in. But here, the mood was stodgy. In the dining room: no leaning. Business was conducted at a whisper. If a guest got up to use the restroom, one did not fold a napkin in absentia, as was protocol in nearly every other restaurant in fine dining. Instead, that napkin was removed. This dirty thing! A new one appeared, folded beside the plate, as if by magic, before the guest re-emerged.There is a difference between restaurants that receive two or three stars from the New York Times and restaurants that receive four. At restaurants that receive four, like Jean-Georges, waiting tables is a career because the money allows it. The job was demanding, but it offered rewards in return. This was not an entry-level restaurant job, and people in the industry understood the level of discipline and professionalism required. If you’re used to working in fine dining, like I was, the transition to top-tier can be brutal.But if you love service – or are, as I was, addicted to the inherent charms of restaurants – you couldn’t help but love this one, with its old school customs and extreme technique. To enter the dining room was to enter another world, which is, at its core, what fine dining is all about: transportive experience. To be in there, among the most expensive wines in the world, with the carts and tableside plating, the French-style service and the whisper-quiet, was to be in elite company.He wanted me to accompany him into his secret, private life, away from the restaurant. How could I possibly decline?Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the critically acclaimed Alsatian chef responsible for the restaurant, was himself a perfectionist. Had I ever seen another place like this, where food was produced, yes, but where, in truth, there was no grimy proof of it, no accidental leak of ketchup, no grease trap overflowing on occasion, no tipping over of a tray or sticky floor that betrayed months – if not years – of old food? There was no cacophony, no clang of pots, no shouting or anger or indication of the stress that comes when the printer is operating on overdrive.For all its formality, Jean-Georges set its pastry chef, Johnny Iuzzini, loose in the final course. The Dover sole was still deboned, plated and sauced tableside. But the dessert? It flew off in a million directions, a weird symphony of flavor and colors.It was always a surprise when it was plated on a square vessel with four quadrants, the most avant-garde part of the meal. Sometimes these quadrants were ingredient-themed, and other times they were seasonally inspired. Consider a rumination on rhubarb: in one quadrant, a birch beer soft-serve ice cream, served in a tiny glass with carbonated strawberry-rhubarb consommé. In another, a rhubarb panna cotta with dried rhubarb powder. Then, a jade green matcha cake, surrounded by hibiscus and red wine–poached rhubarb. Finally, an orb of crispy rhubarb cheesecake, topped with a dollop of raspberry puree.Guests lost their minds over these desserts. New York Magazine’s profile fawned over the chef, who admitted to such an aggressive sugar addiction that, by 2003, he had worn down his teeth and was replacing his veneers every year; he was only 29 at the time. Unlike the straitlaced servers on the floor, he was slick, with a gelled pompadour, a Ducati and a gig spinning as a DJ downtown.Johnny Iuzzini began his career at Jean-Georges in 2002 after working under François Payard for several years at Daniel and Café Boulud. A year after beginning at Jean-Georges, Iuzzini won the James Beard award for outstanding pastry chef. Two years later, he would publish his first book, calledDessert FourPlay: Sweet Quartets from a Four-Star Pastry Chef. That was one year after I met him in the basement of the restaurant, where he operated a glossy pastry kitchen, as well as a fully refrigerated chocolate locker, where he created the final tastes of the evening: handcrafted chocolates.On the first or second day of my stage, I had been sent downstairs to meet with him by the director of operations to learn more about the restaurant’s pastry program, down to the bowels of the seemingly endless restaurant.The prep kitchen, pastry kitchen, chocolate unit, employee dining cafe and lockers constitute an underground maze, never-ending passageways of hidden spaces that hide staff from guests. In the chocolate room, I was meant to learn about the procedure of making the tiny petits fours that go out to guests as the final gift each evening. Instead, in the room so cool that my breath took on the condensed look of smoke, I stood statue-still as Johnny grabbed me from behind. Maybe I didn’t mind.“Come downtown with me,” he said.Chocolate must be kept cool because it is such a shapeshifter. Chocolate-making involves rules. It involves process. You have to temper chocolate. If you fail to control chocolate, it will turn chalky. It will lose its texture and sheen, break prematurely, turn grainy. Such a delicate material, chocolate, far more delicate than pastry, or even pastry cream.That Johnny had chosen chocolate, this most temperamental of ingredients, as his passion project, felt meaningful. Why choose the thing that is hardest, I wondered? It must take a patient person – a person with delicate hands and constitution – to choose to work with something so infinitely fickle. Here was an artist, I thought. Here was someone who had chosen such a difficult medium. And he wanted me to accompany him into his secret, private life, away from the restaurant. How could I possibly decline?“We have to go separately,” he said. “No one can see us.”That should have been my first red flag.All employees at Jean-Georges leave through a separate entrance, so that the guests don’t have to mingle with them; this is another rule of fine dining. When service has ended, and you are in your plain clothes, you must disappear into the night, through a porter’s entrance or side door, a performer who has played the role. No one can see you in this real life of yours, this city life, where you wear jeans and sweaters and carry a backpack or purse.Outside, it was spring, or maybe early summer. Johnny got on his Ducati, a fast bike that would beat me downtown. I hailed a cab on Central Park West, and headed into the velvet night.The invitation felt precious, and I felt unworthy.In his East Village apartment, Johnny talked about his mother, who had died the year before at 56. I would think about this later, from time to time, about what it had meant for him to lose her, about whether it made him a sympathetic character in the wake of my own loss. My own father died at 57 from ALS.Johnny led me into his bedroom.There were things that I agreed to and things that I did not agree to. What I agreed to: sex. What I did not agree to: the camera that appeared out of nowhere. There was no permission to grant. Johnny had already started filming. I looked up from the bed and was greeted by the cold, blank stare of a camera, and not of a partner.I told him to stop. In my head, I thought about the things that I could do, or the things that I could say, about the obvious betrayal. I thought about how disgusting it was, about how I could end up on the internet, about how I could never run for president, and about how ridiculous that thought was, since I had never planned to run for president in the first place.My brain ran on hyperdrive, firing at a million thoughts a second, and my mouth ran dry. “Stop” came out, a pathetic, one-syllable word. You can feel two things at once, and I did, pulled in two directions, like a dog toy that has been ripped at the seams until it barely exists anymore. Stop. Don’t stop. Stop this, but stay here, with me, because, please, I do not want to be alone.“If you don’t want your face in it, you can put a pillowcase over your head,” he said.He didn’t put the camera down. He was staring at me from above, holding the camera in one hand and holding his hair back with another. He wasn’t exactly standing upright; it was more of a kneel. Still, he could have pinned me down if he wanted. I wasn’t free to leave, the position said. This image is mine, the position said.I didn’t agree to the pillowcase, either. I didn’t want to be a floating sphere, a headless apparition. His foreplay was a woman without a head, appearing in his bed without a face. A bag over my head.It wasn’t just me; it was any girl. Every girlI don’t know why, but I didn’t leave. I felt like I couldn’t somehow, like I was pinned by an invisible hand. Johnny didn’t press the issue of the pillowcase again, but his face twisted up, and the version of him that had been with me until then – the chocolatier who was fun and pleasant and who missed his mom – had vanished.It didn’t feel like any ancient betrayal, being photographed without consent. It felt like the same thing as always, just another person whom I had trusted who had let me down a little. Johnny was another power imbalance to negotiate, another calculated loss. I often think that I stayed in restaurants because restaurants were the natural place for a person like me, a person who was constantly seeking affection in places where affection was simply unavailable.The morning after my night with Johnny, I went back to my apartment to change before work. The subway cars, they looked very, very clean, and I felt very, very dirty, a situational crisis that I realized was not exactly my fault – or was it? I had to wonder if I had put myself in a position of vulnerability. It’s not just trauma that walks with you in the haunting moments after a night like this. The true feeling, if I were to pinpoint it, is shame, and the best way to overcome deep shame is to make yourself believe that it was always your idea: the sex, the drinks, that you had agency, that you were the one who wanted it in the first place. Somehow, that feels less shameful than the truth.At work the next day, I told a server that we had been out at the club together – nothing about the apartment, the sex, the camera, the pillowcase. Later, Johnny pulled me into the chocolate room, seething.“You weren’t supposed to tell anyone we went out,” he said.Something about his wrath made me feel even worse. Was it not my fault that I had been treated like garbage by this celebrity chef, after all? I had gone to his apartment of my own volition. I had made the choice to commingle work and pleasure. Johnny had not coerced me or taken advantage of me in any real way. I could have put the pillowcase over my head. It would have made no difference.There was a fundamental part of me that felt turned upside-down. Was it wrong to be grabbed by a chef during work hours in a chocolate room, even if I liked it? Was it wrong, in the aftermath, for him to have requested my silence and complicity, for him to have issued blame, claiming that if I had said anything that I would be jeopardizing his career? And surely it was wrong for him to have asked me to put a pillowcase over my head, even if it was only some infantile execution of his male fantasy?The truth – I would learn later – was that Johnny Iuzzini had a long-term girlfriend, and the casualty, in all of this, was me. When he suggested that I put a pillowcase over my head, he really did not want to see my face, the reality of me, the person behind the sex. I was just a girl in a basement who looked good in a uniform. I was just a girl at a bar after a shift. I was just a girl on a couch listening at the right time. I was just a girl whom he could ask to put a bag over her head. I was just a girl.There were other girls, too. In 2017,four women came forward to say that they had been sexually harassed by Iuzzini at work. It wasn’t just me; it was any girl. Every girl. It was my friend, Tia, whom he had propositioned at her midtown restaurant, even though she was dating his co-worker. It was a woman from work, who claimed that he stuck his tongue down her throat without permission. It was probably women who hadn’t come forward, too, or women like me who were not quite sure if there had been a violation or not, but who had spent years thinking that something about it had felt wrong.Johnny wasn’t an artist. He was something more twisted, more grotesque. Deep within me, there was a black, hardened tree, the branches of which had been growing almost my entire life, the angry scars of mistreatment. There it was: anger. I was so fucking angry. Angry in the way that women are not permitted to be.Why be afraid to say it, anyway? Probably because a public figure – that’s who Johnny was – can make your life a living hell if you dare betray your own humanity. Probably because a woman isn’t allowed to be angry if she was a part-willing participant. I should have been thankful for the attention, thankful to be temporarily on the arm of such a hot commodity. He took me downtown, into his weird, little world. That should have been enough for me, but it wasn’t. I should have been grateful, but I wasn’t. Instead, I was seething, a roiling pot, ready to overflow.Good chocolate, I think, is both bitter and sweet, at least the way that I prefer it. I don’t know whether or not Johnny loved the ingredient for this quality, but it’s what I like about it – that it can be two things at once, that it can straddle the palate and remind us of how high a dessert can climb.The artistry that people found so obsessive when it came to Johnny – that he could stew over an ingredient and turn it into four composed desserts – is exactly what I find uninteresting. In the end, those desserts didn’t actually taste that good. They were bombastic, and they were visual, and they drew you in. They were tricky and manipulative, the way that restaurants and the people in them can be. But they weren’t the kind of desserts that keep you up at night, pierced with longing.We never needed those four desserts, not any of us.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.
