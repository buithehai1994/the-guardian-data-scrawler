Do you still feel this way?FioreSebekI don’t remember saying that, but I can see how someone might joke about it. There’s usually room for improvisation in life, but I have never been a very good improviser when it comes to acting. When I do things in my own accent, likeJack Irish, he was quite laissez-faire and flippant, so I could be looser and pull stuff out of the air. But when I’m working with high-powered actors and speaking with a tricky accent, I’m learning my lines, doing what’s required and staying in control.If you were attending a dinner party where all the other guests were characters you have played, who would you sit next to, and who would you avoid?FrocksAwayI’d avoid Eric fromThe Roverand the Reverend fromBrimstone, because they might kill me. Ed Exley from LA Confidential is quite arrogant and boring. I’d like to sit next to Andy Warhol, who I’ve played [in Factory Girl]. Houdini would be interesting, although I don’t reckon you’d get a word in. And Leonard from Memento would start with dessert and finish with the starter because he’s all backwards.View image in fullscreen‘I’m with her all the way’ … Pearce as Mike from Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockI love my partner dearly, but she says if she was ever going to leave me, it would be for “Mike from Neighbours”.What can I do to make her stop? Perhaps you can tell her for me?TooMuchSpareTimeNo, I’m not going to make her stop. I’m with her all the way if she thinks: if you’re going to have an affair, make sure you have one with Annette Bening, or whoever. Maybe she needs to watch a couple of the horrible characters I’ve played, like Charley Rakes inLawless. That’s another character I don’t want to sit next to. She should watch Brimstone and Lawless, and I can guarantee you she will have lost interest in Mike from Neighbours.When they first sent you the script forMemento, was it backwards?lagodelunaView image in fullscreenBrilliantly constructed … Pearce as Leonard Shelby in Memento.Photograph: Danny Rothenberg/Summit/Kobal/ShutterstockIt was exactly as you see it in the film. Speaking of people who are in control of what they’re doing, Christopher Nolan is king of that, because he so brilliantly constructed something where there was no room for things to move around. When my agent sent me the script, he said: “By the way, this all goes backwards.” I’m glad he did, otherwise I would have read it three times before I got what was going on.Any news about thePriscilla, Queen of the Desertsequel? Have you boarded the lavender bus again, or are you still stuck in the pre-production desert?badrobot2 and feirefitzWe’re stuck in the pre-production desert, going back and forth on the script, locations and budget. I feel there’s enough love in the room to make it happen.View image in fullscreenPearce (right) looking fabulous with Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyI don’t know if I am looking forward to putting on a dress again. I don’t think I’m going to look as good in a frock as I did in 1993 when I was 25. Funnily enough, I was contacted by Madame Tussauds, who were setting up in Australia and wanted to have iconic Australian actors, like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Russell Crowe from Gladiator, Eric Bana from Chopper and me from Priscilla. I was filming Prometheus in London, so they said: “Could you come in to Madame Tussauds and stand in your underwear, pulling this pose” – they had a photo – “and we’re going to take six million photos from every angle?” I said: “This is 2011. I’m not in the same shape that I was in 1993.” They went: “Yes, yes, yes. Everyone wants bigger muscles and bigger boobs. We’ll make the clay model first, you can come in, and if there’s anything you don’t like, you can let us know.” So I had to go in and say: “If you look at this photo, my waist used to be a little bit thinner,” and they said: “Oh yeah, good point.”Did you have an inkling that LA Confidential would be such a masterpiece while you were filming it?GasparGarcaoView image in fullscreen‘The whole thing was so big’ … Pearce, left, and James Cromwell in LA Confidential.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarNo, is the answer. I don’t really have an inkling for anything. I’d done four or five films in Australia, but it was a totally different environment: in the US, with Americans, on an American film. The whole thing was so big, it was hard for me to gauge anything. I was too focused on trying to do a good job to think: “Wow, this is going to be good.” I was the second person cast after Russell Crowe. Russ and I were rehearsing while they were working with the script, and casting other people. So then David Strathairn, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito turned up.James Cromwellsays to my character in the film: “Would you be willing to shoot a hardened criminal in the back to save face?” I say: “No no no,” being all moral, but in the end, I shoot him in the back. When I shot him, the wadding from the shotgun flew out and hit him in the back of the head. He was 30ft away, so everyone had said: “Don’t worry, it’s safe.” But, for a moment, I thought: “Jeez. I’ve killed him. I’ll never work in Hollywood again.”Was there a particularrole that earned you Radiohead’s nod of approval to appear in their music video forFollow Me Around?McScootikinsI don’t think so. They contacted my agent in the US saying: “Do you have any actors who might want to do it?” And Chris, my agent, who knows I’m a big Radiohead fan, said straight away: “Guy Pearce is in London right now.” I was filmingA Spy Among Friendswith Damian Lewis and said: “I have to take a call with Thom Yorke about this Radiohead music video I’m in. So, excuse me.”Are you grateful that your late 80s pop career didn’t take off?Megapode777That’s the best question I’ve ever been asked in my life. After I finishedNeighbours, there was a period where people would say: “Didn’t you used to be Mike from Neighbours?” Then one day, this 10- or 12-year-old kid came up to me in a shopping centre and said: “Didn’t you used to be Guy Pearce?” I thought: “Wow, that’s the most profound thing anyone’s ever said,” because, in a way, it was true.I always knew I wasn’t just a soap opera actor. I was just stuck in that cycle. Prior to Neighbours, I’d done 10 years of theatre, which made playing the same character for four years frustrating. I wanted to delve into a wider variety of personalities and behaviours. But when I finished Neighbours in 1989, I was in the wilderness because no one wanted to employ the guy who was in Neighbours, and I struggled to find work. I went back and did some theatre, a little bit of Home and Away and then, in 1993, I got to do Priscilla. So, yes, I’mreallygrateful that my 80s pop career didn’t take off!Inside is available on digital, DVD and Blu-ray on 11 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewGuy PearceMementoNeighboursThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertRadioheadDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Only in leavers’ most delusional fantasiesPolly ToynbeeYes, Britain secured better terms with the US than most other countries. But compared with the huge loss of European trade, it’s a drop in the oceanThu 31 Jul 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTShareThose who misled the country overBrexitare usually quieter these days. They do not hang their heads in shame, but change the subject whenever they can. They deflect with their new war-cry that Britain must also leave the European convention on human rights.As the effects of their wicked Brexit folly worsen by the month, they rarely get a chance to whoop: “We were right!” So their glee was unrestrained when the great US global bully gave Britain a less hard beating with a 10% tariff on its goods, compared with the EU, which was walloped with 15%.Their joy overflowed when the business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds,conceded: “I’m absolutely clear, this is a benefit of being out of the European Union, having our independent trade policy, absolutely no doubt about that.” But what else can a trade secretary, speaking through gritted teeth, actually say? In his attempts to attract foreign investment, he can hardly tell the truth about the damage done by leaving the EU.These advocates of Brexit should gloat while they can. When the French prime minister called the EU’s deal with Donald Trump a “soumission” (submission), Kwasi Kwartengseized on the wordin a piece for the Telegraph, writing: “For the French, with their memories of capitulation to the Nazis in 1940, the word is even more associated with abject humiliation than it is in English.” Yes, that’s the same Kwarteng who hurled the British economy over a cliff only three years ago.“This trade deal is the EU’s greatest humiliation since Britain voted to leave”, read the headline on his column. But he would never confess that the difference between a 10% and 15% tariff with the US is minimal, since we tradetwice as muchwith the EU as the US. It barely equates to the regular variation in exchange rates: in other words, it’s “a rounding error”, the Centre for European Reform’s trade expert, John Springford, told me, when compared with the hammer blow Britain gave itself with Brexit.The UK-India trade deal signed with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last week was greeted with anotherBrexiter whoopfrom the Conservative peer Daniel Hannan. Also writing in the Telegraph, he said: “My party, and Brexiteers more widely, should be taking credit for having done what all the clever Europhiles have spent six years telling us was impossible. Instead of moaning, we should welcome Starmer’s belated understanding that world’s biggest and fastest-growing markets are outside the EU.” But the Tory leadertook another view: “Keir Starmer called this ‘historic.’ It’s not historic, we’ve just been shafted!” Kemi Badenoch said, dismissing the India agreement as a bad deal thatwould increase immigration.I don’t know whether clever men like Kwarteng and Hannan are blinded by Brexit monomania or paralysed by the awful knowledge of the damage they have inflicted on their country, unable to confess an act of treachery and delusion hardly matched in British history. But as ever, facts are too inconvenient for them to deal with.Yes, the India deal is the biggest and most substantial trade deal since leaving the EU. Yes, it’s a deal that would have been impossible to do from inside the union. But how big is it? It willadd 0.13% to our economy. That’s better than the Australia agreement,worth just 0.08%, the New Zealand deal,worth 0.03%, or the proposed US agreement,worth 0.16%, according to Department for Business and Trade analysis. But our fragile economy needs all the help it can get, so hurrah for Brexit and our new trade deals!But the gloaters ignore the context: our great Brexit losses. Here’sthe Office for Budget Responsibility’s assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade “will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”. In other words, as Jonty Bloom of the New Worldcalculates, we need 50 India trade deals to make up for Brexit, because Britain does more than 40% of its trade with the EU – more if you include the European Economic Area and Switzerland. India has just 2% of our trade.Brexiters bleat that Labour is sneaking us into the EU by the back door, with deals on Horizon, the EU’s research and innovation funding programme; soon, hopefully, Erasmus; and maybe a youth experience scheme. We hope for agricultural products and energy deals. But even these, say the trade experts, are still small potatoes. Major attempts to rescue Britain’s 4% loss in productivity since 2020 hit the concrete walls of Boris Johnson’s monumentally bad trade and cooperation agreement. Brexit zealots protest against agreements to keep a dynamic alignment with EU standards that would make trade easier. But it doesn’t apply to our internal environmental standards: outside EU rules, we have let our water quality fall behind the EU. More than 85% of bathing waters in the EU arerated excellentcompared with just 64% in the UK, with the gap rising every year,reports the European Movement.Public opinion has shifted rapidly: we arenow a “Bregretful” country, where only 31% still think it was right to leave and 61% say Brexit has been more of a failure than a success. Who do they blame? The Conservatives and Boris Johnson are top of the list, with 88% and 84% respectively holding them responsible. More than two-thirds (67%) blame Nigel Farage. A majority of Britons (56%) want to rejoin the EU as the grim reaper carries off old Brexiters, replacing them with young, pro-European voters.Don’t expect bolder moves from the Labour government in its current frame of mind. Though defence and security draw us towards ever closer union, public opinion is not to be trusted. If people were confronted now with actual re-entry terms – paying in, free movement, joining the euro, no special deals – their answers might change. The mood might also be different if the far right continues its gains in EU countries, dividing the union’s values.What might it take to throw off the economic, political and psychological darkness of Brexit? A clever – or Cleverly? – new Tory leader daring to break with the past, confessing the error of Brexit and taking us back into the EU, once and for all. It may take another generation to recover.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionTariffsTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

He was the author of more than 150 books, including the hugely popular Each Peach Pear Plum and The Jolly Postman.Ahlberg had been working as a primary teacher for 10 years when his wife, Janet, an artist, asked him to write a children’s story for her to illustrate. Later he described that moment as feeling as if he were a clockwork toy and “she had turned the key”. Their first book together, Here Are the Brick Street Boys, was published in 1975, and the Ahlbergs went on to become one of the most successful writer/illustrator partnerships in children’s literature.A very close couple, they enjoyed an intimacy that also characterised their working lives. One secret of their success lay in the dynamic relationship they created between word and picture; another was their joint ability to view the world as if through the eyes of a child. They shared a gentle, quirky sense of humour that was conveyed with great warmth. When their daughter, Jessica, was born in 1980, her various stages of growing up provided further inspiration for their work. Perhaps the most memorable volume from this period was The Baby’s Catalogue (1982), a simple but brilliant idea based on the fact that babies loved spotting other babies in catalogues and magazines.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Random HouseEach Peach Pear Plum (1978) was about as perfect as a picturebook could be, and the deserving winner of their first Kate Greenaway medal, with its simple “I spy” game and a rhyme based on playground skipping games and nursery rhyme characters. Peepo! (1981) was a book to accompany the familiar “peek-a-boo” that adults play with babies. The Ahlbergs raised the game a notch or two by adding a hole to literally peep through, running throughout the book, and setting it during the second world war, with fascinating period detail.Ahlberg described the visual aspect of this book as being based on his memories of his own poor, Black Country childhood, in a small house with tin bath and outside privy. “I am the Peepo baby,” as he put it. He would return to that world in 2013 in the prose and poetry recollections of The Bucket: Memories of an Inattentive Childhood.The Jolly Postman (1986, followed by The Jolly Christmas Postman and The Jolly Pocket Postman) was the Ahlbergs’ masterpiece, and the Postman series as a whole their biggest commercial success, winning the couple their second Kate Greenaway medal and the Emil/Kurt Maschler award, with sales of over 6m copies worldwide. Children, teachers and critics alike were mesmerised by the book’s originality; this wonderfully playful text changed forever the scope of what picturebooks could aspire to.Although sophisticated paper engineering was nothing new, no one had come up with such imaginative “props” within a picturebook before. It required active reading from the book’s young audience, as it not only demanded physical interaction, but also expected them to draw on knowledge of traditional nursery rhymes and fairy tales. It used the widest and most inventive range of text-types up to that point – from letters, postcards, invitations and catalogues to tiny books, newspapers, recipes and advertisements. While children were delighting in the book, they were simultaneously embracing the wider culture of the society they lived in.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Rancom HouseAhlberg’s time working in primary schools had given him the opportunity to observe children, and he put this knowledge to good use in all his books, especially his poetry, where one can detect the viewpoint of the benevolent teacher. Please Mrs Butler (1983) was his earliest collection and is still the most popular, though he wrote excellent further volumes, illustrated by Fritz Wegner and Charlotte Voake. His Collected Poems was published in 2008.Born in Croydon, south London, Allan was the son of a single mother. After being adopted by a working-class family – his adoptive parents worked as an office cleaner and a labourer – he grew up in Oldbury, near Birmingham, and,he said, “scraped” in to the local grammar school. A lifelong supporter of West Bromwich Albion, he initially hoped to play football as a career. He met Janet Hall at teacher training college in Sunderland and they married in 1969.Despite living most of his life elsewhere (for many years near Bath), Ahlberg was always happy to drop into Black Country dialect. He was very proud of the 2011 exhibition of the couple’s work at the Public arts centre in Sandwell, near Oldbury, which included children’s responses to their books. What’s in the Book? (2006), a show forSeven Stories: The National Centre for Children’s Booksin Newcastle, described the Ahlbergs’ working method: “I do the words (takes me about a day) and Janet does the pictures (takes her about six months). Then we send the words and the pictures to the publisher and the publisher sends us some money. And I get half for my day’s work, and Janet gets half for her six months’ work: the basis of a happy marriage …”View image in fullscreenFunnybones, 1980, by Allan Ahlberg and Janet Ahlberg.Illustration: Penguin Random HouseAllan was devastated when Janet died of cancer in 1994, but found a therapeutic way of addressing the terrible loss by putting togethera tribute volumeas a private publication, Janet’s Last Book (1997), based on his personal selection of her work.The Adventures of Bert (2001) and A Bit More Bert (2002) were illustrated byRaymond Briggs, and The Runaway Dinner (2006) and The Pencil (2013) byBruce Ingman.Jessicawent on to become a successful author in her own right, and father and daughter collaborated on several books, includingThe Goldilocks Variations(2012).In 2014, Ahlberg was set to receive the Booktrust lifetime achievement award, but decided to turn it down because sponsorship came from Amazon. When his fellow authorsPhilip PullmanandMark Haddonheard about this, they decided to create an alternative, a compilation of tributes from other writers and illustrators which they calledthe Shoestring award, in appreciation of the Ahlbergs’ work.Ahlberg married for a second time, to Vanessa Clarke, his editor at Walker Books, and became stepfather to her two daughters, Saskia and Johanna.

Dennis Parker – Like an Eagle (1979)It perhaps stretches the definition of “actor”: Parker starred in a soap opera, but was better known as pornographic actor Wade Nichols. However, Like an Eagle is incredible, a soaring, euphoric mid-tempo disco epic produced by his then-partner, Jacques Morali – and infinitely cooler than Morali’s biggest successes with Village People – so let’s bend the rules.19. William Shatner – Mr Tambourine Man (1968)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PictureLux/Hollywood Archive/AlamyCaptain Kirk’s debut album raises questions: are its hysterical recitations of pop hits and Shakespeare soliloquies meant to be funny or a wildly misguided attempt at out-there art? They sound nuts either way. Later albums, where Shatner is audibly in on the joke, are somehow less fun; they’re certainly less disturbing.18. Scarlett Johansson – Song for Jo (2008)Produced by TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek, Johansson’s debut album was heavy on Tom Waits covers and featured a cameo from David Bowie. It received a mixed response. As this self-penned song proves, it’s pretty good, its dark, foggy atmospherics suggesting a love of This Mortal Coil.17. Wicked Wisdom – Bleed All Over Me (2006)If you want evidence of where Willow Smith’s eclectic musical taste came from, her mother Jada’s penchant for nu-metal seems a good place to start. Bleed All Over Me is great: the guitars rage, former Fishbone drummer Philip Fisher adds a swing, and Jada Pinkett Smith’s vocals are really powerful.16. Anna Karina – Roller Girl (1967)The queen of the nouvelle vague sang in Godard’s Une Femme Est une Femme but recorded only intermittently: in her 70s, she worked with Giant Sand’s Howe Gelb. The pick of her oeuvre is the raw, gleeful garage rock of Roller Girl, the first – but not last – credit for songwriter Serge Gainsbourg in this list.15. She & Him – In the Sun (2010)Some of Zooey Deschanel’s indie-rock collaborations with M Ward as She & Him are a little too sugary for their own good. But the lead single from their second album, Volume Two, hits the mark: a melding of smooth 70s soft rock and jazzy pre-rock’n’roll pop that’s as warm and lovely as its title suggests.14. Sophie Thatcher – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door (2024)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sipa US/AlamyThe star of Yellowjackets released a debut EP of experimental pop last year. This, her follow-up, was her intriguing contribution to the soundtrack of thehorror film Heretic, a hazy cover of the Bob Dylan classic set to the melody – and the mood – of Mazzy Star’s Fade Into You. It fits with the film, but works perfectly in its own right.13. David Hemmings – Back Street Mirror (1967)The Blow Up star’s debut album, David Hemmings Happens, is impressively star-studded: he is backed by various members of the Byrds and legendary LA session players the Wrecking Crew for a collection of improvised jazzy psychedelia and baroque folk-rock. Its real classic is this otherwise unreleased song by former Byrd Gene Clark: a world-weary minor masterpiece.12. Tracey Ullman – They Don’t Know (1983)Why They Don’t Know was not a hit for its composer, Kirsty MacColl, is an enduring mystery: apparently written when she was 16, it’s a dizzyingly perfect pop song. It finally made the UK and US Top 10 thanks to Ullman’s brief sojourn as a pop singer, helping to kickstart her wildly successful career in the US.11. Jane Birkin – Encore Lui (1973)There was far more to Jane Birkin’s singing career than theheavy-breathing scandal of Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus: her 70s albums are particularly fine examples of leftfield francophone pop. From her solo debut album, Di Doo Dah, Encore Lui is understated, fabulously orchestrated and supremely cool.10. Lace Manhattan – In the Sun She Lies (2025)Margaret Qualley certainly isn’t the only US actor to pursue a parallel career in acoustic alt-rock, but In the Sun She Lies – produced by her husband,Jack Antonoff, for a new Ethan Coen film called Honey Don’t! – is impressively, naggingly odd: swathed in spooky echo, backed by the sound of gusting winds and abstract guitar noise, occasionally dying away entirely.9. Sam Morton – Let’s Walk in the Night (2024)Samantha Morton’s collaborative album with producer andXL Recordings boss Richard Russell, Daffodils & Dirt, was a leftfield delight: its moody brand of trip-hop revivalism is perfectly encapsulated by the darkly seductive, distinctly nocturnal pop of Let’s Walk in the Night, the jazzy sax provided byAlabaster DePlume.8. Matt Berry – Take My Hand (2009)Matt Berry is an astonishingly prolific musician, turning out everything from proggy folk to ambient synth instrumentals to country rock. Take My Hand is particularly fantastic: melodic, soft-focus psychedelia with a hint of Elton John’s Song for Guy in its DNA, it’s also the theme to Toast of London.7. Jamie Foxx – I Don’t Need It (2008)Foxx’s singing career has yielded deeply variable results: you need a strong stomach to cope with him in priapic loverman mode, and his biggest success involved impersonating Ray Charles on Kanye West’s Gold Digger. I Don’t Need It, though, is great: tough, Timbaland-produced 21st-century funk.6. Dead Man’s Bones – Pa Pa Power (2009)Ryan Gosling and Zach Shields’ solitary album as Dead Man’s Bones is a curious thing: ghost-themed gothic alt-rock featuring a children’s choir on every track. But it contained one unequivocal triumph: Pa Pa Power is creepy and compelling, and was subsequentlycovered by Cat Powerto striking effect.5. Eighth Wonder – I’m Not Scared (1988)View image in fullscreenEighth Wonder.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyPatsy Kensithad been an actor since childhood, but a parallel career as a pop star stubbornly refused to take off. Her band Eighth Wonder couldn’t get a hit until Pet Shop Boys gave them the haunting Europop-influenced I’m Not Scared. Success proved fleeting, but at least they left behind one fabulous single.4. Brigitte Bardot – Bonnie and Clyde (1968)Brigitte Bardot may have been an icon of French cinema, but she was no great shakes as a singer. It scarcely mattered once a lovestruck Serge Gainsbourg started turning out extraordinary songs for her. Bonnie and Clyde makes a virtue of her limited range: her voice sounds like the epitome of cool hauteur.3. John Leyton – Johnny Remember Me (1961)Feverish, cinematic and eerie, Johnny Remember Me is one of the masterpieces of pre-Beatles British pop, showcasing the late Joe Meek’s genius as a producer. It was helped to No 1 by John Leyton’s role in the TV series Harpers West One when a performance of the song was somehow worked into the plot.2. Richard Harris – MacArthur Park (1968)Harris’s late 60s collaborations with songwriter Jimmy Webb are extraordinary: lavish, lush, adventurous examples of post-Sgt Pepper experimental pop. The episodic MacArthur Park is more than seven minutes long, mystifying but utterly gripping and furthermore, a huge hit. Harris may not be the greatest singer, but he’s a captivating presence here.1. Childish Gambino – This Is America (2018)Most actors’ singing careers are an adjunct to their main gig: they might produce hits, but they seldom produce anything that garners a response like This Is America. A lot of attention was understandably directed at the choreographed violence of its extraordinary video, but the track doesn’t need visual accompaniment to strike home: trap beats and sweet choral vocals, a performance by Glover that switches from austere rapping to gentle singing, cameos from rappers including 21 Savage and Quavo, lyrics that explore systemic racism and gun violence. Not for nothing did it win song of the year at the Grammys.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockDonald GloverZooey DeschanelWilliam ShatnerScarlett JohanssonJada Pinkett SmithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What if you get sat next to an energy healer at a dinner party? What are you going to talk about? Raw milk is already sort ofpassé.Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here are the wellness trends everyone is discussing in 2025, and what you need to know about them.Dopamine menuDown in the dumps? Try putting together a “dopamine menu” – a list of activities designed to boost your mood. The term first popped up in 2020, and has since taken off on social media, with thousands of users sharing what they “order” when they feel low.It’s helpful to think of a dopamine menu like a regular menu, Adrienne Matei explained, with “starters” that take little time and effort, more substantial “mains”, and “sides” that zest up the day.Matei spoke to several happiness experts about the items on their dopamine menus. These included giving people compliments, sitting in your favorite green space, cuddling with a loved one, and smashing objects to bits in a rage room. Whatever works for you!More about dopamine menus‘Let them’This year, millions of people realized they can’t control the actions of others – no matter how desperately they might want to. At the end of 2024, podcaster and self-help guru Mel Robbins published a book called The Let Them Theory. Its central thesis was simple: if someone is doing something that bothers you,let them.The book made a splash. It jumped to the top of bestseller lists. There were news articles and podcast episodes about the theory, and Oprah called it a “gamechanger”. People even got “Let them” tattoos.The theory was not without critics. Some claimed Robbins cribbed the idea from poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem, Let Them, went viral in 2022. Others said the concept was obvious. But sometimes obvious advice is the most helpful. As one therapist said: “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back, let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to carry.”More about the ‘let them’ theoryCreatineView image in fullscreen‘Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities.’Photograph: Gabriel Soler Tomasella/AlamyStrength training has been thedarlingof the fitness world recently (deservedlyso), and as more people spend time moving heavy weights, there is an increasing demand for products and supplements that help maximize each lift. Entercreatine.Long a favorite supplement among athletes and fitness professionals, creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities – think sprints or heavy lifts. Synthetic creatine is often sold as a white, flavorless powder that one can mix with water or juice (some influencers take it dry as a stunt, but experts strongly discourage this as it could lead to choking).Creatine is considered safe for most healthy adults. And while research doesn’t fully support popular social media claims that creatine helps build muscle, it might do so indirectly by giving you more energy during intense workouts.More about creatineskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Is that the most cursed sentence I’ve ever typed? Who’s to say.) Online, many speculated that her youthful appearance was the result ofa deep plane facelift– a technique that works with deeper layers of tissue than a traditional facelift. Searches for the term soared. (Jenner did not discuss or confirm any particular procedures.)Deep plane facelifts are pricey, because it is a more complex procedure, and also tends to last a few more years. They can set patients back anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000. By contrast, the average cost of a regular facelift in the US is about $11,395.More about deep plane faceliftsPsyllium huskView image in fullscreen‘Psyllium husk has been touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription alternative to GLP-1 medications.’Photograph: Boommaval Boommaval/Getty ImagesPsyllium huskhas been touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription alternative to GLP-1 medications. But this comparison is “oversimplified and misleading”, warns Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of a desert shrub, and is the leading ingredient in popular laxatives like Metamucil. When consumed with water, it’s simply a good source of soluble fiber, and has been found to help lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, slow down digestion and increase satiety.If psyllium husk isn’t your thing (some people don’t enjoy the gloopy, gel-like texture it develops in water) don’t fear. There are plenty of other good sources of fiber, like fruits, vegetables and legumes.More about psyllium huskFibermaxxingAs protein mania reaches a fever pitch, consumers are already looking toward the next nutrition trend. According to some on social media, the future is all about “fibermaxxing” – a trendy term for “eating a lot of fiber”. As one wellness influencer put it, fiber is “super cool”. Indeed, one study found a fiber-rich diet can improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. You could give psyllium husk a try – or just eat an apple.More about fibermaxxingExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Studio Uittenbogaart/Sandra Uittenbogaart.Ambitious bottle return scheme helps the Netherlands hit recycling targets and tackle litteringByHannah Docter-LoebThu 31 Jul 2025 08.27 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.01 EDTShareWhen Mariama Kamara enters the new Statiegeld return shop on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, she is on a mission. She has been tasked by her aunt, who runs a nearby restaurant, with depositing three giant blue trash bags of bottles and cans. In about seven minutes she feeds the deposit machine about 350 cans, bringing in more than €50 (£43) which will go back into her aunt’s business. “It’s a really cool idea, and so convenient,” she says.In theNetherlands, whenever consumers buy goods in cans,glass or plastic bottles, they pay a slight fee (statiegeld) that ranges from 15 cents to 25 cents depending on the size and type. This money can be reclaimed, however, when you return the container to a “reverse vending machine”, while uncollected deposits go to enlarging the scheme.View image in fullscreenStatiegeld stores in the Netherlands serve solely to process returned bottles and cans.Photograph: Thijs HuizerBut the machines, which are usuallylocatedin grocery stores where they can catch foot traffic from customers, sometimes don’t work, or are not large enough. Stores will also only accept packaging from brands that they sell: for instance, Lidl won’t accept a Coca-Cola bottle because they don’t sell that brand there. And, unlike most of the other countries that have deposit return schemes, in the Netherlands there is no legal obligation for stores beyond supermarkets to have these machines.The Netherlands has an extremely ambitious national legal collection target set by the Dutch packaging management decree, which says that the beverage industry must recover at least 90% of all bottles and cans sold. The problem is it still has a long way to go. According toVerpact, 77% of all plastic beverage bottles and 84% of cans were returned last year – a high rate compared with many countries but still not high enough.So this year, Verpact is trying something new, launching shops that are solely for returning plastic bottles and cans (glass must be disposed of elsewhere). The first return store opened in May in Rotterdam, with a bulk machine that can process up to 200 bottles and cans at once and, according to Verpact, more than a million deposit packages have been handed in since then.Amsterdam now houses two Statiegeld stores and, because of their central locations, they have already brought in a lot of foot traffic. Users include those looking to dispose of waste, local businesses, intrigued tourists and people who spend entire evenings collecting cans and bottles. “For some people, it’s junk, for others, it’s something to eat,” said an employee from Kier, the organisation tasked with manning the stores.Deposit return schemes aren’t unique to the Netherlands. In 1970, the Canadian province of British Columbia introduced the first mandatory system to return beer and soft-drink cans and bottles. In 1984, Sweden created its own model, becoming the first in the European region to do so. The Netherlands launched itsdeposit return schemein 2006, which has expanded over the years. Seventeen countries across Europe have systems in operation, includingNorway,GermanyandIreland. And because of recent EUlegislationthat tasks member states with a 90% collection rate for single-use plastic bottles and cans, morecountriesare joining the pack.Hester Klein Lankhorst, the CEO of Verpact, sees this initiative as a way to help reach the ambitious national legal collection targets: “The goals we need to reach are really high and in a short time. We have to do it as quickly as possible.”View image in fullscreenThe first Statiegeld return shop opened in Rotterdam in May. Three more have opened in Amsterdam.Photograph: ANP/AlamyCompanies that release packaged products on the market are legally obliged to handle packaging collection and recycling, including the deposit system, says Verpact. It is the responsibility of the company, on behalf of the packaging industry, to report on an annual basis to the government.The containers collected aresorted, cleaned and then mainly processed into new raw material that can be sold back to manufacturing companies. According to Verpact, recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) is used in new PET bottles. In 2023, PET bottles already contained, on average, 44% recycled PET. TheNetherlandsalso now requires that by 2025, 25% of the material of a PET bottle must be recycled material.Deposit return schemes are also seen as helping create a morecircular economyand in some cases can help reduce litter. A study by the ministry of infrastructure and water management, the CE Delft consultancy and Utrecht Universityfound thatsince the return shops opened (although they are not necessarily the only reason) the number of small plastic bottles and cans in litter decreased by 69%.But conversely, in some situations people who were gathering the bottles to raise money may empty out wastebins searching for them, making the litter situation worse. “In some cities, especially around garbage cans, there has been more litter, and it has incurred costs for cities that have to clean up that litter because they break cans, and then animals come in,” says Martin Calisto Friant of Circle Economy, an Amsterdam-based nonprofit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Finally, there are concerns over whether the financial returns – a key part of the incentive to recycle – are high enough. “There’s a low incentive, in my opinion, of a deposit value for small containers, and that I would say is one of the big weak points in the Dutch system,” says Thomas Morgenstern of Tomra, a Norwegian waste sorting company that supplies the reverse vending machines for many of the deposit return systems in the Netherlands.View image in fullscreenAn automated Statiegeld bottle return site.Photograph: Statiegeld/FacebookThe low deposit doesn’t incentivise reduced consumption, which Calisto Friant sees as the main issue, while it’s also unclear whether these kinds ofsystemsactually do anything to curb plastic production. “This could be a very important and useful kind of incentive to reduce consumption of single-use packaging, which is probably the most important thing we should do in the first place,” he says.The ideal, perhaps, say Lankhorst and Verpact, would be for every store to have recycling units that worked properly. But in the meantime, the Statiegeld shops are a good stopgap measure to continue to reduce litter and reach legal targets.“There’s not a silver bullet,” Lankhorst says. “But altogether we can make it more easy for people to get their deposit back and throw the cans and the bottles in the right way, in the right system.”And for Kamara, it’s more user-friendly. She’s used to going to one of three supermarkets and manually inserting bottles or cans one by one – an extremely tedious task. “If I had to manually do all the work, it would hurt my back,” she says.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesRecyclingPlasticsNetherlandsPollutionEuropeEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Palestinians cannot leave, war has ended farming andIsraelhas banned fishing, so practically every calorie its population eats must be brought in from outside.Israel knows how much food is needed. It has been calibrating hunger inGazafor decades, initially calculating shipments to exert pressure while avoiding starvation.Children and elderly people most vulnerable as Gaza famine deepens, warn expertsRead more“The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” a senior adviser to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert,saidin 2006. An Israeli court ordered the release of documents showing thedetailsof those macabre sums two years later.Cogat, the Israeli agency that still controls aid shipments to Gaza, calculated then that Palestinians needed an average minimum 2,279 calories per person per day, which could be provided through 1.836kg of food.Today, humanitarian organisations are asking for an even smaller minimum ration: 62,000 metric tonnes of dry and canned food to meet basic needs for 2.1 million people each month, or around 1kg of food per person per day.As Gaza has slid into famine this summer, Israeli officials have variouslydeniedthe existence of mass starvation, claimedwithoutevidencethat Hamas steals and hoards aid, or blamed hunger on UN distribution failures, sharing pictures of aid pallets awaiting collection inside the border.bar chart showing that more people in Gaza died of starvation in just over 11 days than in the previous 21 months of conflictThey pointed todeadly and chaoticfood distributions by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US and Israeli-backed logistics startup, as proof that Palestinians had access to food.Yet data compiled and published by Israel’s own government makes clear that it has been starving Gaza. Between March and June, Israel allowed just 56,000 tonnes of food to enter the territory, Cogat records show, less than a quarter of Gaza’s minimum needs for that period.How will the UK’s recognition of Palestine help those starving in Gaza? - podcastRead moreEven if every bag of UN flour had been collected and handed out, and the GHF had developed safe systems for equitable distribution, starvation was inevitable. Palestinians did not have enough to eat.A “worst-case scenario” famine is now unfolding in Gaza, UN-backed food security experts said this week. Food deliveries are “at a scale far below what is needed”, amid “drastic restrictions on the entry of supplies”, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in a report citing Israeli figures on aid.TheFamineReview Committee, an independent group of experts that scrutinises IPC alerts, said food shipments “have been highly inadequate”, and singled out the GHF.“Our analysis of the food packages supplied by the GHF shows that their distribution plan would lead to mass starvation, even if it was able to function without the appalling levels of violence that have been reported,” the FRC said.In March and April Gaza was under total siege, with no food entering. In mid-May Netanyahu said shipments would restart because of international pressure over a “starvation crisis”.View image in fullscreenData compiled and published by Israel’s own government makes clear that it has been starving Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesJust a few weeks of extra aid shipments during the ceasefire in January and February this year provided enough calories to bring Gaza back from the brink of famine, UN data shows.However, in May only a trickle of food returned, in quantities that served only to slow Gaza’s descent into starvation, not stop it. Two months on, the scale of suffering has now spurred another round of international outrage, includingdemandsfrom Donald Trump to get “every ounce of food” to starving children.chart showing that by Israel’s own figures, the amount of aid reaching Gaza falls well below subsistence levelsIn response Netanyahu has promised only “minimal” extra aid. The number of food trucks entering the territory has risen, but is still well below the minimum needed to feed Palestinians there, much less reverse a famine.View image in fullscreenAid packages, dropped from a plane, descend into Gaza.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersAirdrops, used intermittently throughout the war, have also restarted, with France, Germany, the UK, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE among the countries announcing flights even though parachuting in food is expensive, inefficient and occasionally deadly.Last year at least 12 people drowned trying to recover food that landed in the sea, and at least five were killed when pallets fell on them.In the first 21 months of war, 104 flights supplied the equivalent of just four days of food for Gaza, Israeli data shows, for acost runningto tens of millions of dollars. Spent on trucks, the same budget would deliver much more food, but the price of these flights is not only a monetary one.They allow Israel and its allies to frame starvation as a catastrophe caused by logistics, not a crisis created by state policy.Airdrops would usually be ordered as a last resort to feed people in emergency situations where hostile armed forces or geography make road deliveries impossible. In Gaza the only obstacles to driving aid across the border are restrictions imposed by Israel, an ally of many western nations including Britain, and armed with British and US weapons.Two Israeli-based rights groups this week declared that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, with reports citing evidence including the weaponisation of hunger. B’tselem described an “official and openly declared policy” of mass starvation.chart showing that 104 days of airdrops into Gaza supplied less than 4 days’ worth of foodIsrael’s government knows how much food Gaza’s people need to survive, and how much food goes into the territory, and in the past used that data to calculate how much food was needed to avoid starvation.The vast gap between the calories Gaza needs, and the food that has entered since March makes clear that Israeli officials are doing different maths today. They cannot pass responsibility for this human-made famine to anyone else, and nor can their allies.Explore more on these topicsGazaFamineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But since then a lot of extremist groups have been deplatformed by mainstream spaces, so individuals will now lurk on public groups or channels on Facebook or Discord, for example, and use this as a way of identifying someone who might be sympathetic to reach out to.”He added that, while some younger users turn to extreme content for its shock value among their peers, this can make them vulnerable to being targeted.Extremists have been forced to become more sophisticated as the majority of platforms have banned them, Allchorn said. “Speaking to local community safety teams, they told us that approaches are now about trying to create a rapport rather than making a direct ideological sell.”The study also spoke to moderators, who described their frustration at inconsistent enforcement policies on their platforms and the burden of deciding whether content or users should be reported to law enforcement agencies.While in-game chat is unmoderated, moderators said they were still overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of harmful content, including the use of hidden symbols to circumvent banned words that would be picked up by automated moderation tools, for example, a string of symbols stitched together to represent a swastika.Allchorn highlighted the need for critical digital literacy for parents as well as law enforcement so they could better understand how these platforms and subcultures operate.Last October Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, revealed that “13% of all those being investigated by MI5 for involvement in UK terrorism are under 18”, a threefold increase in three years.AI tools are being used to assist with moderation, but they struggle to interpret memes or when language is ambiguous or sarcastic.Explore more on these topicsFar rightGamesYoung peopleInternet safetyInternetThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

That scheme surviveda brief block on climate groundssparked by legal challenges from campaigners, overturnedon appeal in 2020.However, the plans were put on hold as passenger numbers dropped during the pandemic. The shareholders in the airport, which include the French private equity firm Ardian and Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s sovereign wealth funds, are seeking legislative change, as well as long-term political support, before filing a full planning application.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,has strongly endorsed expansion, but Heathrow is seeking firm policy guarantees after previous runway plans were overturned.These include airspace modernisation to ensure extra flight paths and the passing of theplanning and infrastructure bill. The airport is also seeking guarantees that the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), would allow Heathrow to levy charges to airlines at a level high enough to recoup its investment.Heathrow said the price of the runway itself would now be £21bn, up from £14bn six years ago, due to inflation in construction costs. An additional extension of Terminal 5 to support the extra passengers would cost £12bn, while another £15bn spend is planned to upgrade the wider airport regardless of the runway development.The chief executive of the airport, Thomas Woldbye, said it had “never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow”.He said: “We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country. It is time to clear the way for takeoff.”A government spokesperson said: “Expanding Heathrow could drive growth, trade and tourism, whilst unlocking over 100,000 jobs.”View image in fullscreenBritish Airways operates half of all flights from Heathrow, and the airport claims expansion would create more competition.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersThe government has promised to review the plans over the summer, with Heathrow pressing for a green light in September. It will also examine a rival proposal from a developer, the Arora Group, which has drawn up plans for a shorter runway further to the east.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British Airways currently operates half of all flights from Heathrow and airlines jealously guard rights to valuable slots. EasyJet said the runway represented “a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers”.However, opponents questioned whether the scheme would progress, having failed to move ahead so far despite approval from two previous governments.Paul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway coalition, said: “There’s a real danger that we’ll end up with a hole in the ground and a debt pile for taxpayers to underwrite, because the government had foolishly encouraged Heathrow’s profligate self-interest, as if blind to the lessons of HS2.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said a new runway would have “a hugely detrimental impact on our environment”.Dr Douglas Parr, the policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the announcements meant residents around Heathrow would have “their lives put on hold for a few more years while more money and time is wasted on a doomed scheme … the economic case for the whole debacle just will not fly”.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayHeathrowAir transportAirline industryLondonTravel and transportHeathrow airportnewsShareReuse this content"

The radioactive isotopes even at low levels can be recognised by radiation detectors at airports and borders, leading to the arrest of poachers and traffickers.Researchers at Witwatersrand’s Radiation and Health Physics Unit said tests conducted in the pilot study confirmed that the radioactive material was not harmful to the rhinos.“We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project.Dehorning rhinos reduces poaching by 80%, study findsRead more“Even a single horn with significantly lower levels of radioactivity than what will be used in practice successfully triggered alarms in radiation detectors,” said Larkin.The tests also found that horns could be detected inside full 40-foot shipping containers, he said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population was about 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to approximately 27,000 because of demand for rhino horns on the hidden market.South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but has high levels of poaching and about 500 rhinos are killed for their horns every year.The university has urged private wildlife park owners and national conservation authorities to have their rhinos injected.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesAfricaConservationAnimalsWildlifeSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at least I could understand why I would be on stage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.”Timberlake’s post came at the end of more than a year of him being on tour, which kicked off in April 2024, about one month after he released the album Everything I Thought It Was.The singer facedscrutinyfollowing perceived lackluster performances on the road, with some who bought tickets criticizing the concert on social media. Recently, some fans and commentators have pointed out what they felt were signs of fatigue or ill health during his performances.Timberlake addressed the concerns, saying: “I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I’m so glad I kept going.”He added: “Not only did I prove my mental tenacity to myself but, I now have so many special moments with all of you that I will never forget. I was reluctant to talk about this because I was always raised to keep something like this to yourself. But I am trying to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren’t misinterpreted.”His statement on social media was met with an outpouring of support from fans. “You are so loved, and we’ll be here supporting whatever you decide to do next,” said one. Another added: “Justin you are so appreciated. Thank you for showing up for us time and time again. Take care of yourself. We love you and will continue to ride for you.”According to Billboard, the Forget Tomorrow world tour pushed Timberlake to the 10th spot of Billboard‘s midyearBoxscore reportof touring artists, with the tour grossing $73.2m across 41 shows as of late May.Timberlake is not the first famous musician who has spoken out publicly about their struggles with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, a condition which can cause a rash and symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue and muscle and joint aches. Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber and Shania Twain have also revealed they have suffered from the illness.Lyme disease can last many months or even years. Potentially disease-bearing ticks have been flourishing recently in the US, especially as climate change leads to warmer summers that encourage tick populations to thrive.This year, as compared to recent years, there has been an increase in the reported number of ticks and visits to the emergency room because of bites from the tiny parasitic arachnid,according to datafrom universities and the US federal government.In May and June this year, the US has seen the highest number of emergency room visits during those months for tick bites since 2019,according to the CDC.Timberlake began his career as a “Mouseketeer” on the All-New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993, where his cast mates included fellow singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. He rose to fame in the popular boy band ‘NSync, before going solo in 2002 and going on to become one of the best-selling pop artists of the 2000s.Explore more on these topicsJustin TimberlakenewsShareReuse this content"

Villeneuve is currently filming the third Dune instalment.The 65-year-old writer is best known for co-creating the long-running gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and creating the hit crime series Peaky Blinders. His other small-screen credits include Taboo, A Thousand Blows and The Veil starring Elisabeth Moss.On the big screen, Knight was written the scripts for the acclaimed dramas Eastern Promises, Dirty Pretty Things, Locke and Spencer. He also wrote and directed the sci-fi thriller Serenity starring Matthew McConaughey, which received negative reviews. The Guardian’s Charles Bramescocalledit “magnificently terrible”.His upcoming credits include the Peaky Blinders movie The Immortal Man and period drama series House of Guinness for Netflix.When talking about The Immortal Man in 2023, Knight name-checked 007. “The biggest difference between a film and TV series is the budget,” he said to theMirror. “When you do stuff for TV, you often have to ask people to imagine it. But with a film, you can really do it. You can blow stuff up. Will Tommy be giving James Bond a run for his money? Maybe. There are parallels. We always thought of Peaky as very cinematic, so we are finally finding a screen big enough for what we want to do.”While the role of James Bond remains up in the air, a June reportclaimedthat Tom Holland, Harris Dickinson and Jacob Elordi were top of the wishlist. The news came just after the Dune and Arrival directorVilleneuvewas officially attached. “I intend to honour the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come,” he said in a statement. “This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honour.”The 26th Bond film will follow Daniel Craig’s final outing, No Time to Die, which made over $774m at the global box office. Earlier this year, ina reported $1bn deal, Amazon MGM bought the rights to gain “creative control” of the franchise.This week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassymentionedthe film during a Q3 earnings call. “James Bond is in the hands of one of today’s greatest film-makers,”he said. “We cannot wait to get started on 007’s next adventure.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazon Prime VideoDenis VilleneuveAction and adventure filmsThrillersnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the US president seems bent on undermining the region’s second largest democracy too.Since early July, Trump has launched an extraordinary attack on Brazil’s institutions, slapping 50% tariffs on imports from the South American country andsanctions on a supreme court judge– partly in retribution for what he called the political persecution of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a failed coup.“Rarely since the end of the cold war has the United States interfered so deeply with a Latin American country,” the Economistdeclaredlast week.“I feel for the Brazilians,” said Steven Levitsky, the Harvard University political scientist who co-wrote How Democracies Die, a bestselling book about democratic erosion.Trump accused of ‘attack on Brazilian democracy’ after sanctioning Bolsonaro trial judgeRead more“This is a very authoritarian political force that’s doing enormous damage to my country’s democratic institutions and rights – and I wish it would stop at that. It’s painful to see the [US] government do damage to other countries’ democratic institutions as well.”The US has an ignominious track record of interfering in Latin American affairs, through CIA-backed coups and military interventions. But Levitsky said he had never seen trade policy weaponized in such a way: “Brazilians have worked now for generations to build the strongest, most democratic system they’ve ever had … and this sort of reckless, casual assault on democratic institutions pains me.”Trump’s effort to help Bolsonaro dodge justice over hisalleged 2022 coup, by pressuring Brazil’s government and supreme court, has thrilled the ex-president’s supporters. They see Trump as Bolsonaro’s best chance of avoiding jail when the supreme court announces its verdict in the coming weeks.But Trump’s meddling has infuriated millions of Brazilians from across the political spectrum who are appalled at what they call an intolerable foreign ploy to subvert their democracy, 40 years after it was restored after two decades of dictatorship.“In the old days they’d send in the marines. Now they impose tariffs,” said Rubens Ricupero, a former finance minister and ambassador to Washington, who predicted that Trump’s behaviour would provoke a wave of anti-US nationalism.Marcelo Rubens Paiva, an author and pro-democracy campaigner whose father was murdered by Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship, called Trump’s “utterly unspeakable” interference the fruit of “a man who feels he is Napoleon and wants the entire world to kneel down before him”.Observers are split on what is driving Trump’s assault on Brazil’s institutions and democratically elected government, which the White House this weekdeclareda threat to “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States”.Some suspect he hopes to expand Latin America’s pro-Trump rightwing axis – currently led by Argentina’s Javier Milei and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele – by reviving Bolsonaro’s waning political career and, perhaps, returning the far-right populist to power in next year’s presidential election.Others see Trump’s pro-Bolsonaro pressure campaign as a smokescreen for his true objectives: furthering US economic interests and, in particular, those of tech giantsdesperate to avoid regulation in the world’s fifth-largest online market.Levitsky saw a simpler explanation. Trump’s offensive was the product of a president who acted like a “classic 20th-century tinpot dictator”, such as the Dominican Republic’s Rafael Trujillo or Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza.“Trump approaches governance in exactly the same way. The treasury was for them. Trade policy was for them. Foreign policy was for them. The army was their personal security. That’s how Trump looks at governance. He uses policy instruments for his own personal and political ends,” Levitsky said.“There’s no economic strategy here. Very clearly there’s no foreign policy strategy here. But Bolsonaro’s family has gotten into Trump’s inner circle and convinced him that Bolsonaro’s plight is similar to his plight in 2020 [after he lost the election to Joe Biden].“Trump believes – falsely – that he was subjected to a witch-hunt and he’s been convinced by Bolsonaro’s sons that Bolsonaro, like him, is also subject to a witch-hunt. And he’s usingUS foreign policy– tragically, pathetically – to pursue those personal whims,” Levitsky said.Experts doubt Trump will succeed. Bolsonaro,already bannedfrom seeking election until 2030, is expected to receive a hefty sentence when the coup trial concludes. Bolsonaro denies the charges but has admitted considering “alternative ways” to stop the winner of Brazil’s 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office.Paiva believed Trump wanted Bolsonaro to secure the same kind of impunity he enjoyed after trying to overturn the 2020 election result. But the ruse appeared to be backfiring.Early signs suggestPresident Lula has been energized by the tug-of-war with Trump while the Bolsonaro family, who many blame for convincing Trump to target Brazil’s economy and institutions, have suffered a public backlash. In a recent editorial, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper declared: “Bolsonaro’s name has already been inscribed in the pantheon of the greatest traitors this nation has ever seen.”“I think Bolsonaro has buried his political career,” Paiva said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaTrump tariffsUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

No, not a legacy sequel, nor a Liam Neeson movie; the in-demand Irish actor still does two or three of those a year. Like its predecessors, The Naked Gun is a spoof – part of a comedic subgenre with astonishing versatility, in that it can lay claim to some of the very best and very worst comedies of all time. Maybe that’s why these movies, despite relatively low budgets and decent success rates, will sometimes disappear for years at a time. Now, in a period when a pure comedy hasn’t crossed the $100m mark in the US in almost a decade, The Naked Gun seems to be leading a revival. A sequel to the rock-doc spoof This Is Spinal Taparrivesnext month, follow-ups toScary Movieand the Mel Brooks Star Wars spoofSpaceballsare on the way, and there have even beenwhispersof a fourth Austin Powers film.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreThe leader of the latest comeback has a connection to some high-water marks: the original Naked Gun, yes, but more importantly 1980’s Airplane!, a feature-length spoof of the then-popular disaster movies from comic film-makers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. ZAZ, as the team was known, didn’t invent the idea of parodying familiar genres in a barrage of intentional (and subverted) cliches, sight gags, puns and other stupid-clever jokes. But Airplane! took on movies like Airport with such a deadpan density, and such a shockingly high hit rate, that it wrested the spoof crown from previous king, Mel Brooks (whose Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles are still standard-bearers for loving genre parody).Brooks often appeared on camera in his films, while the ZAZ boys did not; instead, Leslie Nielsen became the face of their efforts, and an unlikely catalyst for a youth-driven trend in the process. Following his flawlessly deadpan role in Airplane! as a doctor (“I am serious … and stop calling me Shirley”), Nielsen starred in the team’s failed (but hilarious) TV procedural spoof Police Squad! which was eventually turned into the 1988 big-screen comedy The Naked Gun. The odd thing about the original Naked Gun is that, unlike Airplane!, it’s not a particularly close parody of a classic or trendy film genre. It mostly takes the framework of the Police Squad! show, which was more akin to 60s cop dramas, and throws in some elements of neo-noir crime thrillers. (There’s also a grab-bag of other assorted movie references throughout the trilogy.)Nevertheless, or perhaps because it didn’t require any specific genre knowledge, The Naked Gun was a big enough hit to inspire a pair of sequels – and plenty of knockoffs. A spoof boom lasted for most of the 90s, peaking in 1993 with National Lampoon putting their name on Loaded Weapon 1, veteran film-maker Carl Reiner contributing the erotic-thriller goof Fatal Instinct, Abrahams himself directing the Rambo-inspired Hot Shots! Part Deux, and Mel Brooks returning with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A later entry, a spoof of urban dramas with the omnibus title of Don’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, kickstarted the next generation of spoofs when writers/stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans moved on to savage resurgent horror movies with Scary Movie.A spoof built around a movie as self-aware and self-satirizing as Scream should not have worked – the Scream characters crack jokes, while The Naked Gun and its ilk tend to goof on seriousness – but it actually outgrossed its target. Later spoofs trumpeted the presence of “two of the six writers” of Scary Movie, the non-Wayans-afilliated Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who also wrote the off-brand Nielsen-starring parody Spy Hard. Friedberg and Seltzer more or less got themselves appointed the ZAZ of the 2000s, even as an actual Zucker went on to make some of the later Scary Movie sequels. Their hits include Date Movie, Epic Movie and the 300 parody Meet the Spartans.Watching the Friedberg-Seltzer spoofs of the 2000s is like watching children attempting to draw their own Looney Tunes or perform their own Saturday Night Live sketches: there’s a basic understanding of what their imitation should look like (and a compulsion to have characters crushed by falling objects) but a lack of basic craft that’s years away from passably amateurish. At times, projects like their magnum opus Disaster Movie barely seem to understand what a spoof even is; Friedberg and Seltzer know that it sometimes involves referring to other movies and/or cultural figures, which they do constantly, but are at a loss beyond ordering up a playground imitation. Look, I’m Iron Man! I’m Juno! I’m Miley Cyrus! Splat! (It almost goes without saying that the most oft-splattered targets tend to be “annoying” women.)Like Nielsen in his post-ZAZ phase multiplied by the force of a thousand suns, Friedberg and Seltzer made so many of these things, and so badly, that when they started to falter at the box office it felt like a relief. That loud, graceless sensibility has now migrated over to YouTube and TikTok, where at least the amateurs-at-heart aren’t charging viewers 10 bucks a pop for sub-skit imitations. Even some well-liked spoofs were deemed stretched thin at 85 minutes; maybe stacking dozens of quick-hit joke is a practice better-suited to shorter-form parodies.View image in fullscreenA scene from Scary Movie.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyPerhaps sensing that, or simply wanting to pay tribute to the spirit of Police Squad! rather than the more mugging-intensive later installments, the new Naked Gun doesn’t do much direct-scene parody. Its opening mimics the bank-robbing sequence from The Dark Knight in set design and score, but no one shows up in imitation Joker makeup. Director Akiva Schaffer, who knows from short-form comedy from his work as part of the Lonely Island, counterintuitively avoids taking the proliferation of a particular type of movie (like superheroes) as an imperative to spoof ’em good. That was the instinct behind the biopic parody Walk Hard, one of the last genuinely good spoofs, and a box office bomb in 2007. Instead, The Naked Gun continues to goof on cop thriller cliches and pile on the absurd puns and/or sight gags (“cold case” files in a refrigerator, a car wreck cleaned up via claw machine, etc), with the benefit of Neeson giving it his absolute best, unsmiling deadpan.So what are the conditions required for spoof movies to multiply? Several confirmed follow-ups seem well-timed if not overdue; dozens of straight-faced horror trends have come through since the most recent Scary Movie, and there’s been a 270% increase in Star Wars films since the first Spaceballs. But highly specific parodies are not always an advantage. Done well, they can be exacting, like Young Frankenstein, or a memorable compendium of cliches, like Walk Hard. Done poorly, and suddenly you’ve got unfunny mash-ups. Then again, it would also be reasonable to ask what, exactly, the new Naked Gun is satirizing.Schaffer does work in some mockery of older white men exerting an iron grip on the culture while grousing how bad the world has become. Mostly, though, this particular spoof revival offers the gleeful release of watching an intentionally fake, silly movie in a theater, sharing laughs with strangers. Spoofing a movie through at-home streaming or phone-bound TikTok is certainly possible. But gags built around violating a generally agreed-upon reality of cinema work better in its natural habitat. That’s something The Naked Gun, with its technical imitations of a “real” movie, seems to understand more than any particular cop-movie trends: that it can provide the too-rare experience of laughing throughout a deeply silly movie that’s as relentless, in its way, as the big-screen spectacle more typical of the 2020s. If the Naked Gun redo becomes the biggest comedy in months or even years, it could ease moviegoers back into the habit. If a subgenre responsible for some of the worst comedies ever made can still make ’em laugh, maybe comedy on the whole will get the chance to leave the house again.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsComedyLiam NeesonPamela AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now artist Pablo Bronstein has created wild mashups, complete with blue-bearded gargoyles, suggesting how it lookedOliver WainwrightThu 31 Jul 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 12.16 EDTShareNo legendary building has ever inspired more conjecture about what it might have looked like thanSolomon’s Templein Jerusalem. It is said to have been built in c.950BC, on the mound where God created Adam, and was destroyed 400 years later by marauding Babylonians. But, beyond some inconsistent descriptions in the Bible written centuries after the temple was razed, there is no archaeological evidence that this palatial edifice ever existed.And yet, for more than two millennia, generations of architects, archaeologists and ideologues have bickered over the building’s appearance. They have debated its exact height and width, speculated on the design of its columns, and battled over the precise nature of its porch. The mythic building, also known as the First Temple, has inspired everything from a Renaissanceroyal palace in Spainto arecent megachurch in Brazil, to theinteriors of masonic lodges around the world– all built on a fantasy.“It really draws out the batshit crazy,” says Argentinian artist Pablo Bronstein, standing in front of hismonumental new drawingsof what Solomon’s Temple, and its contents, might have looked like. “It has been used as a cipher for pretty much every crazy projection of power and self-delusion for 2,500 years. I find it totally fascinating – particularly as the whole thing is entirely fabricated.”View image in fullscreenWild ride … the eccentric zoologist Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild (1868-1937).Photograph: The Natural History Museum/AlamyBronstein’s work has long played with the provocative power of architectural image-making. He has poked fun atBritain’s pseudo-Georgian housingand given us orgiasticdepictions of hell, which he imagined as a showcase city strewn with garish monuments worthy of the most tasteless dictator. But the subject matter, location and (incidental) timing of his latest mischievous outing couldn’t be more charged.Bronstein’s speculative drawings of the holiest site in Judaism are now on display in Waddesdon Manor, an inflated French chateau built in Buckinghamshire in the 1890s as the weekend party pad of the Rothschilds – an immensely wealthy Jewish banking family who were instrumental in the creation of Israel. Baron Edmond de Rothschild – the French cousin of Baron Ferdinand, who built Waddesdon – financed a number of early settlements in Palestine and founded thePalestine Jewish Colonisation Associationin 1924, run by his son James, who inherited the manor.When the Balfour Declaration was written in 1917, declaring the British government’s support for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, it was addressed to Ferdinand’s nephew, Walter Rothschild,an eccentric zoologistwho liked to pose astride giant tortoises, ride a carriage drawn by zebras andwho was also a prominent Zionist leader.View image in fullscreen‘Totally fascinating’ … artist Pablo Bronstein.Photograph: Sophie DavidsonA permanent exhibition at Waddesdon, in a room preceding Bronstein’s show, celebrates the Rothschilds’ connection with Israel. It recounts the family’s funding of the construction of the Knesset building, seat of the Israeli parliament, the Supreme Court building and, most recently, the National Library, designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron in the shape ofa swooping stone ski jump. Architectural models of these trophy buildings gleam in Perspex vitrines, like the priceless antique treasures displayed elsewhere around the house.I became fascinated by the construction of Jewish identity in the 19th centuryPablo BronsteinTo this lavish display of patronage in the Holy Land, Bronstein’s florid drawings add an imaginary additional commission. In a brazen act of architectural cosplay, the artist has inserted himself into the minds of two contestants for a fictitious version of the Prix de Rome, a prominent prize for students of architecture in 19th-century Paris, as they compete to recreate Solomon’s Temple in their own image.“I became fascinated by the construction of Jewish identity in the 19th century,” says Bronstein, who was born in Argentina, grew up in London, and describes himself as a “diehard atheist Jew”. Several years in the making, his new work was commissioned alongside a wider research project aboutJewish country houses, and it seems to have triggered a deep curiosity and scepticism in the artist about his own cultural heritage.“As nationalisms develop in the 19th century, particularly in Germany,Judaismbegins to develop its idea of a body of people that are somehow genetically connected to the ancient Middle East,” he says. “They start to see Jerusalem not as an abstract idea, the way that Muslims look at Mecca, but as a reconstructible place of belonging, tied to a kind of orientalist architectural fantasy.”View image in fullscreenA cross-section view of the gaudy version of Bronstein’s Temple of Solomon.Photograph: Jack Elliot Edwards/Pablo Bronstein. Courtesy of the artist and Herald St, LondonBronstein’s mesmerising drawings depict what, if taken to extremes, this fantasy might have looked like. Painstakingly drawn in pen and ink, and beautifully coloured with layers of acrylic wash (with the help of two recent architecture graduate assistants), the images are magnificently grandiose projections of that exoticised 19th-century longing. They depict two rival designs, in precisely detailed elevations, cross-sections and facade studies, for reconstructing the temple. Both are wild mashups of architectural motifs, sampling from the richly embellished catalogue of Asian antiquity, medieval and gothic revival, baroque and art deco with promiscuous relish.On one wall is a version of the temple that Bronstein describes as “vaudeville beaux arts”, its interior glowing with the gilded razzle-dazzle of a New Orleans casino. Marvel at the spirallingSolomonic columnsat the entrance, sampled from Bernini’s baldacchino at St Peter’s in Rome, and the illusionistic domes that hover above the Ark, influenced by Alessandro Antonelli’sMole Antonellianain Turin, which was originally conceived as a synagogue. “It’s the temple as a sort of gin palace,” says Bronstein – an architecturally virtuosic one, nonetheless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy of the artist and Herald St, LondonOn the opposite wall is a more restrained version of the temple, with interior wooden panelling that recalls the kind of synagogue you might find in Golders Green, north London – not far from where Bronstein grew up in Neasden. There are also notes of Henri Labrouste’sBibliothèque de Saint Genevièvein Paris, as well as dazzling blue lapis lazuli walls, representing the celestial realm in a medieval manner, along the lines of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the “arch-reconstructor of historic architecture”, a caption tells us. It’s a heady cocktail, made no less so by the fruity facade, which depicts the heads of Moses, David and Solomon as blue-bearded gargoyles above the entrance, and a relief of God, flanked by sphinxes.Bronstein’s flamboyant fantasies aren’t so far from what was being designed by 19th-century architects“There’s a good amount of scholarship about what a temple would have actually looked like if it was built in the 10th century BC,” says Bronstein. “And it’s got nothing to do with monotheism.” He thinks it’s much more likely that, had the temple been built at the time the Bible alleges, it is highly likely that it would have been a pantheistic riot, full of different representations of the divine – as is the case with a comparable structure that has survived inAin Dara in Syria, built in 1300BC, “which is just full of goblins, basically.”‘As thrilling as driving a sports car’: the Tokyo capsule tower that gave pod-living penthouse chicRead moreIf all this wasn’t enough, Bronstein has also drawn the Ark of the Covenant – depicted as a gilded medieval reliquary casket, topped with a cushion, where God is said to have rested his feet – and the temple’s menorah, imagined as a twirly rococo candelabrum, whose branches emerge from a chinoiserie-style grotto. Drawings from the Waddesdon archive in a following room help to set the project in context, and show that Bronstein’s flamboyant fantasies aren’t so far from what was being designed by the 19th-century architects from whom he took inspiration.View image in fullscreenA detail from Bronstein’s second version of the temple, with lapis lazuli walls.Photograph: Jack Elliot Edwards/Pablo Bronstein.

TheThird Temple movementcontinues to campaign to rebuild the original temple on Temple Mount, one of the most contested sites on the planet – known as the Haram al-Sharif in the Muslim world, site of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque, two of the holiest sites in Islam. We can only hope the Third Temple fanatics don’t misconstrue Bronstein’s drawings as a blueprint.He began these drawings long before war erupted in the region after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023. Has Israel’s merciless bombardment of Gaza altered his position? “The work hasn’t changed,” he says. “But the war has changed my relationship to Judaism. It made me really question the fact that we all get instinctively bullied into the idea that we have a genetic, cosmic link to the Holy Land. It’s genuinely a 19th-century construct and it’s total rubbish.”Pablo Bronstein: The Temple of Solomon and Its Contents is at Waddeston Manor, Buckinghamshire, until 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArchitectureArtJudaismHeritageThe National TrustRothschild & CoThe BiblefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In contrast to last year, when Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4 occupied two of the season’s top three (and combined for about $2.7bn worldwide), it seems entirely possible that not a single fully animated movie will crack the top 10. Adding insult to injury: the Disney-Pixar original Elio has been trounced by “live-action” remakes of Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, which faithfully reproduce old cartoons with bland new actors and CG visual effects. With younger audiences steered toward those movies and seemingly also welcomed into big-tent hits like Superman and Jurassic World: Rebirth, it’s all the more remarkable thatNetflixhas somehow managed to have its biggest animated movie ever. KPop Demon Hunters, about a trio of women who form a pop group while moonlighting as, yes, demon hunters, was released in June – on the same weekend as Elio, no less – and has become a soundtrack-selling, replay-friendly phenom. Netflix numbers can be opaque, but there’s confirmation in Golden, a centerpiece song from the movie, hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. When was the last time a Disney movie made a play for song of the summer?Superhero movies are hits again – but can DC and Marvel avoid the same mistakes?Read moreAnimation seems like a safe bet for budget-conscious streaming content. After all, the much-lamented cost of a movie ticket is tripled or quadrupled when bringing a family (and then maybe tripled again if they want snacks). On a per-person basis, streaming a new cartoon is the more affordable option. But even after poaching film-makers from major animation studios, the streamers have struggled with original material; Netflix’s The Sea Beast isn’t anywhere near as good as Moana, with which it shares a co-director, and its Over the Moon (the directorial debut of Glen Keane, a longtime Disney animator) is downright ghastly.Spellbound, from Skydance’s attempt to start their own animation house led by the disgraced former Pixar honcho John Lasseter, arrived with barely a peep last Thanksgiving. Most of the time, the Netflix charts are dominated by older animated titles from established studios like DreamWorks and Illumination. So why did KPop Demon Hunters break through?Maybe it helps that it isn’t an in-house Netflix production; the movie was actually produced by Sony Pictures Animation, the studio that worked such genre-bending magic with the Spider-Verse movies. KPop isn’t quite as ambitiously style-forward as that series, but it shares the same basic visual approach of intentionally choppy but eye-catching, shapeshifting animation that imitates both comic-book splash pages and anime, splattered in purple and pink hues. It’s not clear when Sony decided they would pursue a streaming release, but Netflix previously distributed the similarly manic (and original)The Mitchells vs the Machineswhen the pandemic delayed its planned theatrical release.The Netflix-Sony cartoons seem to indicate that maybe there’s more cultural cachet in standing out from the animation crowd, rather than doing off-brand versions of Disney-style songs and Pixar-style secret worlds. In particular, KPop Demon Hunters seems freer to capitalize on a cultural trend than its mainstream competition. Disney has become so self-conscious about its own iconography that its last non-sequel in-house animated feature,Wish, was an extended 100th-anniversary celebration for its parent company, packed with references to their animated classics. Their big release for this fall is Zootopia 2, a stringing out from a great original idea they debuted almost a decade ago. The other big US animation houses are similarly sequel-fixated; the last big animated release of the summer isThe Bad Guys 2, from DreamWorks.Not only is KPop Demon Hunters not a sequel, nor even a comics adaptation, it feels engaged with a world outside of its parent company, no matter how heightened its wild fantasy action becomes. By making the central characters aK-popgroup, the movie finds something that breaks the princess/talking animal/scrappy kid hegemony. It’s about young-adult characters with major responsibilities (even if those responsibilities involve the equally fantastical pop-girlie grind and Buffy-esque demon-fighting), carried out with an aspirational big-sister energy that younger kids can watch with wide-eyed admiration usually reserved for Disney princesses.American interest in K-popmay have even peaked; technically, the optimal time for this movie might have been circa 2021 – not coincidentally, the year the movie’s production was announced. But though KPop Demon Hunters has some adult themes and scary monsters, it’s also pitched young enough that it’s almost better-equipped than if it had come at the height of the BTS craze. The movie very much repackages K-pop for an even-broader audience of native English speakers (something K-pop itself has been doing for years at this point) in a way that draws from the trend’s fandom without relying exclusively on it. Demon Hunters also constructs a fantasy version of the pop machine, particularly the astonishing levels of training received by a lot of K-pop acts; here, all the girls’ hard work is entirely at the behest of their own artistic vision, and they rise-and-grind off the couch voluntarily, not because a music label is forcing them.It’s probably no accident that the lower reaches of the movie’s audience are probably also discovering their own music for the first time – and making their preferences known on the charts, as a whopping nine songs from KPop Demon Hunter are currently on the Billboard Hot 100. That closeness to the pop world also allows the movie to make pop stars its dauntless heroines and devious villains all at once. (The demons disguised as a boy band sing an infectious ditty called Soda Pop that even the movie’s demon-savvy characters can’t really resist.) So much pop taste formation involves sussing out what you find irresistible versus what you find deeply annoying, two qualities that can reverse themselves with surprising ease. Even if KPop Demon Hunters is ultimately more about self-acceptance and friendship than the dynamics of pop music, it’s letting a younger audience try out pop fandom. In that way, it welcomes those viewers into the kind of faux-grownup world that they often get from PG-13 live-action superhero movies.As with superheroes, the response to this movie’s success will mostly be “make sequels to this specific movie, forever” with a possible dash of “streaming animation is really happening this time!” It shouldn’t be, though. In the wake of so many sequels from Disney, Pixar, Illumination and DreamWorks, KPop Demon Hunters is a reminder that kids in particular hunger for novelty, probably more so than their nostalgia-drunk adult counterparts. Despite their ongoing enthusiasm for any number of cartoon franchises, family audiences aren’t just waiting around for Despicable Me 5. They are hoping, conscious or not, for something with more pop.Explore more on these topicsAnimation in filmNetflixPop and rockK-popfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if it’s not a daily staple in your house, it’s safe to say most Britons cook and eat rice at least a few times a week. And while it may seem a simple thing to cook, it can be surprisingly difficult to get it right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From long-grain to quick-cook, brown basmati to jasmine, different rice grains have different cook times, different rates of absorption and varying starch levels, which can all affect the result. Instead of fluffy, individual grains, you may find your rice burnt, stuck to the pan or with a claggy, chalky or overly glutinous texture. Dinner ruined.That’s where a specialist rice cooker comes in. They’re a common kitchen appliance in Asia, and the best rice cookers guarantee perfect rice every time. Many machines intuitively set up the cooking time and guide you to add the correct ratio of rice to water depending on the variety. Many have a delay function, or can safely keep the rice warm for up to 24 hours – so you’ll always have dinner ready and waiting. Today’s technology has also seen some rice cookers become multifunctional, with the ability to slow cook, sear and stir, too. At the other end of the spectrum are basic microwave rice cookers – we tested this variety too.At a glanceBestrice cooker overall:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker£189.90 at Yum AsiaBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cooker£28.99 at AmazonBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker£149 at John LewisBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamer£7.99 at AmazonBest mini rice cooker:Yum Asia Panda mini rice cooker£94.90 at Yum AsiaWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing kitchen goods, recipes, food and drink for newspapers and websites for a decade, so I have a good grasp of what’s really useful to have in your cupboard, and whether something is good value for money.I enjoy cooking but am far from an expert, so I approach these appliances just like any other home cook would. I cook for my family every night and understand how much of a tricky balance it can be to make tasty, nutritious food without spending hours in the kitchen. Ultimately, I’m looking for gadgets that are easy to use, give good results and can make your life easier.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels.’Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianI tested 10 rice cookers, each of which was either personally recommended, well-reviewed or from a well-known kitchen appliance brand. Most were new to me, although a few I had tested years previously, and one appliance was still in play from myslow cooker testing.To test each machine, I cooked a cup of basmati rice, following the manufacturer’s instructions where provided or using the ratio suggested on the rice packet if not. Next, I cooked a cup of sushi rice using the same method; few appliances gave guidelines for cooking sushi rice, so I used the on-pack instructions. If the appliance performed well during both these tests, I then experimented with brown rice and jasmine rice. Some appliances had further functionality that needed testing – where there were risotto programs, for example, I made risotto following recipes provided by the manufacturer.In the interests of safety, I also used an external sensor to record the temperature of the appliance at the end of the rice cooking program; none of the machines posed a hazard and were all fairly cool to touch.Some of the rice I cooked wasn’t edible and had to be thrown away, but most of it was good quality – so I ate rice every which way over the month-long testing period. Luckily, iffood safety guidelines are followed carefully, it’s perfectly fine to freeze cooked rice, so I had a useful supply of fluffy basmati, fragrant jasmine, sticky sushi rice and creamy risottos on hand. My family and I reached peak rice consumption levels, thanks to the weekly poke bowls, Indian banquets, egg fried rice and everything in between.The rice cookers sourced for this article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated to acommunity hub in Barnet, where they will find useful new homes or be used in a community kitchen.The best rice cookers in 2025 in the UKView image in fullscreen‘No criticism … it’s perfect’: Yum Asia’s Bamboo.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianBestrice cooker overall:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould/The Guardian£189.90 at Yum Asia£199.90 at AmazonThe Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker uses 3D induction heating technology – whereby the rice is surrounded by heat to cook evenly – and its “AI Smart Brain” microprocessor to analyse the weight of the rice, water volume and other factors to cook rice using a wide range of settings. Choose from white/long grain, short, brown, crust, quick cook, “yumami” and gaba (germinated), add the specified amount of water to well-rinsed rice, and away you go for enough rice for up to eight people. Other settings are accessed on the easy-to-use LED display panel: steam, porridge, slow cook and cake, all cooked within the same ceramic-coated inner bowl or using the steam basket supplied.Why we love itYum Asia is a master of rice cooking, with an unparalleled understanding of how to cook different types of rice to perfection. I’ve never made sushi rice as perfect as in this machine, and it churned out variety after variety of the same quality. One cup takes about 35 minutes to cook, although the gaba setting – which claims to germinate brown rice to increase its nutritional value – takes a bit longer. I’m someone who has never particularly enjoyed brown rice, but I do now.The machine automatically keeps warm once the rice is cooked and has a delay function, as you’d expect. It’s large enough to be useful, but not too large for easy storage, and it operates with just a low whirring noise and no excessive steam. I also like the cool handles to lift out the pot; others should take heed. A standout machine.It’s a shame that …I have no criticism to make of the Yum Asia Bamboo: it’s perfect–if you can afford it.Claimed number of portions:eightTime to cook one cup of basmati rice:35minsDimensions:27 x 37 x 24cm (WDH)Capacity:1.5lExternal temperature atend of cook:21CBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould/The Guardian£39.99 at Robert Dyas£28.99 at AmazonA large-capacity, budget-friendly, no-frills rice cooker from Russell Hobbs that performs better than you’d expect. The instructions are light on the ground, as is its functionality – there are no different programs or guidelines for different types of rice, nor any timer function.Why we love itTo my surprise, the Russell Hobbs rice cooker handled every type of rice well. Basmati, sushi, brown and jasmine rice all cooked quickly and evenly without any fuss, sticking or mess. It was also the only machine that didn’t stipulate rice should be washed first, so I didn’t. The rice was still great and took between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the variety, and the machine switched to keep-warm mode automatically after cooking. This large-capacity cooker would be ideal for any family.It’s a shame that …there’s no estimated time for how long your rice will take to cook. You’ll learn this over time, but the first few times you’ll need to stand over the cooker until it’s done. Especially as I wouldn’t recommend leaving this one on the keep-warm mode for too long: the rice dries out fast.Claimed number of portions:12Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:20minsDimensions:32.2 x 24.5 x 22.6cm (WDH)Capacity:2.8lExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCookerView image in fullscreen£149 at John Lewis£150 at ArgosThe Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker doesn’t bill itself as a rice cooker, but it’s hard to define it as any one thing with this much functionality. I held on to this one after our test of thebest slow cookersso that I could put it through its paces against designated rice-cooking appliances.Why we love itI wasn’t surprised to find it did well – Ninja appliances can rarely be faulted in my experience. I used the steam function to cook the rice, but you’ll get all the other functions too: slow cook, sear, braise, simmer, bake, prove and keep warm. With one of these, there’s no need for a separate rice cooker.Ninja suggests a recipe for risotto, which turned out beautifully. You’ll need to scour the internet to find guidelines for other types of rice, but I made a guess at a ratio and cook time (one cup of basmati rice to two cups of water, 10 minutes on steam function and a five-minute rest) and it was successful – no sticking, scorching or excess starch. I cooked sushi rice equally successfully using the same method, and I increased the water by half a cup and cooking time by five minutes when dealing with brown rice, which worked well.It’s a shame that …it’s very large. But with this many settings, it can replace so many other appliances in one.Claimed number of portions:eight large portionsTime to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:28 x 29 x 42cm (WDH)Capacity:8lExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamerView image in fullscreen£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonA microwave rice steaming bowl is nothing new, but it’s probably not something most of us own. And why not? It’s inexpensive with a simple, failsafe design, offering quick, mess-free convenience. This Sistema version has a large 2.6-litre capacity, suitable for feeding a family, and uses a pressure-chamber tray to draw away overflow liquid for perfect steamed rice and couscous. It’s also dishwasher- and freezer-safe.Why we love itI wasn’t anticipating this to compare favourably with the expensive electric rice cookers I tested, but it actually does. Using its suggested ratios and timings, my basmati emerged after 15 minutes with individual fragrant grains, with no starchiness or chalky middle. Other rice varieties weren’t mentioned in the instructions, but sushi rice worked well using the same method. For brown rice, I added another five minutes and was successful.If you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, then I highly recommend trying one of these. It guarantees results without having to put your hand too far into your pocket. For anyone concerned about Pfas – the “forever chemicals” in some plastics – this cooker is made from safe polypropylene.It’s a shame that …it gets so hot. It’s been in the microwave for 10 to 15 minutes, so there’s no getting around this.

You should also factor in that the quantity of rice to be cooked will affect the cooking time, increasing proportionally with larger batches. The type of rice should also be considered; white basmati is the quickest cook, while brown rice and sticky styles will take longer – up to about 50 minutes. Good rice cookers will carefully detail cook times for specific types of rice, and most have a keep-warm function so you shouldn’t be left with any dinnertime disasters as long as you plan in advance.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

I did very little else. My body had become stuck in a perpetual rinse cycle, wringing itself out day and night. Becalmed on the sofa, too nauseated to mindlessly scroll, I found an unlikely emergency exit in the bloody Battle of Borodino. In between puking jags, I would prop the book open on my chest, squint at the tiny text, and drift into a Tolstoy-induced torpor. It occurred to me that clouds of saltpetre and the booming of cannon weren’t ideal conditions for a growing baby, but I had to go somewhere.At 6am my husband left for work and I began another gruelling day on the front; purging viscous pond slime from my empty stomach and keeping up with the Cossacks on their flanking march. In the throes of extreme pregnancy sickness, I found strange comfort in the privations of 19th-century military life; in soaked bandages and musket fire and impromptu field hospital amputations. And even, or especially, in the seeming endlessness of the book itself. For the months that I starved, I lugged my starving Russian comrades with me, from the upholstery-chemical stink of the sofa to the sweet bleach-stink of the bathroom to the seamy oily-skin stink of the bed. Perhaps it was a derangement of dehydration and hormones, but I felt real solidarity with my gangrenous friends on the front – far more than with anyone in a “felt cute” sundress on the What to Expect When You’re Expecting app.When the hyperemesis gravidarum began, throwing up 10 to 20 times a day had some degree of novelty. I was thrilled to be pregnant – only five weeks along and high on the discovery – and resolved to pay the price for the construction work my body was doing. “I am creating a whole central nervous system,” I thought, slumped and sweaty on the bathroom floor. But by the time we were on to fingernails and toenails, the adrenaline of the sprint had ebbed away. In the wake of what I imagined to be my martyred maternal heroics was panic. I suspected there were months of relentless nausea and puking still to come.“Ah, poor pet” was the invariable response of my beatific, noninterventionist midwife when I described another week of struggling to consume enough for my baby and me to survive. “Nasty stuff. Don’t worry – baby will get everything she needs.” This was often followed up with a quick: “It’s justyouthat will suffer!” as if that were not the sort of problem that needed attention of its own. At one hospital admission after a particularly terrifying Exorcist-style night, the obstetrician told me to let the midwife know that my bump was measuring a bit small. I reported back, but my midwife resented doctors dictating what the pregnant body should and shouldn’t do. “Every bubba grows at its own pace,” she crooned, whisking the measuring tape off my belly.I asked my mother-in-law if she had gone through anything similar. “Oh no, I never got sick like that,” she said, looking at me sceptically. “Actually, there was one time. I made myself a bacon sandwich and then I just couldn’t face it. I always remembered that, because I love bacon sandwiches.”“I was so sick, too!” said my mother. “I couldn’t stand the smell of perfume counters. I could only eat beige foods for the first trimester.” I asked how many times a day she threw up, how she survived it. “Oh, I never actually threw up,” she said, “but I did feel just so awful.”Every year,up to 3% of pregnant womenworldwide are diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, or HG – that is, not the garden-variety morning sickness of the first trimester, but what is considered to be excessive vomiting that can last for the duration of the pregnancy.In parts of China, the rate may be as high as 11%. Worldwide, that’s millions of women at any given moment. Put those numbers together, year after year, and one might suppose we were dealing with a problem of significant public concern. But, dangerously dehydrated, starving, isolated, frequently struggling with suicidal ideation and with barely a treatment protocol in sight, the suffering of these women and their babies has barely registered in the collective consciousness.Not, that is, until the winter of 2012, when Kate Middleton vanished into a private Marylebone hospital. A medical crisis had been sparked in utero, and the palace was forced to announce the presence of a royal foetus far earlier than it would have liked. Prince George, as the bump would become, had leapfrogged Harry in the line of succession, and initiated a form of “severe morning sickness” in the princess that had the world’s tabloid journalists scrambling over potted summaries of the condition. I happened to read one such summary in the Evening Standard on the tube that afternoon, appalled to think such a scenario could suddenly unfold in a woman’s life. Eight years later, when I arrived at my local public hospital in Australia, 13 weeks pregnant in the midst of a pandemic, it was Kate’s name the nurses were whispering in their triage desk huddle.View image in fullscreenPrince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in 2012, leaving the hospital where she has been treated for HG.Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImageLike the millions of non-royals with HG, I was largely left to fend for myself, never knowing when my condition was considered “bad enough” to trouble a hectic emergency department for IV fluids. No blood tests took place to check for nutritional deficiencies (I couldn’t keep down prenatal vitamins), there were no weigh-ins, no extra check-ins, no counsellors and no special clinic to visit. Mostly, I was so weak and disoriented that moving from my huddle over War and Peace would have been too much in any case. And while folk and medical wisdom have been in staunch consensus that “baby gets everything she needs”, even from a mother who can’t keep down so much as a glass of water, troubling new research is emerging which suggests that baby may be suffering far more than we initially thought – and for longer.The sternest sceptic may wonder if HG isn’t just a fabulated modern condition – a bid for attention by lily-livered 21st-century women who can’t endure what our forebears did. I had begun to fear something similar. If women had been suffering like this for centuries, surely we – or at the very least, our doctors – would know a great deal about it? The condition resolved entirely once my daughter was born, and the whole pregnancy was becoming increasingly pixellated – happily so. But some unresolved questions still niggled, and I was curious to know if my ancestors had been plagued by HG too.One afternoon, while our now four-year-old daughter was serenading my husband with a strangely apposite song by punk icon Patti Smith (“Oh baby, I remember when you were born / It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly”), I decided to dig through the medical archives. I prepared myself to encounter very little – some derisory footnotes about hysteria, perhaps. After all, in 2025, women in rich and poor nations alike still experiencemajor healthcare inequity, and one could hardly expect the gender bias to have been any better at the turn of the 20th century. So I was surprised to find that there were actually manyserious, active discussionsof what Toronto’s Dr Temple called the “very distressing and, not infrequently,fatal complication of pregnancy” in the top medical journals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.If you scan down the pages of Victorian British Medical Journals – past cases of syphilitic headache, senilic gangrene, tin poisoning from silk stockings, and sunstroke, you will come upon a section calledMidwifery and Diseases of Women. It’s here where I discovered many cases of women in mid to late pregnancy appearing “in a dying condition” – as I had often imagined myself —and treated with a wild catalogue of remedies. I could find little coherent methodology or protocol, because although there was huge speculation about the causes, everyone still seemed mystified. More than 100 years before the invention of the twist-and-seal sickbag, women were dying of “pernicious vomiting of pregnancy” in large enough numbers to warrant real concern.Predictably, some physicians did conceive of it as a nervous complaint. In Berlin, the foreboding Prof Kaltenbach found that threatening a woman with a grisly (and often fatal) surgical termination could often hasten her “recovery”, and was satisfied that HG could be cured by “a process akin to suggestion,like ordinary hysteria”. Some doctors in the 1920s were heavily influenced by nascent psychoanalytic theory, arguing that the vomiting was a “semi-conscious desireto end an unwished-for pregnancy”. But surprisingly, they were in the minority. On the whole, the condition seemed to be treated with far more gravity, attention and care than I encountered myself, more than a century later.As early as 1880 – the year that female “hysteria” was first described in the medical literature – a demobbed American civil war surgeon was taking the suffering of his HG patients very seriously indeed. That year, William W Potter (who would definitely earn a grid spot on the Hot Victorians Instagram account) submitted the catchily titled “On rectal alimentation and the induction of abortion for the relief of the obstinate vomiting of pregnancy” to theAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children. Potter had served as surgeon for the 57th New York, been captured by the Confederates, and “interviewed” by Gen Stonewall Jackson – presumably he had seen his fair share of suffering and gruesome medical scenarios. So the concerned solemnity with which he discussed and treated HG is all the more interesting. And he wasn’t alone. About 50 years before the saline drip was widely available, a number of gentlemen physicians were truly puzzled as to why otherwise healthy women were vomiting themselves into an early grave. Unlike his more laissez-faire 21st-century counterparts in my local hospital,one Glaswegian doctor reported: “A really bad case of hyperemesis is one of the most serious and trying things with which a physician has to grapple, and no time should be lost … if the patient’s life is to be saved.”That is “patient” singular. In pointed contrast to the current reality in the US after the reversal of Roe v Wade, in the days of Victorian medicine, a mother’s life was the primary consideration. One can even forget the existence of a second patient, so absent is it from the pages of deliberations and outcomes. Indeed, “emptying the uterus” – the euphemism for a therapeutic abortion – was frequently the treatment for intractable cases. It could be an instantly effective cure for the mother’s condition, bringing respite either in the end of her pregnancy, or the end of her days.“Relief” could be obtained via the ominous-sounding “Bossi’s dilator”. This was mentioned so many times that I was moved to hunt down a picture. The unholy love child of a whisk and a winged corkscrew, it looked like something a butcher might have on hand for disembowelling deer. A Genoese inventor created the four-bladed tool, which has a tap head on one end for ratcheting, and four giant hinged arms on the other for “rapid dilation”. In this terrifying era of experimental surgery, I became fond of some of the HG heroes, like Dr Fordyce Barker, who “did not believe in the rapid evacuation of the uterine contents”. He had seen two persons die from shock after rapid delivery with the aid of Bossi’s dilator.But death wasn’t the only ameliorative on offer. Unlike the modern pregnant woman who may take pains to avoid high-mercury fish, a healthy dose of mercury was a first-line remedy for pernicious vomiting. Far from languishing on the chaise longue without intervention, she could also receive the “rectal instillation” of morphine, laudanum or her own urine; an enema with soap, water and disinfectant; regular doses of adrenaline, arsenic, strychnine or deadly nightshade; anintramuscular injection of her husband’s blood; pessaries of hydrogen peroxide; injections of insulin or corpus luteum (the cells on the ovarian follicle that degrade and trigger menstruation); and regularstomach washesandgluteal injections of milk. Some of the treatments even had a droll regional twist; in Edinburgh there was a “rectal feeding regime” of milk, brandy and “meat juice”; in Texas, an obstetrician made the fabulously bullish declaration: “This author uses a strong solution of cocaine,and uses it in heroic doses.” Where cocaine failed, he also experimented withelectric shock treatment, sending current up and down the spine and stomach of his patient. One intrepid physician evenused radiotherapyon the lower backs of his pregnant patients, warning that great care should be taken to not overdo it and accidentally initiate an abortion (he adds a breezy postscript that it’s an effective way to terminate a foetus if you need to, though).As I scrolled into the 1950s and 1960s, the energetic lists of medical interventions puttered out. There were no more pilot remedies, no worried physicians requesting the livers of HG patients to be sent in waterproof packaging for dissection. In fact, for the next few decades there was very little reference to HG at all. It took a few minutes for me to understand why. Because the word thalidomide never actually appears – only its UK brand-name: Distaval.Thalidomide – the anti-emetic with “no known toxicity and free from untoward side-effects”, was prescribed in the late 50s and early 60s for mothers suffering even the mildest form of morning sickness. The severe birth defects and catastrophic human cost of the thalidomide scandal is well known, but there were other areas of fallout, too. Quite understandably, it not only damaged a woman’s confidence in the assurances of her doctor, but it also dented the doctor’s confidence to prescribe medicines for her patient, and the pharmaceutical companies’ confidence to develop and market medications for pregnant women. First, do no harm, of course. But what about when doing nothing constitutes a form of harm, too?Thalidomide is only one piece of the puzzle. The neglect of millions of pregnant women with HG is a classic example of what policy wonks refer to as a “wicked problem” – a complex, multidimensional issue that resists easy solutions. It’s partly an issue of squeamishness – it’s tricky to build a sympathetic, interesting brand around Monty Python levels of vomiting. When I’ve tried to share some of this suffering with friends and family, the reactions are sometimes awkward and the subject is quickly closed. “At least that nastiness is over,” people will happily sigh, and reach for sunnier topics. But it’s also the name. Hyperemesis gravidarum sounds dreary, but the term “extreme morning sickness” is part of the problem, too.Because it’s not just a matter of degree. A bit of polite morning sickness is a cinematic trope; our glowing heroine dashes to the toilet and returns, laughing and shaking her head. But this is not the same as lying bedbound, barely eating or drinking for the entire pregnancy. There’s no socially viable way for the HG sufferer to leap in and correct with her own little anecdotes.Like the night when I was 24 weeks pregnant and even after chemotherapy-grade nausea medication, vomited so many times in rapid succession that I wondered if this was it, if death was coming for me and my baby both, and rubbery-tasting chunks of something that wasn’t food started collecting in my bucket, and, having lost all control of my bladder, I slid in pools of marbled urine and vomit, trying to focus on breathing in between rounds, and when I continued vomiting – now blood – into the transparent bags in the ambulance, and cried out would the baby be OK, and the paramedic chuckled and said: “Nah, that’s nothing. I’ve seen more blood in vomit!” like he was a Crocodile Dundee cameo in a National Lampoon sketch.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Claudine O’Sullivan/The GuardianIf one hasn’t experienced it, it is hard to imagine the physical and psychological impacts of starvation and relentless vomiting – up to 50 times a day, for nine months. So studies fill in the gaps: bedsores, atrophied muscles, torn oesophagi, fractured ribs, detached retinas, intracranial haemorrhage,Wernicke’s encephalopathy, broken teeth, collapsed lungs, liver dysfunction, lost jobs and relationships, sterilisations to avoid future pregnancies, long-term PTSD and depression. And death. In 2022, Jessica Cronshaw, a 26-year-old primary school teacher from Lancashire, took her own life when 28 weeks pregnant. Her much-wanted daughter was delivered via C-section and died four days later. In the inquest report, the assistant coroner said the case “should serve as a reminder to healthcare professionals about the critical importance of addressing the wide-ranging impacts of hyperemesis gravidarum, including its mental health aspects.” According to arecent study,as many as 4.9% of women with HG have terminated a wanted pregnancy and more than a quarter haveconsidered suicideas their only option to obtain relief. That’s a staggering number of women, year on year.Last year, when our daughter was three, my husband came running into the kitchen waving his phone. On the screen, the geneticist Marlena Fejzo smiled out at me from Time’sWomenof the Year round-up. Having identified a possible genetic culprit for HG – the hormone GDF15, which is also implicated in cachexia (the vomiting and rapid muscle wastage associated with cancer and chemotherapy) – Fejzo has become HG’s unofficial Avenger, often pictured hovering over a centrifuge in a white coat. The genetic variants she discovered can lead to abnormally low levels of GDF15 prior to pregnancy, which can make one hypersensitive to their surging levels during pregnancy.Fejzo published one of the first studies on developmental delay in babies of HG mothers. “I started looking at some of theoutcome studiesbecause the issue didn’t seem to raise enough concern – just the mother’s experience throughout the pregnancy,” Fejzo told me.She argues that, far from the “baby gets everything she needs” narrative, HG is actually detrimental to pregnancy. She told me about a study that showed HG mothers were more likely to have small infants than mothers with chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia and even exposure to cannabis, tobacco, cocaine or amphetamines. There was also evidence of abnormal brain growth, neurodevelopmental delay, vitamin K-deficient embryopathy, autism spectrum disorder, childhood cancer and respiratory disorders.Fejzo’s work on HG treatment and prevention is what she calls the “final chapter” in her own story. But like many classic narratives, it is a breakthrough that tragically comes too late for the protagonist. She had HG in the early 00s, but her doctor said she was exaggerating. With a PhD in genetics from Harvard, she was more likely to be believed than many – but still wasn’t. Her doctor said that he’d recently read a study that showed that pregnant women wanted to be infantilised by their mothers. And Fejzo’s retired parents had taken separate shifts to take care of her – to empty her bedpan, among other things. Speaking with her now – an award-winning academic at the top of her field – it’s hard to imagine anyone less likely to be patronised and gaslit. But she was too weak to argue, and lost her baby to chronic starvation in the second trimester.“People used to say to me that it must be all in your head because animals don’t get it. And so I looked it up and that’s just not true. In veterinary journals, for cats, they say, if the cat doesn’t eat for one to two days, you should immediately call your vet. They’re more proactive about the care of the pregnant cat!” She jokes that a woman with HG would have more luck getting an appointment with a vet, and we both cackle in solidarity. But I think of our former selves, of her incalculable loss, of the Bossi’s dilations and the gaslighting and the hushing and the suicides, and of how neither of us really think it’s funny, not even a bit.Fejzo and I both entered our pregnancies in a position of great privilege – educated, financially secure, able-bodied, relatively healthy women in rich countries, with strong social networks and access to healthcare. If we represent the ability to gain the greatest advantage from a cracked system, then what about those who do not? What about the women who don’t feel able to make demands or argue with their healthcare providers, or who lack the language to do so? There isevidencethat Black and Asian women are already the victims of bias in their healthcare, including in pregnancy. What about those women, and the women who live in poverty and are nutrient-deficient at the start of their pregnancies, or the new migrants who live a distancefar from family, or the women who can’t take time off work, or the women in the global south?“HG is the fourth leading cause of maternaldeath in Botswana,” Fejzo tells me, “and that’s just where we happen to have some data.”Studies and trials based, in part, on Fejzo’s research are under way now, using drugs that increase levels of GDF15 prior to pregnancy in order to desensitise the patient, and those that block GDF15 signalling during pregnancy itself. But developing drugs for pregnant women is a long and complicated process, so an over-the-counter treatment based on Fejzo’s research is still a way off.People tend to misunderstand the furore around medicalised misogyny and bias. They imagine arrogant male doctors wilfully and deliberately dismissing female patients, which is rarely the case. They exist, of course, but there are very few doctors who deliberately pursue a “women’s health is not important” policy, and no one enters medicine in order to mistreat and misdiagnose 50% of the population. Bias is very often unconscious, because most of us are not aware of the ways in which our core beliefs and expectations might exclude others or diminish their concerns. But research from a number of sources shows that women not only wait up to33% longerin emergency rooms than men with the same symptoms, they are also more likely to be turned away in the middle of astroke or cardiac event, and have to push harder and longer (sometimes years longer)to get a cancer diagnosis. But increased awareness of this disparity hasn’t changed it.Women have internalised some of these biases, too. Girls growing up within a patriarchal framework absorb certain ways of thinking about their bodies and their identities. That includes female doctors and nurses, holistic midwives and female patients. Periods are meant to be excruciating.Pregnancyis meant to be gruelling. Mothers’ bodies are meant to be exhausted. Menopause is meant to be debilitating. Was there a gendered dimension to my not wanting to keep causing a fuss in the emergency room? A determination to struggle along silently because I was accustomed to doing so? It’s not unrealistic to imagine that HG research and treatment would be a priority if men suffered with it.Hyperemesis gravidarum is an extreme type of suffering for women – torture even, that we turn a blind eye to. Now we know it was never true that only the mother suffered, but why did we think that made it OK in the first place? But there is some hope, and it has just been published in the same journal – renamed – where I discovered my civil war hero and his treatise on rectal alimentation. At the end of June, Fejzo and her colleagues publisheda new studythat found that daily use of an affordable GDF15-increasing drug prior to pregnancy is associated with a greater than 70% reduction in the risk of HG. Metformin is mainly prescribed to lower blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it has recently been touted as a“wonder drug”that may have many more applications. It is heartening and galling to think the solution may have sat on the shelves of my local pharmacy all this time. While more studies are needed, Fejzo’s work suggests generations to come may no longer have to suffer like we and our ancestors did.As it says on the tin, War and Peace is not all cannon fire and amputations – there’s a lot of peace in it, too. All’s Well That Ends Well was its working title, and on re-reading, I remember that children fill the epilogue. We leave the surviving characters in the bosom of their families, dandling “the baby in his little hat, with his wobbly head” and remarking on the redemptive sweetness of their children. Natasha finds that “no one could tell her anything so soothing and sensible as this little three-month-old being, when he lay at her breast and she felt the movement of his mouth and the puffing of his nose”.My four miscarriages: why is losing a pregnancy so shrouded in mystery?Read moreI joke now that the pregnancy was only so hard because I was hatching somebody so spectacular. I would do that pregnancy again, in every possible universe. My daughter has memorised all of the lyrics to that Patti Smith song about the tempestuous birth. I’ve sung it to her since she was born, subbing her name for Kimberly’s and ratcheting to the middle-eight like a rollercoaster. Now we sing it together in the car, in the living room, outside in the garden, getting louder as we inch toward the big payoff. “The palm trees fall into the sea / It doesn’t matter much to me / As long as you’re safe, Kimberly”.One of my first duties as a new mother was to keep my child safe as she grew in my belly. But did I? I am haunted by the idea that, in minimising my own suffering, I minimised hers, too. If I had known her then, or Marlena Fejzo, or William W Potter, I would have dragged us to that hospital, day after day, and demanded the care we deserved.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readPregnancyMaternity & paternity rightsMaternal mortalityHealthParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are absolutely rightThu 31 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 06.46 EDTShareThe Suez crisis in 1956 was a humiliating moment of truth for the UK. Faced with implacable opposition from the US, Anthony Eden’s government was forced to abandon military action in Egypt. Capitulation to American pressure was a recognition of Britain’s diminished status on the world stage.The trade deal agreed between Washington and Brussels this week lacks the drama of troops being sent in to recapture one of the world’s key waterways, but it is the EU’s Suez moment all the same. What’s more, European politicians know as much.Donald Trump said the outcome was “great”, and for the US that was certainly the case, since the EUmade all the concessionsand got nothing in return. Most European goods exported to the US will face a 15% tariff, while the already small tariffs on US goods entering the EU will be eliminated altogether. European companies have been forced to accept higher costs as the price of access to the world’s biggest market.That’s by no means all. The EU has also committed itself to $600bn (£450bn) of US investments, $750bn in long-term fossil-fuel energy purchases and to buy more US military kit. Plans for anEU digital services taxthat would affect US tech giants had already been dropped.As far as the financial markets were concerned, it was reason to feel relieved, since this one-sided peace pact removed the threat of a tit-for-tat trade war. It isn’t that economists think tariffs will be good for the global economy, but rather that they feared an even worse outcome. EU trade negotiators were of the same opinion. For Brussels, any deal was better than no deal.But appeasement always has its critics, and condemnation of the deal was swift in coming – particularly from France. François Bayrou, the prime minister, said it was a “dark day” for Europe. His predecessor, Michel Barnier,said the agreementwas an admission of weakness.Posting on X, the entrepreneur and commentator Arnaud Bertrand said the terms of the agreement represented one of the mostexpensive imperial tributesin history. He added: “This does not even remotely resemble the type of agreements made by two equal sovereign powers. It rather looks like the type of unequal treaties that colonial powers used to impose in the 19th century – except this time, Europe is on the receiving end.”That’s a reasonable conclusion. The rationale behind ever-closer union within the bloc was that an EU armed with its own currency would be able to match the US, not just in terms of economic prowess but in geopolitical influence as well. The euro would be a rival to the dollar, and strong growth would give Europe political clout. Pooling sovereignty in areas such as trade would ensure that Europe punched above its weight.As Trump’s tariff regime becomes clear, Americans may start to foot the billRead moreThings haven’t quite gone according to plan. Europe’s economic performance since monetary union has been dismal, and the gap with the US has widened rather than narrowed. Individual countries have had their scope for independent action systematically reduced, with restrictions on state aid, procurement and industrial policy. Handing the European Commission responsibility for negotiating trade deals hasn’t prevented Europe being steamrolled by the US. Indeed, the trade deal the EU has agreed with the US is actually less favourable than the one that Keir Starmerhas signed up tofor post-Brexit Britain.The US-EU agreement needs to be approved by EU countries, which could be a problem if the hostile French reaction is anything to go by. Many details remain unclear and some of the terms will prove hard, if not impossible, to enforce. There is no way, for instance, that the EU can force private companies in Europe to invest across the Atlantic.Moreover, the deal may prove to be a pyrrhic victory for Trump if, as looks increasingly likely, tariffs increase the cost of goods in the US. Coupled with the clampdown on migration, there is the clear risk that growth will slow and inflation will rise. Share prices on Wall Street are high in expectation that the good times will continue. They may not.But while there would be a tinge of schadenfreude in Europe were the bubble in US asset prices to burst, any joy in Trump’s misfortune would prove short-lived.Europe’s fortunes are tied to those of the US. First, it needs access to the American market because its economic model relies so heavily on exports. This is particularly true of Germany, whichruns large and persistent trade surpluses. German carmakers can probably just about live with 15% tariffs, but they would have been ruined had Trump followed through on his threat to impose levies of 30%.Second, the EU needs the US to help it counter the perceived threat from Russia. It sees US energy as a substitute for Russian oil and gas, while the agreement to buy more American military goods is a way of tying the US more firmly into Nato.The contrast with China is stark. Beijing did not roll over when Trump imposed punitive tariffs earlier this year. Instead, it stood up to US bullying byannouncing retaliatory measuresof its own. The markets went into full panic mode, with China’s robust response triggering a sharp fall in US bond prices. Faced with a financial meltdown, Trump watered down his tariff plans.The EU’s surrender to Trump shows that China is now the only serious rival to American hegemony. Like Britain since Suez, the EU’s subservience to the US is plain for all to see.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionTariffsTrump administrationEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Deep in a box of crumpled photos and loose negatives, my earnest correspondence to the big man requested nothing but a sibling. I wrotesisterin every possible iteration:half-sister, adopted sister, stepsister, foster sisterand, underneath, just in case Santa couldn’t grant that particular wish, I added the same options forbrother.If Santa somehow turned out to be real and started granting wishes to tired mums in their late 30s, my wish would probably remain the same: I’d rewrite history and add a sibling. A lovely one, preferably, but I’ll take what I can get. Because honestly? Being an only child sucks.My parents split up when I was one. It was the right call, as are most divorces, however it meant the experience of a full sibling was off the table at an early age. I spent my early years with my single mum; we were a great team and I was very comfortable with things as they were. Until I started noticing friends acquiring siblings.I’ve never been prone to nostalgia. But when I stop by our old London home, memories come upon me in a flood | Paul DaleyRead moreWhat fun my friends had with their siblings! An inbuilt playmate! A co-conspirator against the enemy that is parents! Someone to blame when things got broken! Someone to confide in when things got tough! I was sold. My poor mother had to deal with my begging and pleading for a sibling, which unbeknownst to me was her wish too. Circumstances weren’t on our side and, after years of trying to convince her to conjure a sibling out of thin air, I set my sights on my dad and stepmother.I moved in with them at age 12 to attend a high school in the city. With my stepmum being younger than my dad, the chance of a baby half-sibling seemed much higher and I wasted no breath in regularly asking for one. Deep in their PhDs, however, my wish was not to be granted and my teenage years crept by without a sibling in sight.To add to the loneliness of being an only child, I had no cousins I was close with. Either by distance, age or having little in common, it was just me and a bunch of adults. When you’re a kid trying to figure out the world without other kids messing up beside you, it can feel like you’re doing it all wrong. All the focus lands on you and that attention could be utterly mortifying.Nowhere was this more excruciatingly clear than the summer I got my second-ever period during a Christmas trip to visit my grandparents in Sydney. Having not yet braved tampons, I told everyone I’d just skip swimming for the week. But with four adults and no other kids to absorb their attention, it was decided: I would learn to use a tampon.Much to my dismay, my grandpa was sent out to buy mini tampons and, as suggested by my stepmum, a small jar of Vaseline “to help things along”. The process was explained in painful detail by my stepmum, with well-meaning interjections from my grandmother. When I was finally sent off to the bathroom to give it a go, I was acutely aware of the four adults waiting just outside the door, eager for news of my success.‘Let’s get your story straight’ – the words that made my mum an ally, and a human | Emily WatkinsRead moreWhile the tampon incident of 2002 was indeed a success, that summer made me painfully aware of how different I was from families with multiple kids running around. While I’m sure there are mortifying moments in bigger families, at least there’s comfort in knowing you aren’t the only one experiencing toe-curling embarrassment.At the risk of someone pulling out a tiny violin, at 38 my yearning for a sibling has only deepened. The loneliness of being an adult only child is an interesting catch-22 in a time when only-child families are surging and I find myself biting my tongue lest I make someone feel bad for not giving their child a sibling. No one should be made to feel bad for not having more kids, especially not in this economy (or this climate), but it does add a layer to the loneliness of being an only child: feeling like you can’t actually talk about it (I know, I know – tiny violin).So while I’ll never experience the delight of completely unhinged sibling fights that are resolved two seconds later, or the joy of being an aunty to kids I adore that I canhand back, I have gifted my daughters each other. Twenty months into my experience of parenting siblings and I’m already relishing the “But she spat on mefirst!” and the “But I’m not eventouchingher” (said by a seven-year-old whose toe is a millimetre from angry screaming toddler’s face). And somehow, watching them navigate this ridiculous, messy relationship is quietly healing my childhood loneliness.Freya Bennett is a writer based on Dja Dja Wurrung Country and is the co-founder and editor of Ramona MagazineExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilyParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

But the character was revolutionaryDave SchillingHogan was a master of wrestling’s unreality, personifying the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be youThu 31 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.16 EDTShareWhen Hulk Hogan died and a rush of people searched his name on Google to read various obituaries, I’m sure at least some of them were shocked to find that one of the most popular search terms related to the WWE Hall of Famer is “Hulk Hogan lies”. There are countlessvideos,Reddit threads,social media postsand articles detailing all the things the Hulkster apparently said that were either exaggerations, distortions or outright fabrications. One time, Hogan said he was asked to play in Metallica. The banddenied the storystraight away. Hulk said in his autobiography that he partied with John Belushi after WrestleMania 2 in 1986, even though Belushi had died in 1982. There’s also the time where Hulk thought the Jackass star Bam Margera was deadwhen he very much was not.If you aren’t a wrestling fan (you’re reading the Guardian. You’re probably not a wrestling fan) you might wonder why someone who was famous for four decades would feel the need to lie about whether he could have been in Metallica. These are the sorts of lies the quarterback of your high school tells at the reunion. “Andre the Giant was 700lb when I bodyslammed him in from of 200,000 people at the Roman Colosseum” is definitely an anecdote that could get you a free shot at the no-host bar at the Elks Lodge, but if you’re Hulk Hogan, you could just be honest and say Andre was more like 400lb and the crowd was between 80,000 and 93,000, depending on whom you ask. Also, it was in Pontiac, Michigan, not Rome. Hulk Hogan did not need to lie, but he did. Often.Lying, fabrication and multiple layers of reality are fundamental tenets of professional wrestling at every level of the industry. In 2019, I worked at WWE as a writer for their TV show SmackDown just long enough to get fired. I wasn’t there for enough time to actually get good at the art of crafting a compelling wrestling story, but I was there long enough to realize that the most crucial element of wrestling is some form of dishonesty. The performer’s job is to approximate reality, to portray their character not just on TV, but on social media, in the press, and sometimes even at the airport. Wrestling is performance art on an entirely different level. Terry Bollea had to live his life as Hulk Hogan – the bandanna, the tank tops, the white moustache. In his now-infamous reality show, Hogan Knows Best, despite the conceit of seeing inside Hulk’s real home, he was still that character. Terry Bollea was so committed to being Hulk Hogan that he had aformal bandanna for black tie events. No one would be mad if he wore, say, a Kangol hat or maybe … no hat at all? When Hogantestified in the Gawker trial,it was shocking to hear him refer to “Terry Bollea” and “Hulk Hogan” as two different people.The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosityIn the pro wrestling parlance, this veil of fiction is called “kayfabe” – a word with its origin in the old-timey carnival culture that wrestling evolved from. Kayfabe is both a noun to describe the glorious unreality of wrestling and a verb to describe when someone is subtly lying to you (or hiding something incredibly important). In WWE, there are layers of kayfabe, with fewer and fewer people smartened up to what’s happening the deeper you go. The outcomes of the matches are kayfabed. Who is wrestling in the main event of WrestleMania 42 next spring is super kayfabed. This doesn’t seem that terribly different from protecting the ending of a summer blockbuster film, but when you’re inside the business, you realize thateverythingcan be kayfabed. How can you trust anything anyone says? WWE just launched a reality show on Netflix calledUnreal, which claims to lift the veil on the behind-the-scenes creation of their storylines. I immediately said to myself: “This is just another layer of kayfabe.” The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosity. This is the world Hulk Hogan lived in.I still love wrestling, and despite thehorrible things he said and did, I still see Hulk Hogan the character as one of the most influential heroes in American history. He managed to make the most mundane, thunderingly obvious credo (“say your prayers and eat your vitamins, kids!”) sound revolutionary. He knew how to captivate an audience with nothing more than a gesture. He understood the art of platonic seduction – the way to get someone to not just love you, but to think that their struggle is also yours. Wrestling fans – both children and adults – could live vicariously through Hulk Hogan. His appeals in his speeches were to his “Hulkamaniacs”, the fans that gave him the strength to do the impossible. At WrestleMania 3, if Andre the Giant wanted to beat Hulk Hogan for the WWE Championship, he’d also have tocontend with the millions of Hulkamaniacs cheering for him. In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel foryouto travel in.If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is.One of Hulk Hogan’s last televised appearances was at theRepublican national convention in 2024. He tore a Trump T-shirt off his body instead of a Hulkamania shirt and pledged his full fealty to our future president. In some twisted way, it was a passing of the torch. For years, Hulk Hogan had been the apex of wrestling’s art of unreality. His talent for leading the masses peaked around 1988, and as the world got more savvy about WWE’s particular magic trick, the connection severed. He left for a rival company, became a bad guy, and reinvented the art form again. But it could never be quite what it was in the mid-80s. Wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and John Cena could captivate a crowd, but it was nothing like Hulkamania. No one would or could ever truly believe like that again. This is why WWE has to open up (or at least pretend to), like the Soviet Union at the end of the cold war.After years of sitting under the learning tree of WWE’s former owner, Vince McMahon,Donald Trumptook the tools of platonic seduction that Hulk Hogan perfected and applied them to politics. The use of the word “we”, the commonality of struggle, the dastardly enemies to defeat in righteous combat. Even the empty slogans. Is “make America great again” that far removed from “say your prayers and eat your vitamins”?In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel for you to travel inWhen Hulk Hogan exaggerated a story or outright lied, he’d very rarely retract his statement. When he was allowed back in the WWE locker room after tape of his racist tirade circulated publicly, he spentmost of his apologywarning fellow wrestlers to be careful about “getting caught”. Hulk Hogan was a man who made his own truth. He didn’t need to do anything other than live in the world he made for himself. The more he made up about himself, the grander he became. He was truly the greatest American hero, because he personified the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be you. And the more he fashioned himself a superhero, the more we wanted to be him – to fully merge with him into one entity. This power was both awe-inspiring and perhaps the most terrifying weapon any human being could wield in this life.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWrestlingOpinionUS televisionTelevisionUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

A decade later, as our region teeters on the edge of catastrophe, that call is no longer just noble – it is essential.The proposal was not a new Iranian initiative. As far back as 1974, Iran proposed azone free from nuclear weapons in the Middle Eastat the UN, and was soon joined by Egypt. That proposal passed overwhelmingly in the general assembly. After Iraq’s use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, the initiative was expanded in 1990 to cover all weapons of mass destruction. But for half a century, progress has been blocked by Israel and its main patron, the United States.This paralysis is no accident. Despite overwhelming annual support in the UN general assembly and repeated commitments in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), the Middle East remains one of the only regions on Earth without a nuclear weapon-free framework. More than 100 non-aligned states at the1995 NPT review and extension conferencemade progress towards such a zone a condition of the treaty’s indefinite extension. Yet 30 years on, little has changed.In fact, the situation has deteriorated, showing that while possession of nuclear weapons usually leads to reckless adventurism, such weapons in no way assure success, provide invincibility or safety for citizens. Recent unlawful military action by the nuclear-armed Israel – which is not party to the NPT – against Iran’s internationally monitored nuclear facilities brought our region dangerously close to an abyss. The failure of Israel to achieve its unwarranted objectives, and the inability of the US to bringIranto its knees, could and still can engulf this region and by extension the entire world in a forever war.Enough is enough. We must take the future of our region’s security into our own hands. It is time for theMiddle East and north Africato move beyond empty rhetoric and towards genuine regional cooperation – based on mutual respect and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. That is why we propose the creation of the Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement, or Menara, which fittingly means “lighthouse” in Arabic.Menara would be a regional body designed to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation among its members. Open to all qualified states in the Middle East and north Africa, to join, countries must reject the development or deployment of nuclear weapons and commit to mutual verification of their compliance. In return, Menara would help them benefit from peaceful nuclear technology, including energy production, medicine, agriculture and scientific research.Such a body is not a substitute for disarmament – it is a step towards it. Regional nuclear cooperation, with strong safeguards and mutual oversight, can strengthen non-proliferation and enhance energy security without enabling militarisation.It has long been argued that progress on regional disarmament must wait for Israel to disarm. But a regime that has shown no regard for international legitimacy by committing international crimes such as apartheid, genocide and, most recently, mass starvation will hardly be influenced by this negative pressure – it certainly has not been for more than 50 years. And its perilous nuclear arsenal has been and will always remain the gravest threat to international non-proliferation and regional and global peace and stability. Holding hundreds of millions of people hostage to one regime’s nuclear arsenal and political impunity is a recipe for permanent instability. We must find a new way forward.Menara would also help reframe the nuclear debate in the region. For too long, nuclear issues have been cast solely in terms of risk and threat. But nuclear science also offers solutions – to the climate crisis, water scarcity, food security and energy diversification. As oil and gas reserves dwindle, nuclear energy will be vital for regional growth and sustainability. Menara can make this future a shared, secure reality.Here’s how it would work. Menara would coordinate research, education and development across member states. It would support joint ventures in fields ranging from uranium enrichment and waste management to nuclear fusion and medicine. Members would share facilities, pool expertise and ensure transparency through a joint regulatory board. Contributions would be proportional to each country’s capacity, but every member would benefit.The network would be headquartered in one of the participating countries, with branch offices and potentially shared enrichment facilities in others. Oversight would be conducted by a board of governors composed of national representatives, with international observers from the UN, the security council and the International Atomic Energy Agency invited to participate. Crucially, Menara would include robust mutual safeguards to prevent the diversion of materials for military use.Today, more than ever, we in the Middle East and north Africa region have been woken up to a collective cognisance of the horrifying picture of our future unless we seize this moment. We know that mistrust runs deep in our region. Iran has its grievances and so do others. But history must not define our destiny.We call on the nations of the Middle East and north Africa to endorse Menara and begin formal negotiations on its structure, mandate and membership criteria. A regional summit – under the auspices of the UN and with support from global powers – could lay the foundation. Such a step would not only reduce the risk of nuclear conflict but also offer a model for cooperation in a fractured world.The status quo is unsustainable. The nightmare of escalation and its inherent potential to cause proliferation is no longer hypothetical; it is dangerously close to becoming real. But there is still time to choose a different path.Menara can be a beacon guiding us towards a future where the Middle East is no longer a battleground for nuclear brinkmanship, but a leader in peace, progress and responsible energy. The time to act is now.Javad Zarif is associate professor of global studies at the University of Tehran. He was Iran’s foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator from 2013-21.

It’s almost becoming predictable. Every time Tufan Erginbilgiç, chief executive ofRolls-Royce, sets “midterm” financial targets, the aero-engine maker beats them, or looks set to do so, in no time.Back in February, Erginbilgiç was able to declare that the 2027 targets for operating profitswould be hit two years early, so he set new ambitions for 2028. Six months on, even the refreshed numbers look conservative. Aftera strong first-half, Rolls now thinks it will make £3.1bn-£3.2bn of operating profit over the whole of 2025, or about £300m more than previously advertised. At the current rate of rapid progress, it looks a short hop to £3.6bn-£3.9bn in 2028.The shares rose 8% and touched £11 for the first time. Three years ago the price was about £1. A business that requireda £2bn rescue rights issuein the pre-vaccine depths of the pandemic in 2020, is now the fifth largest company in the FTSE 100 index and valued at £90bn.Naturally, Erginbilgiç’s share-based “golden hello” has followed in lock-step. To lure him from the private equity sector, he got £7.5m-worth of Rolls shares when they were 91p in January 2023. That package is now worth a cool £90m, albeit locked up in tranches until 2027 and 2028 (a reassuring detail from the point of view of shareholders).The story of how it has been done is well known by now, even if the pace continues to surprise. Erginbilgiç reorganised Rolls’ top management, removed a layer of costs, culled wasteful sidelines and, critically, invested in the reliability of the engines to allow a “win-win” renegotiation of contracts with airlines. Rolls, a company famed for years for falling short on cash generation, is now churning out the stuff.Meanwhile, markets everywhere are helpful. Demand for civil engines has fully recovered from the pandemic.The Aukus submarine partnership, where Rolls supplies the propulsion systems, underpinned the defence side even before Nato governmentspledged to spend more on heavy equipment. Even the unloved power systems division has been knocked into shape in time for the age of datacentres that require backup generators.So the next question is whether the news can get any better. Can Erginbilgiç possibly maintain the pace?Well, there are two reasons to take seriously his talk about “substantial growth prospects beyond the midterm”. One is the bet on small modular reactors, or SMRs. It is still early days but the UK has ordered three and the Czech Republic six, so we will eventually discover whether these scaled-down nuclear plants can be built on time and on budget. If the answer is yes, then possibilities open up. Like the Czechs, the rest of eastern and central Europe probably wants a cost-efficient alternative to Russian gas. Power-hungry “hyperscale” datacentres in the US represent another set of potential customers.The SMR unit will be “profitable and cashflow positive by 2030”, said Erginbilgiç. Before that date, we may be asking what the operation would be worth as a spunoff, separately listed company – Rolls has a 62% stake at the moment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rolls is currently exclusively widebody, but its UltraFan development engine is intended to be capable of being adapted for both markets. The enormous costs mean Rolls would need a partner (the City’s guess is Pratt & Whitney), a committed airline customer and would probably demand government support. But the narrow market is much larger than the wide one – it could be genuinely transformative for Rolls.A cynical view says something always goes wrong at Rolls sooner or later, which was the experience over a couple of decades of false dawns. If there is a difference this time, it is that the company is finally producing heaps of cash, which is the real measure of success in its business. Don’t mess it up: the UK engineering sector needs a reliable world-leader.Explore more on these topicsRolls-RoyceNils Pratley on financeAerospace industryManufacturing sectorAirline industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Get a landlineEmma BrockesA group of parents in Maine were wary of buying smartphones for their 10-year-olds – and took a drastic stepThu 31 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 11.46 EDTShareAmong the many useless but consoling facts I’ve hung on to at the expense of real knowledge is the telephone number of my best friend from high school. I can say it in my head – 612505 – and, like a combination lock, it throws open the door to a memory of me sitting on the stairs after school, yakking to the person I’d just said goodbye to on the bus. Given it’s more than 30 years since I used that number, I have to assume it will stay with me – along with the lyrics to the Cadbury’s Roses ad from 1983, the name of the fictional head teacher ofSummer Bay High (Mr Fisher)and my own telephone number from that era (623492) – until the day I die.I hadn’t given much thought to landlines or the teenage experience of sitting on them after school every day, until a recent piece in the Atlantic shared the results of a small, highly localised experiment: in Portland, Maine, a parent nervous of giving her 10-year-old child a smartphone took the eccentric step ofreintroducing a landline, and then persuaded the parents of her child’s friends to do the same. Before she knew it, between 15 and 20 families in the area had reinstalled landlines for their preteens in what the Atlantic called a “retro bubble”. Charming scenes ensued, communications habits changed, and everyone learned a valuable lesson about the advantages of ancient technology.The funny thing about this is that unlike the brick phone, another answer to the puzzle of how to keep children off social media, the families of Portland discovered that the very thing that limits the landline – the fact it’s attached to the wall – turned out to be one of its big attractions. Most families put the phone in a high-traffic area of the house, keeping their kid at least notionally in the mix rather than shut away in their room. This was a tactic popular in the early days of home computers, when parents would put the family’s single, giant desktop on a table in the kitchen so the kid wasn’t isolated or left alone with “the internet”, a healthy instinct that smartphones effectively killed.For the kids involved, pivoting to landlines entailed a conceptual leap as big as any they’d encountered: the amazing Russian roulette of having to pick up a ringing phone to discover who was on the other end; the mediation experience of having to say hello to a parent and ask politely to be put through to their child; the need to memorise a number; and the wildest thing of all, trying to remember that phoning a friend on a landline meant that, if they picked up, they could only possibly be in one place, so that shouting “ARE YOU HOME?!” down the phone, as one young case study did, made no sense whatsoever (but was very funny).None of the families involved had an interest in reducing the contact their children had with their friends. But they were concerned with the issue of distraction – that kids speaking to each other on smartphones are often scrolling at the same time – and one of the reported findings was that the old-fashioned phones encouraged them to become “better listeners”. For anyone who grew up getting home from school, changing out of their uniform and getting straight on the phone to carry on the conversation they’d broken off an hour earlier, this idea of extracting formal skills and takeaways from basic behaviours seems part of the broader parenting shift towards turning every last thing into an effing learning experience.On the other hand, I get it; the appeal of old phones is rooted in nostalgia but also in the idea that there is something wholesome about the relative transparency of landlines and returning to a way of doing things that, while it annoyed parents back in the day, didn’t strike the fear of God into them. Pre-mobile phones, the main anxiety suffered by parents with kids who were forever on the phone was that they were going to “run up the bill”, “tie up the line”, or fritter their life away gossiping, all adorably quaint concerns. No one can groom or catfish a child via a hunk of plastic attached to the wall.What was the takeaway for us, who grew up on landlines? I guess if mobiles these days exert an enormous gravitational pull in our pockets, still some other order of magic existed around the old landlines. “I’ll get it!”; “it’s for me!”; redundant phrases now that, back then, spoke to the tiny thrill of election that came from receiving a call via the family phone – and like ghosts from the deep past, the lifelong dedication to memory of the numbers.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionTelecomsChildrenSmartphonesMobile phonesFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Our politicians must not allow the EHRC to further shatter trans livesThu 31 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 05.48 EDTShareThe supreme court judgment on the application of the 2010 Equality Act has rendered the UK’s system of legal gender recognition entirely hollow. It has ruled thatmen like me who have gender recognition certificates are defined as women in equality law, which applies to organisations ranging from workplaces to public services and sporting bodies. Vice versa for trans women.For context, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 was passed after the European court of human rights ruled that the “intermediate zone”, between two sexes, in which trans people were then forced to exist was – and, crucially, remains – unlawful. Under the Gender Recognition Act, I am male “for all purposes”, but the supreme court decided this is not the case under the Equality Act.In effect, it is not the casein public.Having run what human rights organisations criticised as anunusually shortsix-week public consultation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will soon update its code of practice about how this legal interpretation of the Equality Act will be applied. This will then go to parliament to be approved by ministers, as things stand,with no opportunity for debate.Far from clarity,experts arguethat the supreme court ruling has created legal uncertainty and contradiction and that the EHRC’s response has been highly questionable. Rather than despair, as understandable as that would be, many trans people live in hope that their MPs are fair, ethical people, who have simply not had the opportunity to fully understand any of this. Which is why, late last month, roughly 900 people travelled from as far as Scotland and Cornwall to queue outside parliament in punishing heat to meet them in person.Many of those people were trans. Others were their loved ones, colleagues and allies. Westminster Hall and the lobby grew so busy that many never got inside. Those who hadn’t managed to pre-book a meeting with their MP queued again in the hubbub to “green card” their representative, an arcane system whereby a constituent requests their presence via a slip of green paper. Organisers were surprised by how many MPs spoke to, perhaps for the first time, someone who happened to be trans. Trans Solidarity Alliance’s director, Jude Guaitamacchi, described the conversations in stark terms: “It’s ‘Look me in the eye and tell me you’re willing to destroy my life’.”This is known as a mass lobby, a direct and old-fashioned tactic for getting MPs’ attention. What choice do trans people have at this point? Over the past 10 years, their rights have been chipped away in Britain, their lives made increasingly difficult byanti-trans lobbyistswith more influential connections and far more money. Systemic transphobia has captured our public institutions with terrifying speed. For its part, the supreme court refused to hear anyinterventions from trans people before deciding on its recent, devastating ruling.Things were so different in 2016. When North Carolina passed a shocking “bathroom bill” banning trans people from using the correct bathroom, the Labour MP Ruth Cadbury told the Commons that “a bathroom bill would never be passed here in the UK”. In the same debate, the Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage welcomed a new NHS policy prescribing cross-sex hormones to young gender-variant people, acknowledging this was “consistent with international guidelines”, a description that, were it not forwell-documented lobbying, would hold today.Maria Miller, a former Conservative MP, cited fairer treatment of trans prisoners as progress “on which Britain leads the way”. Concluding,she said: “Better protecting trans people does not mean diminishing the protections in place for women. It is not a zero-sum game and we should not allow those who attempt to paint it as such, and who try to undermine the position and legitimate rights of trans people, to succeed.” What on earth has happened? Today, any MP who dared say that protecting trans people and protecting women go hand in hand would incur the wrath of politicians and commentators from the right to the centre left.Perhaps current Labour ministers privately justify the state’s capitulation to the anti-trans lobby as political expediency. Perhaps they did the same when branding many peaceful protesters against genocide as terrorists. This government is makingdecisionafterdecisionthat betrays its own principles and those of itsactual voters, who will not be fooled again. It’s cold comfort that trans people are not alone in being thrown under the bus by a PM whopromised an endto culture wars.Maybe the growing number of MPs who feel betrayed by their leaders are reason for hope. They must find the courage to defend their trans constituents, too. Whether they cite the UK’svertiginous slidedown European LGBTQ+ rights rankings, the Council of Europe beingasked to investigatethe proposed implementation of the ruling or the contents of the more than 50,000 responses to the EHRC’s public consultation on its code of practice, they will not lack for evidence to back them up.MPs who attended the mass lobby probably learned alarming things about what the EHRC’s code of practice might look like, based on the interim guidance it released in April, which is being challenged in the high cout by the Good Law project. They might have heard from the news or comment pages that women who are trans may be banned from women’s loos and shelters. What they probably did not hear is that the EHRC’s interim guidance also says a women-only gardening club with more than 25 members will belegally requiredto exclude a trans woman, even if she’s legally a woman, and even if her fellow members want her there.Transgender campaigners call for European rights body to report on UKRead morePerhaps you’re just learning this, too. If so, pause a moment longer to consider what this would mean. This guidance, were it to become legally enshrined, would rob citizens, trans and otherwise, of the freedom to choose whom they associate with and to recognise others for who they truly are.It not only takes away trans peoples’ right to define themselves in relation to their families and friends, but the freedom of those families and friends too. Does someone married to a trans woman no longer have a wife? Does the mother of a trans son, against her better knowledge, now have a daughter?What does this say about the courts’ and government’s readiness to curtail the freedoms of other minorities that, through no fault of their own, become politically inconvenient?The fight for trans safety is a fight for everyone’s safety, whatever your identity, however you present, whatever your beliefs. The decade-long campaign against trans people is not about anyone’s safety. It is exactly what it looks like: an organised effort to drive a tiny minority from public life, back into the closet.Do not let yourselves be fooled. MPs, consider what has changed since 2016 (hint: it isn’t trans people), listen to what you heard at the mass lobby, heed the 100,000 who marched for London trans pride last weekend. The EHRC’s proposals must be properly challenged and debated.

It kept the markets and the nations guessing amid last-minute uncertainty. It attempted to reassert the global heft of the United States economy to take on and master all comers. And it placed President Trump at the centre of the media story, where he always insists on being.In the event, there were some last-minute agreements struck this week, few of them fair or rational in trade terms, most of them motivated by the desire to generate some commercial order. Some conflicts are still in the balance. There were 11th-hour court challenges too, disputing the president’s very right to play the trade war game in this way.Even now, no one, probably including Mr Trump himself, knows whether this is his administration’s last word on US tariffs. Almost certainly not. That’s because Mr Trump’s love of tariffs is always more about the assertion of political clout rather than economic power. Mr Trump’s antipathy towards the European Union drives one example. The pact agreed by Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland last weekend underlines that theEU’s aspirationsas a global economic superpower exceed its actual clout. The EU could not prevent Mr Trump making European goods 15% more expensive if they sell on US markets. Nor could it stop Mr Trump getting EU tariffs on US goods withdrawn.Equally eloquent about the global balance of economic power is that Mr Trump has not been able to force China to bend the knee in the manner of the EU. China hasresponded aggressivelyto Trump’s tariff threats, retaliating with tariffs of its own and blocking the sale of commodities, including rare-earth minerals, that the US most covets. Unsurprisingly, this standoff has not produced one of Mr Trump’s so-called deals. Friday’s deadlinehas been resetfor later in the month. It would be no surprise if it was eventually pushed back further.Mr Trump is not imposing tariffs on the rest of the world in order to promote global trade or even to boost the US economy. He is doing it, in part, because Congress has delegated this power to him, allowing the president to impose or waive tariffs at will. He uses this power for many purposes. These include raising government income without congressional oversight and also, because tariffs are regressive, shifting the tax burden away from the very rich, like Mr Trump himself, on to the middle and working class.But economics also comes way down the field in the list of reasons why Mr Trump is wielding the tariff weaponinternationally. US talks with Brazil – with which the US runs a trade surplus, not a deficit – have beenhijackedby Mr Trump’s grievance over the prosecution of its former president Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overturn his 2022 election defeat. Talks with India are deadlocked because Mr Trump wants to penalise Delhi for buying energy and weapons from Russia. Those withCanadahave been hit by Mr Trump’s objections to Ottawa’s plan to recognise Palestine.The ultimate test of the policy, however, will indeed beeconomic. For now, financial markets appear to have decided that Mr Trump’s tariffs are manageable. If tariffs now raise thecost of goodson US high streets, slowing growth and feeding inflation, as they may, the wider market response could change quickly. In that event, the mood among American voters might even shift too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some of them had worked with British forces in Afghanistan. The result was that thousands were secretly relocated to the UK. A superinjunction covered up the story for almost two years.But the shocking security lapse is far from the only example of Afghans being failed since Kabul fell to the Taliban in 2021. Many more are now at risk because the countries to which they fled are pushing them out. The mirage of a more moderate Taliban was soon shattered by their imposition of gender apartheid and the brutalityfaced by minorities. Three-quarters of the populationstruggle to meet their daily needs. Women are particularly vulnerable. Humanitarian support isbeing slashed. Adroughtand now the loss of overseas remittances are deepening the crisis.Yet almost 2 million Afghan refugees and migrants in neighbouring countries have returned or been forced to return home this year alone – thousands of them unaccompanied children,according to UN experts. More than 1.5 million Afghans have returned from Iran in 2025, with Iran accelerating expulsions after the war with Israel, which fedsuspicion towards migrants.Pakistan began deporting unregistered Afghans in late 2023, after attacks by militants in border areas, but has widened its campaign to those who hold documents. More than two-thirds havenever lived in Afghanistan, according to the International Crisis Group; their families fled conflict decades ago. In some cases, security forces are forcibly repatriating Afghans. In others, threats, harassment or intimidation have chased them out.The Trump administration has announced the removal of temporary protected status from almost 12,000 Afghans in the US, though an appeals courthas for nowblocked it from doing so. The US said that conditions in Afghanistan no longer merited the status. Tajikistanhas also ordered Afghans to leave.UN expertshave warnedthat former officials, including judges and lawyers, human rights defenders and journalists and other critics of the Taliban, along with religious and ethnic minorities, are at particular risk if they are returned. Women and girls are being deported to a country where they can no longerattend secondary schoolor university and are prohibited from letting their voices be heard outside the house, and where the EU has estimated that basic health services are available tojust 10% of women. By driving women out of jobs and severely restricting their movements, the Taliban have ensured that female-headed householdsface destitution. The prospect of return is particularly frightening for women’s rights activistswho face imprisonment or deathfor their work.Pakistan and Iran should not force Afghans home – endangering lives and ending education for girls. But other governments too bear responsibility for this crisis. Poorer nations have been left to shoulder the strain of a high number of refugees, some of whom are in limbo due to Germany’s closure ofa humanitarian admission programme, andthe bureaucracy surrounding a similiar programme in Australia. This has been a triple failure: a failure to welcome Afghans with a strong case for resettlement; to support them in countries which have accepted them; and to help those who are returning to Afghanistan. Western countries must live up to their promises to the Afghan people.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromRoss Armstrong, Pamela HopeandSushila DhallThu 31 Jul 2025 12.59 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 14.45 EDTShareThe upcoming launch of a new party by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana (Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana agree to launch leftwing party, 24 July) will inevitably prompt questions about whether this will divide the progressive vote or offer a genuine alternative to Labour’s centrist drift, especially as the Green party continues to grow as a principled voice for environmental and social justice. Although these projects are potential rivals, they need not be.If the disturbing rise of rightwing populism is to be successfully confronted, the left must overcome fragmentation and find ways to coexist and collaborate. The Corbyn-Sultana initiative and the Greens share much common ground: arejection of austerity, commitment to democratic reform and a belief in economic and ecological justice. Their differences in emphasis, tone and priorities are real but not irreconcilable.There has to be scope for a non-aggression pact at the next general election, with each party standing aside in constituencies where the other has a better chance of success. Joint campaigning on core issues – such as proportional representation, protest rights, wealth taxes and a green new deal – could amplify their impact, and framing climate action as central to economic justice, not separate from it, could provide a unifying narrative for both.This is not about merging or blurring identities. It is about strategic and political maturity. If the left cannot cooperate when so much is at stake, it will surrender the field to those who thrive on division and fear. Unity does not require uniformity; it requires courage and purpose. The worse case, of a public war of words and clashing candidacies between the Greens and Corbynites, would demoralise voters and hand the initiative to the populist right.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, ShropshireYour report quotes Labour party sources who are dismissive of the threat fromJeremy Corbynand then bluntly states that Corbyn “lost the 2017 and 2019 elections as party leader”. It would have provided a fairer context if you had pointed out that in 2017, the Corbyn-led Labour party achieved 2.5m more votes (and a 6% higher vote share) than Keir Starmer did in 2024. Even in 2019, 500,000 more people voted for Corbyn’s party than Starmer’s.Dr Chris MorrisKidderminster, WorcestershireIn the winter election of 2019 I spent hours leafleting for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. The sensation of cold and wet letterboxes still lingers on my fingertips when I think of what he said inan Observer article just after the election– that Labour had lost the election but won the argument. This is all Mr Corbyn is interested in doing – winning the argument – and indeed I think he will find that is all he ever will win.Ross ArmstrongChesterThank you to Jeremy Corbyn for still caring enough and having the humanity to rally the 99% to join together and put 40 years of neoliberal theft and exploitation behind us. I support all his domestic policies, but the realpolitik of foreign policy bothers me.

It’s called women’s football and the Lionesses, 28 July). From the first defeat against France to the final penalties against Spain, England were one match from returning home. Against Sweden, they were about 10 minutes from doing that, and against Italy just over a minute. In the final, they were forced into a rearguard action for pretty much the whole game.If the men’s team had done that, every single player would be called a legend the length and breadth of the country – quite rightly. As it is the women’s team, misogynists are queueing up online to say it is a worthless achievement, as they hate to see female successes.For the last two seasons I have been going to the Emirates Stadium to watch Arsenal women’s team with my wife, who never had the opportunity to play the sport she loves, and my daughter, who has been playing for 15 years in various football teams. The crowd is overwhelmingly young, female, enthusiastic and tolerant, to the extent that I have seen Tottenham and Arsenal supporters sitting together. Yes, there is support for Arsenal, but there is no hatred for the opposition. I would never go to a men’s match, with its poisonous, threatening and exclusionary atmosphere.For me, there is only one type of football I want to see, and it is the football played by these remarkable women. They are role models to everyone, young and old, irrespective of gender. They show the best side of sport and the abuse they receive just shows their detractors up for what they are. You will see me there this season with my “Russo 23” shirt, watching these amazing heroines.David PearceGillingham, KentTom Garry is perceptive in saying that Three Lions was too melancholy a tune to be played after recent Lionesses’ victories (Analysis, 27 July). For almost 30 years that wretched jingle has been a soundtrack to defeat and failure. It should be forgotten, along with the misery it accompanied. Compare the deflating mood it evokes with the exhilaration occasioned by just a few bars of Sweet Caroline, which spurs those triumphant memories of Wembley 2022 and now Basel.Richard StanleyBristolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But the starvation of Tigrayans in northern Ethiopia in the 1980s was as man-made as that of Gaza.The Ethiopian government of the time blocked food from reaching Tigray to starve it into submission. The earlier government of Emperor Haile Selassie did likewise, and also persuaded its ally, the British government, tobomb Tigray in 1943.Today, the starvation, and the rape and killing of Tigrayans, continues as the Pretoria agreement, which was supposed to bring peace after the most recent war on Tigray, in which 600,000 Tigrayans perished (2020-22), has not been fully implemented.Many Tigrayans are still unable to return to their ancestral homes in western Tigray as it is occupied by hostile forces from other Ethiopian regions and from neighbouring Eritrea.

Say what you like about the world’s most desiccated, Miss Havisham-ish team sport, out there trailing around the post-colonial world still dressed in its yellowing wedding dress. It’s definitely got a sense of humour.On day one of the fifth England-India Testthis was expressed in cosmic terms, and a single bold and improbable dramatic arc. Talk about groundsmen a lot. Tell groundsmen they’re nothing. One thing is for sure. You’re going to find yourself spending quite a lot of time watching groundsmen.England v India: fifth men’s cricket Test, day one – as it happenedRead moreOr in this case watching the personage we must now refer to as controversial groundsman Lee Fortis, celebrity Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis, an otherwise peripheral figure with a name that sounds like an Anglo-Saxon burial site in Norfolk, but who was promoted in the buildup to this Test into an instrument of the sporting-political power struggle.And so it came to pass in the first two sessions at the Oval, as India and England traipsed on and off between the showers, and Fortis loomed, somehow inevitably, centre stage. Here is Lee Fortis striding about his domain in classic shorts and boots combos, like a proud, captive bear. Here is Lee Fortis tugging at a tarpaulin.Here is Lee Fortis all alone in his lime green field as the drizzle fell and the walkways around the ground took on the feel of a slowly sinking ship peopled only by pint-sozzled mariners in chino shorts, and watched from behind the plateglass by his chief adversary, India’s head coach, Gautam Gambhir. In a Test series shot through with politics, rumblings and noises off, they’ve finally dragged in the bloke with the rake. Welcome to the Fortis-verse.It is the most unlikely turn of events. Fortis is familiar figure around here, a huge ambling man with the classic groundsman’s shape, as though he’s been hinged together out of sacks of cement and packed into a pair of shorts. Who thinks of the groundsman? What are they? They sit on mowers. They walk with sawdust buckets. They follow the seasons, disturbed only by their personal kryptonite, people walking near a rope, signal for instant and uncontainable explosions of boggle-eyed fury.View image in fullscreenIndia head coach Gautam Gambhir (second left) and Oval head groundkeeper, Lee Fortis, were involved in a spat earlier this week over where the Indian players were training.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAAnd yet, look a little closer, squint at the magic eye picture, and something else has begun to emerge here, the groundsman as instrument of power and conspiracy. By 2pm on Thursday afternoon, 48 hours on from that unnecessary spat with Gambhir, Fortis had been memed and replicated and spun out across the global hive mind.Oval curator breaks silence. Fortis v Gambhir: the full story. Who is Lee Fortis and what does he mean? There are Fortis YouTube clips (jerky spat footage; weird ad hoc media huddle) that have been viewed two million times. Lee Fortis stuns fans with body transformation. This simple Lee Fortis trick will change your life for ever. Seventeen times Lee Fortis broke the internet (No 12 will shock you!)More fuel was added overnight as R Ashwin labelled Fortis a habitual offender. Really? It’s not the first time he’s yelled at people to get off his square? You shock me. Meanwhile, the groundsman community has sprung to his defence, a Facebook page speaking for this maligned minority demanding respect, understanding, a safe space for its members. What next? A Fortis spin-off vehicle. The Fortis origins story. A Fortis male grooming range. Jake Paul calls out Lee Fortis in sensational Vegas standoff.Or perhaps it won’t come to that. Because this is at the same time absolutely nothing, chaff, gossip, and also a grim little episode that reflects poorly on Gambhir in particular; and perhaps also on the general power dynamics of elite cricket in its current form.The initial incident was a standard stramash over practising too close, or so Fortis said, to the square. Gambhir’s response was furious. Any situation where you end up wagging a finger and shouting, “You’re nothing, you’re just a groundsman, nothing beyond that,” is one that has lost any sense of scale.Later Fortis was swarmed by Indian journalists and gave the greatest no comment interview of all time, unveiling a technique that should be urgently coached to all celebrities and politicians, which basically involves just saying “I’m not ... You’re not ... I’m not really,” to every question.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt is a fairly simple divvying up at this point. Gambhir was always in the wrong here. First because all groundsmen are grumpy. They have to venerate, love and fetishise this patch of green. They have the artist’s temperament. They feel the hand of history. They basically just want you to stay off their square and stop playing cricket.But mainly Gambhir was wrong because of the ugliness of his choice of words, and the sense of punching down. England got to show their boorishness in Manchester. This was India’s turn. India’s coach is a born-to-rule type, high caste Hindu, private schoolboy, son of a wealthy industrialist, BJP politician, a Jay Shah man, a Modi guy. It sits a little uncomfortably to hear anyone with such privilege dismissing a bloke with a bucket as “nothing”, unqualified to make demands of his betters.View image in fullscreenOpener KL Rahul was bowled by Chris Woakes as England had India in trouble yesterday.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APIn this context Gambhir v Fortis speaks, if you choose to see it, to the way India wields its commercial and political power in this sport; to the sense that here is an overlord nation that can basically do what it wants, that is in effect untouchable. This is the most unfavourable version of events. More prosaically Gambhir does just love a fight, is essentially a grudge in a cap, outspoken and commendably feisty.In a happier turn there was at least a kind of rapprochement at the start of play between Fortis and India’s players, a little wary banter and some smiles. After which, once the showers had cleared, it was a case of the groundsman’s revenge, as Gambhir got to watch India’s batters sparring and hopping and nicking as the ball leapt and jagged about on Fortis’ chosen strip.England’s pace attack had looked rusty at the start, both Jamie Overton and Josh Tongue perhaps paying tribute the 2.5m distance rule by almost missing the cut part of the pitch. But they chipped away and found movement. Shubman Gill had batted with sculpted elegance, all perfect arms, shoulders, lines, balletic in the way he shifts his weight, then ran himself out trying to take a single to Gus Atkinson’s right hand in his follow through.With India on 204 for six at the end of play the series already felt a little safer. Hopefully the age of Lee is also done. Andy Warhol would later revise his most famous line to the more depressingly accurate “in 15 minutes everyone will be famous”. Fortis had his day in the gloom. With any luck hands will now be shaken, an unpleasant tone revised, and the whole thing can be safely packed away in the shed behind the pigeon nets.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the competition gets tougher, the margin of error gets smaller.”It is his final answer in an interview that takes in everything from the “blue-collar nature of Birmingham”, which he compares with Cleveland and Cincinnati, to theChampionshiplandscape and the bubbling rivalry with Aston Villa, which he was educated on during his first visit to England’s second-biggest city after acquiring his 3.3% stake.It is a moment detailed in the opening scene of Built in Birmingham: Brady & the Blues, the Prime Video documentary series released on Friday, as he travels past a giant mural depicting Jude Bellingham and Trevor Francis. “What’s the other team here?” he asks. “Fuck them … gonna fuck them up too,” he says, smiling.Brady and Tom Wagner, the Birmingham chairman, are in bullish moods for our interview. Wagner’s mantra is “if you can’t say it, you can’t do it” and he is adamant Birmingham will return to the Premier League. But when? “The sooner the better,” he replies.“I think it would be great for the city of Birmingham to have an inner-city derby that brings fans together in a non-violent way; we don’t want it to be peaceful, we don’t want it to be violent either, but we want to allow them the joy of experiencing that great rivalry again. I love reading the comments from Villa supporters, but I think it’s beyond that. There’s so many other great clubs we would love to compete against.”The series contains colourful characters, differing generations of supporters. “We’ve had so many rebirths,” says one, Paul Collins, “but they’ve all been phantom pregnancies.”There is a potted history taking in Barry Fry urinating in all four corners of St Andrew’s to lift a curse and other amusing moments. “I fell in love with fixing businesses,” says Wagner, the co-founder of Knighthead Capital, the multibillion investment fund that acquired a controlling stake two years ago.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City chair Tom Wagner celebrates the Blues’ League One title win at St Andrew’s.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesOn their arrival at Birmingham, one-third of the ground had been condemned, there was no hot water in the men’s toilets and no heating in the executive offices. “We’re not even close to being done, and now we’re embarking on an even more ambitious feat,” Wagner says of plans to build a sports quarter on a 60-acre site with a 62,000-seat stadium, more than double the current capacity. “We want to compete at the top level of the Championship [this season].”After their final home game last season, Wagner enjoyed a mic-drop moment, telling those present: “The best part of the story is just beginning. I promise you this is not the best day we will enjoy together.”Perhaps the most surreal moment of the series is Sir David Beckham, among the VIP guests forBirmingham’s home win over Wrexhamlast September, explaining to Brady the insulting chants Birmingham fans are directing at their Welsh counterparts. What else did Beckham teach him that night?Brady laughs. “A few things that were being said … some of it I couldn’t really fully understand because there’s some thick accents that I’m not 100% educated on yet, but David’s helped me out.” Another time we see Brady mastering his pronunciation of Birmingham en route to the training ground. “I learned that pretty early on. When I first did my social media video [announcing my involvement], they said: ‘It’s Birmingham, not Birming-ham.’”View image in fullscreenBirmingham City co-owner Tom Brady (left) chats with David Beckham in the stands before the League One match against Wrexham at St Andrew’s in September 2024.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWrexham, also promoted last season, have become friendly foes. Wagner says other teams “want in” on Birmingham’s brewing competition with the Welsh club, owned by the Hollywood pair Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.“Rivalries are very important because they allow you to focus at a different level: your concentration, effort, it all becomes very maximised when you’re playing against these rivals,” Brady says. “The fundamentals of the sport [football], the tactics, are different to American football. It’s a different sport but the values are very much the same.”After that win over Wrexham, there is a snapshot into the bigger picture, a reminder that this is business after Wagner congratulates manager, Chris Davies, and his staff. “I’m going to go back upstairs, we’ve got 1,000 people we’re trying to get to spend money in the club so that you guys can spend more next summer,” says Wagner, a former certified public accountant on Wall Street.One of his primary aims is building revenues to close the gap to clubs awarded parachute payments. Asked whether the numbers are where he expected this summer, Wagner says they have smashed this season’s original target. “My team loves it when they achieve a goal and I say: ‘Well, now it’s 10% higher’,” he says.

That’s the way we think about the club and that’s what our objectives are aimed towards – not just getting to the Prem, but then being there for good, and then ultimately becoming competitive.”View image in fullscreenBirmingham City’s manager Chris Davies speaks to his players in the dressing room.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoBirmingham are looking forward but the appointment of Wayne Rooney backfired. The first episode touches on Rooney’s tenure: two wins in 15 matches and 83 days in charge, a run that paved the way to relegation. Wagner says now he “wouldn’t trade that history for the world, because the lessons were invaluable”. We see an awkward, small talk exchange between Brady and Rooney and, later, with Brady stewing in the car after leaving the training ground, comes a telling remark. “I’m a little bit worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” Brady says.Rooney was sacked in January 2024 and Brady is reluctant to linger on the past: “I have very high expectations for myself and certainly for a club and people I associate with, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Wayne. He’s one of the greatest players to step on to a football pitch. And that was a couple of years ago, at this point Chris is our manager … I love Chris’s work ethic, attitude, determination and humility.”On deadline day last summer, Birmingham made a splash after signing Jay Stansfield for a record-breaking £15m fee from Fulham. Episode three focuses on the England Under-21 striker’s return toExeter City, for whom his late father, Adam, also played. We hear from Taylor, one of Stansfield’s younger brothers, who joined Birmingham as kit man during Stansfield’s loan at the club, and their mother, Marie. “As a footballer, he is just like his dad … he even runs like his dad,” she says. “They both run with their pinky finger out,” Taylor says, smiling. Marie is in the stand opposite the one renamed after Adam, which Stansfield blows a kiss towards after scoring a penalty.Birmingham have been aggressive in the market this summer, too, with the returning Demarai Gray and the former Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi two of eight signings. More new faces are expected to follow. So, how does Wagner reflect on his time as chair? “I think the biggest metric for us is the increased amount of interest that we have in the club from new and existing supporters, where we’re now enjoying record levels of season-ticket sales,” he says of the 20,000 signed up this season and referencing the 15,000-strong season-ticket waiting list, a first for the club.View image in fullscreenJay Stansfield surges forward at a rainy St James Park in November 2024.Photograph: Izzy Ninnis/ShutterstockIt is apt that Birmingham host Ipswich, the last team to win back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, in the Championship curtain-raiser a week on Friday.The final episode takes in one of few hiccups under Knighthead: defeat in the Vertu Trophy final at Wembley in April. “I don’t like losing,” says Wagner. “I’ll back that up,” says Brady. “We sold 50,000 tickets and when the last ticket sold, there were 23,000 people on the phone waiting to purchase tickets,” Wagner adds.“Whatever we’re doing seems to be resonating with people, in that they want to be a part of the journey. We knew it was a big club with a lot of supporters but I don’t think we appreciated how many live and die with us on match day.”Explore more on these topicsBirmingham CityChampionshipUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rozman is described on the Ineos Grenadiers website as “one of the longest-serving members of our staff” who “takes on the important role of head carer”.Tour de France Femmes: Squiban’s perfect attack earns home favourite stage six winRead moreThe Slovenian spent four weeks last year working alongside United’s soft tissue therapists as part of an exchange programme introduced after Sir Jim Ratcliffebecame co-owner at Manchester United.In a statement issued to the Guardian on 24 July, Ineos said Rozman had spoken “informally” to the ITA in April when he was told he was not under investigation but added: “Following recent media allegations, David Rozman has now received a request from the ITA to attend an interview. Accordingly, he has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.”The allegations stem from a recent documentary made by ARD in Germany, which made claims linking Rozman to Schmidt but did not name him, with further media reports including alleged texts between the Ineos staff member and Schmidt from June 2012, when the team were racing as Team Sky.The documentary and subsequent reports were said to have drawn on court transcripts and in-court reporting during the Aderlass hearings, which resulted in Schmidt being jailed in 2021 for orchestrating a doping ring revolving around cross-country skiers and multiple cyclists between 2012 and 2019.Dave Brailsford, the head of Ineos Sport, whoreturned to the Tour de Francethis July after his sojourn at Manchester United, declined to comment on the Rozman allegations during the race.

Woad may well be the name on everyone’s lips but, on day two, she will barely feature on anybody’s screens.Perhaps it is a sign of this major’s rapid growth that everyone wants more. Nonetheless, fans will find it unsatisfactory that, with daily television coverage beginning at noon, Woad – plus Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko – will play the vast majority of her second round minus the eyeballs of anyone not in attendance at Royal Porthcawl. This is now a recurring theme after Leona Maguire took to social media to point out her hole in one at the recent Evian Championship was not caught on camera. Woad begins day two at 8.09am, with Ko for company and Korda two groups behind.Golf’s elite hail Lottie Woad as ‘breath of fresh air’ before Open challengeRead moreSky Sports, which screens the Women’s Open in the UK, has a partnership with the R&A which it understandably will not compromise by criticising this tournament’s officials. Insiders at the broadcaster insist they would be keen on extended live hours from next year. For that to happen, the R&A would need to bestow significant funds on European Tour Productions, which provides a world feed for television companies to use. At Porthcawl, that coverage begins at 12 o’clock. The R&A did increase the prize fund for 2025 by $250,000 (£190,000) and player facilities are a notable upgrade on the vast majority of women’s golf events; but what of seeing it to be it? The men’s Open coverage at Royal Portrush two weeks ago began at 6.30am on Thursday and Friday.In the toughest of Thursday’s conditions Woad signed for a level-par 72. The highlight of the 21-year-old’s day was a birdie putt from off the green at the 6th. Another birdie, at the last, ensured she sits five from the lead. “It was OK, a bit mixed,” Woad said. “It was one of those rounds that could definitely have got away from me so I am happy with the way I hung in there.”Mimi Rhodes has won three times on this year’s Ladies European Tour, a matter that has been somewhat lost in fevered excitement over Woad. Rhodes served the latest notice of her ability with a 69 and can be added to the Friday morning blackout list.Ko’s title defence began with a one-over-par 73. The New Zealander was harmed by a birdie-free back nine of 38. Korda’s 70 felt notable. The world No 1 tied second in this event last year. Wales’s Darcey Harry and the Australian Minjee Lee were among those to match Korda’s score.View image in fullscreenJapan’s Rio Takeda holds a share of the lead after day one.Photograph: Nigel French/PAJapanese golfers otherwise dominate the early leaderboard.

A decade ago, Dunne led the Open Championship at St Andrews before injury and loss of form took hold. “That’s more a question for him I think,” said Hall when asked if Dunne will return to competitive golf. “Obviously right now he’s not playing and he’s just kind of supporting me, which I am very grateful for. He’s a very good player. He doesn’t give himself enough credit.

The forecast rain stayed away for the decisive second Test in Melbourne, but the outlook for the Accor Stadium on Saturday is properly damp. Not that the Lions are overly bothered as they seek to squeeze every last drop of joy out of their tour of Australia.From the moment they met up the mantra of this party has been based on showing the absolute best of themselves in the Test matches and winning the series 3-0. Nothing has changed in that regard, as reflected in Farrell’s largely rinse‑and-repeat final-Test selection, with the exception of Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan being elevated to the starting XV and a forward-loaded 6-2 bench split.Andy Farrell says scrapping Lions tours to Australia is ‘insulting’Read moreAs anyone with knowledge of Farrell’s competitive instincts will be aware, the chances of him easing off the downcast Wallabies at this late juncture were always on the nonexistent side of slim. A final flourish is not always easily achieved at the end of a long, punishing season, but, in this case, all the most influential Lions are fit and hungry and motivation is not a problem.Aside from enjoying each other’s company, the players have also responded well to Farrell’s management style, among the primary reasons why this large tour party has stayed fully united. “He’s been really good at getting everyone closer,” said the Scotland centre Huw Jones, set to become a member of a prestigious Lions club by starting all three Tests. “I don’t really know how he’s done it, but it’s worked.“I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the outside. He’s very calm and relaxed a lot of the time, [but] when he’s on, he’s pretty intense. When we’re training he’s always on and doesn’t miss a beat. He sees everything and he’s prepared to call you out in the middle of the session if something’s not good enough.View image in fullscreenThe Scotland and British & Irish Lions centre Huw Jones (left) alongside his centre partner Bundee Aki in training.Photograph: Billy Stickland/INPHO/Shutterstock“There’s no hiding place, his standards are so high. He’s very clear about what he wants and how he wants you to do it. He’s been brilliant and it’s great to be part of the squad under that leadership.”Jones, who will again partner Bundee Aki in midfield, was also good value on the subject of Farrell’s presence and rugby instincts. “He doesn’t need to try to be intimidating, he just is. Some people just have that presence. He’s obviously massive. Without meaning to be, he’s just an intimidating person. Not in a bad way, but in a good way that commands respect. When he speaks everyone is listening. I’m yet to hear him say something I don’t agree with, he reads the game so well.“If you are walking, haven’t quite got into position or if you are not talking to someone he will pick it up … and you will know about it. It is about not accepting anything average or mediocre you may be able to get away with at your club. We are here because we were selected as being the best of our international teams. You have to show up and prove that every day.”A resounding final performance, accordingly, is the objective of all concerned, Farrell included. When he says winning 3-0 “would mean the world to us” he is reiterating his belief that aiming high is vital, in sport and life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t be frightened of that.”Just as telling, perhaps, is that even the 16 unlucky individuals – 12 original selections and four replacements – who have had no involvement in the Tests have felt as much a part of campaign as the 27 who have. “It touches you,” said Farrell. “The ones that were celebrating most last Saturday were the ones who hadn’t put the shirt on.

That’s been the message this week: to try and have our best performance of the tour. To do it in the last game, to win 3-0 – that would be amazing.

This is due to the FA integrity department’s decision, after an investigation than began in August 2023, that apparently unusual betting patterns surrounding four yellow cards for the 27-year-old were sufficient to charge him with spot-fixing. West Ham also lost a huge transfer fee, so it is little wonder they are considering legal action against the FA and will certainly push hard for the governing body to cover costs estimated at around £1m for the player and club.West Ham are angry that the case has taken so long to conclude. With two years left on his contract, Paquetá retains value, but given many Premier League clubs have profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) issues, and there are only four weeks left in the transfer window, selling him this summer will be challenging, even though he has been cleared.The FA’s investigators were hindered by difficulties in obtaining evidence from Brazil, and it took nine months of digging before charges were issued in May 2024. But the case has been beset by delays throughout. After Paquetá was charged West Ham lobbied for the hearing to be expedited. It did not begin until March this year and was adjourned, finally concluding at the beginning of June. West Ham have consequently faced uncertainty over Paquetá’s position for three summer transfer windows, while the player has been in turmoil, particularly after learning that the FA was pushing for a life ban.Several staff members at West Ham have told the Guardian that Paquetá’s demeanour has barely altered at the training ground over the last two years despite the severity of the charges, although a source who knows him personally said the case has taken its toll. That was clear when he burst into tears after being booked in a Premier League game against Tottenham in May, which led to his wife, Maria Fournier, writing on Instagram that the family had “been living this nightmare for two years”.The high stakes for Paquetá contrast with the modest amounts wagered in the allegedly corrupt bets. Around 60 bets were placed on Paquetá to be shown a yellow card in four Premier League games in 2022 and 2023, with the claim being that he was deliberately booked to make money for family and friends. A source with knowledge of the FA’s investigation said one of the bets was for £7, with the highest £400.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá in action against Liverpool last year. The charges against the Brazilian caused him to miss out on a £85m move to Manchester City.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersWhile Paquetá’s problems began with the Soumaré yellow card, it was subsequent bookings against Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth in 2023 that led to the investigation. The fouls in each case were a lunge at John McGinn, pulling Crysencio Summerville’s shirt and a handball in an aerial challenge, offences that his legal team argued were symptomatic of his carelessness, rather than being deliberate.The initial investigation into Paquetá’s behaviour was conducted by the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), which received an integrity alert after several bookmakers in Brazil reported an unusual number of bets on Paquetá to be booked during the Villa game on 12 March 2023. The majority of the suspicious bets were traced to Paquetá Island, an idyllic, 0.5sq mile beach paradise off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, where Paquetá was born and from which he takes his name. Ironically, most of the money staked on Paquetá to be booked used accounts with Betway, which at the time was West Ham’s shirt sponsor. The concern of integrity officials was heightened by the fact most of the money came from new accounts.The FA’s investigation was triggered by the booking Paquetá received at Bournemouth in West Ham’s opening game of the following season, the fourth foul he had conceded that afternoon. The referee Peter Bankes’s report noted that he had booked Paquetá for “persistent infringement”, which along with the number of bets placed on him to be cautioned was enough to trigger a formal inquiry.Slot says Liverpool will target quality players amid links to Alexander IsakRead moreMuch of Paquetá’s defence is believed to have centred on his claim that he asked the then West Ham manager, David Moyes, not to play him at Bournemouth for fear of jeopardising the City move, which they argue demonstrated his booking could not have been premeditated. Moyes is understood to have supported this version of events, and given evidence to the independent commission on Paquetá’s behalf.Paquetá’s lead counsel, Nick De Marco KC, is also understood to have produced betting data showing that Paquetá frequently attracts a statistically unusual volume of bets to be booked, which they attribute to his poor disciplinary record. Paquetá’s legal team also showed the panel Paquetá’s entire disciplinary history, arguing that he has consistently conceded more free-kicks than his teammates throughout his career, which they argued increased the chances of him being booked.The publication of the independent commission’s written reasons, which are not expected for a number of weeks, will reveal more about a fascinating case, and may make awkward reading for the FA.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 23-year-old held off the pursuing peloton of favourites on the final climb to claim the biggest win of her career and the second stage win for a French rider since the women’s race was rebooted as the Tour de France Femmes in 2022.Squiban, riding for UAE Team ADQ, attacked alone, three kilometres from the top of the Col du Chansert, and maintained her lead on the fast descent, through the bonus sprint and into the finishing straight on the Boulevard Henri IV.Tour de France Femmes 2025: Maëva Squiban breaks away to win stage six – as it happenedRead more“When they told me I had a minute and a half [lead] I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I mainly wanted to get a head start before the climb to the bonus sprint. Then I was hoping to be part of a small group from the bonus sprint to the finish.”Behind her, Kim Le Court was as good as her word at the bonus sprints and made every second count. The Mauritian took another four seconds, just ahead of the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, to extend her overall lead. “The goal was to control the race, and then see if the legs were there,” she said. “After that, it was to take the remaining bonus seconds, as there was already a rider up ahead.”“We tried to close the gap to Squiban to try and get the stage, but it wasn’t going to happen so tried to get a bit more time at the finish. I couldn’t wish for it to be better, apart from maybe winning the stage.”The 29-year-old leads by 26 seconds from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and by 30 seconds from Niewiadoma, who leap-frogged the pre-race favourite, Demi Vollering, into third place.The first mountain stage included 2,475m of altitude gain over four categorised climbs, including the first category Col du Beal, and provoked significant time gaps. Marianne Vos tumbled down the yellow jersey rankings, dropping from sixth to 29th.Although the rest of the favourites stayed together over the top of the 10km climb, Cédrine Kerbaol and Niewiadoma tried their hand on the descent, but were recaptured at the foot of the Col du Chansert, the platform for Squiban’s solo attack.Vollering’s FDJ-Suez team-mate Juliette Labous set off in pursuit in the closing kilometres, but it was not enough to draw out any initiatives from the main challengers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her stealthy performance is fuelling French hopes that she may break the nation’s 40-yearTour de Francedrought.The apparent anxieties from the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, over Vollering’s chances may be heightened by the prospect of a French rider being guided to overall victory by his nemesis, Visma–Lease a Bike’s Jos Van Emden, although the pair now appear to have ended their public feud.Friday’s stage from Bourg-en-Bresse to Chambéry has less altitude gain, but is expected to inflict yet more pain as it crosses the summit of the 1,134m Col du Granier, 17km from the finish.

There is a growing feeling that, even with two more teams joining the elite next year, Salford’s position is increasingly untenable as they remain riddled by financial problems.Sport England to meet RFL over concerns with rugby league funding at stakeRead moreHaving been forced to request an advance on their central distribution on the eve of the season, a takeover in February was hoped to be the cure for their long-term ills. But 20 rounds into the season, Salford remain under salary-cap constraints, have had to sell players to make ends meet and are still in deep financial trouble.A multimillion-pound bridging loan that has long been promised by the owners has not arrived. Salford’s young players that are left are being forced to turn out every week when they are not ready for Super League, and the results are ones like these. This win for Hull KR, their biggest as a top-flight club, was a mismatch from the first minute.There is no blame attached to Salford’s young squad, who continue to apply themselves superbly in the face of such adversity, their coaching staff or those on the terraces who are passionately backing this group until the end of the season and will continue to do so whatever may come after that. It may well be life in the Championship.The blame lies with Salford’s ownership, and there is no doubting the uncertainty that has lasted so deep into the season is causing reputational damage to the club, but also to Super League. It was a point not lost on the Hull KR coach, Willie Peters.He said: “I’m not sure what to feel because the situation Salford are in is not good. I feel for [Salford coach] Paul Rowley, the players and the fans who are turning up every week. Some people have got to be held accountable because it’s embarrassing for our game over here. It does not help anyone.”Having watched his side concede 14 tries, Rowley appeared emotionally drained. He said: “I’m not sure what the emotion is. I’m bored of it, I’m sick of it. We just want to compete. It’s not what we want to see. We’re sad at the situation and we’re sad for the sport because we don’t want to be in this position.”View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Mikey Lewis was at his brilliant best against Salford on Thursday night.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PASome Super League coaches have expressed concerns there are not enough players to support 14 elite teams and while Salford have their own problems that contributed to this score, this will have done little to assuage those fears.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They scored points at will here to underline the gulf between these two sides. The reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, provided an incredible eight try assists and scored one of his own, with Rovers 14-0 up after ten minutes and 34-6 ahead by the break.Any suggestion they would ease up in a show of mercy for a young Salford side was unfounded. Lewis continued to torment the Red Devils after the break, with Joe Burgess crossing for four tries in total and Peters’ men picking up their biggest ever victory as a Super League club.Their bigger challenges lie ahead, specifically the defending champions Wigan in a fortnight. As for Salford, it is unclear how much longer they will be a Super League club for but their challenges are the same as the competition itself: minimising reputational damage and convincing the public better times lie ahead.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSalford Red DevilsHull KRRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Ryan Moore seized the initiative aboard Whirl, the 6-5 favourite, and ensured that Aidan O’Brien’s filly was never seriously threatened on her way to a five-length success.Goodwood’s officials were forced to use a flag start, a first for a Group One race in Britain, as there was lightning in the air during a sustained downpour. That changed the going from good, good-to-firm in places to heavy in less than an hour, with none of the usual stopping-off points in between.Glorious Goodwood: 150-1 shot Qirat wins Sussex Stakes after shock of all shocksRead moreIt was an unfamiliar situation for the five riders in the day’s feature event and Moore was first to react as the starter dropped the flag while See The Fire, the second-favourite, was slightly back on her heels for Oisin Murphy. Within a few strides, Whirl had grabbed a useful lead – three or four lengths over See The Fire and at least half a dozen over her stable companion, Bedtime Story. As Moore went through the gears from the two-furlong pole, his opponents were always struggling to land a blow.Whirl has now won two all-aged Group One events in a row after her narrow defeat byMinnie Hauk in the Oaksat Epsom in June and is an increasingly live contender for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in October. Kalpana, the 13-2 favourite with Paddy Power, was a length and a quarter behind Whirl in the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh in June and Whirl is now 8-1 (from 10-1) for Europe’s showpiece event.“Whirl just keeps doing what she says she is going to do,” Moore said. “She has loads of ability, stays well, handles quick ground, handles slow ground. Aidan called her ‘a racing machine’ the last day. He keeps getting these horses to do different things and this filly keeps progressing.“It is a shame it was the spectacle it was, but she won it very well. She has won two Group One races now against the girls. She will have to step up again against the boys, but she is progressing and Aidan’s horses just keep turning up every time.”See The Fire is likely to head to the International Stakes at York next month, a race won by her sire,Sea The Stars, in 2009, and her dam,Arabian Queen, six years later.Whether Field Of Gold,the beaten 1-3 favouritein Wednesday’s Sussex Stakes, also lines up for that race is in doubt as the three-year-old was reportedly lame on Thursday morning.View image in fullscreenRacegoers do their best to shelter from the rain at Goodwood.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“We don’t have the full picture yet, but he is lame on his left hind,” said Barry Mahon, European racing manager for the Juddmonte operation. “Until we have the full picture we can’t fully diagnose it, but the fact he is lame suggests that could be why we didn’t see the true horse we know yesterday.”Merchant followed up his handicap success at the Royal meeting in June with a narrow victory in the Group Three Gordon Stakes, a contest that is often a trial for the St Leger. Merchant is quoted at around 10-1 for the final Classic after edging out Wimbledon Hawkeye by a nose, but William Haggas, his trainer, has yet to commit the three-year-old to the race.“My gut feeling is no because I don’t think it did [the 2023 Gordon Stakes winner] Desert Hero much good long-term,” he said. “We had planned to go to the Voltigeur [at York in August] with Merchant, but he has had a race today and will need at least 10 days going very quietly before we decide what to do.”Asfoora to reign in King GeorgeThe King George Stakes, Glorious Goodwood’s traditional test of pure speed, will be more of a slog after the downpour. The Australian-trained favourite,Asfoora (3.05),has several soft-ground wins on her record and looks fairly priced at around 2-1 to improve on her close second last year.Asfoora wastouched off by Mick Appleby’s Big Evsand another three-year-old from the same yard, Big Mojo, is the probable second-favourite after a strong run into second behind the shock winner,No Half Measures, in the July Cuplast time out.A possible vital difference is that Asfoora shouldered 6lb penalty last year after her winin the King Charles III Stakesat Royal Ascot. Henry Dwyer’s mare went to the same race this year without the benefit of a prep run, finishing a creditable fifth in the circumstances. She goes to post without a penalty and looks sure to improve for the run.Goodwood 1.20Christophe Soumillon is an eye-catching booking for Charlie Johnston’sAlign The Stars,a winner at this meeting 12 months ago. He looked a little one-paced over 14 furlongs at Newmarket last time, but ran well to finish seventh in the Ascot Stakes. This return to a marathon trip at a track he clearly enjoys could be just what he needs.Goodwood 1.55A disappointing sixth behind Field Of Gold in the Craven Stakes in April remains the only blot onOpera Ballo’srecord and he posted another career-best when beating Seagulls Eleven – who reopposes today – at Newmarket’s July festival last time. This step back up to Group Three company looks an obvious next step on the way to even better things.Goodwood 2.30While the past two renewals of this handicap have gone to horses from high-numbered stalls, a low draw is always a significant advantage over this track and trip and Oisin Murphy has an ideal pitch in stall two onGreek Order.Michael Bell’s gelding was in front half a furlong out in the Royal Hunt Cup and this switch to a sharper mile should suit.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Friday tipsShowGoodwood1.20 Align The Stars 1.55 Opera Ballo 2.30 Greek Order (nap) 3.05 Asfoora (nb) 3.45 Haunted Dream 4.20 Golden Brown 4.55 Push The LimitNewcastle2.05 Balqaa 2.40 Weddell Sea 3.15 Territorial Star 3.53 Willingly 4.30 Tanjen 5.07 Highfield VikingSouthwell2.15 Sir Benedict 2.50 Byblos 3.25 Ocean Odyssey 4.05 Mark’s Choice 4.40 Mercurius Power 5.15 Houdini Miss 5.50 HaazeezMusselburgh5.37 Wadacre Giorgio 6.10 Blooming Legend 6.45 Koffee And Kale 7.18 Curious Rover 7.48 Due Respect 8.20 Elemental Eye 8.50 MerseaNewmarket5.45 Beckford’s Folly 6.20 Holbache 6.55 Walson’s Law 7.27 Hot Flame 7.57 Inlet 8.30 Dashing RogerBath5.55 I Can Imagine 6.30 Moe’s Legacy 7.05 Simplify 7.35 Neptune Legend 8.05 Launceston 8.35 Orchestral WaveWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Goodwood 3.45A tricky conditions event where the consistentHaunted Dream,last year’s winner, makes most appeal.

They urged people living in basements to move to higher floors and issued an advisory asking New Yorkers to avoid travel from Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon.The Clearview Expressway, a major highway in the borough of Queens, was closed in both directions, and at least two cars were submerged on the expressway, a law enforcement official told CNN.

One video online showed water pouring down a city street, rising halfway up a parked car, and rendering a busy commercial intersection nearly impassable as waters rose into a car’s wheel wells. In Maryland, multiple water rescues were reported in communities north of Baltimore.Airports in New York,New Jersey, Washington and Philadelphia all reported significant weather-related flight delays and cancellations.Kathy Hochul, the New York governor,saidshe would be declaring a state of emergency for New York City and the surrounding counties.

Continue to monitor your local forecasts, and stay safe.”In anticipation of the severe weather, the acting New Jersey governor, Tahesha Way, had earlier declared astate of emergencyfor the state, effective from 2pm on Thursday. The declarations come amid concerns over flooding, strong thunderstorms, heavy rainfall and gusty winds.“Beginning this afternoon, we are expecting severe thunderstorms to bring heavy rainfall and damaging wind gusts with the potential for flash flooding across the state,” said Way. “I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms. Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely necessary.”Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s governor,postedon social media that state emergency management officials were preparing potential response and recovery efforts.The combination of saturated ground and intense downpours raises the risk of hazardous conditions such as flash floods, rock slides and landslides.

That does mean asking and confronting difficult questions around our fiscal position, around taxation. But if we’re open and honest about the nature of the challenge that we face, we cannot duck that.“Now is a time when we’re seeing forces outside our country’s control impacting on our security. It’s important to have an open conversation with the public and say that means we will need to change when it comes to tax. That needs to be done in a way where those with the broadest shoulders take more responsibility.”While she did not set out exactly where wealth taxes might fall, Dodds urged the Treasury to “look carefully” at the work of economist Arun Advani, whose wealth tax commission in 2020recommended a one-off levyon millionaire households as a better way of raising revenue than increasing taxes on workers or consumers.View image in fullscreenDodds also suggested that Rachel Reeves should look again at her fiscal rules.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianShe joins a growing chorus of Labour MPs, not all from the left of the party, calling for further wealth taxes this autumn. However, proposals for an annual 2% tax on assets over £10m have been denounced as “daft” by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. Government insiders have questioned whether it would raise any funds.Dodds acknowledged there would be consequences from any new wealth tax and said she did not underestimate the challenges involved. However, she played down suggestions the policy would automatically lead to a reduction in the tax base as people moved assets overseas.She added: “There’s no silver bullet here, and I’ve been quite cautious about claims in the past that there’s one single change to tax that could suddenly, immediately inject enormous amounts of money into the government coffers without any further implications. That’s simply not the case. There will be consequences.”Dodds also suggested that Reeves should look again at her fiscal rules to help deliver an increase in defence spending, rather than through further cuts to aid. The government has pledged to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence from 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. It has not said how this would be paid for.She said it would be very difficult for the UK to change its fiscal rules to borrow more to invest in defence, as Germany – which was in a stronger economic position – did when it loosened its “debt brake” in March. But she added: “There’s no route forward without some risk and without some cost.”Forecasts twice a year from the Office for Budget Responsibility have ended up driving fiscal policy, injecting more uncertainty into the system, she said. The IMF has suggested the government should consider having the public finances formally assessed only once a year instead.Dodds said she had little doubt the government would have to further increase defence spending. But she said this could not come from further cuts to the aid budget without an impact on global security and migration patterns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Especially now with the rise of China, Russia, becoming far more involved in the continent of Africa, and many other geopolitical pressures, now isn’t the time to be walking back from those commitments.“We will also see the impact on global security. We also see the impact of it in population movements. It’s no surprise that the number of people seeking asylum in the UK from Sudan, for example, has increased. There is eventually that knock-on impact. There’s no question about that.”Dodds said there was “no magic wand” to bring down the number of asylum hotels, which have been funded from the aid budget. Suggestions that the government could make big savings from quick closures were “just not credible”.She did not criticise Starmer directly for his“island of strangers”remarks, which the prime minister has since said he regretted, and said it was “right to acknowledge people’s concerns” about small boat crossings but she urged ministers “to be clear that we are talking ultimately about human beings”.As a former Labour chair, Dodds suggested the party had to do more to explain what it stood for to take on the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.She said: “What I find time and again when I speak with people who are considering Reform is that they want politicians to say what they think. They want politicians who are upfront about what they believe and who act on their beliefs.”She describedJeremy Corbyn’s new movementas “a bit like the People’s Front of Judea” from Monty Python’s Life of Brian but warned that it could end up splitting the vote: “We have seen in some other countries, a splintering of the left, and centre-left parties doing very badly.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

David Fincher directed the 2010 film, which starred Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg alongside Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer and Rashida Jones.The Social Network Part II,confirmedto be in development this June, will reportedly not be a straightforward sequel to the story of Facebook’s founding in a Harvard dorm room, but rather a follow-up focusing on recent controversy surrounding the social media behemoth. The new screenplay will be based on reporting by Jeff Horowitz for the Wall Street Journal in a series called The Facebook Files, which explored the inner workings and harm caused by the company. The 2021 investigation exposed how internal findings had been buried, as well as Facebook’s influence on the January 6 riot and the mental health of teenage users.Deadline reports that White would ideally play Horowitz, with Madison – fresh off her best actress Oscar win this March – playing the whistleblower at the heart of the articles.Sorkin had previously teased more overt political leanings for the new script. “I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said in 2024 on a special edition ofThe Town podcast, live from Washington DC. When asked to explain why, he responded: “You’re gonna need to buy a movie ticket.“Facebook has been, among other things, tuning its algorithm to promote the most divisive material possible,” Sorkin said. He added: “There is supposed to be a constant tension atFacebookbetween growth and integrity – there isn’t.”The Social Network, based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, made $224m worldwide in 2010 and won three Oscars – best adapted screenplay, original score and editing. Eisenberg, who was nominated for his starring role, is yet to be attached to the new project.In a recentpodcast interview, Zuckerberg was critical of the film, which portrayed him as calculating and ruthless. “It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were, like, completely wrong.”Strong received an Emmy for his portrayal of Succession’s Kendall Roy on the acclaimed HBO series, among many other accolades. He was nominated for an Oscar this year for playing the fearsome attorney and Donald Trump mentor Roy Cohn in The Apprentice, Ali Abbasi’s film tracing the young Trump’s rise in 1980s New York. He will next appear on screen alongside White in the Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere, playing the record producer and Springsteen collaborator Jon Landau.Explore more on these topicsThe Social NetworkJeremy StrongAaron SorkinMark ZuckerbergFacebookMetaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

Hold My Hand was written about love, support, and standing by someone through everything – it’s meant to offer hope and empowerment. Using it to promote something I fundamentally disagree with goes completely against the message of the song.”On Thursday afternoon Jet2 also condemned the post, saying it was “disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as this”.The official White House account posted a clip on X on Wednesday evening showing people wearing handcuffs and being taken out of cars and on to planes, captioned: “When Ice books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. ✈️🎶Nothing beats it!pic.twitter.com/hlLapr9QsE— The White House (@WhiteHouse)July 29, 2025In the six months since Donald Trump took office, the US president hassupercharged the country’s immigration enforcement, overseeing a sweeping mass arrest and incarceration scheme, which resulted in a record number of arrests by immigration officers in June, according to Guardian analysis.The post delighted Trump supporters but was decried as disgusting, embarrassing and unchristian by critics. Glynne, who has previously joined in with the fun spirit of the Jet2 holidays meme by postinga TikTok video miming the voiceover, expressed her disapproval of the White House’s appropriation of the trend on Instagram.“This post honestly makes me sick,” she wrote. “My music is about love, unity and spreading positivity – never about division or hate.”Jet2 had previously appeared to welcome the extra publicity generated by the meme, launching a challenge that offered a £1,000 holiday voucher as a prize.A spokesperson said the company welcomed the “good humour” of the viral phenomenon, but not the White House’s contribution. “We are of course aware of a post from the White House social media account,” they said. “This is not endorsed by us in any way, and we are very disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as this.”The advert’s voiceover actor, Zoë Lister, said she would never condone her voiceover “being used in promotion with Trump and his abhorrent policies”.She told the BBC: “The Jet2 meme has spread a lot of joy and humour around the world, but the White House video shows that Trump has neither.”The White House Ice deportation post is the latest example of anunorthodox digital communications strategythat has veered away from previous administrations’ traditional – and relatively sedate – use of social media platforms.In February, the White House used X to promote Trump’s congestion pricing policy, posting a fake Time magazine front cover portraying the president as a monarch, along with the phrase: “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”The post was described as “revoltingly un-American” by Adam Keiper, the executive editor of the conservative Bulwark news site, while New York state’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, said: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to start now.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

After criticism, the administration recently posted on X: “Nowhere in the constitution does it say we can’t post banger memes.”Last month theTrump administrationappeared to be on track to oversee one of the deadliest years for immigrant detention after the deaths of two men – one from Cuba and another from Canada – while in federal custody.Human rights experts have raised concerns about the detention of children with their parents at the newly recommissioned“family detention centres”in Texas, and while Trump has repeatedly claimed his administration is trying to arrest and deport “dangerous criminals”, analysis shows that most of the people Ice is now arresting have never been convicted of a crime.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJess GlynneSocial mediaUS politicsDonald TrumpInternetDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

He died peacefully after “a brief but acute illness”.Wilson’s career in theatre started in the late 1960s when he started the performance art group the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds in New York, named after a teacher who helped him with a stammer. He went on to create the four-act opera Einstein on the Beach with Philip Glass in the mid-1970s.Robert Wilson: ‘We shouldn’t make theatre if we can’t laugh’Read moreAfter the show toured Europe, Wilson wanted to put it on in New York and decided that the Metropolitan Opera House would be the best venue but they said no so he rented it himself. “It cost $90,000, a lot of money,” hesaidto the Guardian in 2012. “It sold out, so we put on a second performance. It was a crazy mixture of people who turned up, traditional opera-goers and people who had never been before. Even so, we ended up in debt, but those performances really established us both.”His credits also included silent operas such as Deafman Glance and the 12-hour The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin.He directed the work of others including William Shakespeare’s King Lear and The Tempest and Anton Chekhov’s Swansong. Most recently he directedUbuin Palma de Mallorca and Isabelle Huppert inMary Said What She Saidin London.“Theatre is about one thing,” hesaidin 2019. “And if it’s not about one thing – it’s too complicated.”As a visual artist, Wilson has created sculptures, designs for furniture and drawings. In 1993, he was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for his sculptural work.“I don’t think I’m very good at explaining my work,” hesaidin 2022 when he returned for the 57th Venice Biennale. “But it is something you experience.”Recognition of his talents also included a Drama Desk award in 1971 for direction, a Pulitzer prize nomination for drama in 1986 and an Olivier award for best opera in 2013.His many big-name collaborators included Tom Waits, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Martin McDonagh, Allen Ginsberg, Laurie Anderson, Tilda Swinton, Jim Jarmusch and Lady Gaga.Wilson also worked with Gaga during her Artpop era, designing the set for her 2013 MTV music video awards performance and using her in anexhibitionat the Louvre. “The concentration, the power she has, it’s total,” hesaidof Gaga to the Guardian in 2016.Wilson is survived by his sister Suzanne and his niece Lori and memorials will be announced soon. “His works have touched, inspired and influenced generations of artists and audiences since the 1960s,” a statement from the Watermill Center reads.Explore more on these topicsRobert WilsonUS theaterArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The seafloor valleys can be 4,000 metres deep.Illustration: Marine GeologyThe Antarctic canyons resemble those elsewhere “but tend to be larger and deeper because of the prolonged action of polar ice and the immense volumes of sediment transported by glaciers to the continental shelf”, said David Amblàs of the research team.He added: “That’s why we must continue to gather high-resolution bathymetric data in unmapped areas that will surely reveal new canyons, collect observational data … and keep improving our climate models to better represent these processes and increase the reliability of projections on climate change impacts.”Submarine canyons are carved valleys on the seafloor that play a crucial role in the movement of sediments, nutrients and the creations of biodiverse habitats. Antarctica’s canyons become enlarged because of the turbulent water currents that carry sediments at high speed through them.Scientists have been able to map in high resolution only 27% of the Earth’s seafloor, uncovering 10,000 submarine canyons worldwide. But most of these canyons remain underexplored, especially in polar regions.Using data from theInternational Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean, researchers produced high-resolution maps of 332 Antarctic canyon networks, five times as many as previous studies had managed. The most spectacular of these are in east Antarctica and “characterised by complex, branching canyon systems”, said Amblàs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It stretched from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri, roughly the distance between Paris and Venice.The previous record of 768km was also recorded in the Great Plains, a hotspot for severe thunderstorms, on 29 April 2020.Since 2016, scientific advances in space-based mapping have allowed for lightning flashes to be measured over a broader space, allowing these long flashes to be recorded.This event was one of the first flashes to be documented using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s latest model of orbital satellite, known as a geostationary operational environmental satellite.Michael J Peterson, the lead author and an evaluation committee member of the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said: “The extremes of what lightning is capable of is difficult to study because it pushes the boundaries of what we can practically observe. Adding continuous measurements from geostationary orbit was a major advance.”View image in fullscreenA satellite image depicting the flash. Red circles mark positively charged branches of the lightning, and blue circles mark negatively charged branches.Photograph: World Meteorological Organization, American Meteorological SocietyBefore using orbital satellites to record the duration and length of lightning flashes, data was collected by ground-based sensors. Many scientists acknowledged that there were limits to the duration and length of lightning they could record with these ground sensors.The advances in technology have also allowed for the recording of the greatest duration for a single lightning flash. The record is a flash that lasted 17.1 seconds during a thunderstorm over Uruguay and northern Argentina on 18 June 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

At the time, Noel Quinn, the bank’s then chief executive, said industry-wide collaboration was “essential to monitoring progress” towards net zero.The decision to leave the initiative came months after HSBC revealed it woulddelay key parts of its climate goalsfor the next 20 years, and water down other environmental targets, as part of a long-term bonus plan for Quinn’s successor, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.It also followed awave of exits from the NZBAby big US banks including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs during the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.Trump’s second term has sparked a wide-ranging climate backlash from rightwing politicians, who have been emboldened by his anti-greenpush for higher oil and gas production.On Thursday, Winters said: “People that said a lot of stuff, but [when] it was fashionable to say it, [and] who are saying either nothing or the opposite now: shame on them.”He said most of Standard Chartered’s clients – from across China, India, wider Asia and the Middle East – were “as focused on their net zero transitions, or their transitions to low carbon economy, as they were before. And that obviously is good for business.”“A lot of these projects just make sense economically,” Winters added. “Most continue to honour the obligations that they made to their shareholders or other stakeholders early on, independent of political noise one way or the other.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was not until Monday that police and ambulance crews were deployed.A triage centre was set up at the nearby Plungar village hall to assess the children who were at the camp. Eight children were then taken to hospital as a precaution, with all of them subsequently discharged.The children were at a summer camp in a youth centre called Stathern Lodge, which is owned by the Braithwaite Gospel Trust and is about a mile from the village. A representative of the trust said the centre provided self-catering facilities and was hired out, so the trust had no direct involvement with the camp.Police said a man, 76, had been arrested at a nearby public house on Monday evening on suspicion of administering poison or a noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy. The man remains in custody.Neighbours described seeing stressed parents outside the village hall on Monday.A 28-year-old woman who lives nearby said: “We saw all the ambulances and police cars outside. All the kids were very guarded, they would not let anybody near it. Everybody was pretty stressed out. There were like four police cars, critical care teams, an ambulance, there was quite a lot. It was crazy. The parents were pretty stressed, they were here until probably 11pm.”A police spokesperson said the force had referred itself to the watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), “due to the circumstances of the initial police response”.Speaking at the scene, James Avery, an assistant chief constable of Leicestershire police, said it was a complex and sensitive investigation.He was unable give out further information on the age of children, where they were from or the nature of what their illness was. “Other than explaining that they came down with symptoms of feeling unwell I’m unable to elaborate any further at this stage.” He said “care, compassion and support” was being provided to the children.The investigation is being led by an East Midlands major incident team. DI Neil Holden, the senior investigating officer, said: “We understand the concern this incident will have caused to parents, guardians and the surrounding community. We are in contact with the parents and guardians of all children concerned.“Please be reassured that we have several dedicated resources deployed and are working with partner agencies, including children’s services, to ensure full safeguarding is provided to the children involved.“We also remain at the scene to carry out inquiries into the circumstances of what has happened and to continue to provide advice and support in the area. This is a complex and sensitive investigation and we will continue to provide updates to both parents and guardians and the public as and when we can.”The force said detectives and uniformed officers from the Melton and Rutland neighbourhood policing area were still in Stathern carrying out further inquiries and seeking to establish the circumstances of the incident. They were also “providing reassurance to families affected as well as the local community”.The IOPC said: “We received a conduct referral on Tuesday from Leicestershire police relating to their handling of concerns passed to them over the wellbeing of a group of children.“Our assessment team has examined all available evidence and concluded the matter should be independently investigated by the IOPC. The investigation will look at whether there were any breaches of professional behaviour – namely a failure to carry out duties and responsibilities – that resulted in a delay in Leicestershire police’s response to what was later declared a critical incident.”Edward Argar, the local MP, encouraged the police to provide as much information as possible about what happened.He said: “The reports of this incident are clearly shocking and deeply concerning. While, understandably, people will have a lot of questions about what has happened, it is important we remember this is a live police criminal investigation, so I would caution against people speculating while the police do that work.“I would, however, encourage the police to provide as much information publicly as they can, as soon as they can, but without prejudicing that vital investigation.”Anyone with any information in relation to the investigation is being asked by detectives to report ithere.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The three-year trial will start with 70 farms and involve farmers trapping, testing and vaccinating badgers, with training provided by scientists. An earlier pilot study of the approach showed TB rates inbadgers fell from 16% to zeroin four years.TB can devastate cattle herds and more than20,000 infected cattlewere slaughtered in the last year in England. The badger cull started in 2013 and haskilled about 250,000 badgersbut has been highly controversial.Most scientists have argued since the start that culling can make no meaningful contribution to TB control in cattle, based on a large-scale trial from 1998 to 2005. They say most cattle are infected by other cattle and that controlling livestock movements are key. Most farmers argue that badgers are a dangerous reservoir for the disease and must be controlled. The results of the culling to date are contested. Badger culling isdue to end in 2029.View image in fullscreenTB can devastate cattle herds. More than 20,000 infected cattle were slaughtered in the last year in England.Photograph: ZSLThe £1.4m project is the first time the National Farmers’ Union has led a badger vaccination programme. Previous badger vaccination trials have been conducted by wildlife groups.Prof Rosie Woodroffe, at the Institute of Zoology in London, said: “For half a century, wildlife advocates and farmers have argued about the best way to manage the risk of TB transmission between badgers and cattle. Ultimately, we all want the same thing: to see TB eliminated so that farmers, their livestock, and wildlife can all thrive.“By working together to compare different approaches, we can develop a shared understanding of the evidence and use it to identify TB control solutions which are effective and sustainable.”Bridget Whell, a farmer and the NFU’s Cornwall chair, is taking part in the project and has 1,200 cattle serving two dairies. She has lost half the cattle from one of the dairies in the past and her farm has spent most of the last 15 years under government restrictions due to TB infections. “It was really devastating,” she said.There have been six years of badger culling on Whell’s farm but that have now ended due to the government’s decision to end culling. “It does seem now that in terms of the tools available, aside from biosecurity and [cattle] testing, [badger vaccination] is the future,” she said.Cattlevaccines for TB are being developed but have been complicated by the need to be able to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals when they are tested.View image in fullscreenThe project will assess three vaccination approaches to determine which works best.Photograph: ZSL“There’s been a lack of confidence [about badger vaccination] because there’s been no information,” Whell said. “What we hope to ultimately get out of [the project] is whether [badger vaccination] affects the cattle levels of TB – that remains to be seen, but I think it’s well worth doing.”“My scepticism, if any, is whether this is as a policy is sustainable, financially and practically.”The project will begin with 70 farmers over 80 sq kmin Cornwall, and expand over three years to cover 400 to 500 sq km. It will assess the impact of badger vaccination on TB control and examine how vaccination can be scaled up and delivered in the most cost-efficient way.The project will assess three vaccination approaches to determine which works best: annual vaccination over four years, vaccination every other year or reactive vaccination based on TB infection on farms.Explore more on these topicsBadgersCattleFarmingCornwallWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, the figure was passed on 22 September, and in 2023 it was 2 October.The first year in which at least 25,000 arrivals were recorded was 2022, when the milestone was passed on 27 August, and the total went on to hit a record 45,774 by the end of December.The record arrivals come after ministers announced a flurry of measures this spring and summer to reduce the number of crossings. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party has made gains in the polls after attacks on Labour for failing to curb irregular migration.Keir Starmer announceda “one in, one out” returns dealwith France earlier this month, – whereby the UK will send migrants back to France in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain. However, the pilot has not yet begun.Last month, French police for the first timeused knives to slash dinghieswhich were already in the sea, as a result of negotiations with the UK, and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, announced a new sanctions regime to target those involved in Channel smuggling.The Guardian disclosed on Wednesday that an extra 445 spaces were being prepared to house male asylum seekersat RAF Wethersfield in Essexdespite previous promises to cut the numbers there.A Home Office spokesperson said: “All use of property or sites under our ownership is carried out in accordance with relevant planning permissions, and we work together with local authorities and other stakeholders to ensure the accommodation estate is continuously reviewed and managed safely and effectively at all times.”The move also follows a series ofdemonstrations outside a hotelhousing asylum seekers in Epping, after a male asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also highlighted complaints of misogyny and failures to deal with “unwanted romantic advances”.The review team noted a number of challenges facing the trust, including an investigation by Sussex police intopossible corporate and individual manslaughter chargesover allegations of medical negligence and cover-up in the general surgery and neurosurgery departments. Operation Bramber is focused on the deaths of more than 90 patients, and serious harm suffered by more than 100 others. It was sparked by the concerns of two consultant whistleblowers who lost their jobs at the trust after speaking up, firstrevealed in the Guardian in June 2023.The report found staff feared their careers could be hindered if they raised concerns. One said they had been told not to share data that made the trust look bad. Another said when they did raise concerns they were “gaslit” and targeted by management.The report identified “significant issues with psychological safety at every [staff] level” and noted that the fear of speaking up had worsened in the last year. It said staff identified as having the potential to disagree with management said they were deliberately ignored in meetings.A staff survey conducted for the review received 376 responses, of which more than 300 were negative or very negative on the issue of speaking up. The responses often cited a “fear of reprisals”.One said: “There could be comeback which will affect your career in [a] negative manner.” Another said: “I raised concerns. It put a target on my back. Management lied, gaslit me, would circumvent the issue, would dismiss my concerns.” A third said: “I feel no one listens.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The review identified a “predominance of direct and authoritative leadership styles”. It added: “We heard repeatedly that ‘there is a parent-child dynamic in this organisation’.”It also found that “incivility and poor behaviours appear to be pervasive” and there was a strong view that these were tolerated by leaders. The report did not give details of these behaviours. Last year the Guardian revealed that a consultantsurgeon was promoted after allegedly assaulting resident doctors during surgery.Six senior women at the trust complained to the reviewers of misogyny, which was felt to be prevalent among consultants. Female staff said they faced eye rolling and other signs of dismissiveness from male colleagues when they spoke at meetings. They also faced pejorative references to sexuality when they took the lead.One woman claimed she “experienced unwanted romantic advances and inappropriate comments, with no actions taken months after reporting this to various senior leaders”.Earlier this month the trust chief executive,George Findlay, announced his departure.Andy Heeps, the acting chief executive, said the trust accepted all the report’s recommendations for improvement and its “valuable insight into what we do well, where we are improving, and where there is clearly more to do”.He said: “The authors recognise the scale of the task in completing such a huge trust merger during the Covid pandemic, and highlight a number of key improvements such as our big reductions in waiting lists and key service quality improvements.“But they also draw attention to some fundamental issues which we’ve not yet succeeded in tackling – and all of these things need to change, and change quickly.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsDoctorsHealthWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

The executive order will also re-establish the president’s council on sports, fitness, and nutrition.“This is an important step in our mission to make America healthy again,” Trump said in a press conference on Thursday. “It’s something that’s very important, what we’re doing, very important. Dating back to the administration of President Dwight D Eisenhower, this council has championed the vigor and strength and vitality of the American people today. We continue that very proud tradition.”The presidential fitness test was required in public schools in some form from the late 1950s until 2013, when it was changed into a program less focused on specific feats of strength.The test involves activities like a one-mile run, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and a sit-and-reach. People who participated in the program as children often have memories , both fond and not, of their experiences attempting these challenges in their gym classes.Trump threatens drug giants with crackdown over pricesRead more“It was a big deal. This was a wonderful tradition, and we’re bringing it back,” Trump said. “It’s turned out to be very, very popular to do.”Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, will administer the fitness program. There will also be criteria for a “presidential fitness award”. In past iterations of the program, the top 15% of performers would receive the award.“MAKE AMERICA FIT AGAIN!” Karoline Leavitt , the White House press secretary, wrote in a post on X about reintroducing the test. The fitness test aligns with the make America healthy again movement’s focus on physical wellness and exercise.Trump, an avid golfer, reportedly believes exercise is “misguided”, as a person is “born with a finite amount of energy”, the New Yorkerreported in 2017.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrSchoolsChildren's healthHealthChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

A jury last November ordered McGregor to pay her nearly €250,000 (£216,000) in damages.McGregor, 36, denied the allegation and said he had “fully consensual sex” with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff.In the appeal heard earlier this month, lawyers for McGregor said the judge erred in directing the jury to decide whether he “assaulted” rather than “sexually assaulted” the victim.Judge Brian O’Moore said on Thursday that the appeal court had no doubt the overall effect of the trial judge’s charge was to tell them the central allegation by Hand against McGregor was that he had raped her.McGregor’s legal team had also argued that the judge should not have allowed a line of questioning during cross-examination regarding McGregor’s “no comment” responses in a police interview. That ground was also rejected.Hand said in a statement outside the court: “To every survivor out there, I know how hard it is but please don’t be silenced … You deserve to be heard, you also deserve justice. Today, I can finally move on and try to heal.”Hand told the high court in November that she and a friend had made contact with McGregor, whom she knew, after a work Christmas party. She said they were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed.She said McGregor, who was not in court on Thursday, took her to a bedroom in the penthouse and sexually assaulted her.Hand’s lawyer told the jury that when she was referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, a doctor was so concerned that he directed that photographs be taken of her injuries.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s playing catch-up to its fellow tech giants on artificial intelligence, it’s seen its stock fall by double digits since the year began, itclosed a store in Chinafor the first time ever this week, and looming US tariffs on Beijing threaten its supply chain. On Thursday, the company released its third-quarter earnings of the fiscal year as investors scrutinize how the iPhone maker might turn things around.Despite the gloomy outlook, the company is still worth more than $3tn, and it beat Wall Street’s expectations for profit and revenue this quarter.Applereported a massive 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to $94.04bn, and $1.57 per share in earnings. That’s substantially more than the $89.3bn in revenue and $1.43 per share that analysts predicted and is the company’s biggest revenue growth since 2021.Apple’s iPhone revenue also outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, coming in 13% higher than the same time last year.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was “proud” to report a “June quarter revenue record”, showing growth in its iPhone, Mac and services divisions. On an earnings call on Thursday, he said the quarterly results were “better than we expected”.Dipanjan Chatterjee, a vice-president and principal analyst for Forrester, said rising services tend to boost the company’s revenue stream. “Apple has grown accustomed to having revenue growth in this high-margin services business, which masks other areas of the business not performing as well,” Chatterjee explained .He pointed to several issues that have led to Apple’s less-than-stellar product performance of late. He said Apple has lagged on hardware innovation, causing “consumer apathy”, and its AI rollout has been glitchy. Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI product, has beenlimited to incremental featuresand rather than transformational upgrades.And it’s been more than a year since Apple announced a suite of AI upgrades to its voice assistant Siri – many of which have yet to be released.“This work [on Siri] needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s vice-president of software engineering, during the company’s developer conference in June.Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have also been a pain point for the company as the US president pushes his desire for manufacturing to boom in the US. The vast majority of Apple’s products are made in China, with about90% of iPhones assembled there, despite recent efforts to shift production elsewhere. Cook said during the company’s previous quarterly earnings call that he expected the China tariffs to add $900m to its costs this quarter.Apple has attempted to pivot, moving more of its manufacturing to other countries such as India and Vietnam. However, this week, Trump announced a rise in tariffs on India, too, up to 25% starting on 1 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added Apple was “making good progress on a more personalized Siri” and promised a release next year.Because of the external and internal pressures, Apple has seen its share price plummet this year.

There were no impacts to workers, the environment or the public.”It noted that the site is near the center of the 310-sq-mile site.“Generally, wasps travel only a few hundred yards from their nest,” it said.The executive director of the Savannah River Site Watch watchdog group, Tom Clements,told the Associated Pressthis week that he was “as mad as a hornet that SRS didn’t explain where the radioactive waste came from or if there is some kind of leak from the waste tanks that the public should be aware of”.According tothe Department of Energy, the Savannah River site was built in the early 1950s and “focused on the production of plutonium and tritium for use in the manufacture of nuclear weapons from its inception in the early 1950s until the end of the Cold War”. In 1992, the facility began focusing instead on environmental cleanup, nuclear materials management, and research and development.The area where the nest was found – known as the “F-Area Tank Farm” – contains 22 underground carbon steel tanks, with each tank reportedly capable of holding 750,000 to 1.3m gallons (2.8m to 5m litres) of radioactive waste, according to theAiken Standard.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaNuclear wasteInsectsPollutionWildlifeAnimalsNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Richard O’Brien, Barry Bostwick, Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell tell the surprising, seductive story of cinema’s longest-running cult smashThu 31 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 06.44 EDTShareThe Rocky Horror Picture Show was released in cinemas in late 1975 with little fanfare, but the provocative musical, with its campy parody of sci-fi and horror B-movies, fabulous costumes and rollicking songs, dug its glittering heels in and refused to let go for the next 50 years.The film was an adaptation of the hit musical The Rocky Horror Show, created byRichard O’Brienwhen he was an unemployed actor. The story of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an alien, transvestite scientist, decked out like a bewitching glam rock god and hellbent on seducing everyone around him, galvanised audiences into participating in a waythat had never been seen before.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Frank-N-Furter, Rayner Bourton as Rocky, Belinda Sinclair as Janet and Christopher Malcolm as Brad in The Rocky Horror Show at the Chelsea Classic Cinema, London, in 1973.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAs its popularity grew, audiences began to take an active role in screenings – dressing up, dancing, singing along and adding their own lines of dialogue. Screenings also became safe spaces for LGBTQ+ fans, drawn to the film’s unabashed celebration of queerness, sexual liberation and gender fluidity.It remains the longest-running theatrical release in film history and still plays in cinemas today. We look back with the cast and crew to find out how the film became such a cult phenomenon.The year was 1974. Actor Richard O’Brien decided to adaptThe Rocky Horror Show for the big screen, workingwith the show’s director,Jim Sharman. They kept most of the original cast but the studio,20th Century Fox,insisted that the lead couple, Brad and Janet, were recast with Hollywood actors.Richard O’Brien,co-screenwriter, composer and Riff Raff(a“handyman”)I was approached by Mick Jagger’s people to buy the rights because he wanted to play Frank. I spoke to Jim, and he went: “No, don’t do that.” I said: “Why not?” He said: “Well, that means we won’t be able to make it.” It had never occurred to me that we’d be allowed to. By the time we got to Los Angeles, Lou Adler was the producer, and he made the overture to 20th Century Fox. Suddenly we were allowed not only to make the movie, but all be in it. The kids were allowed into the sweet shop.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Frank-N-Furter … ‘[in the film version] Frank became very glamorous – it was rather lovely.’Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyJim Sharman,director and co-screenwriterI was given two options. One was a reasonable budget with rock stars and the other one was a tiny budget keeping the original team together. I said: “Great, let’s do that.” I thought it was fine to have Americans playing the Americans, and it was great to have Barry [Bostwick] and Susan [Sarandon], who were, at that time, not particularly known.Barry Bostwick,Brad(a “hero”, who stumbles across Frank-N-Furter’s castle one stormy night along with his girlfriend Janet, played by Sarandon)It was interesting because [Susan and I replacing the original Brad and Janet] was a parallel to the characters coming into a new, strange world. Susan and I stepped into a very vibrant, glam, rocky environment in London. We were fish out of water; naive, wide-eyed and curious.Nell Campbell,Columbia (a tap-dancing “groupie” and Frank-N-Furter’s former lover)For [Bostwick and Sarandon] it was definitely a little difficult stepping into, basically, a theatre company because we’d all worked together for at least six months.Patricia Quinn,Magenta(Riff Raff’s sister and Frank-N-Furter’s “domestic”)Sharman said: “Let’s go around to [associate producer] John Goldstone’s house, and take a look at the sets and the designs.” So I went and saw this pink laboratory set. I saw Transylvanians [Frank-N-Furter’s alien companions] on motorbikes. I saw my dinner dress sketched by Sue Blane, the amazing costume designer, and I said: “Oh, I’m doing this.”View image in fullscreenDoing The Time Warp … in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyTim Curry, who had cut his teeth in the stage musical as Frank-N-Furter, made his film debut as the sex-crazed, corset-wearing scientist.BostwickI was enamoured with Tim’s acting chops. To watch him balance the meanness and darkness with the charm and seduction of that character, few people could have done that.O’BrienWhen we did it on stage, [Frank-N-Furter] was a bit more German expressionistic theatre, a lot more gothic and ghoulish, and the makeup was rougher. But when we got into the studio, Frank became very glamorous, and it was rather lovely.Production started in October 1974, ona budget of $1.4m, for nearly two months – on location inBray StudiosandOakley Court, a country housein Berkshire, which were both used for Hammer horror films.SharmanWe shot at the Hammer Horror studios as a bit of a homage. But that proved to be a little bit impractical. I made many impractical decisions. It was freezing, the middle of winter, the conditions were far from perfect.BostwickIt was a miserable shoot. I was always wet, I was in my underwear, and every 20 minutes, the prop guy was spraying me down with ice-cold water, because they apparently didn’t know how to heat up water in England at the time. So, Susan got pneumonia, and everybody had colds. I remember cursing a lot before scenes when the guy had to come by. At one point, I took the spray and started spraying him, just so he got a taste.View image in fullscreen‘The kids were allowed into the sweet shop’ … Richard O’Brien as Riff Raff, Tim Curry as Frank-N-Furter and Patricia Quinn as Magenta.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyCampbellIt was hilariously unglamorous … Mercifully, I had a fantastic silk padded dressing gown which got me through the shoot because we were half naked a lot of the time. We would have to hike to the bathrooms. And we were all being paid a very small amount.QuinnEverything was a bit of a surprise on this film. Nothing was explained. [The dining table scene didn’t have] anything to do with the play. Tim Curry was told to pull the tablecloth off the table in one fell swoop. Underneath was Meat Loaf [who played Eddie, a motorcyclist murdered by Frank-N-Furter]. I thought: “Oh my God,” because nobody told us. I got hysterics. Richard said to me: “Shut up.” It was hilarious, and it’s all in the film. There was no time to make mistakes.BostwickThe orgy in the swimming pool … We ended up on the stage, wet, in high heels, trying to do the high kicks. It took every bit of balance, energy and camaraderie to do that. Everybody was kissing and fondling underwater. And then when we got out, we went into a little warming booth. We had a cup of tea, and as we were leaving, it caught on fire. Everybody was afraid it was going to burn down the whole set, and we would be shut down. We got out just in time.They used an unusual technique to get the opening scene.QuinnJim said: “Have you ever seen Man Ray’s Lips, the painting?” “Never.” He said: “We could have your lips miming to Science Fiction.” They [erased] my face completely and painted my lips. I started to do it but the lips kept going out of frame. The lighting guy said: “You see that lamp, that’s clamped in that clamp? Bring it down and clamp her head.” So they brought over [the clamp] and screwed in the top and the sides so I was clamped … The most famous lips in cinema history.The intense shoot meant that no one had time to socialise.O’BrienWe were there first thing in the morning at six o’clock. You went home, straight to bed, to get up the next day. We didn’t have time to party.BostwickI don’t remember having dinner with anybody. I think I got to know the makeup guy better than anybody else … I was experiencing London for the first time. I spent my time at flea markets if I had a day off.QuinnWe were exhausted. I never even got to know Susan. Barry said to me once: “You never liked me.” And I said: “No, I didn’t, because I thought you were Brad” – you know, that dull person. There was no time for chit-chat.BostwickThere was a lot of pot going around in the ranks of the Transylvanians.The film flopped on itsrelease in August 1975and was panned by critics.O’BrienWe had our first viewing of the movie. We all left a little bit depressed. It seemed slow to me. It was a fast 90 minutes on stage. The film seemed more dreamlike, languid. I thought: “God, people should have picked up their cues a bit quicker.”CampbellIt was my big break, so the fact that it disappeared without a trace was very disappointing.View image in fullscreenNell Campbell as Columbia.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBostwickIt never opened in New York. Then I found out later that it hadn’t been a big hit when it opened in London.The film wasrereleased in midnight screenings in April 1976, with word-of-mouth spreading during its run atNew York’s Waverly Theater(now the IFC Center). Fans started to yell out their own responses to lines during screenings, and“shadow casts”dressed up as the characters and lip-synced their own performances in front of the screen. The film was embraced by the queer community, who found a sense of belonging in these immersive screenings.O’BrienI was at home one day, and someone said to me: “Have you heard about your movie?” I said: “Yes, opened and closed.” “No, it’s doing this midnight business.” That was a surprise.SharmanIn a funny way, I felt it would find that audience. Quite irrationally, because there was no reason why it would. But I always felt that there was something special about it. Lou understood the potential and persuaded people at Fox, who had more or less washed their hands of it, to start playing it at late night [screenings]; and so it grew.QuinnWhen I was in South Africa, people said it was being banned for corrupting the youth. They said it had been banned in Germany for cannibalism. I thought: “Wow, we’re going to be a hit.” The first Magenta [fan] ever to dress as me became one of my closest friends.View image in fullscreenA midnight showing at the Nuart Theater, Los Angeles.Photograph: Robert Landau/AlamyBostwickIt started out as a gay event …The audience were outcasts, in a way, from their own society. They found their family there. They found someplace to go and be seen. They were exploring who they were authentically in the world, and they were witnessing something in the film that they had never seen before; that there is an alternative way of being.CampbellIn the beginning, there weren’t that many things [they would call out to the screen]. Now they pretty much call out after every line. The original things were very witty and hilarious. But now – and I know that my fellow cast members agree – it’s too much because you can hardly hear anything without them screaming out.SharmanPeople said: “Are you horrified that your film is being used as wallpaper for a party?” I said: “No, it’s fantastic.”Sharman and O’Brien teamed up again for Shock Treatment, a loose follow-up to The Rocky Horror Picture Showreleased in 1981, which featured several of the same characters.O’BrienThe first draft had Rocky (a creature created by Frank-N-Furter and played by Peter Hinwood in the original film) rising from the grave, pulling Frank’s body from the rubble and dragging him back to Dr Scott (Jonathan Adams) to get him reanimated. The producers liked it. Jim said: “No, we’re not doing that.” Everything was reworked and Shock Treatment came up. It’s a flawed piece. I’m not happy with it, truthfully.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Dr Frank-N-Furter, Peter Hinwood as Rocky and Susan Sarandon as Janet.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamySharmanI felt Rocky Horror Picture Show was self-contained and resisted the idea of a sequel. Having moved on, I was also cautious about “putting the band back together”. I was, however, keen to work with Richard again. We depicted an America enslaved by reality TV run by a megalomaniac. It didn’t fly – maybe the satire seemed too dark and far-fetched for the time – though it has proved prophetic.The Rocky Horror Picture Show went on togrossmore than $115m worldwideand is now thelongest-running film release in cinema history. It continues to screen around the world.O’BrienI find it astonishing. People try forever to write something which has legs. It’s like a musical that was written in a 13-year-old boy’s bedroom … [LGBTQ+ fans] come and say that it was something that changed their lives. They found that they weren’t alone, that somehow there was a place for them in the world. They weren’t going to be laughed at, ridiculed.How we made: The Rocky Horror Picture ShowRead moreBostwickI think that my kids, if they have children, will be able to take their children to it and say: “That was your grandfather, and they used to call him ‘asshole’ [a common refrain called out by the audience during fan screenings] for his whole life. But he wasn’t. He was a great dad. He was just associated with this iconic story.” I’m very proud of it, and I’m a champion for its worldviews.CampbellWe’re the only positive cult I can think of. The great joy has been what this film means to so many people. It is still difficult for a lot of people to come out as gay or cross-dressers or bisexual or trans. This 50-year-old film still brings people together because of the shadow casts. I’ve met so many people that have met their partners that way. Sometimes at a screening I will meet an entire family dressed up as the characters. It’s just marvellous.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is screening at selected cinemas across the UK from 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsMusicalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of screaming, a few criers, a lot of punters standing on their seats. Within the sanctuary of the sound desk, one of the crew hands me some earplugs. “Protect your ears – a lot of squealers in today,” he says, with a wink.The Wiggles’ audiences are not known to hold back their enthusiasm, or ever put down the bubble guns, but there is a noticeably loud roar when a certain green man comes on stage: 31-year-old Dominic Field, AKA the Tree of Wisdom. After the show ends – their second of three that day alone, all sold out – Field shakes my hand as he’s wiping himself off. “I am a big sweater,” he says, affably. It is easy to see why.As the Tree of Wisdom, Field’s wild dancing, with hip thrusts, mad shimmying and the occasional worm, has taken both the world’s stages and TikTok by storm, inspiring thousands of copycats – from giggling parents to US college kids on a night out.On their recent tour of the US, Canada and the UK, Field spotted “like 10 trees in every audience – that was when I was like, I’ve made it”. He has unexpected fans in Khloé Kardashian, Jessie J and Robert De Niro – an ardent Wiggles fan of many years, who recently hugged Field backstage at one of their New York City shows. “He’s very softly spoken,” Field recalls. “He sat next to me and said in a very gentle tone, ‘I really appreciate what you do’.”Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

This is the complete opposite.”View image in fullscreen‘It just got bigger and bigger, and funnier and funnier’ … The Tree of Wisdom is now so big that the Wiggles’ next arena tour is named for him, with an album to go with it.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWhy the Wiggles have a tree in their lineup might be mystifying to some, until you remember that their entourage includes a pirate, a dinosaur, a dog and an octopus in a boater hat. How the tree became both wise and such a good dancer takes some explaining, but Field does his best:A couple years ago, the Wiggles were on tour in Newfoundland, Canada, an island with strong cultural ties to Ireland, Scotland and Celtic traditions. The locals seemed to love it when they played folk songs – the Wiggles are big on covers – so Anthony Field, the OG blue Wiggle and Field’s uncle, suggested they performRattlin’ Bog, an Irish song that speeds up with each verse and, most crucially for this story, is about a tree.The group’s musicians were so intently focused on learning to play the notoriously difficult song that Anthony only gave his nephew brief instructions: you’re the tree, dance onstage, do whatever you want.“And I was like, ‘Great,’” Field says, laughing.At first Field’s moves were “quite tame”. But as he got used to Rattlin’ Bog’s fast pace he began performing moves he had, in his words, perfected in Sydney’s nightclubs. “As I got comfortable with the song and started having more fun, the more phones I started to see come out,” he says. On YouTube alone, Rattlin’ Bog has now been watched 9m times.So Field was now a tree and his uncle had big plans for him. “Anthony called and said, ‘We’re going to expand the tree character!’” Field remembers. “Who knows how his brain works, but he was like ‘You’re the Tree of Wisdom! You are this all-knowing tree! So that’s how it started – then it just got bigger and bigger, and funnier and funnier.”Field has never had any professional dance training – which shows, but not in a negative way; I suspect it is his buzzed uncle vibe that people love so much. “I’m always that guy at a wedding who needs to get the dancefloor started,” he says. I suspect you knew how to do the worm before you joined the Wiggles, I say. “Oh, I was worming before I was walking,” he says.Field’s career trajectory has inspired the birth of the term “nepo tree”, but the Wiggles is very much a family business, albeit one worth an estimated $50m. His father, Paul, was in rock band the Cockroaches with two of the four original Wiggles – his brother Anthony and Jeff Fatt. But in 1988, Paul’s first child, Bernadette, died of SIDS at eight months, which devastated the group. Anthony left the band to study early education, then founded the Wiggles, bringing in Fatt, Murray Cook and Greg Page; their first album was dedicated to Bernadette. Paul became their manager in 1996.These days, Field’s older brother, Luke, is the Wiggles’ manager, while his cousin Lucia is a blue Wiggle like her father, Anthony, and his wife, Stephanie, is a Wiggles dancer who occasionally plays Dorothy the Dinosaur and Bubbles the Mermaid. Field himself made his first Wiggles appearance when he was just two,in the Wiggles video Wake Up Jeff!. The Wiggles have been part of his life for 30 years and counting.“When I was a kid, I didn’t see Anthony as a Wiggle. He was always just my uncle but everyone knew him, which was cool,” he recalls.Did he ever find the Wiggles uncool? “No, I loved it. Actually, on my first day at high school, dad dropped me off while listening to a new album because it was his job. The Wiggles were pumping out the car and that was the only moment I’ve ever been like, ‘Can you just turn that down a bit?’”At 19, Field began working as a stage technician for the Wiggles. Over the years, Anthony would encourage his nephew to sing and join them on stage; eventually he was stepping in for Anthony and Simon the red Wiggle at live shows or filling in as Captain Feathersword. And now he’s beloved by children and parents around the world for playing a groovy tree – an unexpected, but welcome outcome.Can you ever have a bad day as a dancing, singing tree? “Life happens, of course – but as soon as you get to work and you’re singing about hot potatoes, it’s really, really, really hard to have a bad day,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘People with little ones are probably watching the Wiggles 24 hours a day’.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianIn fact, the Tree of Wisdom is now so big that the Wiggles next arena tour is named for him, with an album to go with – and yes, it is all tree-related songs and yes, it includes a cover of Tina Turner’s Nutbush City Limits. “We’re gonna make sure that every year nine dance in every world is doing the Nutbush,” Field says. “We’re trying to get some tree-nagers.”Is it strange getting so much attention now? “No, I love it. I encourage it all. Honestly, people with little ones are probably watching the Wiggles 24 hours a day. When we met De Niro, his partner said, ‘I feel like I know you guys, but I’ve never met you.’”And these days, he’s loved for a character that has become entirely his own. “I’m just being myself – dressed as a tree. And people seem to be connecting with it. I’m proud of that. It’s been really cool to see it grow,” he pauses, then adds, cheekily: “Pun intended.”The Wiggles’ Tree of Wisdom Big Show Arena Spectacular!tourgoes on sale to the general public on 1 August at 2pm.Explore more on these topicsThe WigglesAustralian musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he’s taking on an even bigger franchise. Can lightning strike twice?Thu 31 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 11.39 EDTShareWhen it was first announced in 2013, the thought of Fargo being reimagined as a TV miniseries felt practically sacrilegious. The 1996 neo-noir starring Frances McDormand as a kindly Minnesota police chief was a singular film that had won two Oscars. Surely its distinctive Coen brothers vibe would get shredded in the woodchipper of TV adaptation?Back then, Noah Hawley, the screenwriter who took on the job, would have agreed. “It seemed like such a terrible idea,” he says via video call from a Long Island holiday bolthole. “Which is sort of why I liked it. The risk/reward was really high.”If his take on Fargo had sullied the original, Hawley jokes, he would have been “burned at the stake”. But his approach was more mindful reimagining than direct adaptation, with Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman leading a new small-town tale of malevolence and haplessness that perfectly captured the Coens’ essence. Fargo won three Emmys in 2014 – including outstanding limited series – and has continued as a star-studded anthology for another four seasons, with showrunner Hawley finding an intriguing new angle each time.View image in fullscreenWhat on Earth? … (from left) Sydney Chandler, Essie Davis, Noah Hawley and Timothy Olyphant on the set of Alien: Earth.Photograph: Patrick BrownIf taking on Fargo was a big swing, Hawley’s latest franchise remix is a literal beast. Alien: Earth is a prequel series to the durable sci-fi franchise that began with Ridley Scott’s clammy 1979 horror. Despite numerousAlienmovie sequels, crossovers and spin-offs, this is the first time the hissing, nightmarish xenomorph – “Maybe the best monster ever invented, cinematically,” Hawley suggests – has attempted to colonise TV.The approach had to be different from last year’s successful offshootAlien: Romulus, a back-to-basics slasher picking up plot threads from Scott’s original. “An Alien movie is a two-hour survival story, so the monsters can just be monsters,” says Hawley. “But in a 10-hour, 30-hour, 50-hour show the monsters have to exist for a reason. You’re also not killing everybody off, so there has to be a continuing serialised story in which the monsters fit.”With the critical acclaim that greeted Fargo and his 2017 series Legion – a subversive take on the X-Men comic-book mythos that ran for three trippy seasons – Hawley has helped elevate expectations for small-screen offshoots of existing intellectual property. “The question is always: why are we doing this?” he says. “And if you can’t answer the ‘why?’ question with something other than ‘money’ then probably you should stop.” What used to be cash-grab brand extensions now increasingly strive to be prestige projects, as evidenced by recent blue-chip TV efforts such as HBO’sThe Penguinand politically charged Star Wars hitAndor.It’s complex and layered … but I want you to come out of each episode going: yeah, come on!Hawley is technically on holiday when we speak: he, his artist wife Kyle and their two teenage kids have swapped the summer heat of their Austin, Texas base for New York state. The 58-year-old looks beach-ready in a casual short-sleeve shirt, but is happy to dig into the guts of his own summer blockbuster. It has been gestating since 2018 when, after the success of Legion, the FX channel asked how he might approach an Alien show. “If you ask me if I have an idea, I’m gonna have an idea,” he says.From the lofty prequel Prometheus to a shlocky crossover in Alien vs Predator, the franchise timeline has become cluttered over the past 45 years. Hawley’s pitch zeroed in on unexplored territory: what was happening on Earth in the years just before the events of Alien. The result is a mashup of Peter Pan dreaminess and heavy metal doom, with a sprawling ensemble cast including Babou Ceesay as a poker-faced security officer and Timothy Olyphant as a blond android “synth”. It is set in 2120 – a couple of years before Sigourney Weaver and her blue-collar crew of space truckers will have their fateful close encounter – and the Earth has, rather plausibly, been carved up by a cabal of all-powerful tech corporations.Weyland-Yutani, the franchise’s longstanding corporate baddy, is obviously in the mix. But a pushy rival called Prodigy has secretly cracked transhumanism, decanting consciousness into powerful synth bodies. The catch is that only young minds are flexible enough for the process, so terminally ill kids are being reborn as herculean but emotionally immature “hybrids”. “If you’re telling a story about humanity there’s nobody more human than a child,” says Hawley. “They don’t know they’re bad liars, they can’t pretend they’re not scared and they learn to be cynical. So that was interesting to me.”View image in fullscreenBeast mode … Alex Lawther, Diêm Camille and Moe Bar-El in Alien: Earth.Photograph: Patrick Brown/FXWhen a hulking research vessel carrying unpleasant cosmic beasties crash-lands on a hi-tech city in Thailand, the hybrids are deployed on a search-and-rescue mission. “We’re fast, we’re strong and we don’t break,” points out lead hybrid Wendy, played with suitably childlike glee by Sydney Chandler (Pistol, Sugar). The stage is set for a corporate turf war amid a citywide state of emergency.Coming up with new aliens that could exist alongside the familiar xenomorph was “daunting” for Hawley. The aim was to evoke the feeling of watching Alien for the first time. “They don’t have to carry the day,” he says. “They just have to offer that feeling of unpredictability. By introducing these other creatures, I am able to give you a sense of: well, now I don’t know what’s going to happen.”After the fraught terrain of Fargo andLegion, where an emotional gut punch never felt far away, Alien: Earth feels like Hawley in a brasher, more swaggering mode.

It was a creative household: his mother, Louise Armstrong, was a writer, painter and activist; his father trained as an actor. “We grew up in the West Village in the 70s and 80s when the only people down there were artists,” he says. “It was not the billionaire row that it is today.”After studying political science, Hawley worked as a paralegal while also playing in rock bands and dabbling in creative writing. At 27, he had moved to San Francisco and published his first novel. Despite getting a two-book deal he was struggling with the follow-up. “My editor had left, and the publisher wasn’t really interested in the book that I wrote,” he says, “so I was in kind of a desperate moment.” Helping a friend refine a screenplay led to him pitching and selling his own projects: “Within six months I went from someone who basically didn’t know how I was going to keep the lights on until the end of the year to this whole other career.”He has continued to write novels in parallel with his showrunner career – his sixth, Anthem, was published in 2022 – and made his feature directorial debut in 2019 with the astronaut psychodrama Lucy in the Sky, starring Natalie Portman. If this magpie approach suggests a certain creative restlessness – he also provided vocals forLegion’s spacey soundtrack of retro covers– it has also been a conscious attempt at diversifying. “It’s given me a lot of options, which as an artist translates into a modicum of control over your own destiny,” he says.View image in fullscreenIce work … Martin Freeman in Noah Hawley’s 2014 TV adaptation of Fargo.Photograph: Channel 4/Sportsphoto/AllstarOne unexpected early influence is British comedy. After studying theatre in London, his father returned with Goon Show LPs that Hawley and his brother could soon recite by heart. “I just wore those records out,” he remembers. He also devoured NPR repeats of the BBC’s 1978 radio sitcom The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and enthuses about seeing The Young Ones at an impressionable age.That meant the casting ofAdrian Edmondsonas a sinister aide-de-camp in Alien: Earth was a real full-circle moment. “I told Adrian that there was a moment on The Young Ones [in the episode Flood] that informs everything you need to know about me as a storyteller,” he says. “It was when his character, Vyvyan, walked into the closet and ended up in Narnia. I must have been in my teens when I saw it and it was such a mind-blowing thing, that you could have magical realism in a comedy about roommates.”What was it like meeting his childhood hero? “I’ve found with a lot of comedic actors that their downtime persona is very different. Adrian is very measured, you know.” Hawley laughs. “He’s much more like his character in our show than Vyvyan.”Alien: Earth launches 13 August on Disney+ in the UK.This article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version said the BBC radio sitcom The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was an adaptation of the novels; however, the radio show preceded the books.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAlienScience fiction TVScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it gets better, in a brain-melting sort of way …Lucy ManganThu 31 Jul 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 12.58 EDTShareLeanne Morgan came to standup relatively late. Born and raised in rural Tennessee, she got married at 26 to her college sweetheart and raised three children while the couple built a jewellery business together. It was the door-to-door selling she did and the Tupperware parties she hosted for extra income that first got her a local reputation for being funny and then led to bookings at comedy gigs. But it wasn’t until 2018, when she hired a social media relations team to promote clips of her act online and they went viral, that her comedy career took off and real fame beckoned. Two years ago, when she was 57, Netflix first broadcast her hour-long standup show I’m Every Woman, which she was performing on a 100-city tour. It shows the audience eating out of her hand as she takes them down the highways and byways of marital and menopausal life. Now she is the lead in a new Chuck Lorre-produced sitcom Leanne.It is best to be upfront about these things and say that the opening episode is bad. Worse than you’ve just assumed when I said “bad.” Gone is the lightness of touch, the consummate ease, the subtly immaculate timing of her stage show; instead, we have a leaden script punctuated by a desperate laughter track, and a one-note performance by Morgan as “Leanne”, a menopausal woman closing in on 60, whose husband, Bill (Ryan Stiles), has just run off with a younger woman after 33 years of what his wife had thought was a perfectly happy marriage.Rounding out what is shaping up to be a 16-episode car crash between derivativesitand vanishingly littlecomare a set of stock family members. There is son Tyler (Graham Rogers), adored by his mother, henpecked by his wife; deadbeat daughter Josie (Hannah Pilkes), forever drunk/high and/or wondering whether she’s pregnant, and ageing parents Daddy John (Blake Clark), ornery and tough, and Mama Margaret (Celia Weston), sweet and frail. Then there’s twice-divorced, pill-popping sister Carol, played by the usually glorious Kristen Johnston, who here spends 22 minutes reduced to constant gurning in the absence of any actual jokes to deliver. When a perky neighbour at church tells her “I’m basking in the sunshine of our saviour!”, Johnston distends her face to its not-inconsiderable maximum as she replies: “Working on a melanoma, good.” Well, you’ve got to do something. God, who’d be an actor?There are a few stabs at pathos – Bill says he will still be around “for the important stuff”, Leanne replies “I thoughtIwas the important stuff” – more lines where the intended comedic effect is revealed only by the laughter track, and then it is, mercifully, over.If you can get past this initial horror, however, things get better. Partly, I think, genuinely and quantifiably. The actors find a rhythm, the strain on everyone involved becomes less apparent and the jokes become recognisable as jokes. Not good jokes, not ones I would quote here, confident that they could survive the transition to print, but keep in mind that at one point in the first episode the exchange “You can’t keep a secret”, “Watch me!” was scored as such, so we are working within the narrowest margins here.And once your expectations are suitably lowered, it takes on a charm of its own. The colours are bright. The multi-camera format reminds you of happier, simpler times from your youth. Morgan and Johnston are in almost every scene and have comedy chops that can overcome even the most defiantly second- and third-tier writing and reward your viewing investment with glimmers of merriment. It starts to take on a rosy hue. Are you entertained, or just glad that the first 22 minutes are safely past and need never be seen again?Who’s to say? Whatever is happening, it’s … sort of nice. Will Carol drag her sister out on a disastrous date night before she’s ready? Why, yes, yes she will. Leanne ruins the vibe by showing the guy pictures of her beloved grandson (“Named after his granddaddy, who may rot in hell!”). Did you see the second half of that line coming? Of course you did. But now it’s kind of comforting instead of eye-rollingly inadequate when it arrives, no? Let’s just try one more episode and see if it gets a little better after this one, too. I think it does! Or is my brain melting? And does it matter? I feel happy. I am happy.All of which is to say – I’ve no idea what star rating to give this thing. One? Or five? Perhaps I should average it out to three, even though it feels overall like a two? But Leanne – or “Leanne” – is doing her best! And she’s so good in her special! And I’m so glad she’s out there, flying the flag for older women! And I love her accent. That may be what is casting most of the spell, now that I think about it. So be it. Two stars for the show, one for the honeyed drawl. There you go.Leanne is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It then moves through settings of more unfamiliar composers such as Vicente Lusitano and Nicola Vicentino to end with Marenzio and Luzzaschi, whose madrigals – settings ofPetrarchand a section of Dante’s Inferno respectively – seem to be poised on the cusp between the renaissance and the early baroque.It’s music that was composed in the same period asGesualdo’smuch better known madrigals, which sometimes use chromaticism and dissonance to even more spectacular effect. Yet the writhing, convoluted lines of these pieces, negotiated with exemplary precision and clarity by the seven singers of Exaudi, their voices perfectly matched and balanced, carry their own expressive power. This is a disc that becomes more fascinating and involving the more you listen to it.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Not only were the postwar generation that included Maurizio Pollini, Radu Lupu, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim and Murray Perahia at the height of their powers, andMartha Argerichwas still giving solo recitals, but almost all of the greatest pianists of the second half of the 20th century – Sviatoslav Richter,Emil Gilels, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Annie Fischer, Rudolf Serkin – were more less regular visitors to the capital. And though since his death in 1991 his reputation and his considerable recorded legacy seem to have faded from view,Claudio Arrauunquestionably belonged among that senior elite, too, every one of his appearances, whether in concertos or recitals, eagerly anticipated.View image in fullscreenA reminder of just how rewarding Arrau’s playing could be in those years is provided by this collection of recordings of three recitals that the Chilean pianist gave in the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, California, in 1977, 1981 and 1986. The layout of the discs follows the original programmes exactly – the first recital Beethoven, Liszt and Brahms, the second devoted to Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy, Chopin and Liszt, the third to four Beethoven sonatas, including richly satisfying performances of the Waldstein Sonata Op 53 and Les Adieux Op 81a. Arrau’s rich, almost plummy piano sound is recognisable from the very first bars, as is his emphatic phrasing, which can sometimes seem out of place in Debussy or Schumann, but is wonderfully appropriate in Beethoven, Liszt and Brahms, and is combined with an unfaltering sense of structure; so that where each performance is, and where it is heading, are never in doubt. It’s all wonderfully lucid playing, which hasn’t dated in the slightest.Listen to the album on Apple musicAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Said features usually discuss their onstage theatricality – there is talk of improvised dance and indeed “experimental ballet”, and of fake blood and their all-white homemade costumes, equal parts cottagecore andMidsommar. There are indications that the music the band make is merely part of a broader artistic practice that also involves painting, writing, photography and “traditional female crafts”, among them knitting.Then there’s mention of their curious instrumentation, in which violin, cello and flute have as much role to play as guitar, bass and drums. And there’s a frequent suggestion that the band are sonically sui generis: “We weren’t consciously inspired by any other musicians … it was like we created a new universe of paradise without even realising that’s what we were doing”; “The Velvet Underground are the only band I can compare us to – there’s a similar spirit there, but the New Eves aren’t about genre”.View image in fullscreenClaiming you are, as Duke Ellington liked to say, “beyond category” is part of any new band’s standard attention-grabbing arsenal. And in this case, in one sense at least, it isn’t true. Any alternative rock band who deploy strings to scrape and drone are almost inevitably going to attract some kind of comparison to the John Cale-era Velvet Underground. But, intentional or not, there are also plenty of other reference points you might reasonably mention to describe the music on the New Eves’ debut album The New Eve Is Rising.Something of the Raincoats’ rickety post-punk explorations seem to haunt its sound, albeit relocated from Notting Hill to a more pastoral setting. So does the lo-fi avant-garage rock of the early-80s Fall, which is audible amid the simple riffs and relentless drumming of Highway Man. There is occasionally a bleating quality about the vocals that automatically summons the ghost of Tyrannosaurus Rex-era Marc Bolan. Equally, at their most full throated, they recall the powerful but ascetic harmonies of folk familythe Watersons. When the vocals tend to spoken word declamation – as on opener The New Eve – you might think not only of Patti Smith but those moments in Crass’s oeuvre when the microphone was ceded to Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre.And yet, if there are plenty of artists other than the Velvet Underground whom you could compare the New Eves to – from trad folk to distaff anarcho-punk to hippy whimsy – the band’s central point still stands. Whatever ingredients went into the recipe, the result doesn’t ultimately sound like much else, and there is often something rather thrilling about being in its presence. The weird blend of glam drums, sawing strings and folky vocal roar on Cow Song, for example. Volcano’s slow surge from gentle fluting bucolia to a potent sense of menace. The moment on Rivers Run Red when the scrabble of strings and guitars dramatically finds an urgent percussive shape.It’s given an extra frisson by the fact that, whatever the circumstances of its recording, The New Eve Is Rising sounds as if it’s being played live, by a band who prize immediacy over virtuosity, with all the teetering potential for disaster that suggests. There’s a certain white-knuckle intensity to the moment when Circles shifts its rhythm, and given that the change is counted in with such vociferousness, perhaps it hasn’t always come off in the past.Said disaster never strikes, although you do occasionally wonder if something may have been lost in translation from live show to studio, despite their best efforts. The spoken-word manifesto of The New Eve probably feels more viscerally powerful delivered in front of your eyes than it does coming out of your speakers. But the moments when the album doesn’t quite work are tempered by the sense that this is a band still in a state of flux and progress, working out where they might go next – the “rising” in the title seems the operative word – rather than a perfectly finished product with all of the doubts about how to move on which that would entail. That the New Eves are overflowing with ideas is obvious from their interviews and their debut album alike. The latter presents them in rough hewn and occasionally chaotic style: it feels exciting, as does their future.What Alexis listened to this weekCate Le Bon – Is It Worth It (Happy Birthday)?An equivocal title for an equivocal song – the dreaminess of whose sound is undercut by a strange, sickly quality.

That man was Roger Butler, who was blind, in his 60s and initially wary of having a stranger come to his house. Before their first meeting, Butler asked their mutual friend whether Stephens was “one of us”, by which he meant gay.The pair soon established a bond, as Stephens read books by Alan Hollinghurst and Edmund White to Butler over a bottle of red wine. Sometimes Butler would ask him to read excerpts from his own autobiographical essays which told of his life growing up gay in postwar Britain. In 1960, Butler had joined forces with two colleagues from the Homosexual Law Reform Society and written a letter to national newspaper editors outing themselves. Beginning the letter with “Sir, we are homosexuals”, all were risking their freedom at a time when sex between men was illegal.The Light of Day tells the parallel stories of Stephens’s burgeoning friendship with Butler in his twilight years, and the latter’s life as a pioneer of gay liberation. While Stephens reads the chapters detailing his visits to Butler’s home, Griff Mellhuish narrates the sections about Butler’s early life. The audio version also features delightfully crackly home recordings made by Butler in which he discusses his parents and catches up on his correspondence. In a moving final clip, he notes that he doesn’t regret the blindness that struck in his 30s since it led to “the most miraculous thing”, which was moving to Oxford and meeting Stephens.Available via Headline, 9hr 43minFurther listeningThe Undisputed King of SelstonDanny Scott, John Murray, 9hr 10minA poignant and funny memoir of life in a coal-mining town in the 1970s.

It’s an absolutely brilliant book exploring radicalisation, manipulation and belonging, involving a Muslim woman from London and a disillusioned US veteran – a very topical story that gets underneath the headlines, breathtakingly paced with twists and turns all the way. Mukherjee is a skilled author who can get into the minds of very different characters. It’s frighteningly realistic as to how people can find themselves in situations they would never have believed possible and how life can turn on a sixpence.The characters and the plot are totally believable and offered an opportunity to see many sides to one story. I hope there will be a sequel as I found myself thinking of each character long after I finished the book.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingOcean VuongIrvine WelshBarbara KingsolverFictionCrime fictionPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born in 1941, Rosalind Belben was first published in the 1970s; this, her fourth novel, first came out in 1979. Her eighth and most recent, Our Horses in Egypt, won the James Tait Black award in 2007.Dreaming of Dead People might best be described as an early example of autofiction: its narrator, Lavinia, is the same age as Belben was at the time of writing, and she recalls a similar childhood in Dorset, including a father who was a Royal Navy commander and who was killed when she was three. Belben has described the book as “a study of the human figure”, and given its parallels with her own life story and its raw and deeply personal style any reader could be forgiven for assuming that the figure is her own.The book is divided into six very different sections, including a stay in Venice, a treatise on masturbation, a description of a beloved dog’s euthanasia and a vivid erotic daydream involving Robin Hood. It is hard, at first, to understand how these parts relate to one another, for this uncompromising book offers few obvious clues, but on second reading they shift and merge, and the payoff for this extra mental and imaginative effort is a truthful and vivid portrait of a highly particularised human consciousness.In the first section, At Torcello, Lavinia recalls a trip to the Venetian island in winter. She is there to see a Byzantine mosaic of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, an image of motherhood that will echo through the book. While she is on the island she meets an English family for whom she will later babysit during a power cut, her relationship to children and the idea of family coming slowly into focus.Torcello and Venice itself are made strange by the things she notices, and by her attitude to them, both at the time and in recollection: a pregnant dog, a miserable rat, a canal’s water, “dull of eye”. “In that sour and barren place, a spinster, who did not wish for the dry, un-rustling grass. I weep with mortification. Yet I was extremely happy.” Belben’s angular syntax, frequent ellipses and unusual punctuation force the reader to slow down, think, and pay attention.If this novel is as confessional as it seems, it is truly fearless: death, ageing, anorgasmia, loneliness, despair and madness are all hereIt becomes clear that Lavinia is full of regrets. Having nursed her mother through a long final illness, she has not had sex for 10 years and wonders if others now see her as “not among the fuckers of this world”. She had assumed she would marry and have children, but nobody ever proposed; in today’s world, of course, she would not consider herself “a shrivelled person … an old maid” at 36, but things were different in the 1970s, something which makes her lack of shame all the more remarkable: “I have woken sopping and swollen, with a devil to suppress between my legs.”If this novel is as confessional as it seems, it is truly fearless: death, ageing, anorgasmia, loneliness, despair and madness are all here, jostling for attention, just as they do for many of us, for all we may seek to tune them out. Meanwhile, Lavinia learns to masturbate with an electric toothbrush.The Robin Hood section is a change of gear so abrupt it risks whiplash. As a child Lavinia identified with the idea of a forest-dwelling outlaw (“the myth of the greenwood … a cosy, complete, limited life”), and loved books about children who live outdoors: BB’s classic Brendon Chase andArthur Ransome’s Swallows and Amazonsalso form part of the fantasy. But this book is no fairy story, instead a sensuous, funny account of a sexual encounter between Hood and the wife of Sir Richard atte Lee, a figure from early medieval ballads. This is a vision of sexuality as pure, natural and incorruptible, a vital component in what today’s pop psychologists might call Lavinia’s “love map”.The Echoes by Evie Wyld review – ghosts of the pastRead moreAs the sections unfold, a succession of images and recollections relentlessly and obliquely illuminate one another in the manner of anAdam Curtis film. We glimpse Lavinia’s relationship with her beloved but complicated mother (“something stiff and unyielding, fierce and loving”) and learn more about her deep affinity for animals, particularly horses and dogs, both subjects of Belben’s own later books; we understand her attitude to death, and to London; see the damage inflicted by her schooling, and witness her sustaining, at times ecstatic relationship with the natural world (her account of a trip to Scotland beats nearly all of today’s nature writing into a cocked hat). She imagines the daughter she might have had, and names her “Jessie”, but dwells uneasily on the very different childhood she would doubtless have compared with her own: “She would reckon a Forestry Commission plantation is a nice wood to walk in … she wouldn’t have a clue about apples, how to pick them, how to store them: or pears.”You can feel Lavinia/Belben thinking and imagining her way through something that she might otherwise have had the opportunity to understand in practice: the inevitable distance between generations and the inexorable pace of change.“I am worried that Jessie won’t read,”she writes [italics her own]. “It would be my greatest dread.”The last pages of Dreaming of Dead People dissolve into an impressionistic but carefully structured stream of consciousness, dwelling on ageing and mortality, loneliness and inner strength: extraordinary from any writer, but particularly from one in only her middle 30s. It is extremely beautiful, utterly convincing, and rivals anything byVirginia Woolf. “There comes a time for making peace with oneself,” Belben writes, as Lavinia. “Life as I have known it is ending. I am drying up … I am saying: here is a life, what do you make of it. And trying not to mind that you turn aside.”Dreaming of Dead People by Rosalind Belben is published by And Other Stories, (£14.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Some we will want to hear, others to dismiss. Perhaps we will yearn for the kind of uplifting tale given to us initially by Aaron Pang – about a tragic accident and his overcoming of adversity to find true love. Or perhaps we will demand something grittier.In his sweet and clever one-man show, Pang offers to give us both.First, he leads us into a happy-ending trap; a story that is not what it seems. Then, he questions our need to see him, a disabled man who walks with leg supports and a cane, as the conquering hero of his own story. Would we think less of him if the dice had not rolled in his favour?To demonstrate how programmed we are, he shows us a diagram of a classic story arc, mirroring the tale he has just told. Even then, with our eyes wide open, we still want a narrative in which everything works out. He gives us the option of two endings,Choose Your Own Adventure style, and smiles wryly when we vote for the most comforting.Connie Chen’s simple, chatty production sits somewhere between standup and spoken word, framing the actor as charming, cheery and self-aware as he describes with humour and not a little poignancy the mismatch between his erotic desire and physical capability. What starts as a standard coming-of-age tale about a boys’ school chorister making fumbling approaches to the girl he fancies turns into something sharper and deeper.Pang is brave in his willingness to talk about a sex life that deviates from the social norm and gently provocative in his needling of the audience: what prejudice lies behind our impulse for the perfect story in an imperfect world?At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDisabilityComedy (Stage)Spoken wordEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

She also trained young performers who went straight into featured roles on the West End stage, such asDenise van Outenin Les Miserables and Nicola Stapleton (later of EastEnders) in Aspects of Love.Then, in 1994, when the directorSam Mendesauditioned 3,000 children for his revival of Oliver! at the London Palladium, he found five of the six juvenile leads and almost half of the other young cast members, among Young’s “babies”, as she called them.Although her classes included males such asMatt Willis, of the pop group Busted, and the actorsSteven Mackintoshand John Pickard, many of those who went on to find success were female. “We produce girls with bottle,” said Young, who survived a tough upbringing in London’s East End. “We develop confidence.”The Sylvia Young theatre school opened with 27 pupils and became one of a small band of performing arts establishments offering full-time courses to those aged between 10 and 16. It grew to accommodate more than 200 pupils, along with a staff of 20, providing both training as performers and an academic education from qualified teachers.Monday to Wednesday were spent on standard school lessons, while Thursday and Friday were reserved for the performing arts. “My aim was to prove that coming to a stage school would not be detrimental to a child’s general education,” said Young. Dean Gaffney, who joined EastEnders in 1993, recalled that the end of each week “turned into a complete Fame school, with people singing down the hallways and tracksuits instead of school uniform”.Saturday and summer classes were also established, as well as two affiliated agencies to seek work: Young ’Uns for pupils and Rossmore Management for others over 16.Providing places for those on scholarships and bursaries was important to Young, who said: “I’ve never wanted it to be purely for children of the wealthy.” She encouraged her charges to learn talents across the board – singing, dancing and acting – and to consider associated jobs such as casting agents, camera operators or writers.Other graduates of the school include Naomi Campbell, Samantha Janus, Kellie Bright,Nicholas Hoult, Dani Behr, the singerDua Lipa, three members of the girl band All Saints and the casting director Tony de Freitas, as well as Adele Silva, Sheree Murphy and Isabel Hodgins, who all joined the ITV soap Emmerdale.View image in fullscreenAmy Winehouse was ‘very clever’ and ‘very naughty’ at the school. ‘I liked her tremendously,’ said Young.Photograph:  /AlamyContrary to some reports, Winehouse was not expelled, said Young, who told the Guardian in 2022 that the future singing sensation was “very clever” but “very naughty”, finding the academic work too easy and becoming bored. “I liked her tremendously.”Young was born Sylvia Bakal in Whitechapel, east London. Her mother, Sophie (nee Wexler), was of Romanian heritage, while her father, Abraham, who served in the 17th/21st Lancers, had parents from Belgium and Romania, After the second world war he worked as a tailor’s presser, then owned a betting shop.Evacuated to live with a mining family in a village outside Barnsley in 1943, Sylvia returned to London after the war to be brought up, the eldest of nine children, in a three-bedroom council flat. Finding peace at her local library, she read hundreds of plays as a child.On leaving Skinners’ Company school, Stamford Hill, in north London, at 16 she took a clerical job before working for Stoke Newington Libraries (1956-57), then – despite suffering stage fright – acting with the amateur repertory company at MountviewTheatreClub (1957-65). She became a stay-at-home mother following the births of her two daughters by Norman Ruffell, whom she married in 1961.Helping to stage a fundraising show for her girls’ primary school, Aldersbrook, in 1972 led her to create its Young ’Uns company, performing old-time music-hall routines for charity. When pupils started to call her Sylvia Young-un, she adopted the name.From 1973 she ran a singing and drama group in Manor Park, east London, before setting up a Saturday school six years later in the Notre Dame de France church near Leicester Square. In 1980 this moved to the premises of a boys’ club in Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and became the Sylvia Young theatre school the following year. A relocation to Marylebone shortly afterwards was followed in 2010 by a move to Marble Arch.Among Young’s pupils over the years was her own elder daughter, Frances Ruffelle, whom she expelled for bad behaviour. “I was 15 years old, a wayward teenager who talked back, and my mother decided she couldn’t teach me,” said Ruffelle, who went on to star in West End musicals such as Les Miserables and Chicago. Young’s other daughter, Alison, also acted, ran Rossmore Management and eventually became managing director of the school in 2015.Young was made OBE in 2005 and won a special recognition Olivier award in 2022.Her husband and children survive her, along with four grandchildren, the pop singer Eliza Doolittle, Nat, Felix and Coral.Sylvia Young (Sylvia Bakal), stage school principal, born 18 September 1939; died 30 July 2025Explore more on these topicsTheatreAmy WinehouseNaomi CampbellBillie PiperDua LipaobituariesShareReuse this content"

After Janet’s death in 1994, he worked with illustrators such asRaymond Briggsand Bruce Ingman, with his career coming full circle in a series of collaborations with his daughter Jessica including Half a Pig and a pop-up set of anarchic variations on the tale of Goldilocks.“He was enormously playful in spirit and language and had the ability to make you smile in one sentence,” said Belinda Ioni Rasmussen, CEO of Walker Books Group, which published some of his books. “Allan inspired generations of children’s writers, inspired all of us who worked with him, and inspired artists to make some of their very best work.”Top illustrators pay homage to Allan Ahlberg - in picturesRead moreBorn in 1938, Ahlberg was adopted into a working-class family living in the West Midlands town of Oldbury. “My parents loved me and they did me a huge service saving me from growing up in a children’s home,”he told the Guardian in 2006, “but there were a fair few clips round the ear, no books and not much conversation.”After grammar school and national service, Ahlberg worked as a postman, plumber’s mate and gravedigger. But his life took a different turn when the head of Oldbury’s parks and cemeteries heard he had A-levels, and decided Ahlberg should become a teacher. “I didn’t think it was such a good idea,”Ahlberg recalled in 2011. “I was very shy – I found it embarrassing to buy a bus ticket. But he got me to put my suit on and have a wash and a clean-up, and he took me to one or two schools, just to visit, just to get the feel of it.”He fell in love with teaching, and fell in love again when he met Janet Hall while they were both studying at a teacher training college in Sunderland. After marrying in 1969 they settled near Leicester, Ahlberg teaching in a primary school while Janet worked as an illustrator. But when she despaired of the humdrum material she was drawing and asked Ahlberg to write her a story, he later recalled, “It was as if she turned a key in my back and I was off.”After a string of rejections from publishers, the floodgates opened in 1976 with the vibrantly coloured The Old Joke Book. The following year saw the couple pivot into fiction with the story of a boy who stops growing and starts to shrink, The Vanishment of Thomas Tull, and Burglar Bill, who “lives in a tall house full of stolen property”, has “stolen fish and chips and a cup of stolen tea for supper” and then “swings a big stolen sack over his shoulder and goes off to work, stealing things”.Their reputation was established in 1978 with a book for younger readers, Each Peach Pear Plum. A jaunty rhyme takes the reader on a daisy-chain game of I-spy offering glimpses of Tom Thumb up a peach tree, Cinderella dusting in the cellar, Baby Bunting falling from a tree and Jack and Jill disappearing down the hill. It was hailed as “a work of genius” by the critic Elaine Moss, with Janet’s illustrations earning her the prestigious Kate Greenaway medal the following year.Ahlberg returned to his childhood in the West Midlands with Peepo!, a day in the life of a baby in a working-class family during the second world war. Cut-out circles offer a peek of “his father sleeping / In the big brass bed” and “his sisters searching / For a jar or tin / To take up to the park / And catch fishes in”. The secret was “all in the engineering”, Ahlberg told the Guardian. “You have to turn the page in order to see something – it’s a whole string of little suspenses, almost like in a theatre.”Their daughter Jessica became an inspiration, with her appetite for flicking through catalogues inspiring The Baby’s Catalogue. Her love of playing with the post inspired The Jolly Postman, an intricately constructed story of deliveries to fairytale characters complete with envelopes containing letters and cards. It was five years in the making and went on to sell more than 6m copies.View image in fullscreenAn early draft of The Jolly Postman by Janet and Allan Ahlberg.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianJanet was 50 when she died of breast cancer in 1994, leaving Ahlberg and his 15-year-old daughter bereft. It was a book created in memory of his wife that lifted him out of despair, he later recalled: “Writing about something is distancing it … It distracted me for a whole year. And then I was on the road to recovery.”My famous illustrator parentsRead moreThe road led to a new publisher, where he met the editor Vanessa Clarke, who he later married, and collaborations with other illustrators. He teamed up with Bruce Ingman for The Runaway Dinner and The Pencil, and with Raymond Briggs for The Adventures of Bert. In 2004, Half a Pig marked the first joint project for Ahlberg and his daughter, with the pair going on to collaborate on titles including a memoir of his childhood, The Bucket, and a reworking of Goldilocks.Meanwhile Ahlberg kept working, heading across the garden most days to write in his shed.“I’m like a dripping tap,” he said in 2011. “As I get older I drip more slowly, but I still come down here. I’m less impatient to spend hour after hour writing, though I like it as much as ever.”Explore more on these topicsChildren and teenagersRaymond BriggsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes, when he was drinking from it, I thought: “I’ll have a drink from it as well.” But then I asked him if he was going to take it down, and he just brushed it off.One day, we were having an intimate moment and he whipped out the water bladder and started drinking from it. He should have been concentrating on me so I was annoyed, and now it’s banished.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. That’s acceptable – but it’s not for the bedroomIt was just a huge turnoff. It looks like a drip and it reminds me of a hospital. When you’re with your partner that’s not the connotation you want. Hydration is important, but if Wes needs a drink during sex a water bottle or a cup of water is more appropriate.The water bladder was up for about two and a half months in total. That moment tipped me over the edge, and thankfully Wes listened to me.We have come to an agreement to keep it out of the bedroom, but I know that part of him wants it back. We are going to a festival this weekend and Wes says he is going to bring two water bladders. I won’t be drinking from one unless there’s an emergency.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. I think that’s acceptable as it’s what it was originally designed for – but it’s not for the bedroom.Even though we live separately, as I usually go to Wes’s place, I think he should listen to me when I say I’m not comfortable with something. He did take it down after that incident, but I know if I allowed it, the water bladder would go straight back up.The defence: WesI get that it was maybeinsensitive to do it during sex, butI didn’t expect her to be so botheredAfter building myself a four-poster bed while I was bored, I attached a water bladder I had lying around the house with a little bit of string, looping it over the top of the bed. I thought it was practical and funny. It was really hot recently, so it was a good way to stay hydrated.At first, Leanne drank from it with me when she came round to stay. She didn’t seem opposed to it. But then when I drank from it during an intimate moment she reacted really strongly. Things came to an abrupt halt there and then, and the water bladder was removed immediately. It felt like an overreaction in the face of something I thought was totally innocent. I get that it was bad timing and maybe a bit insensitive to do it during sex. However, I didn’t expect her to be so bothered.We are going to a festival soon and she’s banned me from using it in the tent tooIt started out as “look at this fun idea”, and I thought: “Wow, I can drink hands-free.” But then Leanne said she didn’t like the imagery of it. I do get that the thought of me lying in bed with a tube stuck out of my mouth during sex isn’t very attractive.But we are going to a festival soon and she’s banned it in the tent too. She’s OK with me using it when we’re out and about, just not when I’m lying down inside the tent. I think it’s much more practical than a cup – there’s no risk of spillage. And surely a water bladder is appropriate in any context where you’re camping?If we are in the crowds for hours and Leanne runs out of water, and I’ve got litres left in the bladder, I think she’ll end up using it. It’s a different context to the bedroom, but it seems like the whole idea of the water bladder is totally corrupted for Leanne now.There’s not really a middle ground for her when it comes to the water bladder. I’ve suggested getting a smaller one, but to no avail. Ultimately, Leanne’s upset is more important than the convenience. If it means she is happier, then it’s worth it, but privately I think a water bladder is entirely functional. If she said I could hang it off the bed again, I 100% would.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wes should focus on understanding Leanne’s feelings and how to use bladders appropriately, rather than trying to shoehorn them into every situation.Adnaan, 30Leanne is well within her rights to ban the bladder from the bedroom and also from what functions as a bedroom while they are at the festival. This still leaves Wes plenty of opportunities to hydrate when he’s out and about, just not during sleep or sex!Harmony, 30It’s entirely reasonable to ask that the water bladder isn’t used in the bedroom. Yet, I think it is totally normal to use it in most other contexts, including at a festival. Wes has been willing to make adjustments, so Leanne should let him drink in the tent.Lola, 25Leanne has made it perfectly clear to Wes that she finds the water bladder distasteful, and it makes her uncomfortable.Relationshipsare about compromise – when your partner tells you they don’t like something, you stop doing it. There is no reasonable excuse to persist with this.Peter, 60Wes isn’t a Formula One driver, he can take 10 seconds to drink from a glass. A bladder at a festival makes sense, but using one in the home is unnecessary. Leanne is right to come down hard on it, and Wes is right to concede.Matt, 30Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who should suck it upThe poll closes on Wednesday 6 August at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whether Cara should stop scrimping on holiday46%said yes – Cara is guilty54%said no – Cara is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pharmacists explain how to avoid the worst insects have to offerSarah PhillipsThu 31 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareAdownside to hot weather is all the bugs that can feast on or sting us. Is there anything you can do to avoid this? And what should you do if you are attacked? Here’s what pharmacists have to say about the best ways to prevent and treat stings and bites.Know which bugs to be wary ofThe British Pest Control Association has warned of arise in wasp activitydue to recent heatwaves. “I am definitely seeing more wasps around at the moment,” says Claire Nevinson, the superintendent pharmacist for Boots UK. “We have seen an increase in people presenting with infected insect bites since April.”“It is a bit of a shock when you are stung by a wasp,” says Ian Budd, an independent prescribing pharmacist forChemist4U. “It is painful and, if you’re unlucky, it can trigger an allergic reaction. Hornets and bees are less aggressive. Horsefly bites can cause inflammation and sometimes infection, because it is difficult to stop scratching them. Then there are midges, and we do have mosquitoes in the UK, not the kind that carry malaria but they can still cause issues. And we have ticks, in grassy and wooded areas, some of which carry Lyme disease.”It is important to be more vigilant when you are in certain environments, saysVirginia Chachati, a registered UK pharmacist and public health content creator. “Midges and mosquitoes tend to be in forests and long grasses,” she says, so you need to watch out if you are camping or hiking. Some bugs are drawn to other animals, she adds: “If you’re visiting farm animals and want to pet them, just be aware that they may be carrying ticks.”Midges and mosquitoes can also be found anywhere there is still water, adds Chachati. “Wherever there’s water, even a puddle that sits for a long time, bugs can lay eggs and then multiply very quickly – in a few hours or days. So make sure you don’t have still water around. Drain paddling pools after use. If the bugs are hungry, they will come and bite you.”Nevinson says you should take particular precautions if you’re out in the morning or as the sun goes down. “That is when the mosquitoes and midges will be at their worst.”Cover up with light, loose clothingView image in fullscreenOuch! If insects are hungry, they’re more likely to bite you.Photograph: PKpix/Getty Images“Make sure you wear long sleeves and long trousers, particularly if you’re camping or outdoors a lot,” says Nevinson. Anything not covered could be open to attack. Budd says: “It is quite common to get bitten around the ankles and wrists – anywhere exposed is at risk.” Chachati advises wearing light colours. “Some bugs, especially hornets, can be really attracted to darker colours because they’re trying to hide from predators,” she says. “If you’re walking through long grass and you are wearing white trousers, it is also much easier to see if ticks have latched on to your trousers, and then you can easily pick them off. Definitely wear a hat as well, because some people get bites on their scalp, especially if they don’t have hair.” Keep colours neutral, as “yellow and bright colours can attract wasps”, she says.Don’t irritate wasps“Sadly, it is just being in the wrong place at the wrong time with a wasp,” says Nevinson. “Wasps will be particularly attracted if you’re having a picnic. If there is food around, the wasps will hover around it.”“If you’re waving your hands around,” says Chachati, “those air currents are going to really bother them and knock them out of the air, and they don’t want to be knocked, so they’re going to do whatever they can to defend themselves. Staying really still is a good idea.” This is easier said than done: “If they land on you, you could use a piece of paper to gently slide under it, and put a see-through cup on top. Then take it away and release it.”Wear repellantChachati has worked in travel clinics: “Deet would be the number one thing I recommend, including for children. Use the highest percentage that you can tolerate without it irritating the skin.” In some places, “if you get bitten, you can get diseases like malaria, dengue fever, Zika and tick-borne encephalitis. If you can’t use Deet, there are other repellants such as icaridin andIR3535.”“Deet is a really effective insect repellant,” says Budd. “But there are questions about whether it is environmentally responsible for it to be used in large quantities. There are alternatives, like some citronella-based insect repellants, which are kinder to the environment. If you are still getting bitten with those, maybe move to the chemical ones.”View image in fullscreenYellow and bright colours can attract wasps.Photograph: Leonid Eremeychuk/Getty Images/iStockphoto“Always put on your sunscreen, then put your insect repellant on top,” says Chachati. “When they land on you, they will be repelled by the insect repellant, because that is the outermost layer you’ve applied on your skin. Deet can lower the sun protection factor of the sunscreen, so you will need to reapply it more often.” It can also transfer ink to your skin, so be careful when handling printed matter while wearing it, says Chachati.Go fragrance-free“It is a myth that only dirty people get bitten,” says Budd. “Bugs are drawn to scents, not bad hygiene.”“Don’t wear perfumes, deodorants or moisturisers that are heavily scented,” says Chachati. “These can attract bugs to you, because you smell like flowers.”Possibly avoid alcohol“There was a very smallstudy in 2002where they tested whether or not drinking beer would make mosquitoes more likely to bite you,” says Chachati. “Out of 13 people, the majority of them did get bites from mosquitoes [after beer ingestion compared with before ingestion]. So avoid drinking beer at barbecues,” which can be challenging, she concedes.Budd says it is also a myth that drinking gin and tonic is helpful: “Originally, in countries where there was malaria, people would have loads of tonic water because they believed the quinine in the tonic protected them – you’d have to drink a lot of tonic water for it to be effective.”Clean bites and stings before treatingIf you do get a bite or sting, “it is always best to wash the skin with soap and water to try to avoid any bacteria getting inside the wound,” says Chachati. “If you don’t have access to soap and water, you can use antiseptic wipes or cream.”“In the main, if you just have a simple bite or a sting, it will sort itself out,” says Nevinson. “If there is swelling, cold compresses are really good. If it’s on a limb, keep it raised to prevent that swelling getting any worse.”“Hydrocortisone cream is really good for inflammation,” says Budd. If you want to try something more natural, lavender or tea-tree oil “may deter the insects, but they’re also natural antiseptics once you’ve been bitten. Aloe vera is cooling and anti-inflammatory.”Don’t scratch“Antihistamine creams or tablets can really help with the itching, because scratching that itch makes it worse,” says Budd. “It increases the inflammation and your risk of infection. When you’re scratching the skin, you are interfering with the natural skin barrier, and you can be introducing bacteria into the inflamed area by taking away all the top layers of cells.”View image in fullscreenIf a tick bites you, remove it very carefully …Photograph: KPixMining/AlamyRemove stings and ticks carefully“When a tick bites, the whole animal is attached to you,” says Budd. “Use fine-tip tweezers, grab it really close to the skin, and pull upwards slowly with a steady and even force. Clean the area afterwards with soap and water.”Nevinson says: “If a red ring appears around the bite, that is an indication that it could be Lyme disease, and it’s really important you seek medical help. As long as it is treated quickly, it can be easily dealt with.” Chachati recommends keeping the tick to be tested.Bugs are attracted to body heat and sweat. If your skin is warmer, you are more likely to attract them“Don’t use tweezers for a bee sting,” says Budd, “because you can push more venom into your skin. Scrape it sideways,either with your [clean] fingernail or a bank card. When you get stung by a bee, the sting continues to pump venom, even when the bee is gone. So you definitely need to remove that. Wasps and hornets do not leave a stinger in the skin after they have stung you, they have retractable stingers.”Take antimalarials“Malaria can kill you,” says Chachati.Mosquitoes kill more people than any other creature in the worldbecause of the various diseases they carry and it is essential to take antimalarials if you are going to a region where malaria is carried by mosquitoes. “Look at a malaria map or theFit for Travelwebsite and always speak to a professional about which antimalarials to take.”Know when to seek medical help“Your individual reaction to proteins in the saliva of the bug that has bitten you or the venom from a sting can cause an allergic reaction,” says Budd, “from mild swelling to severe anaphylaxis, where it starts affecting your breathing and your tongue is swelling. This is usually picked up early on in life and you will need to carry an EpiPen. For a mild allergic reaction, an antihistamine or hydrocortisone cream should help. If you are experiencing difficulty breathing, dizziness or swelling of the face, seek emergency help.”Also see a doctor if, “​​a couple of days after being bitten or stung, you notice that there is pus, a hot, swollen red area around the bite that is noticeably spreading, or if you develop a fever, as these can be signs of infection,” says Budd.Disturb the airflow“Keep the air conditioning or ceiling fan on,” says Chachati, “because thatdisturbs the airflow, so it stops mosquitoes from being able to land. It also makes the room cool, which they dislike, and disperses carbon dioxide, making it difficult for mosquitoes to detect humans.” Keep windows closed for this to be effective, she says, “and definitely use a mosquito net over your bed and windows”.Is your home a health hazard? 15 surprisingly filthy everyday items, from taps to toothbrushesRead moreTake a shower“Bugs are attracted to body heat and sweat,” says Budd. “If your skin is warmer, you are more likely to attract bugs. If you have been exercising, there might be more lactic acid in your sweat, and insects are attracted to that, too.”Some people are just more delicious than others“There is no specific reason why one person gets bitten more than another,” says Nevinson, “but you often hear people talking about being prone to bites. It is likely to be to do with the skin type and the scent on the skin, which could be a result of a number of different things, diet or hormone-related.”Budd explains: “Everyone has their own unique skin microbiome and it can make you either less or more attractive to biting insects. Your genetics can influence this. For some reason, people withblood type Omay attract more mosquitoes.” He adds: “Being pregnant could make you more attractive to biting insects because your skin temperature can be warmer.”Chachati says: “It depends on your immune system and how you react to bites. Some people might be more sensitive compared with others. Mosquito bites may be worse in certain parts of the world that you are not used to being in, depending on how your immune system reacts. The first few bites may be quite a difficult experience to go through and then, if you get bitten again later in the holiday, it may not be as bad because your body knows how to handle it better.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsHealth & wellbeingHealthInsectsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m often asked what the next big thing is in wine. How am I supposed to know? After all, the joy of “the next big thing” is that it seemingly pops up as if from nowhere, and then it’s suddenly absolutelyeverywhere. Whether or not it then sticks around is anyone’s guess, though.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For instance, last year, I came across a fluted bottle cut into a fish-scale pattern at an Aldi tasting. I’m always a bit cynical when it comes to custom-made glass bottles, especially when they’re heavier than a regular one and ergo worse for the environment. Why not put that extra expense into the quality of the wine itself? Anyway, there was an orange on the label, while the liquid inside was blushing through the glass. The label read “Rosorange”, or a blend of rosé and orange wine, which Aldi claimed was a supermarket first. The bottle, as far as the supermarket was concerned, had done its job, because I was lured in and poured myself a slug.It wasn’t long before I started seeing the stuff everywhere. Wine communicators who are way more proficient (and, let’s be honest, better) than me were suddenly reviewing rosorange wines left, right and centre. Lucy Hitchcock, whosePartner in Wine TikToksfrequently help sell out supermarket ranges, posted her own review of Aldi’s rosorange, which at time of writing has had an incredible 292,000 views.And it’s not hard to see why: the proposition is intriguing (and the bottle is beautiful). Waitrose has since followed suit by stocking a rosorange of its own, while the other supermarkets doubtlessly have plans to do the same. But why now? Are the big brands trying to attract more orange wine drinkers to rosé, or more rosé drinkers to skin contact?True, the general winemaking process is not all that dissimilar: an orange wine is the product of extended skin contact in a white wine, and the same is true of rosé, only with red grapes. But the received and expected styles couldn’t be more different. Supermarket rosé drinkers are likely to be after something bone-dry, classic and quality-controlled for casual enjoyment and celebration – no alarms and no surprises. But I get the feeling that the typical orange wine drinker is looking for something a little different: the rise of orange wine, after all, has been synonymous with an exploration of alternative styles, low-intervention winemaking and a love for funkier wines.So it’s intriguing to see a wine hybrid trying to reconcile these two, arguably very different wine styles and the customers they want to attract. I can’t see lovers of low-intervention styles using this as a way to enjoy mass-market rosé, so perhaps it’s an attempt to introduce the orange wine style to a broader audience (although part of orange wine’s charm has always been in its anti-mainstream quality). The rosorange cuvée is now in its second year at Aldi, but only time will tell if this trend is here to stay.Four rosorange wines to start you offChassaux et Fils Rosorange£9.99 Aldi, 13%.

The reason for this puffing is the contrast between the rapidly drying surface of the dough and the evaporating water within the dough. The water turns into steam, causing the centre to balloon and the two layers to separate, creating a pocket and making the whole thing look a bit like an inflated whoopee cushion.In order to make pane carasau, which in Sardinia is a domestic, artisan and industrial art, the puffed-up dough is swiftly separated into two thin discs with a sharp knife, then the discs are returned – possibly folded in half or quarters – to the oven to dry and toast for a second time according to the maker’s taste. Fortunately for us, there are hundreds of makers and the whole point of pane carasau, also known ascarta di musica(music paper bread), is that it is brilliantly transportable and enduring: it lasts and lasts, which is why it’s one of my favourite things to have in the cupboard.Pane carasau can be eaten in various ways: its crisp, brittle, cracker-like nature makes it a natural partner for cheese (and honey) and soft toppings; it can also be eaten like bread and filled, dipped or broken into soup or stews, or used as part of a salad; or quickly immersed in cold water (or passed under a running tap), which restores moisture, making the discs pliable enough to fold or roll around. Pane carasau can also be used in the same way as sheets of pasta to make – and I am inspired by the magazineLa Cucina Italianahere – all sorts of lasagne. I have chosen to make one with a tomato sauce using both fresh and tinned tomatoes, mozzarella (it needs to be well drained) and parmesan. Opinions vary as to whether it is better to use dry or slightly damp pane carasau, but I have come to the conclusion that a mix is best: three dry layers then a final damp layer, which ensures that the top doesn’t dry out too rapidly before the cheese melts, and a golden crust forms.As with a classic lasagne, rest for 20 minutes or so after baking, so the flavours settle and the lasagne firms up. The great thing about pane carasau is that it is sturdy enough to maintain form, but pliable enough to be cut, and has a lightness usually found only in expertly hand-rolled sheets of fresh egg pasta. Serve cut into squares with a green salad and a glass of Sardinian red wine, such asBovale SardoorCannonau.Lasagne with Sardinian pane carasauServes4500g ripe tomatoes5 tbsp olive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and gently crushed so broken but still intact400g tin whole plum tomatoes in juice1 small red chilli(fresh or dried), whole or chopped if you want more heatSalt8basil leaves180g pane carasau– look for it in Italian delis400g mozzarella, drained and diced80g parmesanPeel the fresh tomatoes by covering them with boiling water for two minutes, draining, then cooling under cold water, at which point the skins should pull away easily. Chop the tomatoes roughly, discarding any tough bits.Put the olive oil and garlic in a heavy-based pan, then put the pan on a low flame and warm until the garlic gently sizzles – be careful not to burn it. Add both the fresh and tinned tomatoes, bring to a lively simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Add the red chilli and a good pinch of salt, then turn down the heat and simmer gently for 45 minutes, using the back of a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes; add the basil for the last 10 minutes. The sauce should be rich, thick and shiny, with the oil forming a ring at the edges.Assemble the lasagne in a 20cm x 26cm baking dish: start with a layer of sauce, cover with a layer of pane carasau – this can be quite patchwork and informal, with bits overlapping – then make another layer of sauce, diced mozzarella and grated cheese. Continue with another three layers, wetting the final layer of pane carasau very briefly under running water and finishing with a smear of sauce and thin layer of grated cheeses. Bake at 175C (165C fan)/gas 3½ for 20 minutes, until golden.The subheading of this article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version said the flatbreads were layered with tomato and lasagne; however, this should have said tomato and cheese.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodBreadMain courseTomatoesCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

As well aseight royal parksand vast areas of greenery such as Hampstead Heath, the city has numerous hidden havens. One of them is the tiny Onion Garden near Victoria Station and St James’s Park. According to thetour guide Jack Chesher, it was a “derelict concrete corner” until late 2021, when it began to be transformed into the “hanging gardens of Westminster”. The pocket park now has more than 200 species of plant – including a fair few onions – and displays artworks such as mosaic wall art and sculptures.

In the 18th century, it was the garden of the farm where the architect Carl Hårleman lived – two of the pear trees are thought to date from this period. Another architect, Willhelm Klemming, bought the property in 1901, renovated the garden and built the Centralbadets in 1904 – still an affordable day spa today.

Rest takes many forms and parents should consider building all of them into their livesSophie Walker and Jodi WilsonThu 31 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTShareWe live in a society that champions individualism, productivity and professional and financial success. At every turn we’re encouraged to do it all, which can make us worry that if we’re not being productive, what is our purpose?Across two years of research, including interviews with more than 60 perinatal health specialists and hundreds of mothers on the Australian Birth Stories podcast, we learned that most mothers enter postpartum withunrealistic expectationsof themselves and their bodies. Some are left feeling purposeless and questioning their worth when the work of caring for a baby doesn’t fit with the narrative ofa results-driven society.New mothers don’t need to be bombarded with unsolicited advice – they need reassurance | Jodi WilsonRead moreAnd so it’s helpful to flip the narrative and consider rest as the most productive thing you can do after birth. While pregnancy is the most ordinary of experiences, it is also absolutely extraordinary; it’s the longest, highest-energy expenditure task the human body performs.After that you deserve rest, you need rest and it’s important to remember that your body heals when it’s resting. In fact, making a full recovery from childbirth is dependent on rest. When you care for yourself in postpartum, you lay the foundation for your long-term health and wellbeing.When it comes to postpartum, especially if you’ve got older children, rest is only made possible through intention, preparation and support. There’s a lot of privilege associated with the opportunity to rest – access to a support network or the funds to pay for one – but it also requires you to value it and prioritise it. Understanding that there are different ways to rest, even when sleep is not something you can count on, can make that easier.View image in fullscreenChoose to spend time with people who support you.Photograph: SDI Productions/Getty Images1. Social restThis doesn’t mean cancelling all plans but rather considering how you feel in social situations and being aware of the effect people have on you. Social rest is choosing to spend time with people who support your intentions and bolster your energy, who fill your soul and make you feel good.Ultimately, you want your social interactions to be positive and meaningful rather than draining and obligatory. This is particularly pertinent in early postpartum when unwanted guests can become a hindrance, tiring you and your baby by overstaying their welcome, which will make you feel depleted and exhausted at an already overwhelming time.View image in fullscreenGive your brain space to process what you’re learning.Photograph: Anastasiia Stiahailo/Getty Images2. Mental restThe immediate period after birth is a mentally demanding phase of rapid learning. This focus and subsequent exhaustion is exacerbated by birth recovery, fogginess (often referred to as“baby brain”), sleep deprivation and learning to breastfeed (if you do so). It’s imperative to give your brain space to process what you’re learning so the lessons have time to sink in. To create this space be mindful of what else you’re consuming, especially advice from social media, as information overload can make it hard to be discerning.If you feel as though there are too many thoughts, ideas and questions in your head, write them down in a dot-point list: it helps you to find clarity and empties your head of distractions.3. Sensory restBecause you’re in a physiologically vulnerable and sensitive state, you want to be gentle with your whole self. Any stress, anxiety or concerns will rattle you more than they usually do. Calming music, warm baths, hot tea, cosy clothes and minimal screen time will help you stay grounded. Think of your postpartum bedroom and house as a cocoon; prepare it while you’re pregnant and you’ll really benefit from its comfort.Why does postnatal care only last a few weeks? New data shows it should be years | Devi SridharRead moreYou’ll also benefit from time alone where no one is touching you. Being “touched out” is a common experience in early motherhood and is particularly relevant if you have older children who can, understandably, need extra touch and reassurance. This may quickly feel sensorially overwhelming, so prioritising breaks – in the shower or bath, in your bedroom with the door closed – goes a long way to creating the physical space you need to feel settled.4. Physical restBeyond the passive physical rest of sleep, active rest such as lying horizontally as much as possible in the first few weeks after birth is a big step towards recovery. This allows your pelvic floor to heal from pregnancy and birth, which is important for your long-term health.Active rest also involves releasing obvious tension in your body. Moving your hips and legs in a way that feels good – yoga, massage – is recommended in postpartum to improve circulation. Likewise, performing gentle stretches of your upper body, neck and shoulders will release the tension you may experience while learning to breastfeed.If you’re breastfeeding, it can be really helpful to feed while lying on your side; this prevents your upper body from getting tense and won’t place unnecessary pressure on your pelvic floor and perineum. But if you’ve had a caesarean birth, lying on your side to feed can be painful for the first few weeks, so you may be more comfortable in a supported seated position.View image in fullscreenProcessing your thoughts with empathetic listeners is important.Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty Images5. Emotional restTalking to your partner, birth support person or doula/midwife is important. We often have a lot to unpack after birth and it’s common to want to share how you felt in labour, the highs and lows of the experience, and how you feel now. This is really healthy: you’re letting go of your thoughts, processing them with empathetic listeners and considering how they make you feel. Emotional rest is the calm you feel when you can share your experience in an honest and authentic way.This is an edited extract fromThe Complete Guide to Postpartum(Murdoch Books; $39.99)Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyAustralian lifestylePregnancyBreastfeedingSleepHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He insisted that “he still can’t find a better option” and said it was in line with the guidance from medical experts at the time.The policy was blamed for causing outbreaks of Covid in care homes, with one civil servant saying the 46,000 deaths in the sector were a “generational slaughter”.Hancock placed the blame firmly on Public Health England, saying its recommendations had not kept up with the reality of the unfolding situation. “I got so frustrated with PHE I abolished them,” he said. “There wasn’t enough testing, there wasn’t enough PPE. The public health authorities had the wrong attitude and the wrong doctrine. All of these things needed fixing and one by one we did everything we could to fix them.”Helen Whately, the care minister at the time, said hospital patients being discharged into care homes “shouldn’t have happened” and care homes should not have been expected to “serve the NHS in this”.Care home staff were 'terrified' by the lack of testing and distress of residentsThe inquiry heard that many care homes experienced “clinical abandonment” during the pandemic.In some of the most distressing evidence heard by the inquiry, a care home owner and manager from Wrexham described the unfolding chaos and how staff struggled to provide care without adequate PPE and testing.Helen Louise Hough claimed she was told that her residents “would not be considered for ventilation” if they became seriously ill with Covid and she could not get her local GP to attend in person to provide care.In one particularly harrowing incident, she said the home’s first resident to die with Covid was left gasping for breath and begging for help in her final hours after Hough had been denied a prescription for oxygen. Her husband, Vernon, witnessed the resident’s distress and later took his own life as the toll of the pandemic wore on.Many staff members worked long hours and stayed in an attic and in a caravan on site to reduce the risk of bringing the disease into the home. But with testing unavailable in the early weeks there was no way of telling who had Covid.Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: “Being in a care home turned out to be almost the worst place you could be during a pandemic.”Blanket policies banning visits led to rapid declines in physical and mental healthMembers of bereaved groups spoke powerfully about the impact of being unable to visit their relatives for months at a time, in many cases missing out on seeing them in the last weeks of their lives.Jane Weir-Wierzbowska, of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said her mother, who had dementia, deteriorated rapidly when her visits stopped. She could only look on from outside the room – talking through a mobile phone wrapped in a bin bag and placed on her mother’s shoulder – as her mother neared the end of her life. “I just felt like I’d let her down so badly and that guilt is with me always,” she said.The inquiry heard that dementia patients suffered the most from the ban on visits and there was a disproportionate amount of excess deaths in this group. People with dementia accounted for a quarter of all Covid-related deaths in England and Wales.Residents also described the distress caused by long periods stuck in isolation to try to stop the spread of Covid. One woman said she was placed in solitary for 65 days and felt like “a caged animal”.Joanna Killian, the chief executive of the Local Government Association, said the trauma of separation was “inhumane and can’t happen again”.Rolling back of legislation meant individual rights 'were sidelined'Laws such as the Care Act 2014 and the Equality Act 2010 were eased during the pandemic to help the care system manage the pressure of the pandemic.But Helen Wildbore, the director of Care Rights UK, said this meant that “people’s rights became negotiable and sidelined” and individual needs were neglected.She said the pausing of routine inspections removed vital impartial oversight of care, and enforced supervision during visits meant it was harder for people to report abuse or neglect.Disability rights groups said “no government should have legislated to allow local authorities to cease meeting pre-existing eligible needs” and that disabled people felt their lives were less valued.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquirySocial careCare workersHealthNHSMatt HancockHealth policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

The radioactive isotopes even at low levels can be recognised by radiation detectors at airports and borders, leading to the arrest of poachers and traffickers.Researchers at Witwatersrand’s Radiation and Health Physics Unit said tests conducted in the pilot study confirmed that the radioactive material was not harmful to the rhinos.“We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project.Dehorning rhinos reduces poaching by 80%, study findsRead more“Even a single horn with significantly lower levels of radioactivity than what will be used in practice successfully triggered alarms in radiation detectors,” said Larkin.The tests also found that horns could be detected inside full 40-foot shipping containers, he said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population was about 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to approximately 27,000 because of demand for rhino horns on the hidden market.South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but has high levels of poaching and about 500 rhinos are killed for their horns every year.The university has urged private wildlife park owners and national conservation authorities to have their rhinos injected.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesAfricaConservationAnimalsWildlifeSouth AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They are mostly long-acting contraceptives such as IUDs and birth control implants, which had been bought under public health programmes run by theUS Agency for International Developmentand were probably intended for women in Africa.A US state department spokesperson told Agence France-Presse this week that “a preliminary decision was made to destroy” certain birth control products from “terminated Biden-era USAID contracts”.Trump’s administrationdismantled USAID, the country’s foreign aid armbody, in January.The spokesperson said the destruction would cost $167,000 and “no HIV medications or condoms are being destroyed”.The contraceptives, stored in a warehouse in Geel inBelgium, were reportedly planned to be incinerated in France, although there has been no confirmation of this by France. France and Belgium are under pressure to prevent any destruction.The French health ministry said in a statement: “We are following this situation closely and we support the will of the Belgian authorities to find a solution to avoid the destruction of contraceptives.“The defence of sexual health and reproductive rights is a foreign policy priority for France.”This week a collective of rights groups, feminists organisations and trade unions in France launched a petition to stop the destruction of the contraceptives. “We won’t allow this unfair and sexist decision to go ahead, it’s both an economic and human waste,” they said.The French Green leader, Marine Tondelier, signed an open letter calling on the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to intervene to stop the contraceptives from being destroyed. “Our country cannot be complicit, even indirectly, in retrograde policies,” the letter said.Céline Thiébault-Martinez, a Socialist lawmaker, told France Inter radio on Thursday that if France failed to speak out on the destruction of these contraceptives it would “lose credibility with women”.Sarah Durocher, the head of a French family planning group, said: “France has a moral responsibility to act.”Charles Dallara, whose politician grandfather Lucien Neuwirth backed the French law authorising oral contraceptives in 1967, wrote an open letter to Macron in which he urged the president not to “let France become complicit in this scandal”.The Belgian government said it was in urgent contact with the US but it could not say yet whether the contraceptives had already been moved to France.A spokesperson for the foreign affairs department said it contacted the US embassy in Brussels as soon as it became aware of the possible destruction of contraception stocks held in the Geel warehouse. “Foreign affairs is exploring all possible avenues to prevent the destruction of these stocks, including their temporary relocation,” they added.“We do not currently have additional details that would confirm whether a transfer of these products to France has taken place.”The international organisation MSI Reproductive Choices said it had offered to “purchase, repackage, and manage logistics at our expense, ensuring the products reach those in need”, but the offer was rejected.The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) made a similar offer at “no cost to the US government” that was also turned down, AFP reported.Explore more on these topicsFranceContraception and family planningTrump administrationUSAIDBelgiumEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It reviewed medical records of more than 500 patients, surveys of 600 health workers, and in-depth interviews with doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and community leaders.The authors outline evidence of systematic attacks designed to destroy the fertility of Tigrayan women and call for international bodies to investigate the crime of genocide.Quick GuideWhat was the conflict in Tigray, who was fighting, and why?ShowWhere is Tigray?Tigray is the most northern of Ethiopia's 11 regional states, lying along the southern border of Eritrea with Sudan to the west.How did the war start?Years of tensions erupted into war in November 2020. Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who had inflamed hostilities by delaying federal elections, alleged that Tigray's ruling party had attacked a military camp in the state capital, Mekelle. He sent in troops to oust the state government and ordered a communications blackout.Who is involved?The invasion became a joint effort between three parties: Ethiopia, Eritrea, and  regional forces from Tigray's neighbouring state of Amhara. Ethiopia's prime minister denied the presence of Eritrean troops in Tigray for months, despite it becoming clear he had formed an alliance with the country's former enemy to mobilise both nations' armies. Amhara  has long-standing territorial disputes with Tigray and its own tensions with the federal government – they, too, sent troops. On the other side, the ruling party in Tigray's regional government, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), founded and mobilised its own army when the war began, the Tigray Defence Forces, and was joined by militias from the ethnically marginalised Oromo people.Why are they fighting?Each party has a complex history of disputes. Ethiopia has a federal system, and historically its states have maintained a high level of  autonomy. Tigray's ruling party, the TPLF, had been a dominant force in national politics, and led the coalition which ruled Ethiopia for three decades until 2018. The group lost much of its power when Abiy Ahmed was elected prime minister in April 2018, and a political rift began to grow between the TPLF and Abiy's administration. Eritrea and Amhara both have long-standing territorial disputes with Tigray. Eritrea brought violence along Tigray's border during the two decades of the  Ethiopia-Eritrea war, a conflict which saw Abiy awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ending in 2019.What happened during the conflict?The war resulted in massive civilian casualties, with atrocities and crimes against humanity committed by all parties. As troops moved into Tigray, Ethiopia  blockaded the region, preventing journalists, UN agencies and aid from entering and limiting information getting out. Tigray quickly descended into an acute hunger crisis. By the time the ceasefire was signed in November 2022,academics estimatedthat between 300,000 and 800,000 people had died from violence or starvation as a result of the blockade. The capital Mekelle was decimated. Rates of sexual violence were extreme:surveys indicatethat around 10% of Tigrayan women were raped during the conflict.Is the conflict over?The war formally ended in 2022, but violence in the region has continued and is reported to be again escalating. By mid-2025 Eritrean troops were still occupying  chunks of Tigray,according to the UN, and continue to be accused of mass rape, arbitrary detention and looting. Large-scale sexual violence by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces in the region continues: NGOs havedocumented hundreds of casesof rape since hostilities ended, and concluded that \"the scale and nature of these violations has not materially changed\". Now, there are fears the region coulddescend intowar again, after fresh conflicts erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and between Ethiopia's federal government and Amhara state.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The attacks described by healthcare workers are extreme in their brutality, often leaving survivors with severe, long-term injuries.“Having worked on gender-based violence for two decades … this is not something I have ever seen in other conflicts,” said Payal Shah, a human rights lawyer and co-author of the report. “It is a really horrific and extreme form of sexual violence, and one that deserves the world’s attention.”View image in fullscreenA rape survivor (left) is helped by an assistant at a safe house in Mekelle, February 2021. She has difficulties walking after being attacked by Eritrean soldiers.Photograph: Eduardo Soteras/AFP/Getty ImagesSurvivors treated by health professionals ranged from infants to elderly people. The youngest was less than a year old. More than 20% of health workers said those they treated for sexual violence included very young children (1-12 years); and 63% treated children under the age of 17.Dr Abraha Gebreegziabher, chief clinical director of Ayder hospital in Tigray, told the Guardian his hospital treated thousands of rape survivors, at times admitting more than 100 a week.“Some [trends] stand out during the war,” he said. “One is gang raping. Second is the insertion of foreign bodies, including messages and broken rocks or stones … Then, the intentional spread of infection, HIV particularly,” he said. “I am convinced, and see strong evidence, that rape was used as a weapon of war.”In June,the Guardian revealeda pattern of extreme sexual violence where soldiers forced foreign objects – including metal screws, stones and other debris – into women’s reproductive organs. In at least two cases, the soldiers inserted plastic-wrapped letters detailing their intent to destroy Tigrayan women’s ability to give birth.View image in fullscreenIn attacks designed to destroy fertility, foreign objects such as these nail clippers were inserted into women’s wombs, usually after rape.Photograph: Ximena BorrazasThe new research included interviews with a number of healthcare workers who independently reported treating victims of this kind of attack.Many of the survivors said soldiers expressed their desire to exterminate the Tigrayan ethnicity – either by destroying Tigrayan women’s reproductive organs, or forcing them to give birth to children of the rapist’s ethnicity.One psychologist who treated a teenage girl said: “Her arm was broken and became paralysed when the perpetrators tried to remove the Norplant contraceptive method inserted in her upper arm, and this was aimed to force pregnancy from the perpetrator. [They said]: ‘You will give birth from us, then the Tigrayan ethnic[ity] will be wiped out eventually.’”Other women were held at military camps, some for months or years, and gave birth to the children of their assailants while in captivity.Legal analysis of the medical record data and health worker testimony found conclusive evidence of crimes against humanity, including mass rape, forced pregnancy, and enforced sterilisation, Shah said.Women were frequently assaulted in public, by multiple attackers, and in front of family. The attacks included significant breaches of taboo in Tigray, including anal rape and attacks on menstruating women. The resulting stigma meant that some survivors were divorced by their husbands, rejected by families, or socially excluded.“This form of violence is being imparted in a way that is intended to cause trauma, humiliation, suffering and fracture and break communities,” Shah said. “This is going to have generational impacts.”View image in fullscreenMost survivors of sexual violence during Tigray’s war have not received any medical or psychological assistance due to a lack of facilities.Photograph: Nariman El-Mofty/APMany survivors are still living in displaced persons’ camps. A number of clinics providing for survivors have shut due to the closure of USAID.“The very fabric of these women’s personalities and sense of self has been shattered,” one psychiatrist said.A significant portion of health workers had treated children. Many were too young to understand what had happened, one nurse said: “Most of them don’t know what rape is. They do not know what the consequence is.”For girls who became pregnant, some as young as 12, the health risks were significant. “Their bodies are not fully developed to handle the demands of pregnancy,” a reproductive health coordinator working with child survivors said.Ayder hospital treated a number of children, Abraha said, many of whom developed long-term conditions, including fistula.As well as direct victims of sexual attacks, health professionals described treating children who had experienced “forced witnessing”, where they were made to watch parents and siblings being raped or killed, causing severe psychological trauma.View image in fullscreenThen-13-year-old Esther shows her scar.

One surgical worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian that the youngest patient he had treated for sexual attacks was three years old.“It is very difficult to think of the worst [cases],” he said. At Ayder hospital, Abraha said medical staff experienced acute psychological distress and nightmares as a result of what they had witnessed.Rusted screws, metal spikes and plastic rubbish: the horrific sexual violence used against Tigray’s womenRead more“We hope that many people will hear [about this] across the surface of the Earth. If justice can be served, maybe consolation will follow.”The report covered the conflict and post-conflict period to 2024, and concluded that weaponised sexual violence has continued since the ceasefire, and expanded to new regions.“The perpetrators must be punished, and the situation must be resolved,” one health worker said. “True healing requires justice.”Anbassa*, a human rights worker in Ethiopia who helped conduct the surveys, said: “No one is accountable.” The failure to hold perpetrators to account meant human rights abuses continued, he said, with atrocities now being committed in the nearby regions of Amhara and Afar.“If this conflict continues, this impunity that happened in Tigray, the aftermath of this one will continue, [and] conflicts are going to erupt to other regions.”*Name changedIn the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.

They entered the geopolitical spotlight on 20 January when Trump used his inauguration speech to vow he would “take back” the canal from supposed Chinese influence. The very same day, Anel Flores, the comptroller general, announced he would begin an audit of the ports’ owner, Panama Ports Company, in which CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake.In March, BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, announced it was working with MSC to acquire Panama Ports Company and 41 other ports in CK Hutchison’s global portfolio.The parties to the deal agreed a deadline of 27 July to finalize details of the acquisition.But the sale of these strategic assets did not go down well in Beijing. On 28 March China’s anti-trust regulator said it would review the deal “to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”.Earlier this month the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese government hadthreatened to block the dealunless Cosco, a local shipping giant, was included as a veto-holding member of the takeover consortium.On Wednesday, Flores said that Panama Ports’ contract was “unfair” and “abusive”. He claimed that the company had not paid sufficient royalties to the government and that its 25-year extension, signed in 2023, was made without the necessary authorizations. One case lodged with the supreme court seeks to nullify the contract, the other seeks to declare it unconstitutional.In response to media speculation that Cosco would be included in the deal he said: “It doesn’t seem correct that in other [parts of the world] there are people negotiating the future of assets that belong to us, the Panamanians.”Panama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, said on Thursday, that he supported Flores’s decision – which he claimed had nothing to do with the ongoing struggle over the ports’ ownership.However, the timing of the announcement is convenient for the US-backed consortium. Should the court cases prove successful, the contracts for port operations would have to be re-tendered and, with Panama having exited China’s Belt and Road Initiative in April, it would seem likely the successful bid will come from a US firm or an ally country.Nullifying the PPC contract and re-tendering the operation of the ports would allow Panama to potentially redesign the contract terms to be more beneficial to the state. However, the country could also find itself exposed to litigation from CK Hutchison which could potentially argue it is tantamount to a politically motivated expropriation.Explore more on these topicsPanama canalPanamaChinaAsia PacificAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the US president seems bent on undermining the region’s second largest democracy too.Since early July, Trump has launched an extraordinary attack on Brazil’s institutions, slapping 50% tariffs on imports from the South American country andsanctions on a supreme court judge– partly in retribution for what he called the political persecution of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a failed coup.“Rarely since the end of the cold war has the United States interfered so deeply with a Latin American country,” the Economistdeclaredlast week.“I feel for the Brazilians,” said Steven Levitsky, the Harvard University political scientist who co-wrote How Democracies Die, a bestselling book about democratic erosion.Trump accused of ‘attack on Brazilian democracy’ after sanctioning Bolsonaro trial judgeRead more“This is a very authoritarian political force that’s doing enormous damage to my country’s democratic institutions and rights – and I wish it would stop at that. It’s painful to see the [US] government do damage to other countries’ democratic institutions as well.”The US has an ignominious track record of interfering in Latin American affairs, through CIA-backed coups and military interventions. But Levitsky said he had never seen trade policy weaponized in such a way: “Brazilians have worked now for generations to build the strongest, most democratic system they’ve ever had … and this sort of reckless, casual assault on democratic institutions pains me.”Trump’s effort to help Bolsonaro dodge justice over hisalleged 2022 coup, by pressuring Brazil’s government and supreme court, has thrilled the ex-president’s supporters. They see Trump as Bolsonaro’s best chance of avoiding jail when the supreme court announces its verdict in the coming weeks.But Trump’s meddling has infuriated millions of Brazilians from across the political spectrum who are appalled at what they call an intolerable foreign ploy to subvert their democracy, 40 years after it was restored after two decades of dictatorship.“In the old days they’d send in the marines. Now they impose tariffs,” said Rubens Ricupero, a former finance minister and ambassador to Washington, who predicted that Trump’s behaviour would provoke a wave of anti-US nationalism.Marcelo Rubens Paiva, an author and pro-democracy campaigner whose father was murdered by Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship, called Trump’s “utterly unspeakable” interference the fruit of “a man who feels he is Napoleon and wants the entire world to kneel down before him”.Observers are split on what is driving Trump’s assault on Brazil’s institutions and democratically elected government, which the White House this weekdeclareda threat to “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States”.Some suspect he hopes to expand Latin America’s pro-Trump rightwing axis – currently led by Argentina’s Javier Milei and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele – by reviving Bolsonaro’s waning political career and, perhaps, returning the far-right populist to power in next year’s presidential election.Others see Trump’s pro-Bolsonaro pressure campaign as a smokescreen for his true objectives: furthering US economic interests and, in particular, those of tech giantsdesperate to avoid regulation in the world’s fifth-largest online market.Levitsky saw a simpler explanation. Trump’s offensive was the product of a president who acted like a “classic 20th-century tinpot dictator”, such as the Dominican Republic’s Rafael Trujillo or Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza.“Trump approaches governance in exactly the same way. The treasury was for them. Trade policy was for them. Foreign policy was for them. The army was their personal security. That’s how Trump looks at governance. He uses policy instruments for his own personal and political ends,” Levitsky said.“There’s no economic strategy here. Very clearly there’s no foreign policy strategy here. But Bolsonaro’s family has gotten into Trump’s inner circle and convinced him that Bolsonaro’s plight is similar to his plight in 2020 [after he lost the election to Joe Biden].“Trump believes – falsely – that he was subjected to a witch-hunt and he’s been convinced by Bolsonaro’s sons that Bolsonaro, like him, is also subject to a witch-hunt. And he’s usingUS foreign policy– tragically, pathetically – to pursue those personal whims,” Levitsky said.Experts doubt Trump will succeed. Bolsonaro,already bannedfrom seeking election until 2030, is expected to receive a hefty sentence when the coup trial concludes. Bolsonaro denies the charges but has admitted considering “alternative ways” to stop the winner of Brazil’s 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office.Paiva believed Trump wanted Bolsonaro to secure the same kind of impunity he enjoyed after trying to overturn the 2020 election result. But the ruse appeared to be backfiring.Early signs suggestPresident Lula has been energized by the tug-of-war with Trump while the Bolsonaro family, who many blame for convincing Trump to target Brazil’s economy and institutions, have suffered a public backlash. In a recent editorial, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper declared: “Bolsonaro’s name has already been inscribed in the pantheon of the greatest traitors this nation has ever seen.”“I think Bolsonaro has buried his political career,” Paiva said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaTrump tariffsUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

She also works with the Hong Kong Democracy Council, a Washington-based organisation dedicated to “raising international support for the advancement of its democracy and human rights”.Tony Chung, a democracy activist who was jailed under Hong Kong’s national security law butnow lives in the UK, was also the subject of near-identical letters requesting British citizens inform on him.While Hong Kong authorities have denied sending the letters, the UK foreign and home secretaries believe they are an example of “transnational repression” and have called on “Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to end the deliberate targeting of opposition voices”. On Friday, David Lammy and Yvette Cooper vowed to protect the “rights and freedoms” of exiled activists in the UK.View image in fullscreenThe Hong Kong activist Tony Chung was sentenced to 43 months in jail. He now lives in the UK.Photograph: Alex Hofford/EPABut Lau believes detailed instructions from Thames Valley police in March, days after the letters were discovered, only amplified foreign attempts to silence her.The bounty letter, which is cited in the memorandum of understanding, states that Lau is wanted due to the political content of her speeches and social media posts that have criticised Hong Kong authorities.Lau regularly gives speeches criticising the Chinese government’s targeting of dissidents, including at demonstrations in London.She said the force “essentially told me to self-censor”, adding she felt she had no option but to agree to the request when uniformed officers came to her house, but has not stopped campaigning.“It is alarming that, instead of safeguarding my right to speak and gather freely in the UK, the response shifts responsibility on to me to limit my basic freedoms in the face of China’s transnational repression,” Lau said.“In effect, this mirrors the very outcome the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are seeking: silencing dissent through fear and isolation. A truly democratic response should centre on protecting the rights of those targeted, not advising them to retreat from public life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a statement, the force said it was “alive to any attempts from across borders to target or threaten individuals who are in the UK and we continue to work extremely closely with our intelligence and security partners in the UK and abroad”.In Australia,letters targetingYam and another former Hong Kong politician, Ted Hui, are being investigated by the national counter foreign influence taskforce, led by the national domestic intelligence agency and police force.Hui said the memorandum of understanding was “deeply concerning” and “makes it sound as if Carmen is the troublemaker and that the responsibility for her rests solely on her own self-censorship”.On Saturday, Hong Kong’s national security police issued arrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, accusing them of breaching its national security law. The activists are also subject to bounties.Lammy and Cooper’s criticism of the warrants as “transnational repression” was dismissed by the Chinese embassy in the UK, which said the remarks constituted a “gross interference” in China’s internal affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It said it had more than 100,000 members and was “comprised entirely of Chinese men”.Men reportedly shared sexually explicit images of women either in intimate settings or with so-called “pinhole cameras” that can be hidden in everyday items such as plug sockets and shoes.The scandal has been compared to South Korea’s “Nth Room” case, in which women were blackmailed into sharing sexually explicit photographs of themselves with members of a Telegram group.Telegram is blocked inChinabut can be accessed by using a virtual private network, or VPN, which circumvents location controls.Hashtags related to the scandal clocked up more than 11m views on the social media platform Weibo by Thursday. But there are signs the online conversation is being censored, with some relevant searches returning the result: “According to the relevant laws and regulations, this content cannot be shown.” Reuters reported earlier in the week that associated hashtags had received more than 270m views.“A woman’s life is not a man’s erotic novel,” wrote one user on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like platform also known as RedNote.Another user on Xiaohongshu, an app predominantly used by women, wrote: “So scary! After seeing this, I’ve decided if the MaskPark incident isn’t properly addressed, I’ll never get married or have kids.”In the South Korean case, the mastermind of the chat group was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison.In China, the penalty for taking pictures of someone without their consent is up to 10 days’ detention and a 500 yuan (£53) fine. People who disseminate pornographic material can be sentenced to up to two years in prison.The MaskPark scandal is not the first time men have been discovered to be secretly filming women. Last year, the boss of a tech company in Beijing was found to have secretly recorded more than 10,000 videos of his female employees using the bathroom. He was detained for 10 days as a punishment. “Ten days is nothing short of encouragement,” one Weibo user wrote.Lao Dongyan, a criminal law professor at Tsinghua University, wrote on Weibo that Chinese law punished the dissemination of secretly – filmed material as an obscenity offence rather than a violation of women’s rights.“The women who were secretly filmed are the primary victims. Simply treating them as obscene materials is tantamount to treating them as the parties involved in pornographic works. This is absurd,” Lao wrote.Speaking out about feminism and women’s rights has become increasingly difficult in China as the government has cracked down on civil society and activism. But some women have found ways to address misogyny in public. One method is through comedy.On a recent episode of a popular standup comedy television show, The King of Standup Comedy, the comedian Huang Yijin joked that she wore make-up even when alone in hotel rooms: “Whenever I’m in a hotel, I just assume there are hidden cameras … There are about 2 million people in my room,” she said.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTelegramSexual consentPornographyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Nine are still missing, including four municipal government workers.A year’s worth of rain fell within seven days, turning cars upside down and flooding homes. More than 80,000 people have been relocated and more than 100 villages lost power. In total, more than 300,000 people have been affected.“There were gaps in our preparatory plans. Our knowledge of extreme weather was lacking. This tragic lesson has warned us that putting the people first, putting human life first, is more than a slogan,” Yu said, according to Agence France-Presse.Of the 44 confirmed fatalities, 31 happened at an elderly care home in Taishitun, a town in Miyun. A report published byCaixin, a Beijing-based business magazine, said the water in the nursing home was still knee-deep when journalists visited on Tuesday. The care home, where many residents had limited mobility, is near the banks of the Qingshui River, which overflowed during the deluge.Yu expressed “deep mourning” for the deaths.View image in fullscreenSoldiers carry relief supplies for villagers trapped after a road was damaged in the floods in Miyun.Photograph: Ju Huanzong/APHis comments are a rare admission of weaknesses in the authorities’ preparedness for extreme weather events, which are becoming more common. Beijing authorities said there was 67% more rainfall this year than in previous years.City officials said their disaster prevention plans had been imperfect and there were “shortcomings” in the infrastructure needed in the mountainous outlying districts of Beijing.Many flood victims interviewed by the Guardian said they did not receive advance warnings about the extreme weather.“The government was caught off-guard, they didn’t know in advance either,” said Li Qingfa, a 75-year-old Miyun resident. “We didn’t really receive any specific warning. We didn’t receive any training in confronting the disaster.”On Monday, before the scale of the destruction was apparent, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, said government departments should “make every effort to protect people’s lives and property”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaFloodingExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Yesterday one of themost powerful earthquakes ever recordedhit a sparsely populated region in far east Russia.It triggereda tsunamithat started crossing the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour. What followed was a race against time – early warning systems went into alert mode as waves fanned out towards the coastlines of Japan, Hawaii and the US west coast.The damage appears to have been minor so far and this is (in part) thanks to a global and highly successful disaster response effort. More than three million people were successfully warned to evacuate their homes.At the centre of this remarkable response was thePacific Tsunami Warning Centre(PTWC) based in Hawaii; founded in 1949, by the 1960s ​it was monitoring tsunamis across the entire ocean. A small team of experts identified the size and depth of the earthquake, and a tsunami warning was triggered straight away. The whole thing worked like clockwork – their speed and accuracy may have saved thousands of lives, withtemporary evacuees now allowed to return home.But this type of work could be under threat. The PTWC is part of a US government agency that has faced cuts from Trump’s government. To understand why the response was so effective, and why funding such warning systems is so valuable, I spoke toIlan Kelman,professor of disasters and health at University College London. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesTravel| The head of the UK’s air traffic control company isfacing calls to resignafter hundreds of flights were delayed when the system went down for about 20 minutes on Wednesday.Israel-Gaza war| A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas for more than 15 months has accused Keir Starmer of “moral failure” after he set the UK on course to recognise a Palestinian state.

The rupture happened along hundreds of kilometres of a fault line where the Pacific plate is sinking below the North American plate. This is one of the largest faults on earth (it’s called a megathrust fault) and parts of it are underwater, which means there is always a tsunami risk.The earthquake was 47 kilometres (30 miles) beneath sea level and sent shock waves at a range of 300 kilometres (200 miles).Tsunamistravel across the ocean at about 500mph, the speed of a jumbo jet, so some communities had a just few minutes warning, while those on the other side of the ocean had a few hours. Unlike in the movies, when it’s typically one massive wave, tsunamis are often several waves which will continue to travel around the world for days.What has the damage been and where?The epicentre was near the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000 people. Residents fled inland as ports flooded, while 200 miles north the Klyuchevskoy volcano (above) erupted, with lava descending its western slope.Maximum tsunami wave heights of 4 metres (13ft) were observed in Kamchatka. Some buildings on the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk in Russia were swept away, according to local officials. The Kremlin has said alert systems “worked well” in the earthquake response and there were “no casualties”.The tsunami prompted warnings and evacuations across the Pacific, including in Japan, US west coast, Hawaii, Canada, Chile, Ecuador and New Zealand. However, the height of the waves turned out to be lower than initially feared. In Hawaii the highest recorded waves reached1.8 metres(6ft), in California there were surges of just over a metre (3.6ft), and in Japan waves remained under half a metre.How good was the warning system?Local authorities were clear about how to evacuate and gave specific locations across more than a dozen nations.In Hawaii, for example, tsunami warning sirens blared. Evacuations were ordered for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned: “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.” People received alerts on their phones. All islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters opened, and people in coastal areas were told to go to higher ground.Similar warnings were issued elsewhere. InJapan, almost two million people had been ordered to higher ground. Local media reported one fatality of a woman killed while driving her car off a cliff as she tried to escape. In Chile, authorities conducted what the interior ministry said was “perhaps the most massive evacuation ever carried out in our country” involving 1.4 million.“It looks like it’s been very effective. People had that long-term education, and that long-term readiness to know what to do,” says Kelman, estimating that this preparedness saved thousands of lives. At this time of year there is a lot oftourist activity along many Pacific coastlines, and visitors are often unfamiliar with local warning systems or evacuation zones. This can make evacuations more challenging.“It appears from places where the tsunami wave has hit, numerous lives were saved by drawing on that past experience,” says Kelman, notably the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed more than 200,000 people. At the time there was no regional tsunami early warning system in place, and the Indian ocean was not considered a high-risk area. Some warnings were sent by fax and email, and didn’t reach people in time.The 2004 tsunami was also significantly more severe – some waves exceeded 30 metres in height, whereas so far waves from this latest tsunami appear to have reached a maximum of five metres in Russia, says Kelman.In most places waves were less than a metre high, and in many places impacts were negligible so the disaster that was anticipated didn’t arrive. This is another important factor in why damage has been limited.What improvements can be made?Several international centres send out automatic messages for earthquakes, depending on the location. TheIndian Ocean tsunami warning systemwas set up after 2004. “It was never done before then because it was always too expensive, there were always other priorities, but suddenly it became a priority … It has been tested several times with mixed results, so we have to improve it,” says Kelman. There is no effective equivalent for the Atlantic Ocean.The key one that identified this earthquake was the PTWC. “They were on it right away,” says Kelman. “Knowing the size of the earthquake and the depth of the earthquake and the type of the earthquake meant that there was a significant chance of a major tsunami. They issued tsunami warnings and got the messages out there, which were then disseminated by national governments and local authorities.”However, the PTWC sits within a US government agency targeted by Elon Musk-led cuts earlier this year. Kelman says this tsunami showed how needed they are. “We would hope that if the cuts did affect them, they will be reversed and that the people who have saved lives today will also get more support for appropriate resources,” he says.“It appears that they were nonetheless exceptionally effective, and we owe them so many thanks for issuing appropriate messages and saving many lives.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenChildren look at sandbags covering the windows at a preschool in Lviv, Ukraine.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThis devastating piecedetails the impact the Russia-Ukraine war has had onUkrainian children, with almost 3,000 injured or killed.AamnaEvery so often we get some sinister message from the deep.

Media reports said the record could be broken again on Thursday.The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to the meteorology office. “The warm air from the North Pacific High began affecting South Korea a bit earlier than usual,” Youn Ki-han, director of Seoul’s meteorology forecast division, told Agence France-Presse.Youn added: “Normally, if it’s hot for just a day, temperatures spike and then quickly return to normal. But when warm conditions persist for several days, the heat doesn’t fully dissipate, it lingers and accumulates with each day.”Amid stifling summers Japan warns of future restrictions on children’s sportRead moreJapanese weather officials said the temperature on Wednesday had risen to 41.2C in Tamba, in the western prefecture of Hyogo, and urged people to stay hydrated and use air conditioners and electric fans to prevent heat-related illnesses.Japan’s temperature record was broken as a high-pressure system brought clear skies and blistering heat to many parts of the country, the meteorological agency said, adding that the brutal weather was expected to continue into Thursday.The agency said temperatures on Wednesday had exceeded 35C at 271 of its 914 observation points, with new highs seen in 39 places.The previous record of 41.1C was set in Hamamatsu in Shizuoka prefecture, in August 2020, and in Kumagaya, Saitama prefecture near Tokyo in July 2018.Theextreme heatposes a particular threat to the countries’ large populations of older people.Thirteen people have died in South Korea from suspected heat-related causes so far this year – three times the number over the same period last year – according to the Korea’s disease control and prevention agency.In Japan, 10,804 people, more than half of whom were aged over 64, were taken to hospital suffering from exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses in the week up to 21 July – the highest weekly number so far this year. Sixteen people died, according to the fire and disaster management agency.Summer temperatures in Japan have soared in recent years as a result of more erratic weather patterns that scientists attribute to theclimate crisis.Last summer was Japan’sjoint hottest on record, with temperatures matching those of 2023, which was followed by the warmest autumn since records began 126 years ago.Theheatis also affecting overseas visitors.

RecognisePalestine. Savepublic housing. Overhaul childcare. On paper, the urgency resolutions up for debate at Victorian Labor’s state conference this weekend lay out a roadmap for progressive, nation-shaping reform.But how much sway do grassroots members and unions really have on the increasingly cautious federal and state Labor governments?The premier,Jacinta Allan, on Wednesday, said the conference provides the “policies and programs that shape the Labor agenda of the future”.But then, when some of the proposed policiesbecame public a day later, she was quick to distance her government. “It’s government that sets policy,” she said on Thursday.‘Action, not slogans’: Albanese dismisses pressure from Labor MPs to toughen Israel stanceRead moreRank-and-file party members spend months of their own time drafting the urgency resolutions, or motions, lobbying for votes and hoping that – while non-binding – their proposals influence the party’s direction.But many say thatsince state conference returned in 2023– after a four-year gap marked by lockdowns anda federal intervention in the branch– it’s started to feel a bit like political theatre.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“It’s all a big, stage-managed performance really,” one Labor member says, claiming most controversial motions are vetted in advance by the premier, prime minister or relevant ministers’ office, with their wording softened and criticisms blunted.Another member says there’s a “strange paradigm” at play, where ministerial staff “sometimes dismiss the backbone of the movement” while at the same time “put so much effort into making sure conference is clean”. (That is, no public bust-ups or headlines that might cause trouble for the government).Some Labor MPs who have been around for decades insist it’s just the way it has always been.“It’s just that we’ve come off a federal election win and everyone is ambitious to set the agenda,” one state MP said.Indeed, this weekend’s gathering at Moonee Valley racecourse marks the first major meeting ofLabor partymembers since the federal election. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, won’t be in attendance, leaving Allan to rally the room of 600 delegates, split evenly between party members and affiliated unions.Australia won’t receive Aukus nuclear submarines unless US doubles shipbuilding, admiral warnsRead moreThe delegate mix will lean more progressive this year, partly due to the Health Workers Union sitting it out and theCFMEU being unable to participate, making it easier for some motions to get across the line. (Though one state Labor MP quipped that the party was “always more progressive than the government, just as the Liberal party conference is more conservative”).On the draft agenda, there are two motions calling for a review of the Aukus submarine deal, including one from Labor Against War, which urges a withdrawal from the partnership, citing the US president, Donald Trump, as a “clear and present danger to peace and security”.“We shouldn’t rely on the unstable Trump administration for our defence …Victoriamust ensure we are protected from Trump’s chaos and division,” it reads. The group is optimistic it will pass.Two motions deal withthe childcare crisis, sparked by allegations of child sexual abuse against a Victorian worker, with one calling for stricter staffing ratios, tighter regulation and funding reform to “restrict and eliminate profiteering”. The other proposes a centralised Working With Children Check database, real-time alerts, psychometric testing for workers and the creation of a childcare worker integrity unit.There’s a motion rejecting the Allan government’sproposed protest laws, arguing they “would serve only to stifle freedom of expression” and are “anti-democratic and regressive”.Labor for Housing is also pushing the state government to commit to keep all 44 public housing tower sitesslated for redevelopmentpublicly owned.“If this resolution is endorsed by conference it is a clear and unambiguous statement that the Labor government does not have the support of its movement to sell the land,” Julijana Todorovic, the Labor for Housing co-convener and co-founder says.“We have an opportunity to tell a good story about Labor’s value for public assets and ensuring wealth is shared by all Victorians.”Victorian Labor party members to push for ‘immediate’ federal recognition of a Palestinian stateRead moreTodorovic said while the motion isn’t binding “it would be extraordinary for a government to act contrary to the will of those it will rely on to get re-elected next year”.

The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union and the Health and Community Services Union are calling on the state government to follow through on past commitments – including a $12m 2022 election pledge to deliver a worker-led drug, alcohol and gambling service that, three years on, “remains unopened, with no confirmed land, construction or seed funding”.Tony Piccolo from the AMWU said unions “work very hard with their members to generate very good ideas to bring to conference” only for some to “sit on a shelf” for years.“You would think with the state debt level so high that unions offering to fund a health initiative would be embraced as it helps budgetary pressures.”Most anticipated though are motions put forward by Labor Friends of Palestine demanding the federal government“immediately” recognise a Palestinian stateand impose sanctions on Israel – their strongest push to date on the issue.The issue flared up at last year’s conference, withprotesters attempting to stormthe building. Security has been ramped up this year as a result, with another protest planned for Saturday.This year’s conference is also firmly focused on policy, with committees submitting final reports that will help shape Victorian Labor’s 2026 election platform.Proposals include replacing stamp duty with an annual land tax, introducing a new tax on land sale super-profits, establishing a state-owned and regulated cannabis industry, mandating 12 days of reproductive health leave per year and creating a political disinformation register.But the reports show few, if any, ministers, parliamentary secretaries or caucus representatives actually showed up at committee meetings, raising questions about how seriously they’re treated within government ranks.If the mood on the ground is anything to go by, the base is no longer willing to be sidelined.Benita Kolovos is Guardian Australia’sVictoriacorrespondentExplore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaLabor partyJacinta AllananalysisShareReuse this content"

The infection is transmitted through mosquito bites, and those with symptoms can experience a high fever, body aches, headache and nausea. Severe cases may require hospitalisation, and in extreme cases lead to death.Those infected a second time are at even greater risk of severe dengue.Nauru’s president, David Adeang,said last weekhe was “overwhelmed by the increased number of dengue fever cases”, including among families and children.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailTwo children died of dengue in Nauru on Wednesday, the government said in a public statement on social media.“The health of our community depends on the actions we take now,” Adeang said. “This rapid spread of dengue requires every one of us to unite.”Heidi Abdel-Raouf, the manager of detention casework advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), said the group was aware of nine men who have dengue “but there are reports of many more”.There are approximately 93 asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru, who mostly live in the community on a stipend of $230 a fortnight from the Australian government. They have been there between two and 22 months, and will never be settled in Australiaunder government policies. Those with refugee status currently have no resettlement options.“Many of the men have pre-existing health conditions, which mean that the illness that they have with dengue is just compounding,” Abdel-Raouf said.“We know from the history of offshore detention that … due to indefinite detention and poor living conditions and limited and inadequate healthcare services, that detention effectively makes people really unwell.”View image in fullscreenA view of the regional processing centre (RPC1) in Nauru, in 2014.Photograph: Asylum Seeker Resource CentreAn asylum seeker on Nauru told the Guardian he was diagnosed with dengue four or five days ago. He said through an interpreter that he still had a fever, his entire body was painful and he could not eat.He was taken to a facility for blood tests and told to take two tablets of Panadol every six hours after his diagnosis. There is no specific treatment for dengue and doctors generally advise the use of analgesics to control pain.“I am very concerned because I don’t think the medication, Panadol, will be helping me, especially because I cannot eat,” he said.“It’s hard to move around, I don’t have enough strength because I cannot eat enough, so I am very concerned.”Accessing mosquito nets, he said, was “impossible”.“There are no mosquito nets available anywhere in Nauru.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Abdel-Raouf also said the men had difficulty accessing Hydralyte and fruit and vegetables to aid their recovery.The asylum seeker who spoke to the Guardiansaid in his case he had been given enough Panadol to comply with his doctor’s treatment plan.The ASRC also said some of the men had requested mosquito repellant and insect netting but authorities and case managers were not able to help them.“Some men were particularly concerned because they live in a jungle-like area, with a higher number of mosquitoes, a higher chance of getting dengue,” Abdel-Raouf said.Guardian Australia contacted the Australian Border Force for comment on medical supplies and insect control measures provided to those on Nauru, as well as figures on the number of people sickened with dengue. The Nauru government did not reply to a request for comment on the outbreak.The Department of Home Affairs said it was aware cases of dengue fever were rising in Nauru, adding it is following the lead of the country’s government “to coordinate the response to the dengue outbreak”.A spokesperson said transfer to Australia for temporary treatment “may occur on a case-by case-basis depending on individual circumstances where necessary medical treatment is not available on Nauru or to support engagement with third country migration options”.The department added that transitory persons “do not have a settlement pathway in Australia”.The Department of Foreign Affairs’ website notes that severe dengue fever is rare but “a medical emergency that needs hospital treatment”.Islands across the Pacific including Samoa, Fiji and Kiribati all reported high numbers of dengue cases in recent weeks. At leasttwo people diedin Samoa in the latest outbreak.Abdel-Raouf said the situation on Nauru would only grow worse the longer people seeking asylum in Australia remained there.“The health system on Nauru is already fragile and easily overwhelmed – it will struggle to cope with this outbreak,” she said. “Australia has a clear responsibility for the refugees our government has banished there.”AUN watchdog ruled in Januarythat Australia had violated the rights of asylum seekers detained on Nauru, finding a nation “cannot escape its human rights responsibility when outsourcing asylum processing to another state”. Australia has maintained it is not responsible for the treatment of asylum seekers of refugees there, saying it works “closely” with the country to “support the provision of health, welfare and support services”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumNauruPacific islandsDengue fevernewsShareReuse this content"

A jury last November ordered McGregor to pay her nearly €250,000 (£216,000) in damages.McGregor, 36, denied the allegation and said he had “fully consensual sex” with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff.In the appeal heard earlier this month, lawyers for McGregor said the judge erred in directing the jury to decide whether he “assaulted” rather than “sexually assaulted” the victim.Judge Brian O’Moore said on Thursday that the appeal court had no doubt the overall effect of the trial judge’s charge was to tell them the central allegation by Hand against McGregor was that he had raped her.McGregor’s legal team had also argued that the judge should not have allowed a line of questioning during cross-examination regarding McGregor’s “no comment” responses in a police interview. That ground was also rejected.Hand said in a statement outside the court: “To every survivor out there, I know how hard it is but please don’t be silenced … You deserve to be heard, you also deserve justice. Today, I can finally move on and try to heal.”Hand told the high court in November that she and a friend had made contact with McGregor, whom she knew, after a work Christmas party. She said they were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed.She said McGregor, who was not in court on Thursday, took her to a bedroom in the penthouse and sexually assaulted her.Hand’s lawyer told the jury that when she was referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, a doctor was so concerned that he directed that photographs be taken of her injuries.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He signed the law into force swiftly after the vote.The law passed as Russia continued to bombardUkrainewith drones and missiles nightly. A huge attack on Kyiv overnight killed at least nine people, including a six-year-old child. One missile strike in the early hours of Thursday led to the partial collapse of a nine-story block of flats, and authorities reported that 124 people had been injured, including 10 children.In another major attack on Monday night, Russian missile strikes killedmore than 25 people, including at a prison and a maternity hospital in the east of Ukraine.LiveAt least eight dead as explosions rock Kyiv in latest Russian attack – videoDonald Trump appears to be taking a slightly tougher tone withRussiaand earlier this week lowered a 50-day deadline for Russia to make progress on a ceasefire to “10 or 12 days”, saying he had not seen any serious desire from Vladimir Putin to end the war.On Thursday, the senior US diplomat John Kelley told the UN security council that Trump wanted the war ended by next Friday, though he gave little detail of why this effort was expected to succeed where previous attempts had failed. Before taking office Trump had promised to end the conflict within 24 hours.Kelley said: “Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace.” He did not specify what measures he had in mind.Zelenskyy called on Ukraine’s allies on Thursday to put further pressure on Moscow after the latest strikes on Kyiv. “Today the world once again saw Russia’s answer to our desire for peace with America andEurope… That is why peace without strength is impossible,” he wrote on Telegram.He also called for foreign leaders to push for regime change in Russia. “If the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia, that means even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise neighbouring countries,” he said in a speech on Thursday to a conference marking 50 years since the signing of the cold war-eraHelsinki accord.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of a huge overnight airstrike on Kyiv, which caused widespread destruction.Photograph: Jedrzej Nowicki/The GuardianOvernight in Kyiv, explosions rang out for hours, making it another sleepless night for many before the parliamentary vote. Nonetheless, several hundred people gathered in a park close to parliament during the vote, the latest in a set of protests over the past week predominantly attended by young Ukrainians.The law passed with 331 votes in favour and none against, a rapid U-turn from the bill that passed the previous week with support from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party.That bill stripped powers from the national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo. Both work independently of other law enforcement bodies specifically to target high-level corruption. The changes would have brought them under the control of Zelenskyy’s handpicked general prosecutor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the government’s swift response had shown it listened to criticism.“The question is how you react if your initiatives are not accepted by people. Either you ignore protests and complaints, or you analyse them and then make corrections. President Zelenskyy has shown that he reacts very quickly to society and is ready to cooperate constructively,” Podolyak said.Thursday’s parliamentary session devoted to the law was televised for the first time since 2022, lifting a security ban on filming. Opposition MPs made fiery speeches criticising Zelenskyy and the presidential administration before the vote.When the results were announced, the crowd outside parliament broke into cheers and sang the national anthem. Protesters have been clear that they do not have revolutionary intentions, with most acutely aware of the dangers of political destabilisation in wartime. Instead, they say, the demonstrations show that Ukrainian democracy is functioning despite a lack of elections under martial law.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

According to the coalition, IDF soldiers beat and choked the American labor activist Chris Smalls, who was onboard the ship. Smalls is most well-known for co-founding the Amazon Labor Union.The Handala, which carried food, baby formula, diapers and medicine, was attempting to breach Israel’s blockade of Gaza, as Palestinians there continue to starve in what UN-backed hunger experts have called a“worst-case scenario of famine”that is unfolding.“The Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirms that upon arrival in Israeli custody, US human rights defender Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by seven uniformed individuals. They choked him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back,” the Freedom Flotilla Coalition wrote in a statementposted on Instagramon Tuesday morning.“When his lawyer met with him, Chris was surrounded by six members of Israel’s special police unit. This level of force was not used against other abducted activists. We condemn this violence against Chris and demand accountability for the assault and discriminatory treatment he faced.”In a statement to the Guardian, the Israeli foreign ministry wrote: “Contrary to the claims made, the passenger violently resisted. This was a planned provocation intended to create media attention. We emphasize that no other passenger made a similar claim.” The Guardian has contacted Smalls for his response to the foreign ministry’s allegations.Smalls, the only Black person onboard the boat, was one of 21 members of the group who were detained. Others included 19 civilians, including parliamentarians, medics and engineers, and two journalists. Jacob Berger, a Jewish American actor whoshared on Instagramthat Smalls was in “great spirits” after his detention – everyone else who was detained, he said, should be released on Tuesday or Wednesday.The interception of the Handala came as more than 30 Israeli public figures called for“crippling sanctions”over Israel’s starvation of Gaza. Donald Trump saidhe wanted“to make sure [Gazans] get the food, every ounce of food” during a recent meeting with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.The Handala was not the first effort by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to deliver aid to Gaza. Previous attempts, including one in June in which Greta Thunberg was arrested, were also intercepted by Israel. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 activists setting sail for Gaza on the Mavi Marmara.“We are calling on others around the world, definitely our countries, to live up to their obligation of enforcing international law, of protecting human rights, but also other institutions that are founded to do the same,” said Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American attorney and Handala member, in an appearance on Monday onDemocracy Now. “We should not be waiting for Israel to give permission for food or other humanitarian aid to enter … we need to be breaking, challenging and breaking the blockade.”While they were onboard the flotilla, Araf said that the US government did not make contact with the seven American members of the crew, though France, Spain and Italy contacted their citizens to offer consular services after their detention. It is not yet clear if Smalls or any other American citizens have been contacted since their detention.They were “legitimizing Israeli piracy on the high seas. And that is unacceptable to us,” she said, referring to countries that offered services following the illegal boarding in international waters.“And that is the kind of impunity that our governments, all governments, really, have been allowing Israel to just violate international law.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS unionsGazaAidMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s been our position throughout and I absolutely understand the unimaginable horror that Emily went through.“Alongside that, we do need to do everything we can to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe inGaza, where we are seeing the children and babies starving for want of aid which could be delivered.“That is why I’ve said unless things materially change on the ground, we’ll have to assess this in September, we will recognise Palestine before the United Nations general assembly in September.”Damari has said Starmer is “not standing on the right side of history” and that she was “deeply saddened” by the decision.The government has not been explicit about whether Starmer would require remaining hostages taken on 7 October to be released before he would be willing to agree Palestinian statehood. He has said he will assess “how far bothIsraeland Hamas have met the steps we set out” before taking a decision.But Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, appeared to suggest thatHamaswere not part of negotiations over recognition of Palestine because they are terrorists rather than the government.Speaking to the BBC’s World at One, he said the UK would not get into a “to and fro” with Hamas over the recognition plans. Reynolds told reporters: “Our requests that all hostages must be released and that Hamas can play no future role in the governance of Gaza or a Palestinian state are longstanding.“We don’t negotiate with terrorists. Hamas are terrorists and that’s why we don’t get into a to and fro with them as to what we want them to do. That’s absolute in terms of our request.”Two government sources said that its demands on Hamas to free the hostages and sign up to a ceasefire remain unchanged and unrelated to the recognition of Palestinian statehood.The government also stressed on Thursday that its plans to recognise Palestine arecompliant with international law, after a group of peers raised concerns that it did not meet the legal bar.View image in fullscreenThe business minister Gareth Thomas said the government was determined to recognise Palestinian statehood in September if Israel did not end the violence in Gaza.Photograph: Chris McAndrew/UK parliamentGareth Thomas, a business minister, told Times Radio: “In the end, recognition of another state is a political judgment and over 140 countries have already recognised Palestine, and we’re determined to do so in September if Israel does not end the violence in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and agree to a lasting route towards a two-state solution, and to no annexation in the West Bank.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its 2024 Advisory Opinion, at paragraph 283, the Court recognised ‘the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to an independent and sovereign State’. The Court did not indicate that the ‘right to an independent and sovereign State’ was somehow conditional or something for the future. The Court’s language makes clear that that right exists now, and it exists because all the criteria for statehood are met.”On Thursday No 10 said Starmer had spoken to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, about the situation in Gaza.A government spokesperson said: “The leaders agreed the situation on the ground was a humanitarian catastrophe, and all possible efforts needed to be made to get more aid into Gaza at a greater pace and scale.“The prime minister outlined his peace plan and pathway to recognition and thanked the president for his leadership in the region to secure a lasting and durable two-state solution.”Starmer also reiterated his call for the release of all hostages and an immediate ceasefire, before the two men turned to UK-Egyptian relations and closer cooperation on regional security.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warKeir StarmerForeign policyPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Al-Saraya field hospital said it had received more than 100 dead and wounded after the shooting, while the death toll was expected to rise, the Associated Press reported.On Thursday morning, 19 people seeking aid were killed by Israeli soldiers outside aid distribution points in the centralGazaStrip and in Rafah in south Gaza.Gaza is in the throes of famine,according to the international authority on food insecurity. Seven children died of hunger on Wednesday, bringing the total number of malnutrition deaths to 154, the Gaza health authority said.“Dying of starvation is slow and painful,” the World Health Organization said in a statement on Thursday. “A starving child, among the most vulnerable, might cry constantly from pain until becoming too weak to even do that. If not urgently treated, a child with acute malnutrition will die.”The UN agency added that it would take “months, if not years” to reverse what it called a “man-made tragedy”.As Gaza’s famine has deepened, social order has broken down. It is common for crowds of hundreds of desperate people to wait for the rare aid truck to enter Gaza and to loot the vehicle once it arrives.Starvation graphicMore than 1,000 people have been shot, primarily by Israeli soldiers, while trying to get food from the private US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and while waiting for aid trucks by border crossings.The UN has said the key to stopping the looting of aid is to reassure the population that a constant, adequate supply will enter Gaza. Israel controls aid crossings into Gaza and has been accused of creating the hunger crisis through its blockades of humanitarian supplies – something it denies, alongside its rejection that there is starvation in Gaza.Trump threatens Canada on trade deal after Carney moves to recognise PalestineRead moreIsrael recently expanded aid access into Gaza, but humanitarians have said the new measures will not reverse the starvation crisis and have called for urgent, unfettered aid access into Gaza.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on Wednesday that the amount of food being brought into Gaza was “far from enough”.The foreign minister of Cyprus announced on Thursday that his country was working to reactivate a sea route to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. Cyprus had previously helped deliver about 2,200 tonnes of aid to Gaza last year, before several incidents stopped the route altogether.Constantinos Kombos said more planning was needed before reopening the sea corridor. He called the situation in Gaza “unacceptable, unbearable” and said aid must be let into the territory “so that it has tangible, visible outcomes immediately”.As the hunger crisis worsened, Witkoff landed in Israel, where he met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli media reported that they discussed the flagging ceasefire talks and the White House later announced that Witkoff and the US ambassador, Mike Huckabee, would travel to Gaza on Friday “to inspect the current [food] distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food and meet with local Gazans to hear first-hand about this dire situation on the ground”.graphicIsrael sent a response on Wednesday to Hamas’s latest ceasefire plan, which proposed a 60-day pause in fighting and a hostage-prisoner exchange.The US president, Donald Trump, called on Hamas to surrender and release the remaining Israeli hostages. The group holds about 50 captives, 20 of whom are believed to be living.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!”Trump had suggested on Wednesday that the US would partner with Israel to run new food distribution points in Gaza, but has given few details about what this plan would look like. The GHF has the backing of the Trump administration and is chaired by an associate of Trump, but it was not clear whether the US would work through the private initiative.Israel has come under huge international pressure as images of starving people have prompted an outcry. More than a dozen countries have condemned Israel for its conduct in Gaza and taken steps torecognise the Palestinian state– a largely symbolic move.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators march during a rally in Toronto on 6 April.Photograph: Anadolu/GettySeveral countries,including Canada, said they would move toward recognising a Palestinian state in September. Canada’s recognition would be contingent on some changes within the Palestinian Authority, Mark Carney, the prime minister, said.Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said before a visit to Israel on Thursday that recognition of a Palestinian state should come at the end of talks on a two-state solution, but said Berlin would respond to any unilateral actions, after citing “annexation threats” by some Israeli ministers.On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed a partial suspension of Israel from its most prestigious science research programme over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.airdrops into Gaza graphicIsrael has condemned the international censure of its actions in Gaza and moves to recognise the Palestinian state, which it says are in service of Hamas.The past week, however, has brought the sharpest rebukes of Israel from the international community since the war in Gaza began on 7 October 2023. It has put more pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or face more international isolation.Last week, ceasefire talks seemed to completely stall after Israel and the US withdrew their negotiators from Doha, where talks were being held. Both parties blamed Hamas for the collapse, saying the group had introduced new demands late in the talks – a claim Hamas denied.Israeli officials have warned that if Hamas does not become more flexible with its demands, Israel will reimpose a tight siege on humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to the country’s public broadcaster, Kan. The broadcaster said that the military proposed expanding its ground operations in the territory to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in negotiations.Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack in 2023 that killed about 1,200 people. More than 60,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s military operation and much of the territory has been destroyed.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

His father, Zaher Ibrahim, reached out to Republican congressman Mike Haridopolos from their home state of Florida in March, pleading for help after more than 45 days without contact with his son.Relatives mourn Palestinian American beaten to death by Israeli settlers: ‘He made everyone feel loved’Read more“The Megiddo Prison is notorious for brutality and suffering,” Zaher Ibrahim wrote in a form he sent to Haridopolos that has been viewed by the Guardian. “We are kindly asking for some support in this matter. We have exhausted all efforts locally here in Israel and have no other option than to ask our local Florida office officials to reach out on our behalf.”Haridopolos’s office confirmed it had been contacted about Muhammad Ibrahim and said it had shared the family’s information with the state department. The office said it had been informed that the US embassy in Israel was “following standard procedures”. A spokesperson for the state department said in a statement there is “no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens”.The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to queries about the allegations against Ibrahim, directing questions to the Israel Prison Service, which manages the Megiddo prison. The IPS has not responded to requests for comment.The Guardian first became aware of Muhammad Ibrahim’s detention through reporting on his cousinSayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US-Palestinian citizen allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank earlier in July while visiting relatives.Ibrahim is one of hundreds of Palestinian children in Israeli military detention, where advocates say even US citizenship offers little protection from a system that routinely holds minors for extended periods without charge or family contact during proceedings that can drag on for months.“Palestinian children in Israeli prisons are totally disconnected from the outside world,” Ayed Abu Eqtaish, the West Bank-based accountability program director at Defense for Children International-Palestine said. “They will not recognize whether you are American, Somalian or whatever your citizenship.”US embassy officials have conducted welfare checks on Muhammad Ibrahim since his detention but have faced restrictions in recent weeks, according to an email sent by a state department official to the family. Zaher, Muhammad’s father, said he was informed by the embassy after an early visit that his son appeared to have lost 12kg (26lb) in the spring. In mid-July, the state department informed the family in an email seen by the Guardian that Ibrahim was suffering from scabies, a contagious skin infection caused by mites, and was receiving medical treatment, and said US officials would visit once he recovered.Local staff with the state department did not comment on Ibrahim’s health or whether they’ve been able to see him since, but in a statement a spokesperson told the Guardian the department “works to provide consular assistance which may include visiting detained US citizens to ensure they have access to necessary medication or medical attention and facilitating authorized communications with their family or others”.Ibrahim’s lawyer did not return a request for comment to clarify the status of the case against him, but a video seen by the Guardian of Ibrahim’s interrogation while in detention shows Israeli officials questioning the teenager over rock-throwing in Silwad. He did not appear to have a lawyer present.As of March 2025, 323 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 were being held in Israeli military detention, accordingto data fromthe Defense for Children International-Palestine. According to a2011 report from B’Tselem, 835 Palestinian minors between the ages of 12 and 17 were tried on stone-throwing charges in military courts between 2005 and 2010, and only one minor was acquitted. A majority of the minors would receive sentences of longer than four months.Since Hamas’s 7 October attacks and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, conditions for Palestinian detainees from both Gaza and the West Bank have deteriorated significantly. Advocates say military prosecutors have now become less willing to negotiate plea deals that might lead to earlier releases.“After October 2023, the situation was harsher,” Abu Eqtaish said. “Now they are stricter in punishment and sentences. We encounter problems knowing about living conditions inside prisons. There’s no family presence. Lawyer visits are very restricted.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesFloridaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A video appears to show Levi firing his gun wildly and then people screaming as Hathaleen, standing a distance away in the town centre, collapsed.Wave of condemnation after killing of Palestinian activist in West BankRead moreLeviwas released from custody by a court on Tuesday and placed under three days of house arrest, which ends tomorrow and allows him to roam free. According to Levi’s lawyer, Avihai Hajabi, the court found that there was evidence supporting his claims that he acted in self-defence, and ordered his release.Levi, who was earlierput under sanctionsby the then US president Joe Biden and later removed from the sanctions list by Donald Trump, could still face charges.Despite the release of Levi, Hathaleen’s family is still struggling to recover his body from Israeli police so that they can hold his funeral.“It’s devastating. His body is still being held and the killer is free. His mother and his wife – they keep asking where he is, when his body will come back. I have no answers any more. I tell them an hour, two hours, but I don’t know,” said Salem Hathaleen, the elder brother of Awdah.View image in fullscreenIsraeli police stop the Knesset member Gilad Kariv as he attempts to reach settlers operating a bulldozer in Umm al-Khair.Photograph: Alaa Badarneh/EPAIsraeli police said they would not release Hathaleen’s body until his family agreed to 10 conditions, including limiting the funeral to 15 people and burying his body outside his birth village, according to a lawyer representing the family.“The idea is that the police want the funeral to be really small and quiet, so that it is like it never happened and nobody will come,” said Karin Wind, who has reviewed the conditions and is communicating with the police on behalf of the family.Two UK charities donate millions to Israeli settlement in occupied West BankRead moreAccording to a police document seen by the Guardian, police requested that no “signs calling for incitement” be displayed or “amplification” system used at the funeral, with the police requesting a deposit from the family to ensure they complied with conditions. The family refused to sign the document and its conditions.“Fifteen people – this would mean basically half his siblings and children couldn’t even attend,” said Salem.The Guardian reached out to the Israeli police and the military for a comment but did not receive one by the time of publication. The Israeli military has claimed the conditions are necessary to preserve public order.Israeli soldiers raided the tent erected for mourners on Tuesday, declaring it a closed military zone as they pushed mourners out and threw stun grenades at activists and journalists in attendance.“Coming to the place that he was killed, where they killed him, and kicking people out? This is not a life, this is against any law in the world,” said Awdeh’s brother Alaa Hathaleen, who witnessed him die.The Guardian attempted to reach Alaa Hathaleen for a comment on Thursday but discovered he had been arrested, along with 13 other residents, by the Israeli military.More than 70 women from the village declared on Thursday that they were going on hunger strike until the police returned the body of Awdeh Hathaleen.Bishops call on UK government to take action over West Bank settler violenceRead moreActivists and relatives of Hathaleen said the case underscored what they called a system of impunity for Israeli settlers as they committed a wave of violence against Palestinians. At least 1,010 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 have been injured in theWest Bankby Israeli settlers and soldiers since October 2023.View image in fullscreenTorched vehicles in Silwad after violence overnight by Israeli settlers overnight.Photograph: Nasser Nasser/APOn Thursday morning, another settler attack was carried out in the village of Silwad in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority said Israeli settlers descended upon the village and set fire to homes and cars in the village, killing a Palestinian man.“Forty-year-old Khamis Abdel-Latif Ayad was martyred due to smoke inhalation caused by fires set by settlers in citizens’ homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad at dawn,” the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.The Israeli military said in a statement to Agence France-Presse that several suspects set fire to property and vehicles in Silwad, but that they were unable to identify the suspects. The Israeli police said it had launched an investigation into the incident.Accountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians is rare. Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law, but their development has been accelerated under the current rightwing government.The Israeli government distributed 29 all-terrain vehicles, in addition to security and logistical equipment including drones and night vision goggles, to settlements on Wednesday. At the ceremony to hand over the equipment, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The agricultural farms and young settlements are the spearhead of Zionist settlement in Judea and Samaria.”Israeli settlers kill American-Palestinian visiting relatives in West Bank, says familyRead moreThe killing of Hathaleen prompted a wave of international condemnation. The French ministry of foreign affairs released a statement urging the Israeli government to hold Hathaleen’s killer accountable and calling settler violence “a matter of terrorism”.Umm al-Khair is within Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and sits just below the Israeli settlement of Carmel. All settlements in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, are illegal under international law.“There’s a saying here: ‘The dignity of the dead is in burial.’ When someone is killed, there should be immediate burial. It brings some small relief to the heart. But until now, we’ve received neither the body nor the right to do anything,” said Salem.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The results cited “significant security constraints” as one reason for the shortfall – indicating how limited the reach of the election may be amid the civil war.Analysts have predicted rebels will stage offensives around the election as a sign of their opposition.This month the junta began offering cash rewards to those willing to lay down their arms and “return to the legal fold” in the run-up to the vote.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaGovernancenewsShareReuse this content"

The purchase of the gems was secured through a public-private partnership between the Indian government and Godrej Industries Group, it added.Modi wrote: “It would make every Indian proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after 127 long years. These sacred relics highlight India’s close association with Bhagwan Buddha and his noble teachings. It also illustrates our commitment to preserving and protecting different aspects of our glorious culture.”The gems were sold by three descendants of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial landowner who in 1898excavated the gemson his estate in northern India. Their decision to auction the gems was met withan international outcryfrom Buddhist leaders, academics and devotees.The 334 precious stones, which were expected to sell at auction for about HK$100m (£9.7m), include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads and other ornaments or in their natural form.‘They’re rowdy.

Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now theIndian Museumin Kolkata, while Peppé was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them.In a statement, Sotheby’s said it was delighted to have facilitated the historic return of the gems to India.“This completes our active search over the past two months to identify the best possible custodian for the gems. Today is the culmination of our close collaboration with the Peppé family, the government of India and the newly-announced owners of the gems – the Godrej Industries Group.Now concluded, this sale will see the permanent return of the Piprahwa Gems to India where they will be on public display for years to come,” it said.Pirojsha Godrej, the executive vice-chair of Godrej Industries Group, said: “We are deeply honoured to contribute to this historic moment. The Piprahwa gems are not just artefacts, they are timeless symbols of peace, compassion and the shared heritage of humanity.”Chris Peppé, one of the former owners and the great-grandson of William Claxton Peppé, said his family shared Modi’s excitement at the repatriation of the gems. “We are happy that the true significance of the Piprahwa discovery has finally received the public recognition it always deserved and that the gems will be available for the public to see,” he added.This article was amended on 31 July 2025.

That scheme surviveda brief block on climate groundssparked by legal challenges from campaigners, overturnedon appeal in 2020.However, the plans were put on hold as passenger numbers dropped during the pandemic. The shareholders in the airport, which include the French private equity firm Ardian and Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s sovereign wealth funds, are seeking legislative change, as well as long-term political support, before filing a full planning application.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,has strongly endorsed expansion, but Heathrow is seeking firm policy guarantees after previous runway plans were overturned.These include airspace modernisation to ensure extra flight paths and the passing of theplanning and infrastructure bill. The airport is also seeking guarantees that the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), would allow Heathrow to levy charges to airlines at a level high enough to recoup its investment.Heathrow said the price of the runway itself would now be £21bn, up from £14bn six years ago, due to inflation in construction costs. An additional extension of Terminal 5 to support the extra passengers would cost £12bn, while another £15bn spend is planned to upgrade the wider airport regardless of the runway development.The chief executive of the airport, Thomas Woldbye, said it had “never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow”.He said: “We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country. It is time to clear the way for takeoff.”A government spokesperson said: “Expanding Heathrow could drive growth, trade and tourism, whilst unlocking over 100,000 jobs.”View image in fullscreenBritish Airways operates half of all flights from Heathrow, and the airport claims expansion would create more competition.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/ReutersThe government has promised to review the plans over the summer, with Heathrow pressing for a green light in September. It will also examine a rival proposal from a developer, the Arora Group, which has drawn up plans for a shorter runway further to the east.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

British Airways currently operates half of all flights from Heathrow and airlines jealously guard rights to valuable slots. EasyJet said the runway represented “a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers”.However, opponents questioned whether the scheme would progress, having failed to move ahead so far despite approval from two previous governments.Paul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway coalition, said: “There’s a real danger that we’ll end up with a hole in the ground and a debt pile for taxpayers to underwrite, because the government had foolishly encouraged Heathrow’s profligate self-interest, as if blind to the lessons of HS2.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said a new runway would have “a hugely detrimental impact on our environment”.Dr Douglas Parr, the policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the announcements meant residents around Heathrow would have “their lives put on hold for a few more years while more money and time is wasted on a doomed scheme … the economic case for the whole debacle just will not fly”.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayHeathrowAir transportAirline industryLondonTravel and transportHeathrow airportnewsShareReuse this content"

But since then a lot of extremist groups have been deplatformed by mainstream spaces, so individuals will now lurk on public groups or channels on Facebook or Discord, for example, and use this as a way of identifying someone who might be sympathetic to reach out to.”He added that, while some younger users turn to extreme content for its shock value among their peers, this can make them vulnerable to being targeted.Extremists have been forced to become more sophisticated as the majority of platforms have banned them, Allchorn said. “Speaking to local community safety teams, they told us that approaches are now about trying to create a rapport rather than making a direct ideological sell.”The study also spoke to moderators, who described their frustration at inconsistent enforcement policies on their platforms and the burden of deciding whether content or users should be reported to law enforcement agencies.While in-game chat is unmoderated, moderators said they were still overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of harmful content, including the use of hidden symbols to circumvent banned words that would be picked up by automated moderation tools, for example, a string of symbols stitched together to represent a swastika.Allchorn highlighted the need for critical digital literacy for parents as well as law enforcement so they could better understand how these platforms and subcultures operate.Last October Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, revealed that “13% of all those being investigated by MI5 for involvement in UK terrorism are under 18”, a threefold increase in three years.AI tools are being used to assist with moderation, but they struggle to interpret memes or when language is ambiguous or sarcastic.Explore more on these topicsFar rightGamesYoung peopleInternet safetyInternetThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not provide exact turnout numbers or a breakdown of the voting across the three countries.Prof Nicola Ranger, the RCN’s general secretary and chief executive, said: “We deliver the vast majority of care in every [NHS] service and deserve to be valued for all our skill, knowledge and experience. To avoid formal escalation, the government must be true to its word and negotiate on reforms of the outdated pay structure which traps nursing staff at the same band their entire career.”Nurses in England staged several stoppages in late 2022 and early 2023 in pursuit of better pay.The RCN also wants Agenda for Change, the UK-wide mechanism for negotiating the pay of NHS staff apart from doctors and dentists, to be updated. The longstanding agreement “provides nurses with low starting salaries, traps tens of thousands of nurses on the same pay band their entire careers and prevents staff progressing, despite years of experience, skills, formal qualifications and training”, it said.NHS bosses said patients would suffer if nurses did end up striking again. “NHS leaders will be disappointed to hear of the threat of further walkouts given the dust has barely settled on the five-day resident doctor strike,” said Rory Deighton, the acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation. “Patients are always the ones who end up suffering the most during industrial action as they are left waiting longer for their vital treatments, potentially in pain, discomfort and distress.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In polling by YouGov this week, 47% said they strongly or somewhat supported nurses going on strike over pay, while 43% said they would strongly or somewhat oppose that.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it was disappointed nurses in England had rejected the 3.6% award that Streeting had announced in May. “After receiving two above-inflation pay rises from this government, new full-time nurses will earn £30,000 in basic pay for the first time this year so it’s disappointing that RCN members are dissatisfied with this year’s pay rise,” a DHSC spokesperson said.“We hugely value the work of nurses, and through our 10-year health plan, we are rebuilding the NHS for the benefit of patients and staff, and ensuring nursing remains an attractive career choice. This government is clear we can’t move any further on headline pay but will work with the RCN to improve their major concerns, including pay structure reform, concerns on career progression and wider working conditions.”Explore more on these topicsNursingIndustrial actionPublic sector payNHSWes StreetingHospitalsPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

After Janet’s death in 1994, he worked with illustrators such asRaymond Briggsand Bruce Ingman, with his career coming full circle in a series of collaborations with his daughter Jessica including Half a Pig and a pop-up set of anarchic variations on the tale of Goldilocks.“He was enormously playful in spirit and language and had the ability to make you smile in one sentence,” said Belinda Ioni Rasmussen, CEO of Walker Books Group, which published some of his books. “Allan inspired generations of children’s writers, inspired all of us who worked with him, and inspired artists to make some of their very best work.”Top illustrators pay homage to Allan Ahlberg - in picturesRead moreBorn in 1938, Ahlberg was adopted into a working-class family living in the West Midlands town of Oldbury. “My parents loved me and they did me a huge service saving me from growing up in a children’s home,”he told the Guardian in 2006, “but there were a fair few clips round the ear, no books and not much conversation.”After grammar school and national service, Ahlberg worked as a postman, plumber’s mate and gravedigger. But his life took a different turn when the head of Oldbury’s parks and cemeteries heard he had A-levels, and decided Ahlberg should become a teacher. “I didn’t think it was such a good idea,”Ahlberg recalled in 2011. “I was very shy – I found it embarrassing to buy a bus ticket. But he got me to put my suit on and have a wash and a clean-up, and he took me to one or two schools, just to visit, just to get the feel of it.”He fell in love with teaching, and fell in love again when he met Janet Hall while they were both studying at a teacher training college in Sunderland. After marrying in 1969 they settled near Leicester, Ahlberg teaching in a primary school while Janet worked as an illustrator. But when she despaired of the humdrum material she was drawing and asked Ahlberg to write her a story, he later recalled, “It was as if she turned a key in my back and I was off.”After a string of rejections from publishers, the floodgates opened in 1976 with the vibrantly coloured The Old Joke Book. The following year saw the couple pivot into fiction with the story of a boy who stops growing and starts to shrink, The Vanishment of Thomas Tull, and Burglar Bill, who “lives in a tall house full of stolen property”, has “stolen fish and chips and a cup of stolen tea for supper” and then “swings a big stolen sack over his shoulder and goes off to work, stealing things”.Their reputation was established in 1978 with a book for younger readers, Each Peach Pear Plum. A jaunty rhyme takes the reader on a daisy-chain game of I-spy offering glimpses of Tom Thumb up a peach tree, Cinderella dusting in the cellar, Baby Bunting falling from a tree and Jack and Jill disappearing down the hill. It was hailed as “a work of genius” by the critic Elaine Moss, with Janet’s illustrations earning her the prestigious Kate Greenaway medal the following year.Ahlberg returned to his childhood in the West Midlands with Peepo!, a day in the life of a baby in a working-class family during the second world war. Cut-out circles offer a peek of “his father sleeping / In the big brass bed” and “his sisters searching / For a jar or tin / To take up to the park / And catch fishes in”. The secret was “all in the engineering”, Ahlberg told the Guardian. “You have to turn the page in order to see something – it’s a whole string of little suspenses, almost like in a theatre.”Their daughter Jessica became an inspiration, with her appetite for flicking through catalogues inspiring The Baby’s Catalogue. Her love of playing with the post inspired The Jolly Postman, an intricately constructed story of deliveries to fairytale characters complete with envelopes containing letters and cards. It was five years in the making and went on to sell more than 6m copies.View image in fullscreenAn early draft of The Jolly Postman by Janet and Allan Ahlberg.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianJanet was 50 when she died of breast cancer in 1994, leaving Ahlberg and his 15-year-old daughter bereft. It was a book created in memory of his wife that lifted him out of despair, he later recalled: “Writing about something is distancing it … It distracted me for a whole year. And then I was on the road to recovery.”My famous illustrator parentsRead moreThe road led to a new publisher, where he met the editor Vanessa Clarke, who he later married, and collaborations with other illustrators. He teamed up with Bruce Ingman for The Runaway Dinner and The Pencil, and with Raymond Briggs for The Adventures of Bert. In 2004, Half a Pig marked the first joint project for Ahlberg and his daughter, with the pair going on to collaborate on titles including a memoir of his childhood, The Bucket, and a reworking of Goldilocks.Meanwhile Ahlberg kept working, heading across the garden most days to write in his shed.“I’m like a dripping tap,” he said in 2011. “As I get older I drip more slowly, but I still come down here. I’m less impatient to spend hour after hour writing, though I like it as much as ever.”Explore more on these topicsChildren and teenagersRaymond BriggsnewsShareReuse this content"

I have no complaint,” Zakrzewski said in his final words once the curtain to the death chamber went up shortly after 6pm.Before the drugs began flowing, Zakrzewski also quoted from a poem as 14 witnesses looked on, plus media reporters and prison staff.Once the drugs were administered, Zakrzewski began breathing deeply, surrounded by three corrections department staff in dark suits. One of them shook Zakrzewski by the shoulders and shouted his name. There was no reaction and then he was still.No members of the victim’s family spoke with reporters afterward.After the US supreme court restored the death penalty in 1976, Florida carried out a one-year high of eight executions in 2014, a total matched this year with a mid-July execution, and now exceeded.Florida this year has carried out more executions than any other state, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second with four each.A 10th execution is scheduled for 19 August and an 11th on 28 August.Man who fatally shot two people outside Florida bar is executedRead moreZakrzewski, an air force veteran, was sentenced to die for the 1994 slayings of his 34-year-old wife, Sylvia, and their children Edward, seven, and five-year-old Anna, at their home in Okaloosa county in the panhandle. Trial testimony showed he committed the killings after his wife sought a divorce, and he had told others he would kill his family rather than allow that.Opponents of the execution point to Zakrzewski’s military service and the fact that a jury voted 7-5 to recommend his execution, barely a majority of the panel. He could not be executed with such a split jury vote under current state law. The trial judge imposed three death sentences on Zakrzewski.The Action Network, which organized an anti-execution petition, asked people to call DeSantis’s office and read a prepared script urging a stay of execution for Zakrzewski.“Florida does not need the death penalty to be safe. This execution will not make us safer, it will simply add another act of violence to an already tragic story. Justice does not require death,” the script reads in part.Zakrzewski’s lawyers have filed numerous appeals over the years, all of which have been rejected.Zakrzewski’s final appeal for a stay was rejected on Wednesday by the US supreme court.Until Thursday’s execution, twenty-six men had died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the US, and 11 other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.Florida was also the last state to execute someone, when Michael Bernard Bell died by lethal injection on 15 July. The state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, also signed a warrant for the 10th execution this year for Kayle Bates, who abducted a woman from an insurance office and killed her more than four decades ago.On Wednesday night, DeSantis issued a death warrant for Curtis Windom, 59, convicted of killing three people in the Orlando area in 1992. His execution is scheduled for 28 August.Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state’s department of corrections.Explore more on these topicsFloridaCapital punishmentUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s playing catch-up to its fellow tech giants on artificial intelligence, it’s seen its stock fall by double digits since the year began, itclosed a store in Chinafor the first time ever this week, and looming US tariffs on Beijing threaten its supply chain. On Thursday, the company released its third-quarter earnings of the fiscal year as investors scrutinize how the iPhone maker might turn things around.Despite the gloomy outlook, the company is still worth more than $3tn, and it beat Wall Street’s expectations for profit and revenue this quarter.Applereported a massive 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to $94.04bn, and $1.57 per share in earnings. That’s substantially more than the $89.3bn in revenue and $1.43 per share that analysts predicted and is the company’s biggest revenue growth since 2021.Apple’s iPhone revenue also outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, coming in 13% higher than the same time last year.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was “proud” to report a “June quarter revenue record”, showing growth in its iPhone, Mac and services divisions. On an earnings call on Thursday, he said the quarterly results were “better than we expected”.Dipanjan Chatterjee, a vice-president and principal analyst for Forrester, said rising services tend to boost the company’s revenue stream. “Apple has grown accustomed to having revenue growth in this high-margin services business, which masks other areas of the business not performing as well,” Chatterjee explained .He pointed to several issues that have led to Apple’s less-than-stellar product performance of late. He said Apple has lagged on hardware innovation, causing “consumer apathy”, and its AI rollout has been glitchy. Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI product, has beenlimited to incremental featuresand rather than transformational upgrades.And it’s been more than a year since Apple announced a suite of AI upgrades to its voice assistant Siri – many of which have yet to be released.“This work [on Siri] needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s vice-president of software engineering, during the company’s developer conference in June.Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have also been a pain point for the company as the US president pushes his desire for manufacturing to boom in the US. The vast majority of Apple’s products are made in China, with about90% of iPhones assembled there, despite recent efforts to shift production elsewhere. Cook said during the company’s previous quarterly earnings call that he expected the China tariffs to add $900m to its costs this quarter.Apple has attempted to pivot, moving more of its manufacturing to other countries such as India and Vietnam. However, this week, Trump announced a rise in tariffs on India, too, up to 25% starting on 1 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added Apple was “making good progress on a more personalized Siri” and promised a release next year.Because of the external and internal pressures, Apple has seen its share price plummet this year. Once the industry leader of the “Magnificent Seven” – the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world, all American technology giants – Apple boasted the highest-performing stock and biggest market capitalization on the US stock market.Now its share price is the second-worst performing after Tesla in percentage decline among the seven. Since January, Apple’s stock has fallen roughly 15%. In after-hours trading on Thursday, though, the company saw a slight increase of2.5% in its share price.Explore more on these topicsAppleQuarterly resultsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists and political scientists say the country’s prime minister,Mark Carney, was elected on the belief that he’s the right person to be at the helm of negotiations and lead Canada through a tenuous period with their southern neighbour.His successes or failures in this arena could affect public perception – as he has characterised his government as being the most adept in the crisis around its sovereignty due to the tariffs and Donald Trump’s persistent claims that he’d like to make Canada the 51st state.“[Carney] is in a situation where he doesn’t hold all the cards and whoever we put in was going to have to figure out a way through this … [His] ability to plan is severely limited by the chaos machine that is operating south of the border,” said Dennis Pilon, the chair of the politics department at York University in Ontario.On Monday, Carney said at a news conference on Prince Edward Island that the trade negotiations are at an “intense pace” and that they are “complex”. But he projected tentative optimism, stating that the negotiations are “tough” because the government is standing up for Canadian interests.“There is a landing zone that’s possible but we have to get there. We’ll see what happens,” he told reporters.But Trump spoke of the negotiations flippantly when asked by reporters outside the White House last Friday. “We haven’t really had a lot of luck with Canada … Canada could be one where there’s just a tariff, not really a negotiation,” he said.So far, much of the talks have happened behind closed doors. There was a glimpse into what could be the dynamic between Carney and Trump when the prime minister had his first meeting with the president in the Oval Office in early May. There were positive tones in both initially offering praise for each other, but the encounterquickly grew tenseas Trump repeated his annexation claims, which were subsequently rebuffed by Carney.Since March, Trump has imposed several tariffs on Canadian goods and energy resources. There is a 25% tariff on all goods, excluding potash and energy products. But there’s separately a 10% tariff on energy resources, including potash. Additionally, there’s a further 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on autos and auto parts.At this stage, the tariffs have seemingly not delivered a significant blow to Canada’s economy, but that could change quickly. The Royal Bank of Canada noted in its June forecast that nearly 90% of Canadian goods are exempt from tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade deal that replaced Nafta in 2020 and which provides a degree of insulation.In an assessment published by the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) on Tuesday, it reported that energy exports have not been significantly affected by the tariffs, as most exports are compliant under the USMCA, and are therefore exempt from tariffs.Some of the insulation so far from tariffs could be from opening Canada up to other markets. TD said that in the past four months, Canadian businesses rapidly moved to reorient supply chains and export to non-US markets. Now about 30% of exports go outside the US – a level not seen since the pandemic, when TD notes there was disorientation in trade.But TD also warned that the negative effects of the tariffs might be beginning to emerge. It said that Canadian exports to the US are “generally underperforming” in tariff-targeted industries, particularly steel and automaking. Canada’s auto exports fell to levels not seen since late 2022, following the April imposition of tariffs. Automakers have also “slashed” production in response, it said.Andrea Lawlor, an associate professor of political science at McMaster University, said that while there haven’t been many layoffs or a complete reorientation of production lines yet, industries targeted by tariffs are preparing to do so.Lawlor also said that Carney has been prudent in his negotiation strategy so far, and right in waiting for deals to be brokered between the US and other nations, as they were this month with Japan and the EU, to help inform Canada’s strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd despite concerns aboutmarred relationships with First Nations people, pushing forward controversial infrastructure legislation and his quick scrapping of Canada’s digital services tax – which many, including top former diplomats, viewed as fawning capitulation toward Trump – the prime minister is still enjoying fairly positive polling in his term’s infancy.Abacus Data reported at the end of June that 52% of Canadians surveyed approve of the Carney government. The research firm states it shows that his post-election honeymoon period is “far from over”.Lawlor said the best outcome for Carney in the negotiations is a favourable trade deal – however, there has been signalling from Carney, in his discussion of “tough” talks so far, that Canadians may have to accept a baseline of tariffs.“Many Canadians just simply will not be satisfied if that is the outcome,” she said. But due to Carney facing limited criticism of his interactions with the Americans so far, Lawlor said she believes the prime minister will not face extreme negative blowback if he doesn’t trounce tariffs for good this week.But he will be more vulnerable if the tariffs start to place downward pressure on multiple industries, she said.As Canadians are waiting and watching for the Friday deal deadline, the real fears are around the cementing of a new world order and whether long-term business and consumer decisions need to be made in response, said Preetika Joshi, an assistant professor at McGill University in Quebec that specialises in taxation.“If you were a business owner and you knew Trump is going to be in power for only three, four years, would you necessarily make big, significant changes in your supply chain … or would you just wait it out?” she said.But given some grim messaging from those close to Carney – Canadians might be facing tough decisions. Dominic LeBlanc, the federal minister responsible for Canada-US trade, said last week there’s a lot of work ahead of them and minimised the 1 August deadline.“We’re going to continue to work toward the 1 August deadline,” said LeBlanc to reporters in Washington. “But all of these deadlines are with the understanding that we’ll take the time necessary to get the best deal,” he said.Deal or no deal, the negotiations might reveal that there isn’t a best-case scenario, said Joshi.“What we were used to before Trump, where there were very little tariffs, that reality is slightly over,” she said. “We’ll have to wait and see … but the reality is that there are going to be some tariffs.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCanadaMark CarneyDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The 2024 All-Star has 20 saves in 23 opportunities, a 3.76 ERA and 59 strikeouts this season. He’s under team control through 2029.The Padres also added JP Sears, a lefty who has a 7-9 record and 4.95 ERA this season, striking out 95 batters over 22 starts.San Diego sent the A’s a package of prospects, including highly-regarded shortstop Leo De Vries and right-handed pitchers Henry Baez, Braden Nett and Eduarniel Nunez.The Padres also acquired catcher Freddy Fermin from the Kansas City Royals in exchange for right-handers Stephen Kolek and Ryan Bergert.Astros reunite with Carlos Correa, giving club familiar veteranCorrea is returning to Houston in a deal with the Minnesota Twins, giving the franchise a boost as it tries to stay atop the AL West, according to a person with direct knowledge. The person spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the deal hadn’t been announced.Correa spent his first seven years in Houston, where he became one of the most beloved players in franchise history, helping the team to six playoff appearances, three American League pennants and its first World Series title in – a championshiptainted by a sign-stealing scandal.Correa has exclusively played shortstop in his 11-yearMLBcareer but will almost certainly move to third base with shortstop Jeremy Peña close to returning from the injured list. The Astros need help at third base with All-Star Isaac Paredes out indefinitely with a hamstring injury.The 30-year-old Correa has had a down season by his standards, batting .267 with seven homers and 31 RBIs. He’s under contract through 2028.Mets get needed boost in center field with Baltimore’s Cedric MullinsMullins give the Mets an upgrade in center field, where Tyrone Taylor was playing terrific defense but providing little offense. The 30-year-old Mullins – who was an All-Star in 2021 – is batting .229 with 15 homers, 49 RBIs and 14 stolen bases.Versatile veteran Jeff McNeil has also been getting starts in center because of his bat, but he has much more experience at second base and the corner outfield spots.The last-place Orioles received right-handers Raimon Gómez, Anthony Nunez and Chandler Marsh.Yankees add to bullpen, acquire David Bednar from PiratesLooking to fortify their bullpen for the stretch run, the Yankees agreed to acquire Bednar from Pittsburgh.New York was set to send catcher/first base prospect Rafael Flores, catcher Edgleen Perez and outfielder Brian Sanchez to the Pirates in exchange for Bednar, a person with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a review of medical information and had not been announced.The 30-year-old Bednar struggled early in the season and spent some time in the minors but has been dominant since his return. He had a streak of 23 straight appearances without allowing an earned run end in San Francisco on Monday, though he held on to pick up his 17th save.Bednar has a 2.37 ERA and 51 strikeouts in 38 innings this year. He joins a bullpen that already has Luke Weaver and Devin Williams.It was the fourth trade made by the Yankees since last Friday. They obtained third baseman Ryan McMahon from Colorado on Friday, reserve infielder Amed Rosario from Washington on Saturday and reserve outfielder Austin Slater from the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenCarlos Correa is headed back to Houston after waiving his no-trade clause.Photograph: Michael Turner/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockShane Bieber off to Blue Jays, nearing MLB returnBieber is headed to the AL East-leading Blue Jays in a deal with the rebuildingCleveland Guardians.Bieber, who is working his way back from April 2024 Tommy John surgery, has made five rehab starts. His most recent outing was Tuesday for Double-A Akron, in which he allowed one run on three hits and struck out seven in four innings. His next rehab start was scheduled for Sunday.The Guardians are getting right-hander Khal Stephen from the Blue Jays.Bieber had spent his entire career in Cleveland, including winning the AL Cy Young Award in 2020. He has a career record of 62-32 with a 3.22 ERA and 958 strikeouts in 136 games, with 134 starts since his debut in 2018.He agreed to a one-year, $14m contract last fall with a $16m player option for 2026.Phillies stay aggressive, add OF Harrison Bader in deal with TwinsThe Phillies got outfielder Harrison Bader in exchange for two minor leaguers, a person with direct knowledge of the trade told the Associated Press. The person confirmed the swap on condition of anonymity because it was pending a review of medical records.It is the team’s second deal with the Minnesota Twins in two days after landing closer Jhoan Duran.The 31-year-old Bader, a 2021 Gold Glove winner, remains a strong defender at all three outfield spots and has 12 home runs, 38 RBIs and a .778 OPS in 96 games. He also has postseason experience, playing in five playoff series with the Cardinals, Yankees and Mets with a .809 OPS and five career homers.The Phillies are sending minor league outfielder Hendry Mendez and right-hander Geremy Villoria to the Twins for Bader.Tigers pry closer Kyle Finnegan from Nationals, also add Paul Sewald, Codi HeuerAL Central-leading Detroit acquired Kyle Finnegan from Washington for two prospects, a person familiar with the deal told the Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the trade wasn’t announced.The 33-year-old Finnegan was an All-Star in 2024 but his velocity has been down this season. He has 20 saves with a 4.38 ERA in 2025.The Nats received minor league pitchers Josh Randall and RJ Sales, Detroit’s third and 10th round draft picks from 2024, respectively.The Tigers also added right-hander Paul Sewald in a deal with the Guardians and minor-league righty Codi Heuer in a trade with the Rangers.The 35-year-old Sewald is eligible to return from the injured list on Sunday after being shut down with a strained right shoulder. He is 1-1 with a 4.70 ERA in 18 games this season, averaging more than one strikeout each inning.Cubs add more pitching, trade for Andrew Kittredge from OriolesThe Cubs continued seek help on the mound, adding right-hander Andrew Kittredge from the Baltimore Orioles one day after agreeing to a deal with the Washington Nationals for righty Michael Soroka.The 35-year-old Kittredge was an All-Star in 2021 and has a 3.44 ERA over nine seasons. The reliever has a 3.45 ERA in 31 games this season. He signed a $9m, one-year deal with Baltimore last offseason that includes a $9m club option for 2026 with a $1m buyout.Other deals, notesThe Tampa Bay Rays acquired catcher Hunter Feduccia from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for right-handed pitcher Paul Gervase, catcher Ben Rortvedt and left-handed pitcher Adam Serwinowski.Baltimore put right-hander Zach Eflin on the injured list with lower back discomfort Thursday.

They have now had five cracks at building a championship roster around Joe Burrow since drafting him No 1 overall in 2020, and have fallen short all five times. Entering year six, it’s already starting to feel like Burrow is this generation’s Dan Marino or Philip Rivers, an all-time great quarterback let down by the franchise around him.After going 4-12 in Burrow’s rookie season, Cincinnati made the Super Bowl, lost, returned to the AFC title game the next season, and then lost there. Burrow missed almost all of his fourth season with an injury, but put forththe best season of his careerstatistically last year … before the Bengals surrendered it, finding novel way to give up close leads early in the season and failing to reach the playoffs despite winning five straight games to close it. In a league where 44% of teams make the postseason, it was almost impressively bad.After the unlikely Super Bowl run, the outlook in Cincinnati was rosy. In Burrow, they had the NFL’s most valuable building block: a franchise quarterback who could elevate average players into difference-makers. Behind Burrow, they had Ja’Marr Chase, one of the game’s best receivers, a young pool of offensive playmakers and a deep and talented defense. They even had the league’smost prolific young kicker– and had oodles of cap space and draft picks to build on their success.Trump wants to force the Commanders to revert to a racist name. It’s unlikely he canRead moreButchampionship windows are finite. Rather than using the Super Bowl run as a launching pad, they instead committed countless team-building sins: wasting draft picks, misallocating free-agent dollars, continuing to leave Burrow vulnerable behind a porous offensive line, and sticking with a group of coaches who have proven not to be needle-movers.This offseason, they doubled down on mistakes, retaining the core of last year’s roster and making only one significant change to their coaching staff, and retaining head coach Zac Taylor, who is now entering his sixth season alongside Burrow. No team has won its first Super Bowl with the same quarterback starting for the same coach for five years. The franchise had a chance to aggressively retool. Instead, it messed around on the margins. Now it feels increasingly like the window has shut onthisversion of Burrow’s Bengals.Maybe that’s worrying too much. Burrow is at the apex of his powers. When he has been healthy, the Bengals’ offense has been a juggernaut; they could play blindfolded and finish with one of the league’s best passing attacks; Chase and Tee Higgins, the team’s dynamic receiver duo, are nowhere near 30; they have one of the game’s best pass-rushers in Trey Hendrickson; and they’ve gone toe-to-toe with the league’s best over multiple postseasons.That’s the spin from Cincinnati, anyway. But multiple end-of-year losses can warp a team’s self-perception. They think they are closer than they truly are – especially in the AFC, where even getting to the Super Bowl requires climbing over teams quarterbacked by Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Justin Herbert, and CJ Stroud. This season, you can add Bo Nix and the Broncos, Trevor Lawrence and the Jags, andAaron Rodgers and the Steelers’ 2020 All-Pro roster to that list.View image in fullscreenJa’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins comprise one of the best wide receiver combos in the NFL.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesThe Bengals will no doubt point to their record in one-score games last season, a notoriously unreliable way to judge a team’s record. Curb the bone-headed mistakes, and a nine-win team suddenly looks like a division contender. The team’s under-the-hood figures painted them closer to a fringe contender rather than a playoff afterthought, but those figures were propped up by one player: Burrow.Everywhere else, things were a mess. The offensive line remained a sieve. The run game was a non-factor. A once-ballyhooed defense fell off a cliff. Even the special teams unit, once a calling card, fell to the bottom of the league’s standings. There has been little to suggest things will turn around this season, because so little has changed.The Bengals seem to be taking the rationalist’s view – that if they keep hammering away at the door, eventually they will break through. But the Bengals are not the only nearly men of the past half decade. They’re thinking the same thing in Buffalo … and Baltimore … and San Francisco. Compared to those other contenders, the Bengals’ offseason renovation was paltry. They failed to upgrade crucial positions and became bogged down, again, in contract disputes with their own players.This year, owner Mike Brown managed a two-for-one. “They would rather win arguments than win games.” First-round pick Shemar Stewart said during his holdout. Despite settling Stewart’s contract, the team is still inanotherstandoff with Hendrickson, who has requested a trade for the second successive offseason. Hendrickson, who led the league in sacks last season, is the team’s only difference-maker on defense. Yet the Bengals can still not come to terms with the edge-rusher on a pay increase with only one year left on his deal.The New York gunman blamed CTE. I’ve seen that pain and I know silence is deadly | RK RussellRead moreBrown is the kind of billionaire who might think that prices at Dollar General are a bit steep. He refuses to make wholesale changes to his coaching staff, wary of paying out existing contracts. He employs both the smallest coaching staff and scouting department in the league. That may sound trivial, but it adds up. Run by an old-school owner with an outdated mindset, the franchise has stuck, resolutely, to drafting players from college football’s powerhouses, refusing to mine the ground for slept-on gems in football’s outskirts. Only two of the team’s last 30 top-150 picks have played outside college football’s power-five (now power-four) conferences.In fairness, that philosophy has led the Bengals to string together deep rosters in the past, particularly during Marvin Lewis’ tenure as head coach. But the team’s recent anemic draft record has left them lagging behind other contenders – and they’ve missed opportunities to select impact players, particularly along the offensive line, due to that small-school bias.Brown’s penny-pinching has exacerbated the issues caused by their draft record. The Bengals routinely carry the lowest dead money total in the league, a tactic teams use to push cap burdens into the future to improve the roster now. The Bengals’ championship window, with this core, is this season. If ever there was an offseason to put all the chips in, this was it. Brown dipped his toe in the water, but balked at major surgery.On the coaching side, the only significant change was swapping out defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo for Al Golden, the team’s former linebackers coach. They’re banking on running the same squad back and a new coach inspiring an about-face. There is talk of “internal growth,” a neat verbal tick that typically means: “we’re unwilling to spend money, we’re capped out, or we’re unwilling to admit our draft failures”.The Bengalswereaggressive about retaining Burrow’s buddies, though. After beating the Cowboys last year, Burrow used his time at the podium to issue athinly veiled threat to his front office.Bring back my guys or else.Burrow, pointedly, did not mention Hendrickson. The Bengals acquiesced, signing Higgins to a four-year contract worth $31m a year and re-upping Chase on a deal that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the sport. The signal was clear: they’re winning or going down on Burrow’s arm. In a vacuum, those decisions made sense; both Chase and Higgins are excellent players. But in context, the deals mean that roughly 35% of the team’s salary cap this season is tied up in the quarterback and two receivers, making it tough to upgrade other areas of the roster this offseason.View image in fullscreenTrey Hendrickson has been Cincinnati’s most important defensive player.Photograph: Kareem Elgazzar/APA smartfranchise would have said no to Burrow. They would have let Higgins walk, taken the inevitable fire-storm on the chin, and reinforced their offensive line or improved their defense. The Bengals don’t needan electric second receiver to win. It’s a luxury. Burrow is good enough to turn so-so options into viable second bananas. But Cincy spent the offseason caving to Burrow’s demands. That’s great news for the fantasy crowd – not great for parade planners.In summary: The Bengals’ offseason work boiled down to re-upping household names, throwing Anarumo under a bus, and hoping recent draft misfires would kickstart their careers under new leadership.Some of that reasoning is sound. The Bengals’ defensewasa disaster under Anarumo last year. They couldn’t rush the passer. They couldn’t cover. Anarumo’s greatest strength is creating distinctive, one-off gameplans that confuse opposing quarterbacks. But the foundations of last year’s group were so shaky that no amount of schematic voodoo could cover the holes. The Bengals finished in the bottom third in the league in pressure rate, pass-rush win-rate, and defensive run efficiency. Strip Hendrickson out of those metrics, and they fall to the bottom of the pile. Even the Panthers – the 2024 Panthers! – had a more effective four-man pass-rush than the Bengals.Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers says 2025 will almost certainly be his final NFL seasonRead moreThe gameplan is to offset the pricey offensive stars by getting young or cheap players on defense. But the execution has been bungled. Cincy wound up fielding the most expensive defensive line in the league last season, pouring cash and draft picks into trying to engineer a four-man pass-rush that could complement Burrow’s bomb’s away offense. To do that, they cheaped out on the secondary. When that pass-rush fell on its face, the entire defense was exposed. Outside Hendrickson, only one player (BJ Hill) had more than 20 pressures last year. The Bears, Saints and Jets, all five-win teams, all had at least four players notch 20 pressures.Other than ticking off Henderson, the Bengals have done little to improve their pass-rush for this year. They drafted Stewart in the first round, a developmental pass-rusher who missed the early part of training camp. Their only free-agent addition was TJ Slaton, an early-down run stuffer. They allocated more resources to fixing their linebacking corps than addressing the pass-rush needs.And now, the team’s title hopes again rest on the right shoulder of their quarterback. That’s no bad thing. Burrow finished last season fourth in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. No single quarterback was morevaluableto their team last season. Last season, however, proved that won’t be enough. There isn’t another level for Burrow to ascend to. Even at his best, he couldn’t carry a lackluster roster to January by himself.This will no doubt be the millionth consecutive year the Bengals preach diversifying the offense, and the millionth consecutive year in which they run one of the league’s three most predictable offenses. Throughout Burrow’s time, they have struggled to efficiently run the ball or tie the run game to play-action. When they put the ball in Burrow’s hands in the gun, they’re effective. Everything else is a risk. The Bengals were dead last with 3.7 yards per play and 29th with a minus 18.1% DVOA from under-center formations in 2024, according to FTN. Unless Burrow is playing point guard, the Bengals struggle to move the ball. In 2025, that’s no way to build a sustainable offense.The hope is that they can squeeze one more season out of that offensive ideology while Golden patches somethingtogether on defense. If Hendrickson istraded away, the whole plan could cave in before the season even kicks off (though there is hope that won’t happen, with Hendrickson reporting to training camp on Wednesday even as he says he won’t participate fully until a deal is done)“The [championship] window is my whole career,”Burrow said last year.He is not wrong. But championship windowsareperilously short. Burrow may have more time, in Cincinnati or elsewhere. But the current Bengals corps is on to its last dance.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, the league aims to offer players equity stakes, somethingNBArules currently prohibit for active athletes.Ražnatović, a powerful figure in European basketball, posted a photo of the meeting on Instagram over the weekend. The caption, tagged in Saint-Tropez, teased: “The summer of 2025 is the perfect time to make big plans for the fall of 2026.” That photo fueled speculation about a potential team-up between James and Jokić, but sources confirmed to Front Office Sports the meeting was unrelated to the NBA.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Backers already include the Singapore government, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, SC Holdings, UBS and investors such as Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice and former Facebook executive Grady Burnett.Unlike the WNBA-adjacent Unrivaled league, which allows dual participation, Carter’s venture is expected to require full-time commitments, effectively ruling out NBA participation unless league rules change.The NBA, meanwhile, is pursuing its own expansion into Europe. Commissioner Adam Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum met with UK prime minister Keir Starmer in London last week to discuss plans for a Europe-based NBA league in partnership with Fiba. As part of that effort, the NBA announced that the Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies will play regular-season games in Berlin and London in January 2026.EuroLeague officials have pushed back against the NBA’s expansion talks. “We said to them, like we said publicly, we don’t believe that the new league is something that would help the market,” EuroLeague CEO Paulius Motiejūnas told the Athletic on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsBasketballLeBron JamesNikola JokićNBAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

When the competition gets tougher, the margin of error gets smaller.”It is his final answer in an interview that takes in everything from the “blue-collar nature of Birmingham”, which he compares with Cleveland and Cincinnati, to theChampionshiplandscape and the bubbling rivalry with Aston Villa, which he was educated on during his first visit to England’s second-biggest city after acquiring his 3.3% stake.It is a moment detailed in the opening scene of Built in Birmingham: Brady & the Blues, the Prime Video documentary series released on Friday, as he travels past a giant mural depicting Jude Bellingham and Trevor Francis. “What’s the other team here?” he asks. “Fuck them … gonna fuck them up too,” he says, smiling.Brady and Tom Wagner, the Birmingham chairman, are in bullish moods for our interview. Wagner’s mantra is “if you can’t say it, you can’t do it” and he is adamant Birmingham will return to the Premier League. But when? “The sooner the better,” he replies.“I think it would be great for the city of Birmingham to have an inner-city derby that brings fans together in a non-violent way; we don’t want it to be peaceful, we don’t want it to be violent either, but we want to allow them the joy of experiencing that great rivalry again. I love reading the comments from Villa supporters, but I think it’s beyond that. There’s so many other great clubs we would love to compete against.”The series contains colourful characters, differing generations of supporters. “We’ve had so many rebirths,” says one, Paul Collins, “but they’ve all been phantom pregnancies.”There is a potted history taking in Barry Fry urinating in all four corners of St Andrew’s to lift a curse and other amusing moments. “I fell in love with fixing businesses,” says Wagner, the co-founder of Knighthead Capital, the multibillion investment fund that acquired a controlling stake two years ago.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City chair Tom Wagner celebrates the Blues’ League One title win at St Andrew’s.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesOn their arrival at Birmingham, one-third of the ground had been condemned, there was no hot water in the men’s toilets and no heating in the executive offices. “We’re not even close to being done, and now we’re embarking on an even more ambitious feat,” Wagner says of plans to build a sports quarter on a 60-acre site with a 62,000-seat stadium, more than double the current capacity. “We want to compete at the top level of the Championship [this season].”After their final home game last season, Wagner enjoyed a mic-drop moment, telling those present: “The best part of the story is just beginning. I promise you this is not the best day we will enjoy together.”Perhaps the most surreal moment of the series is Sir David Beckham, among the VIP guests forBirmingham’s home win over Wrexhamlast September, explaining to Brady the insulting chants Birmingham fans are directing at their Welsh counterparts. What else did Beckham teach him that night?Brady laughs. “A few things that were being said … some of it I couldn’t really fully understand because there’s some thick accents that I’m not 100% educated on yet, but David’s helped me out.” Another time we see Brady mastering his pronunciation of Birmingham en route to the training ground. “I learned that pretty early on. When I first did my social media video [announcing my involvement], they said: ‘It’s Birmingham, not Birming-ham.’”View image in fullscreenBirmingham City co-owner Tom Brady (left) chats with David Beckham in the stands before the League One match against Wrexham at St Andrew’s in September 2024.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWrexham, also promoted last season, have become friendly foes. Wagner says other teams “want in” on Birmingham’s brewing competition with the Welsh club, owned by the Hollywood pair Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.“Rivalries are very important because they allow you to focus at a different level: your concentration, effort, it all becomes very maximised when you’re playing against these rivals,” Brady says. “The fundamentals of the sport [football], the tactics, are different to American football. It’s a different sport but the values are very much the same.”After that win over Wrexham, there is a snapshot into the bigger picture, a reminder that this is business after Wagner congratulates manager, Chris Davies, and his staff. “I’m going to go back upstairs, we’ve got 1,000 people we’re trying to get to spend money in the club so that you guys can spend more next summer,” says Wagner, a former certified public accountant on Wall Street.One of his primary aims is building revenues to close the gap to clubs awarded parachute payments. Asked whether the numbers are where he expected this summer, Wagner says they have smashed this season’s original target. “My team loves it when they achieve a goal and I say: ‘Well, now it’s 10% higher’,” he says.

That’s the way we think about the club and that’s what our objectives are aimed towards – not just getting to the Prem, but then being there for good, and then ultimately becoming competitive.”View image in fullscreenBirmingham City’s manager Chris Davies speaks to his players in the dressing room.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoBirmingham are looking forward but the appointment of Wayne Rooney backfired. The first episode touches on Rooney’s tenure: two wins in 15 matches and 83 days in charge, a run that paved the way to relegation. Wagner says now he “wouldn’t trade that history for the world, because the lessons were invaluable”. We see an awkward, small talk exchange between Brady and Rooney and, later, with Brady stewing in the car after leaving the training ground, comes a telling remark. “I’m a little bit worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” Brady says.Rooney was sacked in January 2024 and Brady is reluctant to linger on the past: “I have very high expectations for myself and certainly for a club and people I associate with, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Wayne. He’s one of the greatest players to step on to a football pitch. And that was a couple of years ago, at this point Chris is our manager … I love Chris’s work ethic, attitude, determination and humility.”On deadline day last summer, Birmingham made a splash after signing Jay Stansfield for a record-breaking £15m fee from Fulham. Episode three focuses on the England Under-21 striker’s return toExeter City, for whom his late father, Adam, also played. We hear from Taylor, one of Stansfield’s younger brothers, who joined Birmingham as kit man during Stansfield’s loan at the club, and their mother, Marie. “As a footballer, he is just like his dad … he even runs like his dad,” she says. “They both run with their pinky finger out,” Taylor says, smiling. Marie is in the stand opposite the one renamed after Adam, which Stansfield blows a kiss towards after scoring a penalty.Birmingham have been aggressive in the market this summer, too, with the returning Demarai Gray and the former Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi two of eight signings. More new faces are expected to follow. So, how does Wagner reflect on his time as chair? “I think the biggest metric for us is the increased amount of interest that we have in the club from new and existing supporters, where we’re now enjoying record levels of season-ticket sales,” he says of the 20,000 signed up this season and referencing the 15,000-strong season-ticket waiting list, a first for the club.View image in fullscreenJay Stansfield surges forward at a rainy St James Park in November 2024.Photograph: Izzy Ninnis/ShutterstockIt is apt that Birmingham host Ipswich, the last team to win back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, in the Championship curtain-raiser a week on Friday.The final episode takes in one of few hiccups under Knighthead: defeat in the Vertu Trophy final at Wembley in April. “I don’t like losing,” says Wagner. “I’ll back that up,” says Brady. “We sold 50,000 tickets and when the last ticket sold, there were 23,000 people on the phone waiting to purchase tickets,” Wagner adds.“Whatever we’re doing seems to be resonating with people, in that they want to be a part of the journey. We knew it was a big club with a lot of supporters but I don’t think we appreciated how many live and die with us on match day.”Explore more on these topicsBirmingham CityChampionshipUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Accordingly, he has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.”The allegations stem from a recent documentary made by ARD in Germany, which made claims linking Rozman to Schmidt but did not name him, with further media reports including alleged texts between the Ineos staff member and Schmidt from June 2012, when the team were racing as Team Sky.The documentary and subsequent reports were said to have drawn on court transcripts and in-court reporting during the Aderlass hearings, which resulted in Schmidt being jailed in 2021 for orchestrating a doping ring revolving around cross-country skiers and multiple cyclists between 2012 and 2019.Dave Brailsford, the head of Ineos Sport, whoreturned to the Tour de Francethis July after his sojourn at Manchester United, declined to comment on the Rozman allegations during the race. Brailsford was a leading figure in directing performance at Old Trafford.Also seconded to Carrington, United’s training ground, during refurbishment of their laundry facilities, was an Ineos Grenadiers team bus for use by kit staff at Old Trafford.BritishCyclinghas confirmed that Rozman was also present, working for Team GB, at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympic Games.His spell at Manchester United pre-dates the ARD documentary or any contact with the ITA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is due to the FA integrity department’s decision, after an investigation than began in August 2023, that apparently unusual betting patterns surrounding four yellow cards for the 27-year-old were sufficient to charge him with spot-fixing. West Ham also lost a huge transfer fee, so it is little wonder they are considering legal action against the FA and will certainly push hard for the governing body to cover costs estimated at around £1m for the player and club.West Ham are angry that the case has taken so long to conclude. With two years left on his contract, Paquetá retains value, but given many Premier League clubs have profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) issues, and there are only four weeks left in the transfer window, selling him this summer will be challenging, even though he has been cleared.The FA’s investigators were hindered by difficulties in obtaining evidence from Brazil, and it took nine months of digging before charges were issued in May 2024. But the case has been beset by delays throughout. After Paquetá was charged West Ham lobbied for the hearing to be expedited. It did not begin until March this year and was adjourned, finally concluding at the beginning of June. West Ham have consequently faced uncertainty over Paquetá’s position for three summer transfer windows, while the player has been in turmoil, particularly after learning that the FA was pushing for a life ban.Several staff members at West Ham have told the Guardian that Paquetá’s demeanour has barely altered at the training ground over the last two years despite the severity of the charges, although a source who knows him personally said the case has taken its toll. That was clear when he burst into tears after being booked in a Premier League game against Tottenham in May, which led to his wife, Maria Fournier, writing on Instagram that the family had “been living this nightmare for two years”.The high stakes for Paquetá contrast with the modest amounts wagered in the allegedly corrupt bets. Around 60 bets were placed on Paquetá to be shown a yellow card in four Premier League games in 2022 and 2023, with the claim being that he was deliberately booked to make money for family and friends. A source with knowledge of the FA’s investigation said one of the bets was for £7, with the highest £400.View image in fullscreenLucas Paquetá in action against Liverpool last year. The charges against the Brazilian caused him to miss out on a £85m move to Manchester City.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersWhile Paquetá’s problems began with the Soumaré yellow card, it was subsequent bookings against Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth in 2023 that led to the investigation. The fouls in each case were a lunge at John McGinn, pulling Crysencio Summerville’s shirt and a handball in an aerial challenge, offences that his legal team argued were symptomatic of his carelessness, rather than being deliberate.The initial investigation into Paquetá’s behaviour was conducted by the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), which received an integrity alert after several bookmakers in Brazil reported an unusual number of bets on Paquetá to be booked during the Villa game on 12 March 2023. The majority of the suspicious bets were traced to Paquetá Island, an idyllic, 0.5sq mile beach paradise off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, where Paquetá was born and from which he takes his name. Ironically, most of the money staked on Paquetá to be booked used accounts with Betway, which at the time was West Ham’s shirt sponsor. The concern of integrity officials was heightened by the fact most of the money came from new accounts.The FA’s investigation was triggered by the booking Paquetá received at Bournemouth in West Ham’s opening game of the following season, the fourth foul he had conceded that afternoon. The referee Peter Bankes’s report noted that he had booked Paquetá for “persistent infringement”, which along with the number of bets placed on him to be cautioned was enough to trigger a formal inquiry.Slot says Liverpool will target quality players amid links to Alexander IsakRead moreMuch of Paquetá’s defence is believed to have centred on his claim that he asked the then West Ham manager, David Moyes, not to play him at Bournemouth for fear of jeopardising the City move, which they argue demonstrated his booking could not have been premeditated. Moyes is understood to have supported this version of events, and given evidence to the independent commission on Paquetá’s behalf.Paquetá’s lead counsel, Nick De Marco KC, is also understood to have produced betting data showing that Paquetá frequently attracts a statistically unusual volume of bets to be booked, which they attribute to his poor disciplinary record. Paquetá’s legal team also showed the panel Paquetá’s entire disciplinary history, arguing that he has consistently conceded more free-kicks than his teammates throughout his career, which they argued increased the chances of him being booked.The publication of the independent commission’s written reasons, which are not expected for a number of weeks, will reveal more about a fascinating case, and may make awkward reading for the FA.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old spent one season with the Frauen Bundesliga side after playing for Brighton for two campaigns in England. She is also a former title-winner in Sweden with Häcken.Her arrival will give Marc Skinner’s team additional options in central midfield and, with Zigiotti Olme predominantly playing as a deeper lying, defensive midfielder, could allow Dominique Janssen to be deployed as a central defender instead. Janssen demonstrated the versatility to play in either defence or midfield last season. It could also give the side more tactical options for different formations and will undoubtedly boost their strength in depth to compete in the Women’s Champions League as well as domestically.Discussing the arrival of Zigiotti Olme, who has signed a two-year contract, with the option of a further year, Matt Johnson, Manchester United’s director of women’s football, told the club’s media channels: “Julia is one of Europe’s best defensive midfielders who brings a winning mentality and experience of competing in the top competitions.“On the pitch she has an insatiable work rate, ability to win possession back for her team and creative passing range. This is a player the fans will enjoy watching this season.”View image in fullscreenJulia Zigiotti Olme did well for Sweden against England in the Euro 2025 quarter-final, and was one of their two successful penalty takers.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockWhile she is the club’s first summer acquisition, she is unlikely to be the last. It is understood the club could also be seeking to sign a forward, following Geyse’s loan move to Gotham FC in March for the remainder of the NWSL season, as well as being expected to be in the market for a right-sided defender, following Aoife Mannion’s summer move to Newcastle United.New contracts have already been agreed with the goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, the central defender Millie Turner and veteran striker Rachel Williams, but it would not be a surprise to see the club sign another goalscorer before their Champions League qualifying campaign gets under way against PSV Eindhoven on 27 August.Meanwhile, United’s Ella Toone has revealed her grandmother died on the morning of England’s Euro 2025 final victory over Spain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningThu 31 Jul 2025 11.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 12.39 EDTShareA FAMILIAR OPTIMISMWhen the white smoke billowed from the Ibrox chimney in June andRussell Martin was revealed as the new manager of Rangers, vast swathes of the club’s fans could scarcely have been more unenthusiastic. Indeed, short of announcing that Pope Leo XV had left his new role at the Vatican and would be taking over after Barry Ferguson’s lengthy spell in caretaker charge, it is difficult to imagine any other appointment prompting more fury. “We’re not oblivious to the noise at all,” harrumphed the Rangers CEO, Patrick Stewart, upon being quizzed about fan reaction to his announcement. “But I think we are confident because we’ve embarked on such a thorough process to take us to this point where we’ve appointed Russell that we’re confident supporters will get behind him.”Having paddled into Ibrox on such a tidal wave of antipathy, it seemed imperative that Martin got off to a good start and the man who masterminded just one win in Southampton’s opening 16 Premier League games last season before being booted towards the Saints door marked ‘Do one!’ has done exactly that. In closing out their aggregate win in aBigger Cup second qualifying round against Panathinaikos, Russell’s Rangers have successfully negotiated the first hurdle of the season and now face Czech side Viktoria Plzen as they aim to reach the Bigger Cup league phase. But at the very least, last night’s draw in Greece means a place in Euro Vase is now guaranteed. “I’ve just said to the players in the dressing room, I’m so proud of them,” said Martin, after new signing Djeidi Gassama struck back to restore parity after Panathinaikos had opened the scoring. “To be five weeks into the process, from where they were to where they are is incredible.”With European football now guaranteed until January and the possibility of Bigger Cup group stage participation still very much alive, Martin has presumably bought himself some time from his many vocal detractors among theRangersfanbase but now is no time for complacency. With the fitba league season due to start this weekend and his players fresh from walking their hand luggage out from the back of their plane from Athens, they will have to prove they can do it on wet and windy nights (or as they are known in Scotland: ‘nights’ ) in places like Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Paisley if they are to mount any sort of meaningful title challenge against Celtic. It was at exactly such places that Rangers came a cropper last season, leading to the 17-point chasm that separated the two Glasgow clubs at the end of the campaign. While Martin may have earned some grudging goodwill from the Ibrox faithful for his early efforts thus far, expect it to evaporate if his new-look side fail to win Saturday’s league opener at Motherwell and hand the advantage, if not the title to Celtic before Brendan Rodgers’ side have even played a game.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations. I can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face.

They will almost certainly have to break the British transfer record to get their man.“I always say, another thing about Liverpool is that if we see a chance in the market we never hesitate to bring someone in,” said Slot as Liverpool left Japan after their pre-season tour of the far east. “It’s about quality and we have already made some very good signings.”This summer Liverpool have brought in Florian Wirtz andJeremie Frimpongfrom Bayer Leverkusen,the former for a club-record £100m, as well asMilos Kerkezfrom Bournemouth,Hugo Ekitikéfrom Eintracht Frankfurt and the goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia.“It’s the way this club has worked over several years: targeting a specific player who we think can strengthen the squad and can bring us quality,” said Slot. “Then we try to bring him in. “We do spend, but if we spend, then we always need to recoup some money.”Díaz’s move to Germany means Liverpool have raised more than £190m from player sales since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June 2024.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolTransfer windowArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

In a previous life, the club listed Sammy McIlroy, Paul Ince and Sol Campbell as former managers. Since their rebirth in 2020, the former Premier League players Neil Danns, Alex Bruce and, most notably, Robbie Savage, have enjoyed spells in the hot seat.John Rooney’s surname is unlikely to go unnoticed, yet the younger brother of the England and Manchester United legend Wayne is, by his own admission, a far less glitzy appointment than his predecessor Savage, whose effervescent character came to define Macclesfield in recent years.New signings are in line to be saviours – even if we don’t know who they are | Max RushdenRead moreA self-styled Marmite man, Savage enjoyed unparalleled success in his season-long stint at Macclesfield, winning the Northern Premier League with a mammoth 109 points.His departure to Forest Greenearlier this summer left a void, with key players such as Laurent Mendy, Tre Pemberton and Neil Kengni following him to Gloucestershire.Pictures of Savage still adorn the walls behind Rooney as we chat in the boardroom of the Leasing.com Stadium, days out from Macclesfield’s opening game of the new National League North campaign against Worksop Town. “I’ll be different to Sav,” says Rooney, an attacking midfielder who rejoined Macclesfield as a player in August 2023 following stints at clubs such as New York Red Bulls, Orlando City, Barrow and Oldham before announcing his retirement at the end of last season. “He has always been out there as a player and a pundit. He likes attention – not in a bad sense. I’ll go under the radar and be my own person. I’d be stupid to act like Sav, because I’m a different person and I’d be being false.”View image in fullscreenJohn Rooney (left) celebrates with Corey Hertzog (centre) and Juan Agudelo after scoring the winning goal in New York Red Bull’s US Open Cup third round match against FC New York in June 2011.Photograph: Mike Stobe/Getty ImagesThere’s no doubt Savage’s exit has been seismic, but it took just days for Macclesfield to replace him with Rooney. Plans had already been in place for the 34-year-old to take up a coaching role if a vacancy arose. “It happened so quick with Sav going, so we didn’t have time to sit back and think about it,” Rooney says. “Rob [Smethurst, the club’s owner] told me on the Monday and we were training on the Tuesday.”Rooney had little hesitation accepting the role and there was even a word of advice from his brother, whose own tumultuous managerial journey in the past few years may provide a lesson for John. “When I got the job, [Wayne] said: ‘Just try and enjoy it’. Obviously he went into management and did well at some places, not so well at other places. And listen, that’s football. It’s part of management. you’re not going to get your own way all the time.”“When do these opportunities come up to be a manager of a club like this? Not often,” Rooney adds. “It might not come again. So once I got wind of it, I wanted to take it with both hands. You could be falling out of the game as a player, then you’re scratching around to come back in as a coach. I spoke about it last year with Sav, that if he ever left, would I be interested? I always said I’d want to throw myself right at it.”View image in fullscreenRobbie Savage guided Macclesfield to promotion to the National League North.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianRooney, whose playing days began in the Everton academy like his brother, made his professional debut with Macclesfield in 2008. He’s now a novice manager but with experience by his side to call upon. Macclesfield have just appointed Francis Jeffers, another ex-Everton player, as Rooney’s assistant. “I’ve known Franny for a long time. I played under him as a coach at Oldham. He’s coached at Ipswich, out in Saudi. I wanted someone older than me who would challenge me, not just agree with everything I say. I’d be naive otherwise.” Rooney laughs off the idea of offering a job to a certain other former Everton striker. He’s keen to be his own man.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They gave me my chance in professional football and I’ll never forget thatIt’s put to Rooney that he is still registered as a player for the coming season, so could mirror the player-manager role in which Wayne thrived at Derby early in his own managerial career. “Touch wood I’m not needed,” he replies. “It’s been a pretty smooth transition to managing. It’s now my third spell here; two as a player and now as manager. Everyone knows what this club means to me. I started here, they gave me my chance in professional football and I’ll never forget that.”Rooney takes the reins at an intriguing stage in the Silkmen’s journey. They have blazed a trail through the divisions, with three promotions in four years, and now face their most challenging task in the National League North. “It’s going to be a lot tougher than last year,” admits Rooney, with a nod to the fellow phoenix clubs Hereford, Chester and Darlington who are on this season’s fixture list. “Come December, January, away from home, the pitches won’t be great, it’s about being adaptable.“Last year we got on that winning streak and winning is a habit. We need to roll that on to this season. There are some big teams in this league, five or six clubs that are full time and that’s our goal as well, we want to get to the full-time stage.”Will Macclesfield hit a glass ceiling at some point soon? Rooney will not countenance the idea. “We want to finish as high as possible. Our plan is to carry on.”Explore more on these topicsMacclesfieldinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There is a growing feeling that, even with two more teams joining the elite next year, Salford’s position is increasingly untenable as they remain riddled by financial problems.Sport England to meet RFL over concerns with rugby league funding at stakeRead moreHaving been forced to request an advance on their central distribution on the eve of the season, a takeover in February was hoped to be the cure for their long-term ills. But 20 rounds into the season, Salford remain under salary-cap constraints, have had to sell players to make ends meet and are still in deep financial trouble.A multimillion-pound bridging loan that has long been promised by the owners has not arrived. Salford’s young players that are left are being forced to turn out every week when they are not ready for Super League, and the results are ones like these. This win for Hull KR, their biggest as a top-flight club, was a mismatch from the first minute.There is no blame attached to Salford’s young squad, who continue to apply themselves superbly in the face of such adversity, their coaching staff or those on the terraces who are passionately backing this group until the end of the season and will continue to do so whatever may come after that. It may well be life in the Championship.The blame lies with Salford’s ownership, and there is no doubting the uncertainty that has lasted so deep into the season is causing reputational damage to the club, but also to Super League. It was a point not lost on the Hull KR coach, Willie Peters.He said: “I’m not sure what to feel because the situation Salford are in is not good. I feel for [Salford coach] Paul Rowley, the players and the fans who are turning up every week. Some people have got to be held accountable because it’s embarrassing for our game over here. It does not help anyone.”Having watched his side concede 14 tries, Rowley appeared emotionally drained. He said: “I’m not sure what the emotion is. I’m bored of it, I’m sick of it. We just want to compete. It’s not what we want to see. We’re sad at the situation and we’re sad for the sport because we don’t want to be in this position.”View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Mikey Lewis was at his brilliant best against Salford on Thursday night.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PASome Super League coaches have expressed concerns there are not enough players to support 14 elite teams and while Salford have their own problems that contributed to this score, this will have done little to assuage those fears.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They scored points at will here to underline the gulf between these two sides. The reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, provided an incredible eight try assists and scored one of his own, with Rovers 14-0 up after ten minutes and 34-6 ahead by the break.Any suggestion they would ease up in a show of mercy for a young Salford side was unfounded. Lewis continued to torment the Red Devils after the break, with Joe Burgess crossing for four tries in total and Peters’ men picking up their biggest ever victory as a Super League club.Their bigger challenges lie ahead, specifically the defending champions Wigan in a fortnight. As for Salford, it is unclear how much longer they will be a Super League club for but their challenges are the same as the competition itself: minimising reputational damage and convincing the public better times lie ahead.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSalford Red DevilsHull KRRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Woad may well be the name on everyone’s lips but, on day two, she will barely feature on anybody’s screens.Perhaps it is a sign of this major’s rapid growth that everyone wants more. Nonetheless, fans will find it unsatisfactory that, with daily television coverage beginning at noon, Woad – plus Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko – will play the vast majority of her second round minus the eyeballs of anyone not in attendance at Royal Porthcawl. This is now a recurring theme after Leona Maguire took to social media to point out her hole in one at the recent Evian Championship was not caught on camera. Woad begins day two at 8.09am, with Ko for company and Korda two groups behind.Golf’s elite hail Lottie Woad as ‘breath of fresh air’ before Open challengeRead moreSky Sports, which screens the Women’s Open in the UK, has a partnership with the R&A which it understandably will not compromise by criticising this tournament’s officials. Insiders at the broadcaster insist they would be keen on extended live hours from next year. For that to happen, the R&A would need to bestow significant funds on European Tour Productions, which provides a world feed for television companies to use. At Porthcawl, that coverage begins at 12 o’clock. The R&A did increase the prize fund for 2025 by $250,000 (£190,000) and player facilities are a notable upgrade on the vast majority of women’s golf events; but what of seeing it to be it? The men’s Open coverage at Royal Portrush two weeks ago began at 6.30am on Thursday and Friday.In the toughest of Thursday’s conditions Woad signed for a level-par 72. The highlight of the 21-year-old’s day was a birdie putt from off the green at the 6th. Another birdie, at the last, ensured she sits five from the lead. “It was OK, a bit mixed,” Woad said. “It was one of those rounds that could definitely have got away from me so I am happy with the way I hung in there.”Mimi Rhodes has won three times on this year’s Ladies European Tour, a matter that has been somewhat lost in fevered excitement over Woad. Rhodes served the latest notice of her ability with a 69 and can be added to the Friday morning blackout list.Ko’s title defence began with a one-over-par 73. The New Zealander was harmed by a birdie-free back nine of 38. Korda’s 70 felt notable. The world No 1 tied second in this event last year. Wales’s Darcey Harry and the Australian Minjee Lee were among those to match Korda’s score.View image in fullscreenJapan’s Rio Takeda holds a share of the lead after day one.Photograph: Nigel French/PAJapanese golfers otherwise dominate the early leaderboard.

A decade ago, Dunne led the Open Championship at St Andrews before injury and loss of form took hold. “That’s more a question for him I think,” said Hall when asked if Dunne will return to competitive golf. “Obviously right now he’s not playing and he’s just kind of supporting me, which I am very grateful for. He’s a very good player. He doesn’t give himself enough credit.

The 36-year-old was scheduled to have a scan on Thursday evening, with his ability to take an active part in the remainder of the game to be assessed overnight.Woakes, the only English bowler considered fit enough to play all five games of a gruelling series, was clearly in considerable pain after landing awkwardly while attempting to keep the ball away from the boundary in the 60th over of a rain-affected day. After treatment on the field he was led to the dressing room with his arm cradled in a makeshift sling.Gus Atkinson throws down gauntlet to India before England’s Woakes blowRead more“It doesn’t look great,” said Gus Atkinson, who was the pick of England’s bowlers on his return to the team. “It’s a big shame, in the last game of the series. I’m hoping it’s not too bad and whatever it is he’ll get full support from everyone.”Atkinson, who since injuring a hamstring in May has played one club game and once for Surrey’s second XI, said he was confident he could help the team’s remaining seamers cover for Woakes if the scan brings bad news. “I feel fresh, I feel good,” he said. “I know I’ve only got this one game to play, so I can push the limits a bit.”Assisted by some wayward bowling, if not by a green-tinged pitch, several rain breaks and consistently threatening overhead conditions, India reached stumps on 204 for six, with Karun Nair unbeaten on 52 as he seeks to give a previously personally disappointing tour an ending brighter than the skies he was playing under.“You look at the pitch, you look at the overheads and you think this should be easy for the bowlers, but it’s a ground where if you don’t bowl well you can go for a lot of runs,” said Atkinson. “It can be a tough ground to bowl on because of the way the ball moves – sometimes off the pitch, and it can swing a lot after it’s pitched. And the footholes weren’t easy. It was slippy out there and that can obviously affect the bowling.”Ryan ten Doeschate, India’s assistant coach, defended the decision not to play the team’s star bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, in conditions that appear ideal for him and after their captain, Shubman Gill, had indicated on Wednesday that he remained under consideration.View image in fullscreenGus Atkinson says he can ‘push the limits’ a bit more in his only Test appearance of the series.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock“It’s quite a complex issue. We want to wheel him out but we also want to respect where his body’s at,” the Dutchman said. “He’s bowled a large number of overs.

With hindsight we’d love to have him here. Maybe England have got it spot on, leaving the best bowling wicket for the last Test after he’s played three. For a tour of England you’d expect conditions closer to this than what we’ve seen in the first four Tests.”England’s task was eased by a calamitous decision by Gill, the leading run-scorer in the series, to attempt a run after nudging the ball into Atkinson’s path as the bowler completed his follow-through and having scored only 21. “He’s in the touch of his life. Again today he made batting look really easy,” Ten Doeschate said. “But these mistakes do happen, and that’s a misjudgement of a run.

Or at least, welcome to the England their batters might have expected when touching down at the start of June. Cloud cover, stoppages for rain, and seamers operating on a green-tinged surface — the opening day at the Oval was certainly a far cry from what came before.And yet by the time stumps came at 7.30pm the tourists had scrapped their way to a serviceable 204 for six from 64 overs and it was England who were feeling a bit glum. Though the hosts went into this series decider 2-1 up, a late injury to Chris Woakes took the shine off a day that, until that point, had been all about Gus Atkinson’s stellar return on his home ground.‘A big shame’: Chris Woakes could miss rest of fifth Test with shoulder injuryRead moreFigures of two for 31 from 19 overs did not tell the full story of Atkinson’s day either. Arguably the most important strike witnessed came not from his brand of waspish fast-medium but a sparkling run out of Shubman Gill for 21 in a six-over mini-session between the afternoon showers. Given the glowing form India’s captain has been in this series, it felt like a defining moment.It was a hugely self-inflicted dismissal too, Gill having dropped Atkinson into the off side with a defensive prod and set off for a single that was simply never on. Turning on his heels but already in trouble, he could only look on as Atkinson swooped in, took aim, and threw down the stumps with unerring precision. The look of anguish on Gill’s face as he walked off was palpable.But Gill’s despair was later trumped by that of Woakes and what may also be greater by way of significance. The only English seamer to push through all five Tests, Woakes had chased a ball to the rope only to fall awkwardly in the process. A dislocated left shoulder appears the likely upshot here, the 36-year-old walking off in agonywith his arm in a makeshift sling.Standing in for the injured captain Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope now faces the prospect of juggling three seamers for the remainder of the match, and only the part time spin of Jacob Bethell and Joe Root offering scope for a breather. And though Atkinson impressed, pinning Yashasvi Jaiswal lbw for two and getting Dhruv Jurel caught in the cordon for 19, Pope will need Josh Tongue and Jamie ­Overton to offer more than they did on day one.Because as much as England were happy to claim six wickets, there is a case to say that it should have been more. Lee Fortis, chief groundsman andscourge of the touristsin the build-up, had left 8mm of grass on the Oval pitch – ideal conditions to lock in on a length and let the Dukes do its thing. And yet this was something the support cast struggled to achieve at times.View image in fullscreenChris Woakes lands heavily on his shoulder after chasing a ball at the boundary.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersIn the case of the fast but often wayward Tongue, perhaps this is missing the point. England like the point of difference he offers and, while he sprayed wides for fun in the morning, his best remains very good indeed. His two wickets on the day, Sai Sudharsan for 38 and Ravindra Jadeja for nine, were both a case of rip-snorting deliveries being edged behind.Overton, however, looks a curious selection on a surface that might be better suited to Matthew Potts or Sam Cook. While his speeds picked up from some initial 80mph long hops, and swing was harnessed, figures of nought for 66 were the weak link in the attack – a link that must be strengthened swiftly if Woakes spends the remainder of the match on the sidelines.Atkinson, back from a hamstring injury, appears to have picked up where he left off at least. His removal of Jaiswal was also a notable feat for his Surrey teammate, Pope, who sent a decision upstairs for the 14th time as a stand-in captain and finally saw one go his way. Going by the celebrations – Pope beaming, wry smiles in the dressing room – everyone was fully aware.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Replacing Atkinson from the Pavilion End after a tight six-over opening spell, Woakes persuaded Rahul to chop on to his stumps with a bit of nip – even if it was always too tight to cut.In the end, with Gill having lost his fifth toss in a row, India were grateful to another experienced campaigner for steering them out of choppy waters. Recalled after his omission at Old Trafford, Karun Nair turned things around from 153 for six at the fall of Jurel’s wicket with a classy unbeaten 52 from 98 balls. Support here came from Washington Sundar, who made 19 not out.England know all about Sundar, of course, but open up an end first thing and India’s tail will begin. Problem is, even with the forecast in London set to improve and batting conditions with it, taking 10 wickets second time around will be a significant challenge if the fears about poor Woakes are accurate.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

A jury last November ordered McGregor to pay her nearly €250,000 (£216,000) in damages.McGregor, 36, denied the allegation and said he had “fully consensual sex” with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff.In the appeal heard earlier this month, lawyers for McGregor said the judge erred in directing the jury to decide whether he “assaulted” rather than “sexually assaulted” the victim.Judge Brian O’Moore said on Thursday that the appeal court had no doubt the overall effect of the trial judge’s charge was to tell them the central allegation by Hand against McGregor was that he had raped her.McGregor’s legal team had also argued that the judge should not have allowed a line of questioning during cross-examination regarding McGregor’s “no comment” responses in a police interview. That ground was also rejected.Hand said in a statement outside the court: “To every survivor out there, I know how hard it is but please don’t be silenced … You deserve to be heard, you also deserve justice. Today, I can finally move on and try to heal.”Hand told the high court in November that she and a friend had made contact with McGregor, whom she knew, after a work Christmas party. She said they were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed.She said McGregor, who was not in court on Thursday, took her to a bedroom in the penthouse and sexually assaulted her.Hand’s lawyer told the jury that when she was referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, a doctor was so concerned that he directed that photographs be taken of her injuries.Explore more on these topicsConor McGregorIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But the character was revolutionaryDave SchillingHogan was a master of wrestling’s unreality, personifying the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be youThu 31 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.16 EDTShareWhen Hulk Hogan died and a rush of people searched his name on Google to read various obituaries, I’m sure at least some of them were shocked to find that one of the most popular search terms related to the WWE Hall of Famer is “Hulk Hogan lies”. There are countlessvideos,Reddit threads,social media postsand articles detailing all the things the Hulkster apparently said that were either exaggerations, distortions or outright fabrications. One time, Hogan said he was asked to play in Metallica. The banddenied the storystraight away. Hulk said in his autobiography that he partied with John Belushi after WrestleMania 2 in 1986, even though Belushi had died in 1982. There’s also the time where Hulk thought the Jackass star Bam Margera was deadwhen he very much was not.If you aren’t a wrestling fan (you’re reading the Guardian. You’re probably not a wrestling fan) you might wonder why someone who was famous for four decades would feel the need to lie about whether he could have been in Metallica. These are the sorts of lies the quarterback of your high school tells at the reunion. “Andre the Giant was 700lb when I bodyslammed him in from of 200,000 people at the Roman Colosseum” is definitely an anecdote that could get you a free shot at the no-host bar at the Elks Lodge, but if you’re Hulk Hogan, you could just be honest and say Andre was more like 400lb and the crowd was between 80,000 and 93,000, depending on whom you ask. Also, it was in Pontiac, Michigan, not Rome. Hulk Hogan did not need to lie, but he did. Often.Lying, fabrication and multiple layers of reality are fundamental tenets of professional wrestling at every level of the industry. In 2019, I worked at WWE as a writer for their TV show SmackDown just long enough to get fired. I wasn’t there for enough time to actually get good at the art of crafting a compelling wrestling story, but I was there long enough to realize that the most crucial element of wrestling is some form of dishonesty. The performer’s job is to approximate reality, to portray their character not just on TV, but on social media, in the press, and sometimes even at the airport. Wrestling is performance art on an entirely different level. Terry Bollea had to live his life as Hulk Hogan – the bandanna, the tank tops, the white moustache. In his now-infamous reality show, Hogan Knows Best, despite the conceit of seeing inside Hulk’s real home, he was still that character. Terry Bollea was so committed to being Hulk Hogan that he had aformal bandanna for black tie events. No one would be mad if he wore, say, a Kangol hat or maybe … no hat at all? When Hogantestified in the Gawker trial,it was shocking to hear him refer to “Terry Bollea” and “Hulk Hogan” as two different people.The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosityIn the pro wrestling parlance, this veil of fiction is called “kayfabe” – a word with its origin in the old-timey carnival culture that wrestling evolved from. Kayfabe is both a noun to describe the glorious unreality of wrestling and a verb to describe when someone is subtly lying to you (or hiding something incredibly important). In WWE, there are layers of kayfabe, with fewer and fewer people smartened up to what’s happening the deeper you go. The outcomes of the matches are kayfabed. Who is wrestling in the main event of WrestleMania 42 next spring is super kayfabed. This doesn’t seem that terribly different from protecting the ending of a summer blockbuster film, but when you’re inside the business, you realize thateverythingcan be kayfabed. How can you trust anything anyone says? WWE just launched a reality show on Netflix calledUnreal, which claims to lift the veil on the behind-the-scenes creation of their storylines. I immediately said to myself: “This is just another layer of kayfabe.” The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosity. This is the world Hulk Hogan lived in.I still love wrestling, and despite thehorrible things he said and did, I still see Hulk Hogan the character as one of the most influential heroes in American history. He managed to make the most mundane, thunderingly obvious credo (“say your prayers and eat your vitamins, kids!”) sound revolutionary. He knew how to captivate an audience with nothing more than a gesture. He understood the art of platonic seduction – the way to get someone to not just love you, but to think that their struggle is also yours. Wrestling fans – both children and adults – could live vicariously through Hulk Hogan. His appeals in his speeches were to his “Hulkamaniacs”, the fans that gave him the strength to do the impossible. At WrestleMania 3, if Andre the Giant wanted to beat Hulk Hogan for the WWE Championship, he’d also have tocontend with the millions of Hulkamaniacs cheering for him. In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel foryouto travel in.If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is.One of Hulk Hogan’s last televised appearances was at theRepublican national convention in 2024. He tore a Trump T-shirt off his body instead of a Hulkamania shirt and pledged his full fealty to our future president. In some twisted way, it was a passing of the torch. For years, Hulk Hogan had been the apex of wrestling’s art of unreality. His talent for leading the masses peaked around 1988, and as the world got more savvy about WWE’s particular magic trick, the connection severed. He left for a rival company, became a bad guy, and reinvented the art form again. But it could never be quite what it was in the mid-80s. Wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and John Cena could captivate a crowd, but it was nothing like Hulkamania. No one would or could ever truly believe like that again. This is why WWE has to open up (or at least pretend to), like the Soviet Union at the end of the cold war.After years of sitting under the learning tree of WWE’s former owner, Vince McMahon,Donald Trumptook the tools of platonic seduction that Hulk Hogan perfected and applied them to politics. The use of the word “we”, the commonality of struggle, the dastardly enemies to defeat in righteous combat. Even the empty slogans. Is “make America great again” that far removed from “say your prayers and eat your vitamins”?In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel for you to travel inWhen Hulk Hogan exaggerated a story or outright lied, he’d very rarely retract his statement. When he was allowed back in the WWE locker room after tape of his racist tirade circulated publicly, he spentmost of his apologywarning fellow wrestlers to be careful about “getting caught”. Hulk Hogan was a man who made his own truth. He didn’t need to do anything other than live in the world he made for himself. The more he made up about himself, the grander he became. He was truly the greatest American hero, because he personified the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be you. And the more he fashioned himself a superhero, the more we wanted to be him – to fully merge with him into one entity. This power was both awe-inspiring and perhaps the most terrifying weapon any human being could wield in this life.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWrestlingOpinionUS televisionTelevisionUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

With schools now allowed to pay players directly under terms of the industry-changing House settlement, the role of collectives was thrown into limbo.Trump signs executive order to rein in ‘chaotic’ influence of money on college sportsRead moreThe CSC, in charge of vetting third-party deals worth $600 or more, was trying to make it more difficult for schools to use collectives as a workaround to the $20.5m cap that the schools are allowed to pay players.Plaintiff attorneys threatened to take the case back to court, arguing the CSC guidance amounted to an incorrect reading of the lawsuit settlement that made the payments possible.The CSC’s new guidance provides a more liberal view of what third-party collectives can do.The CSC’s “for-profit inquiry focuses on whether the sale of goods or services is for profit and not whether the entity itself is operating at a profit or a loss at any given time,” the CSC said in a news release.Part of the CSC’s requirements include athletes needing to, in certain cases, provide documentation showing the entity’s efforts to profit from the deal.In a joint statement, the defendants and plaintiffs reiterated that “the traditional purpose of many NIL collectives – raising money to induce student-athletes to attend or play at an institution – does not satisfy the valid business purpose requirement.”But, the statement said, “In evaluating such payments, the Settlement’s requirements focus on substance, not labels” – an indication that the focus should not be on whether the organization making the deal is considered a ”collective,” but only whether it sells something to the public for profit.Parts of the arrangement that don’t change are the CSC’s task of determining fair market value for the goods and services provided and the collectives’ ability to match athletes with other businesses offering NIL opportunities.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsUS sportsNCAAnewsShareReuse this content"

His Tour was not about glory, but purposeOwen LewisThu 31 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 04.02 EDTShareTadej Pogačar’s victory looked certain as he flew up Butte Montmartre for the second of three times on the Tour de France’s final stage. His lead in the race’s general classification (GC) stood at four minutes and 27 seconds over Jonas Vingegaard, more than 10 minutes clear of everybody else, and GC times had been frozen for the final stage. He had won four stages already; that he hadn’t won at least six seemed more his choice than anybody else’s. There was no need to be at the front here, to add a fifth cherry atop the ice cream, but Pogačar’s unquenchable competitive spirit demanded an attempt. He stamped on his pedals on the cobblestoned hill, scything riders off the back of the bunch. By the time he crested Montmartre, he had just four others for company.Among them werethe American Matteo Jorgensonand Wout van Aert, both of Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-Bike team. Thanks to superb climbing performances and helming the deepest team in the race, Vingegaard managed to defeat Pogačar at the 2022 and 2023 Tours de France – given Pogačar’s dominance since, these Tours now feel like distant memories from an obsolete world. Back then, Visma used Pogačar’s raw aggression against him. With the knowledge that he would respond to every acceleration, Vingegaard and his teammates threw jab after jab and Pogačar exhausted himself trying to counter with haymakers.Pogačar – already an all-time-great cyclist – responded by simply eradicating any trace of weakness. In the 2024 Tour and the first 20 stages of the 2025 event, Pogačar looked invincible. He hadn’t been dropped once. Most teams didn’t even think of trying to unseat him, so pointless their resistance would be. The peloton can resemble a living thing, a giant vibrating insect with shimmering, multicolored scales. For all its beauty, no part of it stood up to Pogačar. Vingegaard was the only rider who could feasibly compete. Givenhow comfortably Pogačar beat him in 2024, he would need even more help from his team than before.Jorgenson intended to provide just that. It’s baked into his job title,domestique, the French word for servant. If the Tour were a battlefield, the Idaho-bred Jorgenson would be on a suicide mission to engage Pogačar for as long as possible before he inevitably met his end. Any selfish goals he may have had were irrelevant.For the first four days of the Tour, Visma riders tried to surprise Pogačar with unusually timed accelerations on the flats, on the downhills, and into fierce sidelong wind. Jorgenson, to present a credible dummy target, tried to stick as close as possible to Pogačar in the overall standings. That way, Pogačar would be obligated to follow the American’s attacks as well as Vingegaard’s, leaving him potentially overextended.Pogačar casually fended off the Visma assault while simultaneously battling Mathieu van der Poel, a far heavier, more natural sprinter, in short dashes to the line. Van der Poel won their first duel on Stage 2; outsprinting him appeared a bridge too far for even Pogačar. All of two stages later, Pogačar exacted revenge. Vingegaard was behind in the sprints, but managed to stay eight seconds behind Pogacar through four stages, and Jorgenson 19. Visma’s plan had yet to produce the desired result, but hadn’t gone badly wrong either.View image in fullscreenTim Wellens, Matteo Jorgenson and Ivan Romeo, left to right, compete in the breakaway during the 20th stage of the Tour de France.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesThen on stage five’s time trial, Vingegaard and Jorgenson dropped more than one minute each to Pogačar, rendering all the efforts of the previous four days irrelevant. Stage 12’s hulking Hautacam was themost difficult climb yet; Pogačar chiseled two more minutes out of Vingegaard and 10 from Jorgenson. That was the end of any illusions that Jorgenson could be a general classification contender.With plan A vaporized, Visma tried to win individual stages. (Their Simon Yates had won stage 10, but it felt almost incidental.) On the queen stage of the race, Jorgenson stuck to the lead group, then formed a breakaway with two other riders as the rest jousted cagily at the foot of the unforgiving Col de la Loze. When Jorgenson fell back midway up the vertiginous slope, it looked like he had been instructed to wait for Vingegaard. Instead, Vingegaard’s group caught him and went past. Jorgenson was empty.Idaho-bred Matteo Jorgenson is big – and getting bigger in cycling’s biggest racesRead moreSuch was Pogačar’s dominance that when he grimaced in pain while following a Vingegaard attack on Mont Ventoux, I felt a genuine, if pathetic, thrill. Pogačar had shown so little mortality on the preceding stages that he had shifted the benchmarks for entertainment. In lieu of seeing him get dropped, I would accept a warped facial expression. It allowed a momentary dream of tighter competition before Pogačar whizzed clear on yet another sprint.Jorgenson’s plight seemed even direr than Vingegaard’s, who had seen his once-brilliant rivalry with Pogačar decimated by the latter’s evolution. Though he failed to land a single meaningful blow on his foe, Vingegaard’s efforts earned him praise. Jorgenson, meanwhile, disappeared silently on the slopes each day. He was emptying his reserves on stage after stage, seemingly to little effect for a hopeless purpose. With two stages left, Jorgenson admitted he had beentussling with bronchitisthe previous week. What was this tall, sick man doing, trying to climb as fast as the wraiths around him?In 2023, Sepp Kuss, Visma’s most dependable domestique, rode his way into the red leader’s jersey at the Vuelta a España. Though he wasn’t the best rider on his team, it stood to reason that Visma would throw their weight behind him given his lead. They eventually did, helping ensure Kuss’ victory, but not before team leaders Vingegaard and Primoz Roglic initiated infighting that suggested they would rip the jersey from Kuss’ back if given the chance.“I had to give something up of my own ambitions to help them,” Kuss latersaidof his years as a domestique. “Whether they needed my help or not, I don’t know. Maybe they never did.” He laughed, but beneath the mirth is a frightening sentiment: the idea that those generous, painful sacrifices made no difference. At this year’s Tour, Jorgenson looked into a darker crisis – Vingegaard needed all the help he could get, and Jorgenson couldn’t give it.Maybe he could help someone else. With Vingegaard’s GC bid doomed, Visma aimed at securing a final stage win, likely with Wout van Aert, whose plentiful horsepower suited short, punchy climbs like Montmartre. On the flats ahead of the third trip up Montmartre’s jangly cobbles, Jorgenson began attacking the group. Pogačar followed each time, but on a slight delay. It was as if his legs needed a few seconds to overcome their fatigue before spurring into blurred motion. Though Visma’s pecking and poking throughout the Tour hadn’t resulted in any time profits, they had contributed to exhausting Pogačar. Jorgenson remained deathly loyal to that tactic. But still Pogačar had the energy to take the lead on the climb itself and further whittle down the survivors.As the top of the hill approached, van Aert suddenly thundered ahead of Pogačar, pushing his pedals so hard I could imagine the bike frame snapping beneath the strain. As van Aert sustained his violent effort all the way up, gradually, impossibly, Pogačar fell behind. Jorgenson had finally taken enough bites out of him that somebody else could draw blood, he’d shown that Pogačar stillcouldbleed.Van Aert joyfully coasted across the finish line well ahead of the others, who, realizing the futility of chasing the rocket in front of them, had given up the chase. Pogačar rolled through the line with a finger held aloft in celebration of his fourth Tour de France victory. Jorgenson followed behind quietly, his agonizing, selfless job done and done well.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025SportblogCyclingTour de FranceUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The right-hander has a 2.01 ERA, 16 saves and 53 strikeouts in 49 and one-third innings this season. To get him, the Phillies sent two top prospects – catcher Eduardo Tait and right-hander Mick Abel – to Minnesota.‘There is history here’: For Laredo’s baseball team, the US/Mexico border is their true hometownRead moreIn a rare twist, identical twins Tyler and Taylor Rogers were both dealt on the same day. Tyler Rogers and fellow reliever Ryan Helsley are headed to the Mets, who are in a tight NL East race with the Phillies. The pair joins Edwin Díaz in a suddenly formidable New York bullpen.Rogers, known for his submarine delivery, has posted a 1.80 ERA with 38 strikeouts and just four walks over 53 appearances for San Francisco. The Mets gave up pitchers José Buttó and Blade Tidwell, along with outfielder Drew Gilbert, to acquire him.Helsley, a mainstay in St Louis over the past seven seasons, has a 3.00 ERA and 21 saves this year. The Mets sent the Cardinals three minor leaguers: infielder Jesus Baez and right-handers Nate Dohm and Frank Elissalt.While many top names – including Pittsburgh’s Mitch Keller, Cleveland’s Steven Kwan, and Arizona slugger Eugenio Suárez – remain available, several other deals signaled a market heating up before Thursday’s 6pm ET deadline.The Reds acquired 2023 Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pirates in exchange for lefty Taylor Rogers, shortstop prospect Sammy Stafura and cash. Hayes, 28, is hitting .236 with two home runs and 36 RBIs this season and is under contract through 2029 with a club option for 2030.The Yankees added outfielder Austin Slater from the White Sox, seeking a reliable right-handed bat for the stretch run. Slater, 32, has hit .236 with five homers and boasts an .859 OPS against lefties. Chicago received minor league pitcher Gage Ziehl in return.Other Wednesday trades included:The Angels acquiring relievers Andrew Chafin and Luis García from the Nationals for lefty Jake Eder and first baseman Sam Brown.The Braves adding veteran reliever Tyler Kinley from the Rockies for prospect Austin Smith.The Mariners picking up lefty Caleb Ferguson from the Pirates for right-hander Jeter Martinez.Meanwhile, Suárez returned to the Diamondbacks’ lineup Wednesday after a finger scare earlier in the week. Arizona, losers of eight of their last nine, may still deal additional players, including pitchers Merrill Kelly and Zac Gallen.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia PhilliesMLBMinnesota TwinsNew York MetsCincinnati RedsBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

And what information will people need to hand over?What does the social media ban apply to?From 10 December, new laws will apply to platforms that meet the government’s definition of an “age-restricted social media platform”, which has the sole or significant purpose of enabling social interaction with two or more users, and which allows users to post material on the service.The government has not specified by name any platforms that will be included in the ban, meaning any site that meets the above definition could be included except if they meet the exemptions released on Wednesday.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said that the covered platforms include – but are not limited to – Facebook, Instagram, X, Snapchat, and YouTube.The communications minister, Anika Wells, said these platforms would be expected to take reasonable steps to deactivate accounts for users under 16, prevent children registering new accounts, check ages, and also prevent workarounds to bypass the restrictions.What are the exemptions?The government said platforms would be exempt if they had the primary purpose of:Messaging, emailing, voice calling or video callingPlaying online gamesSharing information about products or servicesProfessional networking or professional developmentEducationHealthCommunication between educational institutions and students or their familiesFacilitating communication between providers of healthcare and people using those providers’ servicesAs Australia’s teen social media ban looms, here’s how the platforms are lobbying for an exemptionRead moreIt will be up to theeSafety commissionerto determine which platforms meet the criteria for an exemption.In practice, this means that LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Roblox, and Coursera would likely be exempt if assessed to meet the criteria. LinkedIn had previously argued to the government it was not of interest to children.In theory, it could also mean YouTube Kids could be exempt from the ban if it meets the criteria for an exemption, given it does not allow comments on videos. But the government has not confirmed this, and YouTube has not commented on whether it would seek an exemption for its service designed for children.What about other platforms?Platforms that have not been named by the government but do not meet the exemption criteria will also need to consider whether they need to bring in age assurance by December. This would include services such as Bluesky, Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, Discord and Twitch.How will tech companies check that users are over 16?A common misconception about the social media ban is that it will only apply to children. In order to ensure teenagers remain off social media, the platforms will need to check the ages of all user accounts in Australia.How they will do that is not prescribed, but it will be informed by the outcome of theage assurance technology trial, the full report of which is due in August.The government has legislated that although ID checks can be one form of age assurance, it can’t be the only one accepted.It is expected Australia will follow a similar path for age assurance thatlaunched in the UKin July, which includes options such as:Allowing banks and mobile providers to confirm a user is over 18Asking site users to upload a photo that is then matched with photo IDUse of facial age estimation technologyIn addition to that, platforms could infer user ages based on account behaviour or age. For example, if you signed up for Facebook in 2009, you would be over 16 by now. YouTubehas also flaggedit will use artificial intelligence to determine user ages.Won’t kids find ways around it?Albanese has compared the social media ban to alcohol restrictions, and said there will no doubt be children who manage to get around the ban, but he argued it was still worth doing.In the UK, where age verification was brought in this week for accessing pornography websites, there has been a surge inpeople using virtual private networks(VPNs), which hide a user’s real location, enabling access to blocked websites.Four of the top five free apps on the Apple app store in the UK on Thursday were VPN apps, with Proton, the most popular, reporting a 1,800% increase in downloads.Albanese says banning children from social media ‘not going to be easy’ as key questions unansweredRead moreThe Australian government has said it expects the platforms will implement “reasonable steps” to account for how teens may seek to avoid the ban.What happens if sites don’t comply with the ban?Platforms that do not take what the eSafety commissioner determines to be “reasonable steps” to keep kids off their service can face a fine of up to $49.5m that will be determined in the federal court.What “reasonable steps” means will be up to the commissioner to determine. When asked on Wednesday, Wells said: “I think reasonable steps is reasonable.“These are meant to be working rules, and they also need to sort of correct any errors as they arise. Because these are not set-and-forget rules, these are set-and-support rules. They are world-leading. But this is manifestly too important for us not to have a crack.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyYouTubeMetaInstagramFacebookSnapchatChildrenexplainersShareReuse this content"

It said it had more than 100,000 members and was “comprised entirely of Chinese men”.Men reportedly shared sexually explicit images of women either in intimate settings or with so-called “pinhole cameras” that can be hidden in everyday items such as plug sockets and shoes.The scandal has been compared to South Korea’s “Nth Room” case, in which women were blackmailed into sharing sexually explicit photographs of themselves with members of a Telegram group.Telegram is blocked inChinabut can be accessed by using a virtual private network, or VPN, which circumvents location controls.Hashtags related to the scandal clocked up more than 11m views on the social media platform Weibo by Thursday. But there are signs the online conversation is being censored, with some relevant searches returning the result: “According to the relevant laws and regulations, this content cannot be shown.” Reuters reported earlier in the week that associated hashtags had received more than 270m views.“A woman’s life is not a man’s erotic novel,” wrote one user on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like platform also known as RedNote.Another user on Xiaohongshu, an app predominantly used by women, wrote: “So scary! After seeing this, I’ve decided if the MaskPark incident isn’t properly addressed, I’ll never get married or have kids.”In the South Korean case, the mastermind of the chat group was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison.In China, the penalty for taking pictures of someone without their consent is up to 10 days’ detention and a 500 yuan (£53) fine. People who disseminate pornographic material can be sentenced to up to two years in prison.The MaskPark scandal is not the first time men have been discovered to be secretly filming women. Last year, the boss of a tech company in Beijing was found to have secretly recorded more than 10,000 videos of his female employees using the bathroom. He was detained for 10 days as a punishment. “Ten days is nothing short of encouragement,” one Weibo user wrote.Lao Dongyan, a criminal law professor at Tsinghua University, wrote on Weibo that Chinese law punished the dissemination of secretly – filmed material as an obscenity offence rather than a violation of women’s rights.“The women who were secretly filmed are the primary victims. Simply treating them as obscene materials is tantamount to treating them as the parties involved in pornographic works. This is absurd,” Lao wrote.Speaking out about feminism and women’s rights has become increasingly difficult in China as the government has cracked down on civil society and activism. But some women have found ways to address misogyny in public. One method is through comedy.On a recent episode of a popular standup comedy television show, The King of Standup Comedy, the comedian Huang Yijin joked that she wore make-up even when alone in hotel rooms: “Whenever I’m in a hotel, I just assume there are hidden cameras … There are about 2 million people in my room,” she said.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTelegramSexual consentPornographyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Even if it’s not a daily staple in your house, it’s safe to say most Britons cook and eat rice at least a few times a week. And while it may seem a simple thing to cook, it can be surprisingly difficult to get it right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From long-grain to quick-cook, brown basmati to jasmine, different rice grains have different cook times, different rates of absorption and varying starch levels, which can all affect the result. Instead of fluffy, individual grains, you may find your rice burnt, stuck to the pan or with a claggy, chalky or overly glutinous texture. Dinner ruined.That’s where a specialist rice cooker comes in. They’re a common kitchen appliance in Asia, and the best rice cookers guarantee perfect rice every time. Many machines intuitively set up the cooking time and guide you to add the correct ratio of rice to water depending on the variety. Many have a delay function, or can safely keep the rice warm for up to 24 hours – so you’ll always have dinner ready and waiting. Today’s technology has also seen some rice cookers become multifunctional, with the ability to slow cook, sear and stir, too. At the other end of the spectrum are basic microwave rice cookers – we tested this variety too.At a glanceBestrice cooker overall:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker£189.90 at Yum AsiaBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cooker£28.99 at AmazonBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker£149 at John LewisBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamer£7.99 at AmazonBest mini rice cooker:Yum Asia Panda mini rice cooker£94.90 at Yum AsiaWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing kitchen goods, recipes, food and drink for newspapers and websites for a decade, so I have a good grasp of what’s really useful to have in your cupboard, and whether something is good value for money.I enjoy cooking but am far from an expert, so I approach these appliances just like any other home cook would. I cook for my family every night and understand how much of a tricky balance it can be to make tasty, nutritious food without spending hours in the kitchen. Ultimately, I’m looking for gadgets that are easy to use, give good results and can make your life easier.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels.’Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianI tested 10 rice cookers, each of which was either personally recommended, well-reviewed or from a well-known kitchen appliance brand. Most were new to me, although a few I had tested years previously, and one appliance was still in play from myslow cooker testing.To test each machine, I cooked a cup of basmati rice, following the manufacturer’s instructions where provided or using the ratio suggested on the rice packet if not. Next, I cooked a cup of sushi rice using the same method; few appliances gave guidelines for cooking sushi rice, so I used the on-pack instructions. If the appliance performed well during both these tests, I then experimented with brown rice and jasmine rice. Some appliances had further functionality that needed testing – where there were risotto programs, for example, I made risotto following recipes provided by the manufacturer.In the interests of safety, I also used an external sensor to record the temperature of the appliance at the end of the rice cooking program; none of the machines posed a hazard and were all fairly cool to touch.Some of the rice I cooked wasn’t edible and had to be thrown away, but most of it was good quality – so I ate rice every which way over the month-long testing period. Luckily, iffood safety guidelines are followed carefully, it’s perfectly fine to freeze cooked rice, so I had a useful supply of fluffy basmati, fragrant jasmine, sticky sushi rice and creamy risottos on hand. My family and I reached peak rice consumption levels, thanks to the weekly poke bowls, Indian banquets, egg fried rice and everything in between.The rice cookers sourced for this article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated to acommunity hub in Barnet, where they will find useful new homes or be used in a community kitchen.The best rice cookers in 2025 in the UKView image in fullscreen‘No criticism … it’s perfect’: Yum Asia’s Bamboo.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianBestrice cooker overall:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould/The Guardian£189.90 at Yum Asia£199.90 at AmazonThe Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker uses 3D induction heating technology – whereby the rice is surrounded by heat to cook evenly – and its “AI Smart Brain” microprocessor to analyse the weight of the rice, water volume and other factors to cook rice using a wide range of settings. Choose from white/long grain, short, brown, crust, quick cook, “yumami” and gaba (germinated), add the specified amount of water to well-rinsed rice, and away you go for enough rice for up to eight people. Other settings are accessed on the easy-to-use LED display panel: steam, porridge, slow cook and cake, all cooked within the same ceramic-coated inner bowl or using the steam basket supplied.Why we love itYum Asia is a master of rice cooking, with an unparalleled understanding of how to cook different types of rice to perfection. I’ve never made sushi rice as perfect as in this machine, and it churned out variety after variety of the same quality. One cup takes about 35 minutes to cook, although the gaba setting – which claims to germinate brown rice to increase its nutritional value – takes a bit longer. I’m someone who has never particularly enjoyed brown rice, but I do now.The machine automatically keeps warm once the rice is cooked and has a delay function, as you’d expect. It’s large enough to be useful, but not too large for easy storage, and it operates with just a low whirring noise and no excessive steam. I also like the cool handles to lift out the pot; others should take heed. A standout machine.It’s a shame that …I have no criticism to make of the Yum Asia Bamboo: it’s perfect–if you can afford it.Claimed number of portions:eightTime to cook one cup of basmati rice:35minsDimensions:27 x 37 x 24cm (WDH)Capacity:1.5lExternal temperature atend of cook:21CBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould/The Guardian£39.99 at Robert Dyas£28.99 at AmazonA large-capacity, budget-friendly, no-frills rice cooker from Russell Hobbs that performs better than you’d expect. The instructions are light on the ground, as is its functionality – there are no different programs or guidelines for different types of rice, nor any timer function.Why we love itTo my surprise, the Russell Hobbs rice cooker handled every type of rice well. Basmati, sushi, brown and jasmine rice all cooked quickly and evenly without any fuss, sticking or mess. It was also the only machine that didn’t stipulate rice should be washed first, so I didn’t. The rice was still great and took between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the variety, and the machine switched to keep-warm mode automatically after cooking. This large-capacity cooker would be ideal for any family.It’s a shame that …there’s no estimated time for how long your rice will take to cook. You’ll learn this over time, but the first few times you’ll need to stand over the cooker until it’s done. Especially as I wouldn’t recommend leaving this one on the keep-warm mode for too long: the rice dries out fast.Claimed number of portions:12Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:20minsDimensions:32.2 x 24.5 x 22.6cm (WDH)Capacity:2.8lExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCookerView image in fullscreen£149 at John Lewis£150 at ArgosThe Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker doesn’t bill itself as a rice cooker, but it’s hard to define it as any one thing with this much functionality. I held on to this one after our test of thebest slow cookersso that I could put it through its paces against designated rice-cooking appliances.Why we love itI wasn’t surprised to find it did well – Ninja appliances can rarely be faulted in my experience. I used the steam function to cook the rice, but you’ll get all the other functions too: slow cook, sear, braise, simmer, bake, prove and keep warm. With one of these, there’s no need for a separate rice cooker.Ninja suggests a recipe for risotto, which turned out beautifully. You’ll need to scour the internet to find guidelines for other types of rice, but I made a guess at a ratio and cook time (one cup of basmati rice to two cups of water, 10 minutes on steam function and a five-minute rest) and it was successful – no sticking, scorching or excess starch. I cooked sushi rice equally successfully using the same method, and I increased the water by half a cup and cooking time by five minutes when dealing with brown rice, which worked well.It’s a shame that …it’s very large. But with this many settings, it can replace so many other appliances in one.Claimed number of portions:eight large portionsTime to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:28 x 29 x 42cm (WDH)Capacity:8lExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamerView image in fullscreen£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonA microwave rice steaming bowl is nothing new, but it’s probably not something most of us own. And why not? It’s inexpensive with a simple, failsafe design, offering quick, mess-free convenience. This Sistema version has a large 2.6-litre capacity, suitable for feeding a family, and uses a pressure-chamber tray to draw away overflow liquid for perfect steamed rice and couscous. It’s also dishwasher- and freezer-safe.Why we love itI wasn’t anticipating this to compare favourably with the expensive electric rice cookers I tested, but it actually does. Using its suggested ratios and timings, my basmati emerged after 15 minutes with individual fragrant grains, with no starchiness or chalky middle. Other rice varieties weren’t mentioned in the instructions, but sushi rice worked well using the same method. For brown rice, I added another five minutes and was successful.If you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, then I highly recommend trying one of these. It guarantees results without having to put your hand too far into your pocket. For anyone concerned about Pfas – the “forever chemicals” in some plastics – this cooker is made from safe polypropylene.It’s a shame that …it gets so hot. It’s been in the microwave for 10 to 15 minutes, so there’s no getting around this. Much is made of the “easy lift handles”, but you’ll still need oven gloves to handle the container until it cools.Claimed number of portions:three to fourTime to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:21.6 x 21.6 x 16.4 (WDH)Capacity:2.6lExternal temperature at end of cook:85Cskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Basmati, sushi, brown rice and jasmine were all fantastic, cooking silently and mess-free with minimal steam escaping. It’s brilliant.It’s a shame that …it takes quite a long time.

And while multi-cookers are extremely tempting, not all of them have nailed the rice cooking aspect in the way that dedicated appliances have done – proceed with caution.The best pans for every type of cooking – chosen by chefsRead moreIf you haven’t got cash to splash, then a machine for about £30 will do the trick perfectly well – or considera microwave rice cookerto see how much you actually use it. Otherwise, I’d point you to one of the Yum Asia machines – real rice cooking mastery awaits.How long does rice take to cook in a rice cooker?Cooking rice in a saucepan typically takes about 15 minutes, and most rice cookers will take twice as long. You should also factor in that the quantity of rice to be cooked will affect the cooking time, increasing proportionally with larger batches. The type of rice should also be considered; white basmati is the quickest cook, while brown rice and sticky styles will take longer – up to about 50 minutes. Good rice cookers will carefully detail cook times for specific types of rice, and most have a keep-warm function so you shouldn’t be left with any dinnertime disasters as long as you plan in advance.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

It kept the markets and the nations guessing amid last-minute uncertainty. It attempted to reassert the global heft of the United States economy to take on and master all comers. And it placed President Trump at the centre of the media story, where he always insists on being.In the event, there were some last-minute agreements struck this week, few of them fair or rational in trade terms, most of them motivated by the desire to generate some commercial order. Some conflicts are still in the balance. There were 11th-hour court challenges too, disputing the president’s very right to play the trade war game in this way.Even now, no one, probably including Mr Trump himself, knows whether this is his administration’s last word on US tariffs. Almost certainly not. That’s because Mr Trump’s love of tariffs is always more about the assertion of political clout rather than economic power. Mr Trump’s antipathy towards the European Union drives one example. The pact agreed by Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland last weekend underlines that theEU’s aspirationsas a global economic superpower exceed its actual clout. The EU could not prevent Mr Trump making European goods 15% more expensive if they sell on US markets. Nor could it stop Mr Trump getting EU tariffs on US goods withdrawn.Equally eloquent about the global balance of economic power is that Mr Trump has not been able to force China to bend the knee in the manner of the EU. China hasresponded aggressivelyto Trump’s tariff threats, retaliating with tariffs of its own and blocking the sale of commodities, including rare-earth minerals, that the US most covets. Unsurprisingly, this standoff has not produced one of Mr Trump’s so-called deals. Friday’s deadlinehas been resetfor later in the month. It would be no surprise if it was eventually pushed back further.Mr Trump is not imposing tariffs on the rest of the world in order to promote global trade or even to boost the US economy. He is doing it, in part, because Congress has delegated this power to him, allowing the president to impose or waive tariffs at will. He uses this power for many purposes. These include raising government income without congressional oversight and also, because tariffs are regressive, shifting the tax burden away from the very rich, like Mr Trump himself, on to the middle and working class.But economics also comes way down the field in the list of reasons why Mr Trump is wielding the tariff weaponinternationally. US talks with Brazil – with which the US runs a trade surplus, not a deficit – have beenhijackedby Mr Trump’s grievance over the prosecution of its former president Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overturn his 2022 election defeat. Talks with India are deadlocked because Mr Trump wants to penalise Delhi for buying energy and weapons from Russia. Those withCanadahave been hit by Mr Trump’s objections to Ottawa’s plan to recognise Palestine.The ultimate test of the policy, however, will indeed beeconomic. For now, financial markets appear to have decided that Mr Trump’s tariffs are manageable. If tariffs now raise thecost of goodson US high streets, slowing growth and feeding inflation, as they may, the wider market response could change quickly. In that event, the mood among American voters might even shift too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the character was revolutionaryDave SchillingHogan was a master of wrestling’s unreality, personifying the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be youThu 31 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.16 EDTShareWhen Hulk Hogan died and a rush of people searched his name on Google to read various obituaries, I’m sure at least some of them were shocked to find that one of the most popular search terms related to the WWE Hall of Famer is “Hulk Hogan lies”. There are countlessvideos,Reddit threads,social media postsand articles detailing all the things the Hulkster apparently said that were either exaggerations, distortions or outright fabrications. One time, Hogan said he was asked to play in Metallica. The banddenied the storystraight away. Hulk said in his autobiography that he partied with John Belushi after WrestleMania 2 in 1986, even though Belushi had died in 1982. There’s also the time where Hulk thought the Jackass star Bam Margera was deadwhen he very much was not.If you aren’t a wrestling fan (you’re reading the Guardian. You’re probably not a wrestling fan) you might wonder why someone who was famous for four decades would feel the need to lie about whether he could have been in Metallica. These are the sorts of lies the quarterback of your high school tells at the reunion. “Andre the Giant was 700lb when I bodyslammed him in from of 200,000 people at the Roman Colosseum” is definitely an anecdote that could get you a free shot at the no-host bar at the Elks Lodge, but if you’re Hulk Hogan, you could just be honest and say Andre was more like 400lb and the crowd was between 80,000 and 93,000, depending on whom you ask. Also, it was in Pontiac, Michigan, not Rome. Hulk Hogan did not need to lie, but he did. Often.Lying, fabrication and multiple layers of reality are fundamental tenets of professional wrestling at every level of the industry. In 2019, I worked at WWE as a writer for their TV show SmackDown just long enough to get fired. I wasn’t there for enough time to actually get good at the art of crafting a compelling wrestling story, but I was there long enough to realize that the most crucial element of wrestling is some form of dishonesty. The performer’s job is to approximate reality, to portray their character not just on TV, but on social media, in the press, and sometimes even at the airport. Wrestling is performance art on an entirely different level. Terry Bollea had to live his life as Hulk Hogan – the bandanna, the tank tops, the white moustache. In his now-infamous reality show, Hogan Knows Best, despite the conceit of seeing inside Hulk’s real home, he was still that character. Terry Bollea was so committed to being Hulk Hogan that he had aformal bandanna for black tie events. No one would be mad if he wore, say, a Kangol hat or maybe … no hat at all? When Hogantestified in the Gawker trial,it was shocking to hear him refer to “Terry Bollea” and “Hulk Hogan” as two different people.The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosityIn the pro wrestling parlance, this veil of fiction is called “kayfabe” – a word with its origin in the old-timey carnival culture that wrestling evolved from. Kayfabe is both a noun to describe the glorious unreality of wrestling and a verb to describe when someone is subtly lying to you (or hiding something incredibly important). In WWE, there are layers of kayfabe, with fewer and fewer people smartened up to what’s happening the deeper you go. The outcomes of the matches are kayfabed. Who is wrestling in the main event of WrestleMania 42 next spring is super kayfabed. This doesn’t seem that terribly different from protecting the ending of a summer blockbuster film, but when you’re inside the business, you realize thateverythingcan be kayfabed. How can you trust anything anyone says? WWE just launched a reality show on Netflix calledUnreal, which claims to lift the veil on the behind-the-scenes creation of their storylines. I immediately said to myself: “This is just another layer of kayfabe.” The sacred work of wrestling is to make people believe, to bend the truth just enough to make a few bucks off our curiosity. This is the world Hulk Hogan lived in.I still love wrestling, and despite thehorrible things he said and did, I still see Hulk Hogan the character as one of the most influential heroes in American history. He managed to make the most mundane, thunderingly obvious credo (“say your prayers and eat your vitamins, kids!”) sound revolutionary. He knew how to captivate an audience with nothing more than a gesture. He understood the art of platonic seduction – the way to get someone to not just love you, but to think that their struggle is also yours. Wrestling fans – both children and adults – could live vicariously through Hulk Hogan. His appeals in his speeches were to his “Hulkamaniacs”, the fans that gave him the strength to do the impossible. At WrestleMania 3, if Andre the Giant wanted to beat Hulk Hogan for the WWE Championship, he’d also have tocontend with the millions of Hulkamaniacs cheering for him. In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel foryouto travel in.If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is.One of Hulk Hogan’s last televised appearances was at theRepublican national convention in 2024. He tore a Trump T-shirt off his body instead of a Hulkamania shirt and pledged his full fealty to our future president. In some twisted way, it was a passing of the torch. For years, Hulk Hogan had been the apex of wrestling’s art of unreality. His talent for leading the masses peaked around 1988, and as the world got more savvy about WWE’s particular magic trick, the connection severed. He left for a rival company, became a bad guy, and reinvented the art form again. But it could never be quite what it was in the mid-80s. Wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and John Cena could captivate a crowd, but it was nothing like Hulkamania. No one would or could ever truly believe like that again. This is why WWE has to open up (or at least pretend to), like the Soviet Union at the end of the cold war.After years of sitting under the learning tree of WWE’s former owner, Vince McMahon,Donald Trumptook the tools of platonic seduction that Hulk Hogan perfected and applied them to politics. The use of the word “we”, the commonality of struggle, the dastardly enemies to defeat in righteous combat. Even the empty slogans. Is “make America great again” that far removed from “say your prayers and eat your vitamins”?In the unreality of pro wrestling, you, the audience member, are the real protagonist. Hulk Hogan is merely a vessel for you to travel inWhen Hulk Hogan exaggerated a story or outright lied, he’d very rarely retract his statement. When he was allowed back in the WWE locker room after tape of his racist tirade circulated publicly, he spentmost of his apologywarning fellow wrestlers to be careful about “getting caught”. Hulk Hogan was a man who made his own truth. He didn’t need to do anything other than live in the world he made for himself. The more he made up about himself, the grander he became. He was truly the greatest American hero, because he personified the most American virtue of them all: you do not have to be you. And the more he fashioned himself a superhero, the more we wanted to be him – to fully merge with him into one entity. This power was both awe-inspiring and perhaps the most terrifying weapon any human being could wield in this life.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsWrestlingOpinionUS televisionTelevisionUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Will it work?Margaret SullivanIn recent years, the newspapers that have fared the best have been those with committed local ownershipThu 31 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 12.25 EDTShareWhen the legendary journalist David Halberstam wrote his landmark 1979 book about American journalism, The Powers That Be, he focused on four media organizations: the Washington Post, Time magazine, CBS and theLos Angeles Times.His choice of the LA newspaper made perfect sense. Influential and successful, it was owned by a prominent California family, the Chandlers. The paper had high standards, a raft of Pulitzer prizes, and a hard-charging Washington DC bureau that competed successfully with its east coast rivals. For reporters and editors, the LA Times was a prestigious career destination; if you got there, you probably stayed.Nearly 50 years later, the Los Angeles Times is much smaller in staff size and circulation size and is losing tens of millions of dollars a year. The beleaguered staff was rocked – again – in recent weeks with the news that the owner, the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, wants to take the newspaper public in the next year. This would, he said, “democratize” it.To protect US democracy from tyrants, we must protect the truly free press | Robert ReichRead moreHe offered few details, though, as he made the announcement on a late-night talkshow during an interview with host Jon Stewart, who was roundly criticized for his softball approach.Certainly, the paper has been through hell over the decades. It endured many years of owners far more focused on profits than on the best interests of the reading public.Roughly a decade ago – long after the Chandlers had sold the paper – the Times was part of the laughably named and poorly run “Tronc” chain that was busy diminishing the Chicago Tribune and other journalistic institutions.The staff was shrinking, the hope for profits disappearing and the newsroom’s morale low.Then, salvation seemed to arrive. Soon-Shiong, a former surgeon who made his fortune in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, bought the paper in 2018, coming in hot with promises of restoring the paper’s greatness and public mission.Champagne corks popped as the new owner’s view of newspapers as a public trust seemed to offer relief from all the drama of recent years.But – ever so sadly – those promises have turned out to be mostly hollow, though the paper remains the largest news organization in the American west and has a respected editor in Terry Tang, formerly of the New York Times. Though it has many talented journalists who still churn out important investigations, break news and winmajor awards, it is drowning in red ink and laid off 20% of its staff last year. Paid subscriptions are fewer than 300,000, compared with 11m at the New York Times and (as of 2023) more than 2m at the Washington Post.The billionaire doctor has becomecloser to Donald Trumpand may have allowed that relationship to affect the paper’s editorial integrity. Last year, he blocked a planned presidential endorsement of then vice-president Kamala Harris, causing a cascade of subscribers to cancel and the top opinion editor to resign. (Some reports suggested the decision wasrelated to Gaza.)The LA Times’ AI ‘bias meter’ looks like a bid to please Donald Trump | Margaret SullivanRead moreMany a journalist, especially on the opinion side, has walked out the door, and a celebrated top editor, Kevin Merida,departed last yearafter disagreements with the Soon-Shiong family.Can Soon-Shiong’s latest notion of taking the paper public improve this sorry situation?The plan seems far from ideal. After all, the large regional newspapers that have thrived in the US are those with local ownership committed to the best journalistic practices – including editorial independence. The best owners have protected that while working toward financial success in this challenging new digital environment.Consider: the Philadelphia Inquirer is owned by a local non-profit. The Boston Globe is owned by Boston-based John W Henry, whose portfolio includes the Boston Red Sox. And the Minnesota Star Tribune is owned by Glen Taylor, a Minnesota-based businessperson and former state senator.The worst owners, by contrast, are predatory chains such as Alden Global Capital, a Manhattan-based hedge fund intent on wringing the last profits from waning newspapers. They don’t seem to care about the public mission or about building a sustainable future for their papers.Granted, we’re a long way since “the powers that be” and from the rich heyday of newspapers when 30% profit margins were nothing to marvel at, and when regional papers like the Baltimore Sun and the Chicago Tribune boasted foreign bureaus and newsrooms of 400 or more.The industry is in sharp decline. No local newspaper has had an easy time since the business model changed so radically 20 years ago with the precipitous loss of print advertising.But those with reasonably enlightened local ownership have fared the best. The LA Times, under Patrick Soon-Shiong, could have been in that enviable category – but it didn’t go that way.The chances of restoring the gleam to this journalistic jewel can only be described as uncertain. And, for many reasons, that’s a shame.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles TimesOpinionUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Grassroots organizing offers opportunity for changeThu 31 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 08.36 EDTShareThousands of famished people waiting for hours in 90-degree heat to secure bags of flour that run out after 10 minutes – this isa typical sceneat the four aid distribution centers remaining in Gaza. The cause of this desperation isn’t shortages per se, because the World Food Programmehas tons of foodwaiting to be delivered to malnourished Palestinians.Instead, the problem is Israel’s months-long blockade of aid, which more than 100 humanitarian organizationshave statedis causing “chaos, starvation, and death”. And though Israeli authorities began allowing a trickle of convoysto resume deliveriesover the weekend, the face-saving gesture is too little for theone in three Gazanswho haven’t eaten in days, and too late forthe dozenswho have already starved to death.Amid this manufactured famine, however, Israel has permitted another kind of shipment to flow freely. Weapons imports have continued unabated, withthousands of pounds of bombs, guns and ammunitionpouring into the Israel Defense Forces.A new reportby Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, has uncovered the major supplier of this fatal equipment:the United States.Titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide”, the exposé lays bare how major American corporations have been all too eager to facilitate Israel’s atrocities in Gaza in exchange for billions of dollars in revenue. It also reveals our nation’s now undeniable complicity in what has been described asthe worst humanitarian crisisof the 21st century.War profiteering is a phenomenon as ancient as war itself, but Albanese’s investigation shows that the military-industrial-technological complex is reaping uniquely horrible payoffs in Palestine.Albanese describeshow companies led by Lockheed Martin have built fighter jets for Israel that have carried out bombings which have killed or wounded almost200,000 Palestinians. She describes Palantir’s work with the Israeli military, and its consummation of that partnership by holding a board meeting in Tel Aviv (Palantir hasdenied involvementin IDF programs identifying Gaza targets). And she brings to light how Caterpillar Inc equipment has demolished homes and hospitals, crushing to death civilians stuck inside those structures.Perhaps the most hypocritical offenders are the members of the Magnificent Seven. Google’s unofficial motto was once“Don’t be evil,”but now the company has joined Amazon to provide cloud computing services to Israel and its military fora persuasive $1.2bn. Albanese quotes an Israeli colonel who calls this technology “a weapon in every sense of the word”, a cloud as deadly as any poison gas.The Trump administration has responded to Albanese’s research with its classic combination of denial and retribution. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio,has sanctioned her, calling her work“political and economic warfare”.But Albanese’s conclusions align with those of several prominent Jewish and Israeli figures. The former IDF soldier and leading genocide historian Omer Bartov defended Albaneseby writing, “I have been teaching classes on genocide for a quarter of a century. I can recognize one when I see one.” On Monday, two major Israeli human rights groupsannounced they agreedwith that description. The journalist Peter Beinart, the editor-at-large of Jewish Currents, has called Israelan apartheid state, andrecently condemnedthe crisis in Gaza as “an astonishing level of death and suffering that has been normalized”. A simple scan of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz turns up recent headlines like“The Mathematics of Starvation”and“Israel’s Destruction of Gaza”.In the US Capitol, progressive lawmakers such as Representative Rashida Tlaib and Senator Bernie Sandershave repeatedly calledfor ending the transfer of US arms to Israel. A handful of other Democrats have also introduced theBlock the Bombs Act, which wouldprohibit the sale of certain weaponswithout congressional approval, including those made by American companies like Boeing and General Dynamics.While the bill has gained little traction, outrage over Gaza has become a bipartisan consensus among voters.Only 23% of Americansdeem Israel’s military actions to be justified. But with activists like Mahmoud Khalilfacing deportationover their pro-Palestinian advocacy, and with otherprotests worldwidebeing met with brutal andeven deadly repression, crystallizing sentiment into a social movement seems an increasingly daunting task.Amid so much pushback, though, grassroots organizing against weapons exports to Israel still represents a concrete if challenging opportunity for change.Students in Israel,the USandacross the globehave already been providing a moral witness on this front, despite the threat ofretaliation, expulsion and blacklisting. Now, a broader coalition will be necessary to convince lawmakers that they should fear constituent backlash more than a primary challengebankrolled by Aipac.Beyond pouring into the streets, Americans can also boycott the corporations living large while the population of Palestine dwindles. The employees of those very companies can do the same, like the 50 now-terminated workers at Google wholed “No Tech for Apartheid” protestslast year. Otherwise, the warningrecently issuedby Beinart will remain true: “Blood is on our hands as Americans because it is our weapons that are responsible for those children starving to death.”In the meantime, the thirsty toddlers of Khan Younis willcontinue to wait for some drops of salt waterto drink, andthe emaciated doctors of Gaza Citywill continue to scrounge for a few cans ofexpired foodto eat.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s not too late to fight backThu 31 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareDonald Trump’s decision towithdraw the United Statesa second time from what is essentially the beacon of global culture and heritage – Unesco – is depressing but unsurprising given the administration’s lack of respect for art and culture that celebrates the diversity of humanity in all of its fullness. But it is still a grave error of moral leadership that harms the United States’ global standing on free expression, human rights and democracy.Earlier this year, he initiateda takeoverof the Kennedy Center’s programming and content, andlinked National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)andNational Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)grants to highly partisan ideological conditions. Meanwhile,the government’s attempts atcensorship in schoolsare all but rewriting American history.Trump has also systematically removed the United States from global obligations connected to health, human rights and the betterment of society. This includes withdrawing from theWorld Health Organization(WHO) and the UN human rights council (UNHRC) and in effect the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).Culture comes under fire when democracy is dyingIt was only a matter of time before Unesco – the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – came under fire, representing as it does everything the Trump White House rails against. Unesco’s chief was unsurprised,sayingthat since the last time Trump was in power and pulled the US out of the organization, they had reduced their reliance on US funding significantly and would be carrying on with its mission.Why, then, does this withdrawal matter? Surely it can be chalked up to another strong-arm tactic designed to make headlines and give the administration some more “America First” policies to boast about. Unfortunately, when it comes to culture, it is not that simple.Culture comes under fire when democracy is dying.Russia’s imprisonment of writers, artists and cultural figures who question official narratives about the war on Ukraine; or the Taliban’s destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas – these are examples of how culture becomes both a target and a battleground because it represents identity, memory and freedom of thought – the very things authoritarianism seeks to control or erase.What the US administration has dismissed as “woke” is actuallyUnescopreserving democratic ideals, teaching the world valuable lessons based in history and protecting artistic freedom – all things that autocrats see as a threat to their ability to control the narrative. It is no small irony that the organization’s recognition of Palestine has also been used as an excuse for the withdrawal, when Unesco is one of the leaders of Holocaust education in the world, and Palestine itself is suffering near total cultural obliteration.We do not comply: how do we disrupt the momentum of Trump’s cruelty? | V (formerly Eve Ensler)Read moreIt would be a grave error for the United States not to recognize that Trump’s disdain for cultural preservation is part of a broader assault on human rights, democracy, free expression and artistic freedom. It is a story repeated across the world and throughout time. It is notable that one of the few countries to also withdraw from Unesco was South Africa, which withdrew in 1955 in protest against Unesco’s stance against apartheid. During this period of isolation, the apartheid government intensified its control over culture and education, seeking to tightly control the narrative in South Africa and globally about its discriminatory policies.There is still time to reverse this decision. PEN America, which defends free expression worldwide and ARC, the Artists at Risk Connection that protects artistic freedom,urgeCongress to oppose this latest move to further isolate the United States globally, and ensure that the country continues to fulfill its international human rights obligations. US funders and foundations should also increase support to writers, journalists and media outlets, artists and cultural institutions, and free expression advocates in countries affected by the shutdown of US foreign assistance.By working with Unescoto commemorate sites of apartheid resistance when it rejoined in 1994, South Africa has shown how global engagement can honor truth and build inclusive memory; the United States, by contrast, risks forfeiting that same moral leadership by retreating from the very institution that makes such progress possible.Liesl Gerntholtz is the managing director of the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Center at PEN America.

They are absolutely rightThu 31 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 06.46 EDTShareThe Suez crisis in 1956 was a humiliating moment of truth for the UK. Faced with implacable opposition from the US, Anthony Eden’s government was forced to abandon military action in Egypt. Capitulation to American pressure was a recognition of Britain’s diminished status on the world stage.The trade deal agreed between Washington and Brussels this week lacks the drama of troops being sent in to recapture one of the world’s key waterways, but it is the EU’s Suez moment all the same. What’s more, European politicians know as much.Donald Trump said the outcome was “great”, and for the US that was certainly the case, since the EUmade all the concessionsand got nothing in return. Most European goods exported to the US will face a 15% tariff, while the already small tariffs on US goods entering the EU will be eliminated altogether. European companies have been forced to accept higher costs as the price of access to the world’s biggest market.That’s by no means all. The EU has also committed itself to $600bn (£450bn) of US investments, $750bn in long-term fossil-fuel energy purchases and to buy more US military kit. Plans for anEU digital services taxthat would affect US tech giants had already been dropped.As far as the financial markets were concerned, it was reason to feel relieved, since this one-sided peace pact removed the threat of a tit-for-tat trade war. It isn’t that economists think tariffs will be good for the global economy, but rather that they feared an even worse outcome. EU trade negotiators were of the same opinion. For Brussels, any deal was better than no deal.But appeasement always has its critics, and condemnation of the deal was swift in coming – particularly from France. François Bayrou, the prime minister, said it was a “dark day” for Europe. His predecessor, Michel Barnier,said the agreementwas an admission of weakness.Posting on X, the entrepreneur and commentator Arnaud Bertrand said the terms of the agreement represented one of the mostexpensive imperial tributesin history. He added: “This does not even remotely resemble the type of agreements made by two equal sovereign powers. It rather looks like the type of unequal treaties that colonial powers used to impose in the 19th century – except this time, Europe is on the receiving end.”That’s a reasonable conclusion. The rationale behind ever-closer union within the bloc was that an EU armed with its own currency would be able to match the US, not just in terms of economic prowess but in geopolitical influence as well. The euro would be a rival to the dollar, and strong growth would give Europe political clout. Pooling sovereignty in areas such as trade would ensure that Europe punched above its weight.As Trump’s tariff regime becomes clear, Americans may start to foot the billRead moreThings haven’t quite gone according to plan. Europe’s economic performance since monetary union has been dismal, and the gap with the US has widened rather than narrowed. Individual countries have had their scope for independent action systematically reduced, with restrictions on state aid, procurement and industrial policy. Handing the European Commission responsibility for negotiating trade deals hasn’t prevented Europe being steamrolled by the US. Indeed, the trade deal the EU has agreed with the US is actually less favourable than the one that Keir Starmerhas signed up tofor post-Brexit Britain.The US-EU agreement needs to be approved by EU countries, which could be a problem if the hostile French reaction is anything to go by. Many details remain unclear and some of the terms will prove hard, if not impossible, to enforce. There is no way, for instance, that the EU can force private companies in Europe to invest across the Atlantic.Moreover, the deal may prove to be a pyrrhic victory for Trump if, as looks increasingly likely, tariffs increase the cost of goods in the US. Coupled with the clampdown on migration, there is the clear risk that growth will slow and inflation will rise. Share prices on Wall Street are high in expectation that the good times will continue. They may not.But while there would be a tinge of schadenfreude in Europe were the bubble in US asset prices to burst, any joy in Trump’s misfortune would prove short-lived.Europe’s fortunes are tied to those of the US. First, it needs access to the American market because its economic model relies so heavily on exports. This is particularly true of Germany, whichruns large and persistent trade surpluses. German carmakers can probably just about live with 15% tariffs, but they would have been ruined had Trump followed through on his threat to impose levies of 30%.Second, the EU needs the US to help it counter the perceived threat from Russia. It sees US energy as a substitute for Russian oil and gas, while the agreement to buy more American military goods is a way of tying the US more firmly into Nato.The contrast with China is stark. Beijing did not roll over when Trump imposed punitive tariffs earlier this year. Instead, it stood up to US bullying byannouncing retaliatory measuresof its own. The markets went into full panic mode, with China’s robust response triggering a sharp fall in US bond prices. Faced with a financial meltdown, Trump watered down his tariff plans.The EU’s surrender to Trump shows that China is now the only serious rival to American hegemony. Like Britain since Suez, the EU’s subservience to the US is plain for all to see.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionTariffsTrump administrationEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Julia Gillard is prime minister, everyone is playing Angry Birds on the new iPad, and I am here writing about homophobia in sport. You know, 2010! Unfortunately, however, I’m not in some Rebel Wilson-type Netflix head-injury time-travel comedy, I am still in 2025 Australia. Despite this fact, in the last year or so there have been six separate incidents where an AFL player or coach has used a homophobic slur against an opposition player – including twoin the last fewweeks.TheAFLhas suspended each player, and in the most recent case, Riak Andrew has been banned for a lengthy five matches. This has happenedafterall AFL players this year had to complete an LGBTQ+ education model. The AFL has taken such steps to try to stem the tide of homophobia in the game, but the tactics don’t seem to be working. Players are still being homophobic on the field, and many fans and supporters take this as license to be homophobic off the field. This is a culture issue, a player issue, and a fan issue – it is inbuilt and insidious. And it is harmful.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsI get the sense, reading the players’ apologies, that while they may be remorseful, they don’t understand that this is not just about one hurtful moment. When they shout out a slur, it is not just a fleeting thing that everyone can move on from in the same way. These casually thrown out slurs do not just offend – they silence. I know this from personal experience. I grew up in regional Queensland, in a time and place where I knew I was different from other 11-year-olds. I didn’t think I could ever come out of the closet. This was pre-“wokeness”, so I suffered every day trying to change or hide who I was.After years and years of this torture, at 17 years old I finally decided to come out to someone. I went to stay with family members in Brisbane, a young couple that I had convinced myself wouldn’t hate me, and would accept me. I will never forget sitting out on the back step while they were in the kitchen, my body fighting with itself as I gathered the courage to tell someone about this secret that was consuming my life. I was almost there, I was going to do it. And then I overheard one of them say “faggot” in a conversation about the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It sounds absurd now, but it was one of the more crushing moments of my life. My stomach dropped to hell, I felt so stupid for thinking I could ever come out to anyone, that I could ever trust anyone enough to know it would be OK. That one moment, that one word from someone I loved, stopped me trying to come out again for three entire years.If players, after all that education and disciplining,stillfind themselves hurling a slur at an opposition player because it’s just there below the surface, imagine what is said off the field. Imagine the training sessions, the locker rooms, the bus, the pub. Imagine you are a young gay player who hears his colleagues, his heroes, the people he looks up to using that kind of language. Imagine you’re a young kid, an AFL fan, hearing it. Regardless if you are out and proud or hiding away, if you hear someone like a family member, a friend, a football hero use whatyou areas the worst insult they can think of – of course it immediately suggests that they despise you, and everyone like you.When Jack Graham from the West Coast Eagles was suspended, his captain Liam Duggandescribed his use of the sluras a “slip of the tongue”. If that’s true, if it’s just in the heat of the moment – too bad. It does not matter. You have made your impact, you have done the damage. Words famously are the things we use to communicate, and homophobic slurs very clearly communicate your disdain for us, more effectively than disdain for your opponent.The other thing people love to say on this issue is that “sexuality doesn’t matter” and that it shouldn’t come up in footy. Look at the comments on the Sydney Swans’Instagram postof the jersey they will wear for their (one) Pride game this year. More than 400 comments from the football community, from the fans, with a huge proportion of those insulting and homophobic, and a great many complaining that sexuality should not be forced in their faces. If you take one message from this article please let it be this – you people are the reason we are talking about sexuality. The pride game exists because it is a reaction to the homophobic culture of the sport. This article exists because of straight players who brought up sexuality on the field. We want these grown men being paid a lot of money to do their fucking jobs without bringing us into it. I am sick of people claiming that we are forcing this on to you, when you are forcing us to do this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

It’s time for us to rise up | Rebecca ShawRead moreWe have of course made a lot of progress for LGBTQ+ rights generally in society. But there are still many, many people around this country who are not able to be themselves in their environments. Sometimes that environment is the footy. There are young people at AFL games trying to figure out who they are, and listening to everything coming out of everyone’s mouths. Kids who might have the course of their life changed by something said by their family, by the fans, or by the players they love. The AFL has to do more than making players click through some module, or suspending them from a few games when their homophobia slips out. There needs to be a culture shift somehow, and I think that can only happen if players take the impact of their words seriously. Players need to be doing more themselves to combat what is being said on the field, and off. I’m sick of being in 2010, the homophobia is rife and the outfits are ugly.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsOpinionAFLAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Deep in a box of crumpled photos and loose negatives, my earnest correspondence to the big man requested nothing but a sibling. I wrotesisterin every possible iteration:half-sister, adopted sister, stepsister, foster sisterand, underneath, just in case Santa couldn’t grant that particular wish, I added the same options forbrother.If Santa somehow turned out to be real and started granting wishes to tired mums in their late 30s, my wish would probably remain the same: I’d rewrite history and add a sibling. A lovely one, preferably, but I’ll take what I can get. Because honestly? Being an only child sucks.My parents split up when I was one. It was the right call, as are most divorces, however it meant the experience of a full sibling was off the table at an early age. I spent my early years with my single mum; we were a great team and I was very comfortable with things as they were. Until I started noticing friends acquiring siblings.I’ve never been prone to nostalgia. But when I stop by our old London home, memories come upon me in a flood | Paul DaleyRead moreWhat fun my friends had with their siblings! An inbuilt playmate! A co-conspirator against the enemy that is parents! Someone to blame when things got broken! Someone to confide in when things got tough! I was sold. My poor mother had to deal with my begging and pleading for a sibling, which unbeknownst to me was her wish too. Circumstances weren’t on our side and, after years of trying to convince her to conjure a sibling out of thin air, I set my sights on my dad and stepmother.I moved in with them at age 12 to attend a high school in the city. With my stepmum being younger than my dad, the chance of a baby half-sibling seemed much higher and I wasted no breath in regularly asking for one. Deep in their PhDs, however, my wish was not to be granted and my teenage years crept by without a sibling in sight.To add to the loneliness of being an only child, I had no cousins I was close with. Either by distance, age or having little in common, it was just me and a bunch of adults. When you’re a kid trying to figure out the world without other kids messing up beside you, it can feel like you’re doing it all wrong. All the focus lands on you and that attention could be utterly mortifying.Nowhere was this more excruciatingly clear than the summer I got my second-ever period during a Christmas trip to visit my grandparents in Sydney. Having not yet braved tampons, I told everyone I’d just skip swimming for the week. But with four adults and no other kids to absorb their attention, it was decided: I would learn to use a tampon.Much to my dismay, my grandpa was sent out to buy mini tampons and, as suggested by my stepmum, a small jar of Vaseline “to help things along”. The process was explained in painful detail by my stepmum, with well-meaning interjections from my grandmother. When I was finally sent off to the bathroom to give it a go, I was acutely aware of the four adults waiting just outside the door, eager for news of my success.‘Let’s get your story straight’ – the words that made my mum an ally, and a human | Emily WatkinsRead moreWhile the tampon incident of 2002 was indeed a success, that summer made me painfully aware of how different I was from families with multiple kids running around. While I’m sure there are mortifying moments in bigger families, at least there’s comfort in knowing you aren’t the only one experiencing toe-curling embarrassment.At the risk of someone pulling out a tiny violin, at 38 my yearning for a sibling has only deepened. The loneliness of being an adult only child is an interesting catch-22 in a time when only-child families are surging and I find myself biting my tongue lest I make someone feel bad for not giving their child a sibling. No one should be made to feel bad for not having more kids, especially not in this economy (or this climate), but it does add a layer to the loneliness of being an only child: feeling like you can’t actually talk about it (I know, I know – tiny violin).So while I’ll never experience the delight of completely unhinged sibling fights that are resolved two seconds later, or the joy of being an aunty to kids I adore that I canhand back, I have gifted my daughters each other. Twenty months into my experience of parenting siblings and I’m already relishing the “But she spat on mefirst!” and the “But I’m not eventouchingher” (said by a seven-year-old whose toe is a millimetre from angry screaming toddler’s face). And somehow, watching them navigate this ridiculous, messy relationship is quietly healing my childhood loneliness.Freya Bennett is a writer based on Dja Dja Wurrung Country and is the co-founder and editor of Ramona MagazineExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilyParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

But compared with the huge loss of European trade, it’s a drop in the oceanThu 31 Jul 2025 11.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTShareThose who misled the country overBrexitare usually quieter these days. They do not hang their heads in shame, but change the subject whenever they can. They deflect with their new war-cry that Britain must also leave the European convention on human rights.As the effects of their wicked Brexit folly worsen by the month, they rarely get a chance to whoop: “We were right!” So their glee was unrestrained when the great US global bully gave Britain a less hard beating with a 10% tariff on its goods, compared with the EU, which was walloped with 15%.Their joy overflowed when the business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds,conceded: “I’m absolutely clear, this is a benefit of being out of the European Union, having our independent trade policy, absolutely no doubt about that.” But what else can a trade secretary, speaking through gritted teeth, actually say? In his attempts to attract foreign investment, he can hardly tell the truth about the damage done by leaving the EU.These advocates of Brexit should gloat while they can. When the French prime minister called the EU’s deal with Donald Trump a “soumission” (submission), Kwasi Kwartengseized on the wordin a piece for the Telegraph, writing: “For the French, with their memories of capitulation to the Nazis in 1940, the word is even more associated with abject humiliation than it is in English.” Yes, that’s the same Kwarteng who hurled the British economy over a cliff only three years ago.“This trade deal is the EU’s greatest humiliation since Britain voted to leave”, read the headline on his column. But he would never confess that the difference between a 10% and 15% tariff with the US is minimal, since we tradetwice as muchwith the EU as the US. It barely equates to the regular variation in exchange rates: in other words, it’s “a rounding error”, the Centre for European Reform’s trade expert, John Springford, told me, when compared with the hammer blow Britain gave itself with Brexit.The UK-India trade deal signed with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last week was greeted with anotherBrexiter whoopfrom the Conservative peer Daniel Hannan. Also writing in the Telegraph, he said: “My party, and Brexiteers more widely, should be taking credit for having done what all the clever Europhiles have spent six years telling us was impossible. Instead of moaning, we should welcome Starmer’s belated understanding that world’s biggest and fastest-growing markets are outside the EU.” But the Tory leadertook another view: “Keir Starmer called this ‘historic.’ It’s not historic, we’ve just been shafted!” Kemi Badenoch said, dismissing the India agreement as a bad deal thatwould increase immigration.I don’t know whether clever men like Kwarteng and Hannan are blinded by Brexit monomania or paralysed by the awful knowledge of the damage they have inflicted on their country, unable to confess an act of treachery and delusion hardly matched in British history. But as ever, facts are too inconvenient for them to deal with.Yes, the India deal is the biggest and most substantial trade deal since leaving the EU. Yes, it’s a deal that would have been impossible to do from inside the union. But how big is it? It willadd 0.13% to our economy. That’s better than the Australia agreement,worth just 0.08%, the New Zealand deal,worth 0.03%, or the proposed US agreement,worth 0.16%, according to Department for Business and Trade analysis. But our fragile economy needs all the help it can get, so hurrah for Brexit and our new trade deals!But the gloaters ignore the context: our great Brexit losses. Here’sthe Office for Budget Responsibility’s assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade “will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”. In other words, as Jonty Bloom of the New Worldcalculates, we need 50 India trade deals to make up for Brexit, because Britain does more than 40% of its trade with the EU – more if you include the European Economic Area and Switzerland. India has just 2% of our trade.Brexiters bleat that Labour is sneaking us into the EU by the back door, with deals on Horizon, the EU’s research and innovation funding programme; soon, hopefully, Erasmus; and maybe a youth experience scheme. We hope for agricultural products and energy deals. But even these, say the trade experts, are still small potatoes. Major attempts to rescue Britain’s 4% loss in productivity since 2020 hit the concrete walls of Boris Johnson’s monumentally bad trade and cooperation agreement. Brexit zealots protest against agreements to keep a dynamic alignment with EU standards that would make trade easier. But it doesn’t apply to our internal environmental standards: outside EU rules, we have let our water quality fall behind the EU. More than 85% of bathing waters in the EU arerated excellentcompared with just 64% in the UK, with the gap rising every year,reports the European Movement.Public opinion has shifted rapidly: we arenow a “Bregretful” country, where only 31% still think it was right to leave and 61% say Brexit has been more of a failure than a success. Who do they blame? The Conservatives and Boris Johnson are top of the list, with 88% and 84% respectively holding them responsible. More than two-thirds (67%) blame Nigel Farage. A majority of Britons (56%) want to rejoin the EU as the grim reaper carries off old Brexiters, replacing them with young, pro-European voters.Don’t expect bolder moves from the Labour government in its current frame of mind. Though defence and security draw us towards ever closer union, public opinion is not to be trusted. If people were confronted now with actual re-entry terms – paying in, free movement, joining the euro, no special deals – their answers might change. The mood might also be different if the far right continues its gains in EU countries, dividing the union’s values.What might it take to throw off the economic, political and psychological darkness of Brexit? A clever – or Cleverly? – new Tory leader daring to break with the past, confessing the error of Brexit and taking us back into the EU, once and for all. It may take another generation to recover.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionTariffsTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

A decade later, as our region teeters on the edge of catastrophe, that call is no longer just noble – it is essential.The proposal was not a new Iranian initiative. As far back as 1974, Iran proposed azone free from nuclear weapons in the Middle Eastat the UN, and was soon joined by Egypt. That proposal passed overwhelmingly in the general assembly. After Iraq’s use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, the initiative was expanded in 1990 to cover all weapons of mass destruction. But for half a century, progress has been blocked by Israel and its main patron, the United States.This paralysis is no accident. Despite overwhelming annual support in the UN general assembly and repeated commitments in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), the Middle East remains one of the only regions on Earth without a nuclear weapon-free framework. More than 100 non-aligned states at the1995 NPT review and extension conferencemade progress towards such a zone a condition of the treaty’s indefinite extension. Yet 30 years on, little has changed.In fact, the situation has deteriorated, showing that while possession of nuclear weapons usually leads to reckless adventurism, such weapons in no way assure success, provide invincibility or safety for citizens. Recent unlawful military action by the nuclear-armed Israel – which is not party to the NPT – against Iran’s internationally monitored nuclear facilities brought our region dangerously close to an abyss. The failure of Israel to achieve its unwarranted objectives, and the inability of the US to bringIranto its knees, could and still can engulf this region and by extension the entire world in a forever war.Enough is enough. We must take the future of our region’s security into our own hands. It is time for theMiddle East and north Africato move beyond empty rhetoric and towards genuine regional cooperation – based on mutual respect and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. That is why we propose the creation of the Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement, or Menara, which fittingly means “lighthouse” in Arabic.Menara would be a regional body designed to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation among its members. Open to all qualified states in the Middle East and north Africa, to join, countries must reject the development or deployment of nuclear weapons and commit to mutual verification of their compliance. In return, Menara would help them benefit from peaceful nuclear technology, including energy production, medicine, agriculture and scientific research.Such a body is not a substitute for disarmament – it is a step towards it. Regional nuclear cooperation, with strong safeguards and mutual oversight, can strengthen non-proliferation and enhance energy security without enabling militarisation.It has long been argued that progress on regional disarmament must wait for Israel to disarm. But a regime that has shown no regard for international legitimacy by committing international crimes such as apartheid, genocide and, most recently, mass starvation will hardly be influenced by this negative pressure – it certainly has not been for more than 50 years. And its perilous nuclear arsenal has been and will always remain the gravest threat to international non-proliferation and regional and global peace and stability. Holding hundreds of millions of people hostage to one regime’s nuclear arsenal and political impunity is a recipe for permanent instability. We must find a new way forward.Menara would also help reframe the nuclear debate in the region. For too long, nuclear issues have been cast solely in terms of risk and threat. But nuclear science also offers solutions – to the climate crisis, water scarcity, food security and energy diversification. As oil and gas reserves dwindle, nuclear energy will be vital for regional growth and sustainability. Menara can make this future a shared, secure reality.Here’s how it would work. Menara would coordinate research, education and development across member states. It would support joint ventures in fields ranging from uranium enrichment and waste management to nuclear fusion and medicine. Members would share facilities, pool expertise and ensure transparency through a joint regulatory board. Contributions would be proportional to each country’s capacity, but every member would benefit.The network would be headquartered in one of the participating countries, with branch offices and potentially shared enrichment facilities in others. Oversight would be conducted by a board of governors composed of national representatives, with international observers from the UN, the security council and the International Atomic Energy Agency invited to participate. Crucially, Menara would include robust mutual safeguards to prevent the diversion of materials for military use.Today, more than ever, we in the Middle East and north Africa region have been woken up to a collective cognisance of the horrifying picture of our future unless we seize this moment. We know that mistrust runs deep in our region. Iran has its grievances and so do others. But history must not define our destiny.We call on the nations of the Middle East and north Africa to endorse Menara and begin formal negotiations on its structure, mandate and membership criteria. A regional summit – under the auspices of the UN and with support from global powers – could lay the foundation. Such a step would not only reduce the risk of nuclear conflict but also offer a model for cooperation in a fractured world.The status quo is unsustainable. The nightmare of escalation and its inherent potential to cause proliferation is no longer hypothetical; it is dangerously close to becoming real. But there is still time to choose a different path.Menara can be a beacon guiding us towards a future where the Middle East is no longer a battleground for nuclear brinkmanship, but a leader in peace, progress and responsible energy.

Get a landlineEmma BrockesA group of parents in Maine were wary of buying smartphones for their 10-year-olds – and took a drastic stepThu 31 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 11.46 EDTShareAmong the many useless but consoling facts I’ve hung on to at the expense of real knowledge is the telephone number of my best friend from high school. I can say it in my head – 612505 – and, like a combination lock, it throws open the door to a memory of me sitting on the stairs after school, yakking to the person I’d just said goodbye to on the bus. Given it’s more than 30 years since I used that number, I have to assume it will stay with me – along with the lyrics to the Cadbury’s Roses ad from 1983, the name of the fictional head teacher ofSummer Bay High (Mr Fisher)and my own telephone number from that era (623492) – until the day I die.I hadn’t given much thought to landlines or the teenage experience of sitting on them after school every day, until a recent piece in the Atlantic shared the results of a small, highly localised experiment: in Portland, Maine, a parent nervous of giving her 10-year-old child a smartphone took the eccentric step ofreintroducing a landline, and then persuaded the parents of her child’s friends to do the same. Before she knew it, between 15 and 20 families in the area had reinstalled landlines for their preteens in what the Atlantic called a “retro bubble”. Charming scenes ensued, communications habits changed, and everyone learned a valuable lesson about the advantages of ancient technology.The funny thing about this is that unlike the brick phone, another answer to the puzzle of how to keep children off social media, the families of Portland discovered that the very thing that limits the landline – the fact it’s attached to the wall – turned out to be one of its big attractions. Most families put the phone in a high-traffic area of the house, keeping their kid at least notionally in the mix rather than shut away in their room. This was a tactic popular in the early days of home computers, when parents would put the family’s single, giant desktop on a table in the kitchen so the kid wasn’t isolated or left alone with “the internet”, a healthy instinct that smartphones effectively killed.For the kids involved, pivoting to landlines entailed a conceptual leap as big as any they’d encountered: the amazing Russian roulette of having to pick up a ringing phone to discover who was on the other end; the mediation experience of having to say hello to a parent and ask politely to be put through to their child; the need to memorise a number; and the wildest thing of all, trying to remember that phoning a friend on a landline meant that, if they picked up, they could only possibly be in one place, so that shouting “ARE YOU HOME?!” down the phone, as one young case study did, made no sense whatsoever (but was very funny).None of the families involved had an interest in reducing the contact their children had with their friends. But they were concerned with the issue of distraction – that kids speaking to each other on smartphones are often scrolling at the same time – and one of the reported findings was that the old-fashioned phones encouraged them to become “better listeners”. For anyone who grew up getting home from school, changing out of their uniform and getting straight on the phone to carry on the conversation they’d broken off an hour earlier, this idea of extracting formal skills and takeaways from basic behaviours seems part of the broader parenting shift towards turning every last thing into an effing learning experience.On the other hand, I get it; the appeal of old phones is rooted in nostalgia but also in the idea that there is something wholesome about the relative transparency of landlines and returning to a way of doing things that, while it annoyed parents back in the day, didn’t strike the fear of God into them. Pre-mobile phones, the main anxiety suffered by parents with kids who were forever on the phone was that they were going to “run up the bill”, “tie up the line”, or fritter their life away gossiping, all adorably quaint concerns. No one can groom or catfish a child via a hunk of plastic attached to the wall.What was the takeaway for us, who grew up on landlines? I guess if mobiles these days exert an enormous gravitational pull in our pockets, still some other order of magic existed around the old landlines. “I’ll get it!”; “it’s for me!”; redundant phrases now that, back then, spoke to the tiny thrill of election that came from receiving a call via the family phone – and like ghosts from the deep past, the lifelong dedication to memory of the numbers.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionTelecomsChildrenSmartphonesMobile phonesFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Our politicians must not allow the EHRC to further shatter trans livesThu 31 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 05.48 EDTShareThe supreme court judgment on the application of the 2010 Equality Act has rendered the UK’s system of legal gender recognition entirely hollow. It has ruled thatmen like me who have gender recognition certificates are defined as women in equality law, which applies to organisations ranging from workplaces to public services and sporting bodies. Vice versa for trans women.For context, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 was passed after the European court of human rights ruled that the “intermediate zone”, between two sexes, in which trans people were then forced to exist was – and, crucially, remains – unlawful. Under the Gender Recognition Act, I am male “for all purposes”, but the supreme court decided this is not the case under the Equality Act.In effect, it is not the casein public.Having run what human rights organisations criticised as anunusually shortsix-week public consultation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will soon update its code of practice about how this legal interpretation of the Equality Act will be applied. This will then go to parliament to be approved by ministers, as things stand,with no opportunity for debate.Far from clarity,experts arguethat the supreme court ruling has created legal uncertainty and contradiction and that the EHRC’s response has been highly questionable. Rather than despair, as understandable as that would be, many trans people live in hope that their MPs are fair, ethical people, who have simply not had the opportunity to fully understand any of this. Which is why, late last month, roughly 900 people travelled from as far as Scotland and Cornwall to queue outside parliament in punishing heat to meet them in person.Many of those people were trans. Others were their loved ones, colleagues and allies. Westminster Hall and the lobby grew so busy that many never got inside. Those who hadn’t managed to pre-book a meeting with their MP queued again in the hubbub to “green card” their representative, an arcane system whereby a constituent requests their presence via a slip of green paper. Organisers were surprised by how many MPs spoke to, perhaps for the first time, someone who happened to be trans. Trans Solidarity Alliance’s director, Jude Guaitamacchi, described the conversations in stark terms: “It’s ‘Look me in the eye and tell me you’re willing to destroy my life’.”This is known as a mass lobby, a direct and old-fashioned tactic for getting MPs’ attention. What choice do trans people have at this point? Over the past 10 years, their rights have been chipped away in Britain, their lives made increasingly difficult byanti-trans lobbyistswith more influential connections and far more money. Systemic transphobia has captured our public institutions with terrifying speed. For its part, the supreme court refused to hear anyinterventions from trans people before deciding on its recent, devastating ruling.Things were so different in 2016. When North Carolina passed a shocking “bathroom bill” banning trans people from using the correct bathroom, the Labour MP Ruth Cadbury told the Commons that “a bathroom bill would never be passed here in the UK”. In the same debate, the Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage welcomed a new NHS policy prescribing cross-sex hormones to young gender-variant people, acknowledging this was “consistent with international guidelines”, a description that, were it not forwell-documented lobbying, would hold today.Maria Miller, a former Conservative MP, cited fairer treatment of trans prisoners as progress “on which Britain leads the way”. Concluding,she said: “Better protecting trans people does not mean diminishing the protections in place for women. It is not a zero-sum game and we should not allow those who attempt to paint it as such, and who try to undermine the position and legitimate rights of trans people, to succeed.” What on earth has happened? Today, any MP who dared say that protecting trans people and protecting women go hand in hand would incur the wrath of politicians and commentators from the right to the centre left.Perhaps current Labour ministers privately justify the state’s capitulation to the anti-trans lobby as political expediency. Perhaps they did the same when branding many peaceful protesters against genocide as terrorists. This government is makingdecisionafterdecisionthat betrays its own principles and those of itsactual voters, who will not be fooled again. It’s cold comfort that trans people are not alone in being thrown under the bus by a PM whopromised an endto culture wars.Maybe the growing number of MPs who feel betrayed by their leaders are reason for hope. They must find the courage to defend their trans constituents, too. Whether they cite the UK’svertiginous slidedown European LGBTQ+ rights rankings, the Council of Europe beingasked to investigatethe proposed implementation of the ruling or the contents of the more than 50,000 responses to the EHRC’s public consultation on its code of practice, they will not lack for evidence to back them up.MPs who attended the mass lobby probably learned alarming things about what the EHRC’s code of practice might look like, based on the interim guidance it released in April, which is being challenged in the high cout by the Good Law project. They might have heard from the news or comment pages that women who are trans may be banned from women’s loos and shelters. What they probably did not hear is that the EHRC’s interim guidance also says a women-only gardening club with more than 25 members will belegally requiredto exclude a trans woman, even if she’s legally a woman, and even if her fellow members want her there.Transgender campaigners call for European rights body to report on UKRead morePerhaps you’re just learning this, too. If so, pause a moment longer to consider what this would mean. This guidance, were it to become legally enshrined, would rob citizens, trans and otherwise, of the freedom to choose whom they associate with and to recognise others for who they truly are.It not only takes away trans peoples’ right to define themselves in relation to their families and friends, but the freedom of those families and friends too. Does someone married to a trans woman no longer have a wife? Does the mother of a trans son, against her better knowledge, now have a daughter?What does this say about the courts’ and government’s readiness to curtail the freedoms of other minorities that, through no fault of their own, become politically inconvenient?The fight for trans safety is a fight for everyone’s safety, whatever your identity, however you present, whatever your beliefs. The decade-long campaign against trans people is not about anyone’s safety. It is exactly what it looks like: an organised effort to drive a tiny minority from public life, back into the closet.Do not let yourselves be fooled. MPs, consider what has changed since 2016 (hint: it isn’t trans people), listen to what you heard at the mass lobby, heed the 100,000 who marched for London trans pride last weekend. The EHRC’s proposals must be properly challenged and debated. This is a litmus test for the country’s soul, wounded as it is, though not yet dead.Freddy McConnell is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But he wasn’t perfect – and didn’t face the challenges of todayThu 31 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 11.27 EDTShareWe raised a glass last Saturday evening, the four of us, to toast the 80th anniversary of the 1945Labourgovernment. None was old enough to remember the event itself, but three of us were born while Clem Attlee was prime minister. In a funny way, I still take a kind of childish pride from that inheritance, as if a piece of that distant era somehow transferred itself by osmosis into my DNA. A photograph of Attlee in old age, taken and given to me by the late Sally Soames, is a treasured possession too.Our little group was certainly not alone this summer in marking Attlee’s anniversary. There have been TV documentaries and, most substantially, David Runciman’s fascinating Postwar series on BBC Radio 4. All of these start – and Runciman’s series also ends – with the same enduringly astounding fact about Britain in 1945. Weeks after Winston Churchill had led the country to victory inthe war in Europe, the voters rejected him by a landslide in favour of Attlee’s Labour.Yet Labour’s triumph was led by the least triumphalist or bombastic of men. Eighty years ago, on 26 July 1945, the Daily Mail, bullying and wrong as always, warned Labour to accept its expected defeat “like men, and not like spoilt children”. That evening, driven there by his wife in the family car, Attlee went to Buckingham Palace to become prime minister. Peter Hennessy records that Attlee’s audience with the equally self-effacing George VI began with a long silence. Eventually, Attlee broke it by announcing: “I’ve won the election.” To which the king replied: “I know. I heard it on the six o’clock news.”Eighty years on, Labour’s win, with its Commons majority of 146, remains a dumbfounding event. Although it does not cancel out Churchill’s wartime greatness, it places his reputation in a wider context. Labour’s victory ushered in a postwar reordering of Britain and of its role in the world, embodied by Indian independence in 1947, the creation of the National Health Service a year later, and by the creation of Nato in 1949. And all this was overseen by a leader who was, in almost every aspect of his character, Churchill’s antithesis.So far, so fairly familiar. Yet if Conservative Britain’s foundation myth was born in 1940, when the country stood alone under Churchill, modern Labour still sees its own finest hour in the “never again” mood that carried Attlee into office in 1945. Attlee knew what he wanted from his government – a comprehensive postwar welfare state in the wake of the Beveridge report – and he appointed some seriously stroppy big beasts as ministers to achieve it. He made a team out of his rivals. His stock has only grown with the years.Just as Conservative leaders invoke Churchill and then Margaret Thatcher, Labour leaders of every stripe must still claim their inspiration from Attlee. No other Labour politician except Aneurin Bevan comes even close. All are measured against Attlee, not leastKeir Starmer, another self-effacing Labour leader who seems good in a crisis and in whom admirers perceive hidden depths that are rarely shared with the public.View image in fullscreenClement Attlee smiles to well-wishers outside Transport House after Labour’s victory in the 1945 general election. His wife, Violet, is on the left.Photograph: JA Hampton/Getty ImagesEven so, the comparison between the Attlee and Starmer eras is misleading and unhistorical. Steam-age Britain of 1945 and digital Britain of 2025 are different worlds. Unlike Starmer’s voters in 2024, Attlee’swere just emerging from a life-and-death war to which all else was subordinated. Defence spending was nearly 18% of GNP. Even at the end of 1946, almost 1.5 million people remained in uniform, policing an empire that held back an economy stretched to breaking point, and now dependent on US aid. But that is not the Britain we inhabit today.There are, of course, echoes of Attlee’s agenda in Starmer’s. But they reflect radically changed times. Palestine is the latest of these. In 1945, Britain was the administrative power in Palestine, with 100,000 UK troops policing an increasingly violent conflict between Arabs and Jews, the latter increasingly post-Holocaust refugees. The issues divided the Middle East itself, as well as the Labour party and the alliance between Britain and the US, which favoured a scale of Jewish emigration that Attlee opposed.Attlee was not an imperialist, and he often favoured self-determination. But his hand was forced, especially after the winter of 1947, by the brute fact that Britain could not afford its empire, not only in Palestine but in India and elsewhere. Attlee dumped the Palestine issue on the United Nations and pulled Britain out of India as fast as he could. Many died as a result. The US, on which Britain was economically and militarily dependent, became the chief western power in the Middle East. Eighty years on, Starmer’s difficult hand of cards on Palestine is still the one that Attlee dealt him.It is hard not to warm to Attlee’s terseness, which at times could be devastating. “Not up to the job,” he replied when a junior minister asked why he was being reshuffled. “Thank you for your letter, contents of which have been noted,” he replied to the Labour grandee who urged a change of leader before 1945. Modern politicians, Starmer included, feel they must be at the media’s beck and call, while simultaneously avoiding saying anything of substance. Attlee felt no such need. “Is there anything else you’d like to say about the coming election?” inquired an interviewer at the start of the 1951 campaign. “No,” was Attlee’s reply.Starmer v Starmer: why is the former human rights lawyer so cautious about defending human rights?Read moreWonderful. Who would dare do that today? No one. This is a different world. A prime minister with Attlee’s no-nonsense briskness is as inconceivable as one with Churchill’s alcohol consumption. Attlee was a great Labour leader, yet he concealed Britain’s secret postwar nuclear programme from his cabinet, and the landslide of 1945 was followed by the collapse of 1950 and defeat the following year. Few now argue that the humbling of 1951 would have been averted by more socialist policies. It was simply an impossibly difficult time, in which Attlee grasped, as his biographer John Bew puts it, that “from the moment that Labour accepted the responsibility for governance, it could not afford to think in terms of utopias”.Don’t romanticise Attlee. He does not need that. In any case, it is a mistake to judge today’s politicians by speculations about how those from earlier generations might have behaved if they were operating in today’s different conditions. That’s a mug’s game. It is as unhistorical in its way as attempts to wag your finger too relentlessly at the past for its inevitable failings. The case for Attlee in his own time is clear. That for Starmer, in his different time, remains in the balance. They are onboard recognisably similar boats, but they are not and cannot ever be borne by the selfsame river.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Those who oppose him tend to fall out of windows or suffer other “accidents” or go to prison.If he agrees to a ceasefire, it will be only to gain time to replenish his forces before trying again. All that would stop him then would be armed peacekeepers of some kind, as is alreadybeing discussed. If someone replaces him from his inner circle, there is unlikely to be change.However, somewhere well-hidden in Moscow, there must be people yearning for real peace, which would include recognisingUkraineas a sovereign country, just as during the cold war there were people fairly well-hidden in the communist establishment who yearned for democracy. They got their chance when Mikhail Gorbachev became leader in 1985. Sadly, the chance was bungled.While waiting with slender hopes for the appearance of these benign forces, it is worth reminding everyone that there is an organisation in place with many of the skills and machinery for promoting democracy and peace in Europe. This is theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding document, generally known as “the Helsinki final act”.Theaccord was signedin the Finnish capital on 1 August 1975 by 35 presidents, prime ministers and other leaders from both sides of the iron curtain: all of Europe, east and west, plus the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. Only Maoist Albania declined Finland’s invitation to explore how adversaries, armed to the teeth with nuclear and conventional weapons, could find some common ground as the basis for eventual peace.The adoption of the Helsinki final act was the dramatic and unexpected product of nearly three years of intense negotiation. Moscow and its allies wanted to put a seal on the postwar order inEurope, including the division of Germany and Soviet rule over the unhappy people of central and eastern Europe. During those three years, however, it was turned around, mainly by the nine members of the European community – in which Britain played an important role – to become instead an exciting agenda for change.Will we ever see despots like Putin in court? It’s unlikely – and that’s the west’s fault too | Simon TisdallRead moreThe final act allowed frontiers to be changed by peaceful means, thereby keeping open the road to German (and Irish) unification. It committed signatories to increase military transparency through a catalogue of “confidence-building measures”, and it defined an ambitious set of activities to facilitate trade, cultural contacts and the freer movement of people and information “of all kinds”.Most significantly of all, as it turned out,it pledged signatories to“respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief”, stipulating that this was an essential basis for peace in Europe.In the following years, the authoritarian governments that signed the final act made only small, grudging moves towards implementing those pledges. But they were eagerlytaken up by dissidents,who collected thick dossiers of abuses of human rights to present to liberal governments and pressure groups, which then forced the Soviet Union to accept human rights as a subject for negotiation.In other words, a factor in mutual security was how governments treat their people. This was an important innovation in international diplomacy. Gradually this intense activity around human rights in the Soviet empire helped to punch holes in the iron curtain, weaken the regimes and lay some of the groundwork for the peaceful ending of the cold war.This became known as the “Helsinki effect”. The legitimacy of the final act derived from the fact that it was not a stitch-up between great powers but the result of 35 states negotiating doggedly until they reached consensus.Will there be another “Helsinki effect”? Not in that form, and certainly not immediately, as repression in Putin’sRussiais harsher than that of the ailing Soviet Union in its dying days. The Russian president has also severely weakened the OSCE by violating most of its pledges, including its foundational commitments to international peace and the nonviolent settlement of disputes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Importantly, the OSCE remains uniquely inclusive – it is the sole regional organisation of which Ukraine, the US and Russia are members – and it possesses longstanding experience and considerable expertise in promoting cooperation. It has the potential to help broker and monitor a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine when the time is right.OnThursday, member states will congregate in Helsinki to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the final act, in the same Finlandia Hall where it was signed. The accord was a masterpiece of diplomacy and a milestone in European history whose vision remains as relevant as ever: a peaceful and cooperative Europe whose governments respect international law and protect human rights.Its institutional offspring, the OSCE, cannot realise this noble vision by itself, but it remains an important vehicle for seeking peace through diplomacy.Kai Hebel is author of Britain, Détente, and the Helsinki CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe); he is assistant professor of international relations at Leiden University.

In stark terms: there will be more victims because of the CLP’s policiesWed 30 Jul 2025 22.26 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Jul 2025 22.27 EDTShare“We expect the usual offender apologists to criticise our efforts”. So said the Northern Territory’s chief minister, Lia Finocchiaro, in an Instagram post this week announcing her Country Liberal party government’s newest changes to the NT’s youth justice laws since coming to power in August.The most notorious among the CLP’s third set of amendments to youth justice laws in under a year is thereintroduction of spit hoods, now to be called “anti-spit guards”, into youth detention centresincluding Don Dale. Spit hoods became emblematic of what a royal commission found in August 2016 was a system in which children were verbally and physically abused and humiliated contrary to international law in prison-like youth detention centres that were unfit for accommodating children, let alone rehabilitating them.Among the critics of the reintroduction of “anti-spit guards” have been Mindy Sotiri, executive director of the Justice Reform Initiative; Karly Warner, the chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services; and the NT’s own children’s commissioner, Shahleena Musk.Are these leaders “offender apologists”? Finocchiaro wants to cast the CLP’s critics as people who are somehow accepting of terrible violence. In the same Instagram post, Finocchiaro justified these latest changes – which also include lowering the bar before force is used against children in detention, and broadening the kinds of force that can be used to include dogs – by referring to a shocking incident last weekend in which a 15-year-old boy was stabbed at the Royal Darwin Show.Advocates criticise ‘dangerous’ NT plan to reintroduce spit hoods in youth detention centresRead moreThe CLP’s pattern is now clear. The opposition leader, NT Labor’s Selena Uibo, called the newest amendments a “reactive, knee-jerk response”. But it’s more likely that they’ve sat in Finocchiaro’s “to be actioned” tray for some time. It takes time to draft laws, and these latest changes appeared just three days after the Royal Show.In its first sitting week after returning to power, the CLPlowered the age of criminal responsibility back down to 10. And following a horrific home invasion, the CLP immediately tightened bail laws. Rather than rushed and kneejerk, the CLP’s trilogy of amendments to youth justice laws have been patient and opportunistic. They are consistent with an ideological opposition among many detention centre staff and corrections and police officers to the changes demanded by theroyal commissioninto the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory.Most youth crime is committed by a relatively small number of children, some of whom commit an enormous number of offences. Evidence, in the form of research into this small cohort of repeat offenders and why they behave as they do, supports targeted, therapeutic approaches that aim to address underlying reasons and causes. The overwhelming majority of kids who offend have led extraordinarily traumatic lives. Often, they were victims of serious abuse and neglect long before they began breaking and entering, or hurting people. The evidence shows that reacting to these kids’ bad behaviour with violence (or “force”) and aggression simply heaps more trauma on existing trauma – and makes it more likely that the offending behaviour escalates rather than resolves.People like Sotiri, Warner and Musk accept this evidence base. The reason they’re critical of laws that authorise reactive force rather than encourage therapeutic intervention is that they know such laws will only make the existing problem worse. But therapeutic intervention just doesn’t exist, even when it’s been court-ordered. When children who have been traumatised inside detention centres are released, they will be more, not less, likely to commit further offences. In stark terms: there will be more victims as a result of the CLP’s policies.But the people who accept this evidence base are not the CLP’s constituents. During the last decade, non-Labor parties across the country have discovered a growing appetite among communities of resentment – fuelled by online echo-chambers and shock-jock opinionistas – for reactionary approaches that get tougher and tougher on criminalised kids, and that blame what it calls “soft” approaches by governments more interested in the evidence. (Finocchiaro herself talks about the “soft, offender-first policies” of her Labor predecessors.)The CLP was the first to ride this wave of reaction into power. The Liberal National Party in Queensland was the second, inOctober, by promising what it called “adult crime, adult time”. Ironically, most of this crime is more accurately characterised as juvenile, in the sense that it’s perpetrated by kids and young adults with damaged or under-developed pre-frontal cortexes.But it’s politics and ideology, not evidence, that guide what we might call the “Northern approach” to youth crime, following the united approachannouncedby Finocchiaro and Queensland’s police minister, Dan Purdie, after he visited Darwin this month. No doubt we haven’t seen the last of its regressions.Russell Marks is a criminal defence lawyer and adjunct research fellow at La Trobe University.

Do you still feel this way?FioreSebekI don’t remember saying that, but I can see how someone might joke about it. There’s usually room for improvisation in life, but I have never been a very good improviser when it comes to acting. When I do things in my own accent, likeJack Irish, he was quite laissez-faire and flippant, so I could be looser and pull stuff out of the air. But when I’m working with high-powered actors and speaking with a tricky accent, I’m learning my lines, doing what’s required and staying in control.If you were attending a dinner party where all the other guests were characters you have played, who would you sit next to, and who would you avoid?FrocksAwayI’d avoid Eric fromThe Roverand the Reverend fromBrimstone, because they might kill me. Ed Exley from LA Confidential is quite arrogant and boring. I’d like to sit next to Andy Warhol, who I’ve played [in Factory Girl]. Houdini would be interesting, although I don’t reckon you’d get a word in. And Leonard from Memento would start with dessert and finish with the starter because he’s all backwards.View image in fullscreen‘I’m with her all the way’ … Pearce as Mike from Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockI love my partner dearly, but she says if she was ever going to leave me, it would be for “Mike from Neighbours”.What can I do to make her stop? Perhaps you can tell her for me?TooMuchSpareTimeNo, I’m not going to make her stop. I’m with her all the way if she thinks: if you’re going to have an affair, make sure you have one with Annette Bening, or whoever. Maybe she needs to watch a couple of the horrible characters I’ve played, like Charley Rakes inLawless. That’s another character I don’t want to sit next to. She should watch Brimstone and Lawless, and I can guarantee you she will have lost interest in Mike from Neighbours.When they first sent you the script forMemento, was it backwards?lagodelunaView image in fullscreenBrilliantly constructed … Pearce as Leonard Shelby in Memento.Photograph: Danny Rothenberg/Summit/Kobal/ShutterstockIt was exactly as you see it in the film. Speaking of people who are in control of what they’re doing, Christopher Nolan is king of that, because he so brilliantly constructed something where there was no room for things to move around. When my agent sent me the script, he said: “By the way, this all goes backwards.” I’m glad he did, otherwise I would have read it three times before I got what was going on.Any news about thePriscilla, Queen of the Desertsequel? Have you boarded the lavender bus again, or are you still stuck in the pre-production desert?badrobot2 and feirefitzWe’re stuck in the pre-production desert, going back and forth on the script, locations and budget. I feel there’s enough love in the room to make it happen.View image in fullscreenPearce (right) looking fabulous with Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyI don’t know if I am looking forward to putting on a dress again. I don’t think I’m going to look as good in a frock as I did in 1993 when I was 25. Funnily enough, I was contacted by Madame Tussauds, who were setting up in Australia and wanted to have iconic Australian actors, like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Russell Crowe from Gladiator, Eric Bana from Chopper and me from Priscilla. I was filming Prometheus in London, so they said: “Could you come in to Madame Tussauds and stand in your underwear, pulling this pose” – they had a photo – “and we’re going to take six million photos from every angle?” I said: “This is 2011. I’m not in the same shape that I was in 1993.” They went: “Yes, yes, yes. Everyone wants bigger muscles and bigger boobs. We’ll make the clay model first, you can come in, and if there’s anything you don’t like, you can let us know.” So I had to go in and say: “If you look at this photo, my waist used to be a little bit thinner,” and they said: “Oh yeah, good point.”Did you have an inkling that LA Confidential would be such a masterpiece while you were filming it?GasparGarcaoView image in fullscreen‘The whole thing was so big’ … Pearce, left, and James Cromwell in LA Confidential.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarNo, is the answer. I don’t really have an inkling for anything. I’d done four or five films in Australia, but it was a totally different environment: in the US, with Americans, on an American film. The whole thing was so big, it was hard for me to gauge anything. I was too focused on trying to do a good job to think: “Wow, this is going to be good.” I was the second person cast after Russell Crowe. Russ and I were rehearsing while they were working with the script, and casting other people. So then David Strathairn, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito turned up.James Cromwellsays to my character in the film: “Would you be willing to shoot a hardened criminal in the back to save face?” I say: “No no no,” being all moral, but in the end, I shoot him in the back. When I shot him, the wadding from the shotgun flew out and hit him in the back of the head. He was 30ft away, so everyone had said: “Don’t worry, it’s safe.” But, for a moment, I thought: “Jeez. I’ve killed him. I’ll never work in Hollywood again.”Was there a particularrole that earned you Radiohead’s nod of approval to appear in their music video forFollow Me Around?McScootikinsI don’t think so. They contacted my agent in the US saying: “Do you have any actors who might want to do it?” And Chris, my agent, who knows I’m a big Radiohead fan, said straight away: “Guy Pearce is in London right now.” I was filmingA Spy Among Friendswith Damian Lewis and said: “I have to take a call with Thom Yorke about this Radiohead music video I’m in. So, excuse me.”Are you grateful that your late 80s pop career didn’t take off?Megapode777That’s the best question I’ve ever been asked in my life. After I finishedNeighbours, there was a period where people would say: “Didn’t you used to be Mike from Neighbours?” Then one day, this 10- or 12-year-old kid came up to me in a shopping centre and said: “Didn’t you used to be Guy Pearce?” I thought: “Wow, that’s the most profound thing anyone’s ever said,” because, in a way, it was true.I always knew I wasn’t just a soap opera actor. I was just stuck in that cycle. Prior to Neighbours, I’d done 10 years of theatre, which made playing the same character for four years frustrating. I wanted to delve into a wider variety of personalities and behaviours. But when I finished Neighbours in 1989, I was in the wilderness because no one wanted to employ the guy who was in Neighbours, and I struggled to find work. I went back and did some theatre, a little bit of Home and Away and then, in 1993, I got to do Priscilla. So, yes, I’mreallygrateful that my 80s pop career didn’t take off!Inside is available on digital, DVD and Blu-ray on 11 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewGuy PearceMementoNeighboursThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertRadioheadDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Dennis Parker – Like an Eagle (1979)It perhaps stretches the definition of “actor”: Parker starred in a soap opera, but was better known as pornographic actor Wade Nichols. However, Like an Eagle is incredible, a soaring, euphoric mid-tempo disco epic produced by his then-partner, Jacques Morali – and infinitely cooler than Morali’s biggest successes with Village People – so let’s bend the rules.19. William Shatner – Mr Tambourine Man (1968)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PictureLux/Hollywood Archive/AlamyCaptain Kirk’s debut album raises questions: are its hysterical recitations of pop hits and Shakespeare soliloquies meant to be funny or a wildly misguided attempt at out-there art? They sound nuts either way. Later albums, where Shatner is audibly in on the joke, are somehow less fun; they’re certainly less disturbing.18. Scarlett Johansson – Song for Jo (2008)Produced by TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek, Johansson’s debut album was heavy on Tom Waits covers and featured a cameo from David Bowie. It received a mixed response. As this self-penned song proves, it’s pretty good, its dark, foggy atmospherics suggesting a love of This Mortal Coil.17. Wicked Wisdom – Bleed All Over Me (2006)If you want evidence of where Willow Smith’s eclectic musical taste came from, her mother Jada’s penchant for nu-metal seems a good place to start. Bleed All Over Me is great: the guitars rage, former Fishbone drummer Philip Fisher adds a swing, and Jada Pinkett Smith’s vocals are really powerful.16. Anna Karina – Roller Girl (1967)The queen of the nouvelle vague sang in Godard’s Une Femme Est une Femme but recorded only intermittently: in her 70s, she worked with Giant Sand’s Howe Gelb. The pick of her oeuvre is the raw, gleeful garage rock of Roller Girl, the first – but not last – credit for songwriter Serge Gainsbourg in this list.15. She & Him – In the Sun (2010)Some of Zooey Deschanel’s indie-rock collaborations with M Ward as She & Him are a little too sugary for their own good. But the lead single from their second album, Volume Two, hits the mark: a melding of smooth 70s soft rock and jazzy pre-rock’n’roll pop that’s as warm and lovely as its title suggests.14. Sophie Thatcher – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door (2024)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sipa US/AlamyThe star of Yellowjackets released a debut EP of experimental pop last year. This, her follow-up, was her intriguing contribution to the soundtrack of thehorror film Heretic, a hazy cover of the Bob Dylan classic set to the melody – and the mood – of Mazzy Star’s Fade Into You. It fits with the film, but works perfectly in its own right.13. David Hemmings – Back Street Mirror (1967)The Blow Up star’s debut album, David Hemmings Happens, is impressively star-studded: he is backed by various members of the Byrds and legendary LA session players the Wrecking Crew for a collection of improvised jazzy psychedelia and baroque folk-rock. Its real classic is this otherwise unreleased song by former Byrd Gene Clark: a world-weary minor masterpiece.12. Tracey Ullman – They Don’t Know (1983)Why They Don’t Know was not a hit for its composer, Kirsty MacColl, is an enduring mystery: apparently written when she was 16, it’s a dizzyingly perfect pop song. It finally made the UK and US Top 10 thanks to Ullman’s brief sojourn as a pop singer, helping to kickstart her wildly successful career in the US.11. Jane Birkin – Encore Lui (1973)There was far more to Jane Birkin’s singing career than theheavy-breathing scandal of Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus: her 70s albums are particularly fine examples of leftfield francophone pop. From her solo debut album, Di Doo Dah, Encore Lui is understated, fabulously orchestrated and supremely cool.10. Lace Manhattan – In the Sun She Lies (2025)Margaret Qualley certainly isn’t the only US actor to pursue a parallel career in acoustic alt-rock, but In the Sun She Lies – produced by her husband,Jack Antonoff, for a new Ethan Coen film called Honey Don’t! – is impressively, naggingly odd: swathed in spooky echo, backed by the sound of gusting winds and abstract guitar noise, occasionally dying away entirely.9. Sam Morton – Let’s Walk in the Night (2024)Samantha Morton’s collaborative album with producer andXL Recordings boss Richard Russell, Daffodils & Dirt, was a leftfield delight: its moody brand of trip-hop revivalism is perfectly encapsulated by the darkly seductive, distinctly nocturnal pop of Let’s Walk in the Night, the jazzy sax provided byAlabaster DePlume.8. Matt Berry – Take My Hand (2009)Matt Berry is an astonishingly prolific musician, turning out everything from proggy folk to ambient synth instrumentals to country rock. Take My Hand is particularly fantastic: melodic, soft-focus psychedelia with a hint of Elton John’s Song for Guy in its DNA, it’s also the theme to Toast of London.7. Jamie Foxx – I Don’t Need It (2008)Foxx’s singing career has yielded deeply variable results: you need a strong stomach to cope with him in priapic loverman mode, and his biggest success involved impersonating Ray Charles on Kanye West’s Gold Digger. I Don’t Need It, though, is great: tough, Timbaland-produced 21st-century funk.6. Dead Man’s Bones – Pa Pa Power (2009)Ryan Gosling and Zach Shields’ solitary album as Dead Man’s Bones is a curious thing: ghost-themed gothic alt-rock featuring a children’s choir on every track. But it contained one unequivocal triumph: Pa Pa Power is creepy and compelling, and was subsequentlycovered by Cat Powerto striking effect.5. Eighth Wonder – I’m Not Scared (1988)View image in fullscreenEighth Wonder.Photograph: Pictorial Press/AlamyPatsy Kensithad been an actor since childhood, but a parallel career as a pop star stubbornly refused to take off. Her band Eighth Wonder couldn’t get a hit until Pet Shop Boys gave them the haunting Europop-influenced I’m Not Scared. Success proved fleeting, but at least they left behind one fabulous single.4. Brigitte Bardot – Bonnie and Clyde (1968)Brigitte Bardot may have been an icon of French cinema, but she was no great shakes as a singer. It scarcely mattered once a lovestruck Serge Gainsbourg started turning out extraordinary songs for her. Bonnie and Clyde makes a virtue of her limited range: her voice sounds like the epitome of cool hauteur.3. John Leyton – Johnny Remember Me (1961)Feverish, cinematic and eerie, Johnny Remember Me is one of the masterpieces of pre-Beatles British pop, showcasing the late Joe Meek’s genius as a producer. It was helped to No 1 by John Leyton’s role in the TV series Harpers West One when a performance of the song was somehow worked into the plot.2. Richard Harris – MacArthur Park (1968)Harris’s late 60s collaborations with songwriter Jimmy Webb are extraordinary: lavish, lush, adventurous examples of post-Sgt Pepper experimental pop. The episodic MacArthur Park is more than seven minutes long, mystifying but utterly gripping and furthermore, a huge hit. Harris may not be the greatest singer, but he’s a captivating presence here.1. Childish Gambino – This Is America (2018)Most actors’ singing careers are an adjunct to their main gig: they might produce hits, but they seldom produce anything that garners a response like This Is America. A lot of attention was understandably directed at the choreographed violence of its extraordinary video, but the track doesn’t need visual accompaniment to strike home: trap beats and sweet choral vocals, a performance by Glover that switches from austere rapping to gentle singing, cameos from rappers including 21 Savage and Quavo, lyrics that explore systemic racism and gun violence. Not for nothing did it win song of the year at the Grammys.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockDonald GloverZooey DeschanelWilliam ShatnerScarlett JohanssonJada Pinkett SmithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now artist Pablo Bronstein has created wild mashups, complete with blue-bearded gargoyles, suggesting how it lookedOliver WainwrightThu 31 Jul 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 12.16 EDTShareNo legendary building has ever inspired more conjecture about what it might have looked like thanSolomon’s Templein Jerusalem. It is said to have been built in c.950BC, on the mound where God created Adam, and was destroyed 400 years later by marauding Babylonians. But, beyond some inconsistent descriptions in the Bible written centuries after the temple was razed, there is no archaeological evidence that this palatial edifice ever existed.And yet, for more than two millennia, generations of architects, archaeologists and ideologues have bickered over the building’s appearance. They have debated its exact height and width, speculated on the design of its columns, and battled over the precise nature of its porch. The mythic building, also known as the First Temple, has inspired everything from a Renaissanceroyal palace in Spainto arecent megachurch in Brazil, to theinteriors of masonic lodges around the world– all built on a fantasy.“It really draws out the batshit crazy,” says Argentinian artist Pablo Bronstein, standing in front of hismonumental new drawingsof what Solomon’s Temple, and its contents, might have looked like. “It has been used as a cipher for pretty much every crazy projection of power and self-delusion for 2,500 years. I find it totally fascinating – particularly as the whole thing is entirely fabricated.”View image in fullscreenWild ride … the eccentric zoologist Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild (1868-1937).Photograph: The Natural History Museum/AlamyBronstein’s work has long played with the provocative power of architectural image-making. He has poked fun atBritain’s pseudo-Georgian housingand given us orgiasticdepictions of hell, which he imagined as a showcase city strewn with garish monuments worthy of the most tasteless dictator. But the subject matter, location and (incidental) timing of his latest mischievous outing couldn’t be more charged.Bronstein’s speculative drawings of the holiest site in Judaism are now on display in Waddesdon Manor, an inflated French chateau built in Buckinghamshire in the 1890s as the weekend party pad of the Rothschilds – an immensely wealthy Jewish banking family who were instrumental in the creation of Israel. Baron Edmond de Rothschild – the French cousin of Baron Ferdinand, who built Waddesdon – financed a number of early settlements in Palestine and founded thePalestine Jewish Colonisation Associationin 1924, run by his son James, who inherited the manor.When the Balfour Declaration was written in 1917, declaring the British government’s support for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, it was addressed to Ferdinand’s nephew, Walter Rothschild,an eccentric zoologistwho liked to pose astride giant tortoises, ride a carriage drawn by zebras andwho was also a prominent Zionist leader.View image in fullscreen‘Totally fascinating’ … artist Pablo Bronstein.Photograph: Sophie DavidsonA permanent exhibition at Waddesdon, in a room preceding Bronstein’s show, celebrates the Rothschilds’ connection with Israel. It recounts the family’s funding of the construction of the Knesset building, seat of the Israeli parliament, the Supreme Court building and, most recently, the National Library, designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron in the shape ofa swooping stone ski jump. Architectural models of these trophy buildings gleam in Perspex vitrines, like the priceless antique treasures displayed elsewhere around the house.I became fascinated by the construction of Jewish identity in the 19th centuryPablo BronsteinTo this lavish display of patronage in the Holy Land, Bronstein’s florid drawings add an imaginary additional commission. In a brazen act of architectural cosplay, the artist has inserted himself into the minds of two contestants for a fictitious version of the Prix de Rome, a prominent prize for students of architecture in 19th-century Paris, as they compete to recreate Solomon’s Temple in their own image.“I became fascinated by the construction of Jewish identity in the 19th century,” says Bronstein, who was born in Argentina, grew up in London, and describes himself as a “diehard atheist Jew”. Several years in the making, his new work was commissioned alongside a wider research project aboutJewish country houses, and it seems to have triggered a deep curiosity and scepticism in the artist about his own cultural heritage.“As nationalisms develop in the 19th century, particularly in Germany,Judaismbegins to develop its idea of a body of people that are somehow genetically connected to the ancient Middle East,” he says. “They start to see Jerusalem not as an abstract idea, the way that Muslims look at Mecca, but as a reconstructible place of belonging, tied to a kind of orientalist architectural fantasy.”View image in fullscreenA cross-section view of the gaudy version of Bronstein’s Temple of Solomon.Photograph: Jack Elliot Edwards/Pablo Bronstein. Courtesy of the artist and Herald St, LondonBronstein’s mesmerising drawings depict what, if taken to extremes, this fantasy might have looked like. Painstakingly drawn in pen and ink, and beautifully coloured with layers of acrylic wash (with the help of two recent architecture graduate assistants), the images are magnificently grandiose projections of that exoticised 19th-century longing. They depict two rival designs, in precisely detailed elevations, cross-sections and facade studies, for reconstructing the temple. Both are wild mashups of architectural motifs, sampling from the richly embellished catalogue of Asian antiquity, medieval and gothic revival, baroque and art deco with promiscuous relish.On one wall is a version of the temple that Bronstein describes as “vaudeville beaux arts”, its interior glowing with the gilded razzle-dazzle of a New Orleans casino. Marvel at the spirallingSolomonic columnsat the entrance, sampled from Bernini’s baldacchino at St Peter’s in Rome, and the illusionistic domes that hover above the Ark, influenced by Alessandro Antonelli’sMole Antonellianain Turin, which was originally conceived as a synagogue. “It’s the temple as a sort of gin palace,” says Bronstein – an architecturally virtuosic one, nonetheless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy of the artist and Herald St, LondonOn the opposite wall is a more restrained version of the temple, with interior wooden panelling that recalls the kind of synagogue you might find in Golders Green, north London – not far from where Bronstein grew up in Neasden. There are also notes of Henri Labrouste’sBibliothèque de Saint Genevièvein Paris, as well as dazzling blue lapis lazuli walls, representing the celestial realm in a medieval manner, along the lines of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the “arch-reconstructor of historic architecture”, a caption tells us. It’s a heady cocktail, made no less so by the fruity facade, which depicts the heads of Moses, David and Solomon as blue-bearded gargoyles above the entrance, and a relief of God, flanked by sphinxes.Bronstein’s flamboyant fantasies aren’t so far from what was being designed by 19th-century architects“There’s a good amount of scholarship about what a temple would have actually looked like if it was built in the 10th century BC,” says Bronstein. “And it’s got nothing to do with monotheism.” He thinks it’s much more likely that, had the temple been built at the time the Bible alleges, it is highly likely that it would have been a pantheistic riot, full of different representations of the divine – as is the case with a comparable structure that has survived inAin Dara in Syria, built in 1300BC, “which is just full of goblins, basically.”‘As thrilling as driving a sports car’: the Tokyo capsule tower that gave pod-living penthouse chicRead moreIf all this wasn’t enough, Bronstein has also drawn the Ark of the Covenant – depicted as a gilded medieval reliquary casket, topped with a cushion, where God is said to have rested his feet – and the temple’s menorah, imagined as a twirly rococo candelabrum, whose branches emerge from a chinoiserie-style grotto. Drawings from the Waddesdon archive in a following room help to set the project in context, and show that Bronstein’s flamboyant fantasies aren’t so far from what was being designed by the 19th-century architects from whom he took inspiration.View image in fullscreenA detail from Bronstein’s second version of the temple, with lapis lazuli walls.Photograph: Jack Elliot Edwards/Pablo Bronstein. Courtesy of the artist and Herald St, LondonAlarmingly, nor are they too far off what some people are still hoping to see built in Jerusalem. TheThird Temple movementcontinues to campaign to rebuild the original temple on Temple Mount, one of the most contested sites on the planet – known as the Haram al-Sharif in the Muslim world, site of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque, two of the holiest sites in Islam. We can only hope the Third Temple fanatics don’t misconstrue Bronstein’s drawings as a blueprint.He began these drawings long before war erupted in the region after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023. Has Israel’s merciless bombardment of Gaza altered his position? “The work hasn’t changed,” he says. “But the war has changed my relationship to Judaism. It made me really question the fact that we all get instinctively bullied into the idea that we have a genetic, cosmic link to the Holy Land. It’s genuinely a 19th-century construct and it’s total rubbish.”Pablo Bronstein: The Temple of Solomon and Its Contents is at Waddeston Manor, Buckinghamshire, until 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArchitectureArtJudaismHeritageThe National TrustRothschild & CoThe BiblefeaturesShareReuse this content"

After some hired dwarves caper around it, the band’s David St Hubbins complains that they looked likely to crush it underfoot.No such problems with the new version made for the long-awaited sequel Spın̈al Tap II: The End Continues, which will be released 12 September in the US and UK (and 25 September in Australia). In the scene, released today along with a recording of the song on streaming services, the band put in a considerably more triumphant performance, complete with full-sized standing stones and the return of the dwarves.Appearing in a cloak from beneath the stage is Elton John, who takes over the lead vocal, singing lyrics such as “Stonehenge, where a man’s a man / and the children dance to the pipes of Pan” with the requisite po-faced grandeur.John is one of a number of starry cameos in the film, along with Paul McCartney, Questlove, Metallica’s Lars Ulrich and more. Michael McKean reprises his role as St Hubbins alongside Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel andHarry Sheareras Derek Smalls, heading up a supporting cast filled with British comedy stars such as Nina Conti, Chris Addison and Kerry Godliman.The film will have the documentary film-maker Marty DiBergi (played by Rob Reiner) following the group as they prepare for a final reunion show. The first trailer was released earlier this week.An accompanying soundtrack album has also been announced. Elton John will appear again on Flower People, while McCartney joins them for Cups and Cakes, and country music couple Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood perform Big Bottom.Explore more on these topicsMusicSpinal TapElton JohnPop and rockComedy filmsThis Is Spinal TapComedynewsShareReuse this content"

No, not a legacy sequel, nor a Liam Neeson movie; the in-demand Irish actor still does two or three of those a year. Like its predecessors, The Naked Gun is a spoof – part of a comedic subgenre with astonishing versatility, in that it can lay claim to some of the very best and very worst comedies of all time. Maybe that’s why these movies, despite relatively low budgets and decent success rates, will sometimes disappear for years at a time. Now, in a period when a pure comedy hasn’t crossed the $100m mark in the US in almost a decade, The Naked Gun seems to be leading a revival. A sequel to the rock-doc spoof This Is Spinal Taparrivesnext month, follow-ups toScary Movieand the Mel Brooks Star Wars spoofSpaceballsare on the way, and there have even beenwhispersof a fourth Austin Powers film.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreThe leader of the latest comeback has a connection to some high-water marks: the original Naked Gun, yes, but more importantly 1980’s Airplane!, a feature-length spoof of the then-popular disaster movies from comic film-makers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker. ZAZ, as the team was known, didn’t invent the idea of parodying familiar genres in a barrage of intentional (and subverted) cliches, sight gags, puns and other stupid-clever jokes. But Airplane! took on movies like Airport with such a deadpan density, and such a shockingly high hit rate, that it wrested the spoof crown from previous king, Mel Brooks (whose Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles are still standard-bearers for loving genre parody).Brooks often appeared on camera in his films, while the ZAZ boys did not; instead, Leslie Nielsen became the face of their efforts, and an unlikely catalyst for a youth-driven trend in the process. Following his flawlessly deadpan role in Airplane! as a doctor (“I am serious … and stop calling me Shirley”), Nielsen starred in the team’s failed (but hilarious) TV procedural spoof Police Squad! which was eventually turned into the 1988 big-screen comedy The Naked Gun. The odd thing about the original Naked Gun is that, unlike Airplane!, it’s not a particularly close parody of a classic or trendy film genre. It mostly takes the framework of the Police Squad! show, which was more akin to 60s cop dramas, and throws in some elements of neo-noir crime thrillers. (There’s also a grab-bag of other assorted movie references throughout the trilogy.)Nevertheless, or perhaps because it didn’t require any specific genre knowledge, The Naked Gun was a big enough hit to inspire a pair of sequels – and plenty of knockoffs. A spoof boom lasted for most of the 90s, peaking in 1993 with National Lampoon putting their name on Loaded Weapon 1, veteran film-maker Carl Reiner contributing the erotic-thriller goof Fatal Instinct, Abrahams himself directing the Rambo-inspired Hot Shots! Part Deux, and Mel Brooks returning with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A later entry, a spoof of urban dramas with the omnibus title of Don’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, kickstarted the next generation of spoofs when writers/stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans moved on to savage resurgent horror movies with Scary Movie.A spoof built around a movie as self-aware and self-satirizing as Scream should not have worked – the Scream characters crack jokes, while The Naked Gun and its ilk tend to goof on seriousness – but it actually outgrossed its target. Later spoofs trumpeted the presence of “two of the six writers” of Scary Movie, the non-Wayans-afilliated Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who also wrote the off-brand Nielsen-starring parody Spy Hard. Friedberg and Seltzer more or less got themselves appointed the ZAZ of the 2000s, even as an actual Zucker went on to make some of the later Scary Movie sequels. Their hits include Date Movie, Epic Movie and the 300 parody Meet the Spartans.Watching the Friedberg-Seltzer spoofs of the 2000s is like watching children attempting to draw their own Looney Tunes or perform their own Saturday Night Live sketches: there’s a basic understanding of what their imitation should look like (and a compulsion to have characters crushed by falling objects) but a lack of basic craft that’s years away from passably amateurish. At times, projects like their magnum opus Disaster Movie barely seem to understand what a spoof even is; Friedberg and Seltzer know that it sometimes involves referring to other movies and/or cultural figures, which they do constantly, but are at a loss beyond ordering up a playground imitation. Look, I’m Iron Man! I’m Juno! I’m Miley Cyrus! Splat! (It almost goes without saying that the most oft-splattered targets tend to be “annoying” women.)Like Nielsen in his post-ZAZ phase multiplied by the force of a thousand suns, Friedberg and Seltzer made so many of these things, and so badly, that when they started to falter at the box office it felt like a relief. That loud, graceless sensibility has now migrated over to YouTube and TikTok, where at least the amateurs-at-heart aren’t charging viewers 10 bucks a pop for sub-skit imitations. Even some well-liked spoofs were deemed stretched thin at 85 minutes; maybe stacking dozens of quick-hit joke is a practice better-suited to shorter-form parodies.View image in fullscreenA scene from Scary Movie.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyPerhaps sensing that, or simply wanting to pay tribute to the spirit of Police Squad! rather than the more mugging-intensive later installments, the new Naked Gun doesn’t do much direct-scene parody. Its opening mimics the bank-robbing sequence from The Dark Knight in set design and score, but no one shows up in imitation Joker makeup. Director Akiva Schaffer, who knows from short-form comedy from his work as part of the Lonely Island, counterintuitively avoids taking the proliferation of a particular type of movie (like superheroes) as an imperative to spoof ’em good. That was the instinct behind the biopic parody Walk Hard, one of the last genuinely good spoofs, and a box office bomb in 2007. Instead, The Naked Gun continues to goof on cop thriller cliches and pile on the absurd puns and/or sight gags (“cold case” files in a refrigerator, a car wreck cleaned up via claw machine, etc), with the benefit of Neeson giving it his absolute best, unsmiling deadpan.So what are the conditions required for spoof movies to multiply? Several confirmed follow-ups seem well-timed if not overdue; dozens of straight-faced horror trends have come through since the most recent Scary Movie, and there’s been a 270% increase in Star Wars films since the first Spaceballs. But highly specific parodies are not always an advantage. Done well, they can be exacting, like Young Frankenstein, or a memorable compendium of cliches, like Walk Hard. Done poorly, and suddenly you’ve got unfunny mash-ups. Then again, it would also be reasonable to ask what, exactly, the new Naked Gun is satirizing.Schaffer does work in some mockery of older white men exerting an iron grip on the culture while grousing how bad the world has become. Mostly, though, this particular spoof revival offers the gleeful release of watching an intentionally fake, silly movie in a theater, sharing laughs with strangers. Spoofing a movie through at-home streaming or phone-bound TikTok is certainly possible. But gags built around violating a generally agreed-upon reality of cinema work better in its natural habitat. That’s something The Naked Gun, with its technical imitations of a “real” movie, seems to understand more than any particular cop-movie trends: that it can provide the too-rare experience of laughing throughout a deeply silly movie that’s as relentless, in its way, as the big-screen spectacle more typical of the 2020s. If the Naked Gun redo becomes the biggest comedy in months or even years, it could ease moviegoers back into the habit. If a subgenre responsible for some of the worst comedies ever made can still make ’em laugh, maybe comedy on the whole will get the chance to leave the house again.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsComedyLiam NeesonPamela AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s not not that either.The musician Georgia Maq moved from Melbourne to Los Angeles two years ago, aftersaying goodbye to her band, Camp Cope,and working as a nurse for two years during the pandemic. The move was prompted as much by television (“I watchedThe L Wordand thought, I want to live in Hollywood”) as an urgent need to not spend her entire life in the place she was born: “I was sick of who I was, really. I wanted a different life for myself.”When I ask how she describes to her new friends in the US about what her time in theAustralian musicindustry was like, she tells me: “I say, I played in a band for eight years. We were an all-girl band and people never let us forget it.”I’m speaking to Maq over Zoom, as she sits in her car. She has had an especially charged day, after fielding a phone call from a film director who’s hoping to cast her in a “chaotic and insane” role in a freaky new movie. “Am I in my actor era?” she deadpans. It would be perfectly cliche for the transplant punk to land in LA and suddenly become a film star.View image in fullscreen‘Am I in my actor era?’ … Georgia Maq.Photograph: Lee DubinSometimes, Maq feels as if she’s “too emotional” for LA. The previous day she released the glittering, tender single Slightly Below the Middle from her upcoming EP, God’s Favourite, and called her Camp Cope bandmates, Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and Sarah Thompson. They discussed Hellmrich’s upcoming book and the vinyl release of their final show together, at Sydney Opera House in 2023. The call “brought out a bunch of emotions because it’s like, no matter how far I run away, I’m still exactly who I am, and Kelly and Thomo are such a big reminder of who I am and who I was back then,” Maq says.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe three of them shared beds and vans and cramped green rooms and big stages for nearly a decade. The mirror they represent can be painful for Maq to look at: “We have good friendships, but it’s not as intense as it was back then. I wasn’t always the best person to be in a band with. And sometimes I get reminded of that when it’s just us three.”For so long, she didn’t know what her music was if it was not complemented by Hellmrich’s bass and Thomo’s drumbeat. She experimented with electro-pop production on her 2019 solo record Pleaser but since then she has found a comfortable and fertile space to play in country pop. “I’m a creature of comfort and I love a country songwriter,” she says, admitting some guilty pleasures in the form of male country artists whose reputations are anything but rosy. The irony isn’t lost on Maq: “I literally wrote The Face of God,” she scoffs, namechecking the Camp Cope song about how quickly people can write off abuse allegations if they’re levelled at a guy who makes good songs.‘You expect us not to call you out?’ – Camp Cope and the Australian musicians fighting industry sexismRead moreThroughout her career, being Georgia Maq has often meant being a vector for people’s biggest emotions. She used the platform she had as the frontperson of a popular band to advocate for change –calling for festivals she played to book more female artists, campaigning for safer crowds and namechecking abusive men in the industry – and was often criticised, by Australia’s predictable “shut up and sing” crowds, by bookers claiming festival lineups were meritocracies, by people in positions of power who’d rather see a troublemaker booted out than have the focus pulled on their bad behaviour. “The music industry … taught me that I needed to fight,”Maq proclaimed in her keynote speech at the 2023 Bigsound conference. “I am proud that dangerous men in the music industry still warn each other about me.”“I was so abrasive and reactive, and I had so much pressure on me all the time,” Maq says now. That period of her life cemented, for many people, an immovable public-facing version of herself. “I didn’t really have time to think. I was just dumb and I was angry and now … I’m not that.”View image in fullscreenCamp Cope performed their final show at the Sydney Opera House in 2023.Photograph: Jess GleesonFor years, she felt the expectation on her and the band was to make statements more than music. “That was really exhausting,” she says. Now, with time and a fresh start, she’s finding ways to let the light in. God’s Favourite, as the title suggests, is preoccupied with ideas and images of faith, repentance, sin and salvation, all set against the backdrop of swiping on dating apps, pretending you can be chill and have casual sex – then remembering, in fact, you’re too much of a romantic.“The song Citronella feels like 11am the morning after an emotional night where you’re just like, ‘What the fuck am I doing? I can’t keep doing this because it’ll never make me happy,’” she says. “I just put so much feeling behind everything. I can’t do a regular chill thing with someone. I’m not regular and chill. I’m insane.”Slightly Below the Middle sees Maq channelling a conversation with the devil, who invokes her late father, Hugh McDonald, who was a musician in the famed band Redgum. Maq was baptised in the Greek Orthodox church, but her parents didn’t instil its belief systems in her or her siblings. Still, something crept in along the way: she shows me the cross around her neck and moves the camera to capture the rosary beads hanging from her rear-view mirror. Sometimes she finds herself visiting Greek Orthodox churches in LA. “There’s a lot of standing up and sitting down and everything’s in Greek. So I have no idea what anyone’s saying,” she says – but when she goes, she feels connected to her late grandmother, who came to Australia alone at 13 from Nestani. “She never went to school or anything. She was just kind of nuts. But she really loved religion. [Going to church] is kind of my way to honour her. I go to be reminded of who I am, I guess.”The biggest story of forgiveness might be the one she’s writing for herself. She wonders aloud if maybe she’s in her “redemption arc”. “But maybe I’ve made that all up in my head,” she adds. “Maybe people don’t think I’m evil. I don’t think I’m evil, but I feel like I want people to know that I’ve changed.”Georgia Maq’s EP God’s Favourite is out 4 September.

Richard O’Brien, Barry Bostwick, Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell tell the surprising, seductive story of cinema’s longest-running cult smashThu 31 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 31 Jul 2025 06.44 EDTShareThe Rocky Horror Picture Show was released in cinemas in late 1975 with little fanfare, but the provocative musical, with its campy parody of sci-fi and horror B-movies, fabulous costumes and rollicking songs, dug its glittering heels in and refused to let go for the next 50 years.The film was an adaptation of the hit musical The Rocky Horror Show, created byRichard O’Brienwhen he was an unemployed actor. The story of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an alien, transvestite scientist, decked out like a bewitching glam rock god and hellbent on seducing everyone around him, galvanised audiences into participating in a waythat had never been seen before.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Frank-N-Furter, Rayner Bourton as Rocky, Belinda Sinclair as Janet and Christopher Malcolm as Brad in The Rocky Horror Show at the Chelsea Classic Cinema, London, in 1973.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAs its popularity grew, audiences began to take an active role in screenings – dressing up, dancing, singing along and adding their own lines of dialogue. Screenings also became safe spaces for LGBTQ+ fans, drawn to the film’s unabashed celebration of queerness, sexual liberation and gender fluidity.It remains the longest-running theatrical release in film history and still plays in cinemas today. We look back with the cast and crew to find out how the film became such a cult phenomenon.The year was 1974. Actor Richard O’Brien decided to adaptThe Rocky Horror Show for the big screen, workingwith the show’s director,Jim Sharman. They kept most of the original cast but the studio,20th Century Fox,insisted that the lead couple, Brad and Janet, were recast with Hollywood actors.Richard O’Brien,co-screenwriter, composer and Riff Raff(a“handyman”)I was approached by Mick Jagger’s people to buy the rights because he wanted to play Frank. I spoke to Jim, and he went: “No, don’t do that.” I said: “Why not?” He said: “Well, that means we won’t be able to make it.” It had never occurred to me that we’d be allowed to. By the time we got to Los Angeles, Lou Adler was the producer, and he made the overture to 20th Century Fox. Suddenly we were allowed not only to make the movie, but all be in it. The kids were allowed into the sweet shop.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Frank-N-Furter … ‘[in the film version] Frank became very glamorous – it was rather lovely.’Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyJim Sharman,director and co-screenwriterI was given two options. One was a reasonable budget with rock stars and the other one was a tiny budget keeping the original team together. I said: “Great, let’s do that.” I thought it was fine to have Americans playing the Americans, and it was great to have Barry [Bostwick] and Susan [Sarandon], who were, at that time, not particularly known.Barry Bostwick,Brad(a “hero”, who stumbles across Frank-N-Furter’s castle one stormy night along with his girlfriend Janet, played by Sarandon)It was interesting because [Susan and I replacing the original Brad and Janet] was a parallel to the characters coming into a new, strange world. Susan and I stepped into a very vibrant, glam, rocky environment in London. We were fish out of water; naive, wide-eyed and curious.Nell Campbell,Columbia (a tap-dancing “groupie” and Frank-N-Furter’s former lover)For [Bostwick and Sarandon] it was definitely a little difficult stepping into, basically, a theatre company because we’d all worked together for at least six months.Patricia Quinn,Magenta(Riff Raff’s sister and Frank-N-Furter’s “domestic”)Sharman said: “Let’s go around to [associate producer] John Goldstone’s house, and take a look at the sets and the designs.” So I went and saw this pink laboratory set. I saw Transylvanians [Frank-N-Furter’s alien companions] on motorbikes. I saw my dinner dress sketched by Sue Blane, the amazing costume designer, and I said: “Oh, I’m doing this.”View image in fullscreenDoing The Time Warp … in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyTim Curry, who had cut his teeth in the stage musical as Frank-N-Furter, made his film debut as the sex-crazed, corset-wearing scientist.BostwickI was enamoured with Tim’s acting chops. To watch him balance the meanness and darkness with the charm and seduction of that character, few people could have done that.O’BrienWhen we did it on stage, [Frank-N-Furter] was a bit more German expressionistic theatre, a lot more gothic and ghoulish, and the makeup was rougher. But when we got into the studio, Frank became very glamorous, and it was rather lovely.Production started in October 1974, ona budget of $1.4m, for nearly two months – on location inBray StudiosandOakley Court, a country housein Berkshire, which were both used for Hammer horror films.SharmanWe shot at the Hammer Horror studios as a bit of a homage. But that proved to be a little bit impractical. I made many impractical decisions. It was freezing, the middle of winter, the conditions were far from perfect.BostwickIt was a miserable shoot. I was always wet, I was in my underwear, and every 20 minutes, the prop guy was spraying me down with ice-cold water, because they apparently didn’t know how to heat up water in England at the time. So, Susan got pneumonia, and everybody had colds. I remember cursing a lot before scenes when the guy had to come by. At one point, I took the spray and started spraying him, just so he got a taste.View image in fullscreen‘The kids were allowed into the sweet shop’ … Richard O’Brien as Riff Raff, Tim Curry as Frank-N-Furter and Patricia Quinn as Magenta.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyCampbellIt was hilariously unglamorous … Mercifully, I had a fantastic silk padded dressing gown which got me through the shoot because we were half naked a lot of the time. We would have to hike to the bathrooms. And we were all being paid a very small amount.QuinnEverything was a bit of a surprise on this film. Nothing was explained. [The dining table scene didn’t have] anything to do with the play. Tim Curry was told to pull the tablecloth off the table in one fell swoop. Underneath was Meat Loaf [who played Eddie, a motorcyclist murdered by Frank-N-Furter]. I thought: “Oh my God,” because nobody told us. I got hysterics. Richard said to me: “Shut up.” It was hilarious, and it’s all in the film. There was no time to make mistakes.BostwickThe orgy in the swimming pool … We ended up on the stage, wet, in high heels, trying to do the high kicks. It took every bit of balance, energy and camaraderie to do that. Everybody was kissing and fondling underwater. And then when we got out, we went into a little warming booth. We had a cup of tea, and as we were leaving, it caught on fire. Everybody was afraid it was going to burn down the whole set, and we would be shut down. We got out just in time.They used an unusual technique to get the opening scene.QuinnJim said: “Have you ever seen Man Ray’s Lips, the painting?” “Never.” He said: “We could have your lips miming to Science Fiction.” They [erased] my face completely and painted my lips. I started to do it but the lips kept going out of frame. The lighting guy said: “You see that lamp, that’s clamped in that clamp? Bring it down and clamp her head.” So they brought over [the clamp] and screwed in the top and the sides so I was clamped … The most famous lips in cinema history.The intense shoot meant that no one had time to socialise.O’BrienWe were there first thing in the morning at six o’clock. You went home, straight to bed, to get up the next day. We didn’t have time to party.BostwickI don’t remember having dinner with anybody. I think I got to know the makeup guy better than anybody else … I was experiencing London for the first time. I spent my time at flea markets if I had a day off.QuinnWe were exhausted. I never even got to know Susan. Barry said to me once: “You never liked me.” And I said: “No, I didn’t, because I thought you were Brad” – you know, that dull person. There was no time for chit-chat.BostwickThere was a lot of pot going around in the ranks of the Transylvanians.The film flopped on itsrelease in August 1975and was panned by critics.O’BrienWe had our first viewing of the movie. We all left a little bit depressed. It seemed slow to me. It was a fast 90 minutes on stage. The film seemed more dreamlike, languid. I thought: “God, people should have picked up their cues a bit quicker.”CampbellIt was my big break, so the fact that it disappeared without a trace was very disappointing.View image in fullscreenNell Campbell as Columbia.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBostwickIt never opened in New York. Then I found out later that it hadn’t been a big hit when it opened in London.The film wasrereleased in midnight screenings in April 1976, with word-of-mouth spreading during its run atNew York’s Waverly Theater(now the IFC Center). Fans started to yell out their own responses to lines during screenings, and“shadow casts”dressed up as the characters and lip-synced their own performances in front of the screen. The film was embraced by the queer community, who found a sense of belonging in these immersive screenings.O’BrienI was at home one day, and someone said to me: “Have you heard about your movie?” I said: “Yes, opened and closed.” “No, it’s doing this midnight business.” That was a surprise.SharmanIn a funny way, I felt it would find that audience. Quite irrationally, because there was no reason why it would. But I always felt that there was something special about it. Lou understood the potential and persuaded people at Fox, who had more or less washed their hands of it, to start playing it at late night [screenings]; and so it grew.QuinnWhen I was in South Africa, people said it was being banned for corrupting the youth. They said it had been banned in Germany for cannibalism. I thought: “Wow, we’re going to be a hit.” The first Magenta [fan] ever to dress as me became one of my closest friends.View image in fullscreenA midnight showing at the Nuart Theater, Los Angeles.Photograph: Robert Landau/AlamyBostwickIt started out as a gay event …The audience were outcasts, in a way, from their own society. They found their family there. They found someplace to go and be seen. They were exploring who they were authentically in the world, and they were witnessing something in the film that they had never seen before; that there is an alternative way of being.CampbellIn the beginning, there weren’t that many things [they would call out to the screen]. Now they pretty much call out after every line. The original things were very witty and hilarious. But now – and I know that my fellow cast members agree – it’s too much because you can hardly hear anything without them screaming out.SharmanPeople said: “Are you horrified that your film is being used as wallpaper for a party?” I said: “No, it’s fantastic.”Sharman and O’Brien teamed up again for Shock Treatment, a loose follow-up to The Rocky Horror Picture Showreleased in 1981, which featured several of the same characters.O’BrienThe first draft had Rocky (a creature created by Frank-N-Furter and played by Peter Hinwood in the original film) rising from the grave, pulling Frank’s body from the rubble and dragging him back to Dr Scott (Jonathan Adams) to get him reanimated. The producers liked it. Jim said: “No, we’re not doing that.” Everything was reworked and Shock Treatment came up. It’s a flawed piece. I’m not happy with it, truthfully.View image in fullscreenTim Curry as Dr Frank-N-Furter, Peter Hinwood as Rocky and Susan Sarandon as Janet.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamySharmanI felt Rocky Horror Picture Show was self-contained and resisted the idea of a sequel. Having moved on, I was also cautious about “putting the band back together”. I was, however, keen to work with Richard again. We depicted an America enslaved by reality TV run by a megalomaniac. It didn’t fly – maybe the satire seemed too dark and far-fetched for the time – though it has proved prophetic.The Rocky Horror Picture Show went on togrossmore than $115m worldwideand is now thelongest-running film release in cinema history. It continues to screen around the world.O’BrienI find it astonishing. People try forever to write something which has legs. It’s like a musical that was written in a 13-year-old boy’s bedroom … [LGBTQ+ fans] come and say that it was something that changed their lives. They found that they weren’t alone, that somehow there was a place for them in the world. They weren’t going to be laughed at, ridiculed.How we made: The Rocky Horror Picture ShowRead moreBostwickI think that my kids, if they have children, will be able to take their children to it and say: “That was your grandfather, and they used to call him ‘asshole’ [a common refrain called out by the audience during fan screenings] for his whole life. But he wasn’t. He was a great dad. He was just associated with this iconic story.” I’m very proud of it, and I’m a champion for its worldviews.CampbellWe’re the only positive cult I can think of. The great joy has been what this film means to so many people. It is still difficult for a lot of people to come out as gay or cross-dressers or bisexual or trans. This 50-year-old film still brings people together because of the shadow casts. I’ve met so many people that have met their partners that way. Sometimes at a screening I will meet an entire family dressed up as the characters. It’s just marvellous.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is screening at selected cinemas across the UK from 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsMusicalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of screaming, a few criers, a lot of punters standing on their seats. Within the sanctuary of the sound desk, one of the crew hands me some earplugs. “Protect your ears – a lot of squealers in today,” he says, with a wink.The Wiggles’ audiences are not known to hold back their enthusiasm, or ever put down the bubble guns, but there is a noticeably loud roar when a certain green man comes on stage: 31-year-old Dominic Field, AKA the Tree of Wisdom. After the show ends – their second of three that day alone, all sold out – Field shakes my hand as he’s wiping himself off. “I am a big sweater,” he says, affably. It is easy to see why.As the Tree of Wisdom, Field’s wild dancing, with hip thrusts, mad shimmying and the occasional worm, has taken both the world’s stages and TikTok by storm, inspiring thousands of copycats – from giggling parents to US college kids on a night out.On their recent tour of the US, Canada and the UK, Field spotted “like 10 trees in every audience – that was when I was like, I’ve made it”. He has unexpected fans in Khloé Kardashian, Jessie J and Robert De Niro – an ardent Wiggles fan of many years, who recently hugged Field backstage at one of their New York City shows. “He’s very softly spoken,” Field recalls. “He sat next to me and said in a very gentle tone, ‘I really appreciate what you do’.”Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

This is the complete opposite.”View image in fullscreen‘It just got bigger and bigger, and funnier and funnier’ … The Tree of Wisdom is now so big that the Wiggles’ next arena tour is named for him, with an album to go with it.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWhy the Wiggles have a tree in their lineup might be mystifying to some, until you remember that their entourage includes a pirate, a dinosaur, a dog and an octopus in a boater hat. How the tree became both wise and such a good dancer takes some explaining, but Field does his best:A couple years ago, the Wiggles were on tour in Newfoundland, Canada, an island with strong cultural ties to Ireland, Scotland and Celtic traditions. The locals seemed to love it when they played folk songs – the Wiggles are big on covers – so Anthony Field, the OG blue Wiggle and Field’s uncle, suggested they performRattlin’ Bog, an Irish song that speeds up with each verse and, most crucially for this story, is about a tree.The group’s musicians were so intently focused on learning to play the notoriously difficult song that Anthony only gave his nephew brief instructions: you’re the tree, dance onstage, do whatever you want.“And I was like, ‘Great,’” Field says, laughing.At first Field’s moves were “quite tame”. But as he got used to Rattlin’ Bog’s fast pace he began performing moves he had, in his words, perfected in Sydney’s nightclubs. “As I got comfortable with the song and started having more fun, the more phones I started to see come out,” he says. On YouTube alone, Rattlin’ Bog has now been watched 9m times.So Field was now a tree and his uncle had big plans for him. “Anthony called and said, ‘We’re going to expand the tree character!’” Field remembers. “Who knows how his brain works, but he was like ‘You’re the Tree of Wisdom! You are this all-knowing tree! So that’s how it started – then it just got bigger and bigger, and funnier and funnier.”Field has never had any professional dance training – which shows, but not in a negative way; I suspect it is his buzzed uncle vibe that people love so much. “I’m always that guy at a wedding who needs to get the dancefloor started,” he says. I suspect you knew how to do the worm before you joined the Wiggles, I say. “Oh, I was worming before I was walking,” he says.Field’s career trajectory has inspired the birth of the term “nepo tree”, but the Wiggles is very much a family business, albeit one worth an estimated $50m. His father, Paul, was in rock band the Cockroaches with two of the four original Wiggles – his brother Anthony and Jeff Fatt. But in 1988, Paul’s first child, Bernadette, died of SIDS at eight months, which devastated the group. Anthony left the band to study early education, then founded the Wiggles, bringing in Fatt, Murray Cook and Greg Page; their first album was dedicated to Bernadette. Paul became their manager in 1996.These days, Field’s older brother, Luke, is the Wiggles’ manager, while his cousin Lucia is a blue Wiggle like her father, Anthony, and his wife, Stephanie, is a Wiggles dancer who occasionally plays Dorothy the Dinosaur and Bubbles the Mermaid. Field himself made his first Wiggles appearance when he was just two,in the Wiggles video Wake Up Jeff!. The Wiggles have been part of his life for 30 years and counting.“When I was a kid, I didn’t see Anthony as a Wiggle. He was always just my uncle but everyone knew him, which was cool,” he recalls.Did he ever find the Wiggles uncool? “No, I loved it. Actually, on my first day at high school, dad dropped me off while listening to a new album because it was his job. The Wiggles were pumping out the car and that was the only moment I’ve ever been like, ‘Can you just turn that down a bit?’”At 19, Field began working as a stage technician for the Wiggles. Over the years, Anthony would encourage his nephew to sing and join them on stage; eventually he was stepping in for Anthony and Simon the red Wiggle at live shows or filling in as Captain Feathersword. And now he’s beloved by children and parents around the world for playing a groovy tree – an unexpected, but welcome outcome.Can you ever have a bad day as a dancing, singing tree? “Life happens, of course – but as soon as you get to work and you’re singing about hot potatoes, it’s really, really, really hard to have a bad day,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘People with little ones are probably watching the Wiggles 24 hours a day’.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianIn fact, the Tree of Wisdom is now so big that the Wiggles next arena tour is named for him, with an album to go with – and yes, it is all tree-related songs and yes, it includes a cover of Tina Turner’s Nutbush City Limits. “We’re gonna make sure that every year nine dance in every world is doing the Nutbush,” Field says. “We’re trying to get some tree-nagers.”Is it strange getting so much attention now? “No, I love it. I encourage it all. Honestly, people with little ones are probably watching the Wiggles 24 hours a day. When we met De Niro, his partner said, ‘I feel like I know you guys, but I’ve never met you.’”And these days, he’s loved for a character that has become entirely his own. “I’m just being myself – dressed as a tree. And people seem to be connecting with it. I’m proud of that. It’s been really cool to see it grow,” he pauses, then adds, cheekily: “Pun intended.”The Wiggles’ Tree of Wisdom Big Show Arena Spectacular!tourgoes on sale to the general public on 1 August at 2pm.Explore more on these topicsThe WigglesAustralian musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Some we will want to hear, others to dismiss. Perhaps we will yearn for the kind of uplifting tale given to us initially by Aaron Pang – about a tragic accident and his overcoming of adversity to find true love. Or perhaps we will demand something grittier.In his sweet and clever one-man show, Pang offers to give us both.First, he leads us into a happy-ending trap; a story that is not what it seems. Then, he questions our need to see him, a disabled man who walks with leg supports and a cane, as the conquering hero of his own story. Would we think less of him if the dice had not rolled in his favour?To demonstrate how programmed we are, he shows us a diagram of a classic story arc, mirroring the tale he has just told. Even then, with our eyes wide open, we still want a narrative in which everything works out. He gives us the option of two endings,Choose Your Own Adventure style, and smiles wryly when we vote for the most comforting.Connie Chen’s simple, chatty production sits somewhere between standup and spoken word, framing the actor as charming, cheery and self-aware as he describes with humour and not a little poignancy the mismatch between his erotic desire and physical capability. What starts as a standard coming-of-age tale about a boys’ school chorister making fumbling approaches to the girl he fancies turns into something sharper and deeper.Pang is brave in his willingness to talk about a sex life that deviates from the social norm and gently provocative in his needling of the audience: what prejudice lies behind our impulse for the perfect story in an imperfect world?At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDisabilityComedy (Stage)Spoken wordEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Both have since been dropped from the programme.Shafi said she initially rejected an offer by MasterChef’s producers Banijay to edit her out of her episode. The 57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced theyhad decided to broadcast the series from 6 August.“I didn’t say edit me out,” she said. “I said: ‘Axe the show, don’t air the show. I’m asking you not to air the show.’ Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send out to women?“For me, it’s about the enabling environment. It’s that complicity. Those individual powerful men do not [act] in isolation. There is an enabling environment, turning a blind eye … It’s about years of these institutions not being accountable.”View image in fullscreenGregg Wallace and John Torode will feature in the new series despite being dropped after allegations.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/ShutterstockWallace was dropped by the BBC after an independentreport substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused”, but said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.John Torode was also dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over theuse of racist language, which he believes never happened.Shafi, a leadership and management development partner for St John Ambulance, said she came from a “family of foodies” and had entered the programme as a tribute to her late mother, who was a pioneering Indian cookery teacher.Once the allegations against Wallace emerged, Shafi told Banijay she was against the programme being broadcast. It culminated in “quite a heated conversation” with a producer.She said she was urged to think about the life-changing opportunity the show provided to some contestants. Shafi was then told about the “potential solution” to edit her out of the programme.“I was flabbergasted, because in what way was that a solution – and a solution for whom?” Shafi said. “My point was not about me not being associated with it. My point was about the institutional enabling environment. I said I am completely against this airing of the show. I object to it strongly. This is the principle I’m standing by. I’m objecting to the show being aired, not about me being in it.”She agreed to be edited out once theBBCpublicly confirmed the series would be shown.When the BBC announced the decision to press ahead with the series, it acknowledged “not everyone will agree” and that doing so “in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters”.Shafi said: “While the BBC are signalling how life changing, for the better, this could be for some contestants – I’d say top 10 at most – where is the respect for how life changing, for the worse, it has been for the victims?“What I suggested to them was: ‘Why don’t you do a special show dedicated to these people that excludes those prominent figures – but it focuses on the talent?’”The BBC reiterated its decision to air the series was not an easy one. “Banijay consulted with all the contestants before that decision was made and there was widespread support for it going ahead,” it said. “We are sorry that this contestant does not support the decision and we are grateful she raised this with both the BBC and Banijay.”A Banijay UK spokesperson said: “We are sorry that Sarah does not support the decision to air this series ofMasterChef. We carefully considered her concerns about broadcasting the series and discussed them with the BBC. However, having consulted with all contributors in the series ahead of the decision being made, the resounding feeling from those taking part was support for airing the series.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefGregg WallaceBBCWomenFood TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

It was built in 1784 by the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, and visited by 18th-century artists such as Francisco de Goya. Its 17-hectare gardens were designed by Jean Baptiste Mulot, who also worked on the Petit Trianon gardens at the Palace of Versailles. They are in three sections: Italian, French and English landscape. The park also has a small lake, a labyrinth, a bandstand and a mansion.

Another architect, Willhelm Klemming, bought the property in 1901, renovated the garden and built the Centralbadets in 1904 – still an affordable day spa today.

Officially, I specialize in Hawaii’s local food and diasporic Asian cuisines, but unofficially, or if you catch me on a tired day, I’ll say my style of cooking is “dorm room”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Which means I can make a filling, elaborate meal out of seemingly nothing, so long as I have a rice cooker in my arsenal. It’s my “desert island appliance”, the one piece of equipment I could still thrive with if I lost my entire kitchen. And anybody can learn the same hacks and shortcuts.A portable kitchenToday’s rice cookers come with sometimes dozens of functions,which I thoroughly tested when I rounded up 17 of them for my “Rice Cooker Olympics”. But the most basic rice cooker – even one with just the two simple functions of “cook rice” and “keep rice warm”, is an entire kitchen encased in a little plug-in pot. Let me explain.First, obviously, it cooks rice, from short-grain to sushi, jasmine to brown, and even mixed grains. By extension, it can also make congee, or rice porridge: the finest of breakfasts and the most comforting of one-bowl meals. All you have to do is keep adding more water, purposefully exploding rice grains into silken porridge.It can braise meats and tofu when it’soperating at full throttle. Skip the rice, add a bit of oil to the pot, and hit start to make dishes like mapo tofu or spiced ground beef stews.It can make fluffy, cakeyJapanese pancakes. And don’t forgetchawanmushi– that silken Japanese egg custard often served at the start of omakases, or chef-curated sushi meals. It steams quickly and beautifully in a rice cooker: as you set your rice to cook, halfway through the process, set a little ceramic bowl of water and egg scrambled together in the middle of the half cooked rice and then voila, when your rice is done, you also have chawanmushi.Put in wholeeggsand you’ll have soft-boiled or hard-boiled eggs, depending on timing. Hard-boiled eggs take 20 minutes and soft boiled eggs take 13 to 15 minutes. You can either set the eggs in a steamer basket set inside your rice cooker (if your cooker comes with one – the Hamilton Beach one we like does, as does the Tatung), or just put them directly into your cooking rice.You can makesoupsin a rice cooker,rice pudding, and an infinite number of grains: quinoa, fonio, barley, couscous, to name just a common few.Stick vegetables in your rice cooker and you’ll also wind up with perfectly tender broccoli, green beans, and asparagus. During the cooking process, you can put them in a ceramic bowl and set it directly into your cooking rice, or use a steamer basket attachment.Rice cookers 201I tested a lot of rice cookers for The Guardian’s list of the best rice cookers, and many are sophisticated devices. With added functions and settings come increased food options.Some of the rice cookers I tested can take the thinking and preparation out of complex grains such as germinated brown rice, which is thought to haveextra nutritional value. They will soak, time and baby the grains over a cooking cycle of around three hours.Other rice cookers can pressure cook grains at high speed and they can unlock the complex, floral notes of even the most common, frankly boring, short-grain rice. They will time your congee for you, or adjust themselves to cook wild rice, mixed rice, sushi rice or jasmine rice. They’ll wake up just before you do, and make sure that the oatmeal you put in them the night prior is your steaming hot breakfast.Some can even sanitize themselves, steaming their innards at high temperatures. Modern rice cookers come with dozens of bells and whistles.Whether you choose the highest endZojirushi cookeror themost basic Green Lifeone, look after it. Treat its inner liners like a nonstick pan and clean it by hand.And know when you’re purchasing a rice cooker, you’re purchasing a kitchen. Get one with a handle and it can travel with you anywhere.Explore more on these topicsRiceFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reason for this puffing is the contrast between the rapidly drying surface of the dough and the evaporating water within the dough. The water turns into steam, causing the centre to balloon and the two layers to separate, creating a pocket and making the whole thing look a bit like an inflated whoopee cushion.In order to make pane carasau, which in Sardinia is a domestic, artisan and industrial art, the puffed-up dough is swiftly separated into two thin discs with a sharp knife, then the discs are returned – possibly folded in half or quarters – to the oven to dry and toast for a second time according to the maker’s taste. Fortunately for us, there are hundreds of makers and the whole point of pane carasau, also known ascarta di musica(music paper bread), is that it is brilliantly transportable and enduring: it lasts and lasts, which is why it’s one of my favourite things to have in the cupboard.Pane carasau can be eaten in various ways: its crisp, brittle, cracker-like nature makes it a natural partner for cheese (and honey) and soft toppings; it can also be eaten like bread and filled, dipped or broken into soup or stews, or used as part of a salad; or quickly immersed in cold water (or passed under a running tap), which restores moisture, making the discs pliable enough to fold or roll around. Pane carasau can also be used in the same way as sheets of pasta to make – and I am inspired by the magazineLa Cucina Italianahere – all sorts of lasagne. I have chosen to make one with a tomato sauce using both fresh and tinned tomatoes, mozzarella (it needs to be well drained) and parmesan. Opinions vary as to whether it is better to use dry or slightly damp pane carasau, but I have come to the conclusion that a mix is best: three dry layers then a final damp layer, which ensures that the top doesn’t dry out too rapidly before the cheese melts, and a golden crust forms.As with a classic lasagne, rest for 20 minutes or so after baking, so the flavours settle and the lasagne firms up. The great thing about pane carasau is that it is sturdy enough to maintain form, but pliable enough to be cut, and has a lightness usually found only in expertly hand-rolled sheets of fresh egg pasta. Serve cut into squares with a green salad and a glass of Sardinian red wine, such asBovale SardoorCannonau.Lasagne with Sardinian pane carasauServes4500g ripe tomatoes5 tbsp olive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and gently crushed so broken but still intact400g tin whole plum tomatoes in juice1 small red chilli(fresh or dried), whole or chopped if you want more heatSalt8basil leaves180g pane carasau– look for it in Italian delis400g mozzarella, drained and diced80g parmesanPeel the fresh tomatoes by covering them with boiling water for two minutes, draining, then cooling under cold water, at which point the skins should pull away easily. Chop the tomatoes roughly, discarding any tough bits.Put the olive oil and garlic in a heavy-based pan, then put the pan on a low flame and warm until the garlic gently sizzles – be careful not to burn it. Add both the fresh and tinned tomatoes, bring to a lively simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Add the red chilli and a good pinch of salt, then turn down the heat and simmer gently for 45 minutes, using the back of a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes; add the basil for the last 10 minutes. The sauce should be rich, thick and shiny, with the oil forming a ring at the edges.Assemble the lasagne in a 20cm x 26cm baking dish: start with a layer of sauce, cover with a layer of pane carasau – this can be quite patchwork and informal, with bits overlapping – then make another layer of sauce, diced mozzarella and grated cheese. Continue with another three layers, wetting the final layer of pane carasau very briefly under running water and finishing with a smear of sauce and thin layer of grated cheeses. Bake at 175C (165C fan)/gas 3½ for 20 minutes, until golden.The subheading of this article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version said the flatbreads were layered with tomato and lasagne; however, this should have said tomato and cheese.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodBreadMain courseTomatoesCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

But how long will the party last?Hannah CrosbieThu 31 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent.

After all, the joy of “the next big thing” is that it seemingly pops up as if from nowhere, and then it’s suddenly absolutelyeverywhere. Whether or not it then sticks around is anyone’s guess, though.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For instance, last year, I came across a fluted bottle cut into a fish-scale pattern at an Aldi tasting. I’m always a bit cynical when it comes to custom-made glass bottles, especially when they’re heavier than a regular one and ergo worse for the environment. Why not put that extra expense into the quality of the wine itself? Anyway, there was an orange on the label, while the liquid inside was blushing through the glass. The label read “Rosorange”, or a blend of rosé and orange wine, which Aldi claimed was a supermarket first. The bottle, as far as the supermarket was concerned, had done its job, because I was lured in and poured myself a slug.It wasn’t long before I started seeing the stuff everywhere. Wine communicators who are way more proficient (and, let’s be honest, better) than me were suddenly reviewing rosorange wines left, right and centre. Lucy Hitchcock, whosePartner in Wine TikToksfrequently help sell out supermarket ranges, posted her own review of Aldi’s rosorange, which at time of writing has had an incredible 292,000 views.And it’s not hard to see why: the proposition is intriguing (and the bottle is beautiful). Waitrose has since followed suit by stocking a rosorange of its own, while the other supermarkets doubtlessly have plans to do the same. But why now? Are the big brands trying to attract more orange wine drinkers to rosé, or more rosé drinkers to skin contact?True, the general winemaking process is not all that dissimilar: an orange wine is the product of extended skin contact in a white wine, and the same is true of rosé, only with red grapes. But the received and expected styles couldn’t be more different. Supermarket rosé drinkers are likely to be after something bone-dry, classic and quality-controlled for casual enjoyment and celebration – no alarms and no surprises. But I get the feeling that the typical orange wine drinker is looking for something a little different: the rise of orange wine, after all, has been synonymous with an exploration of alternative styles, low-intervention winemaking and a love for funkier wines.So it’s intriguing to see a wine hybrid trying to reconcile these two, arguably very different wine styles and the customers they want to attract. I can’t see lovers of low-intervention styles using this as a way to enjoy mass-market rosé, so perhaps it’s an attempt to introduce the orange wine style to a broader audience (although part of orange wine’s charm has always been in its anti-mainstream quality). The rosorange cuvée is now in its second year at Aldi, but only time will tell if this trend is here to stay.Four rosorange wines to start you offChassaux et Fils Rosorange£9.99 Aldi, 13%.
