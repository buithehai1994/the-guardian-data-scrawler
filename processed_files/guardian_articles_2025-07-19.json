This is not what I voted for.” “This cemented permanent deep state power.” “I’m concerned about being able to trustDonald Trumpto keep his word.” “What about justice for these young ladies who were trafficked? What about their justice? Don’t they deserve justice?”These were just a few of the calls thatbesieged conservative radio hostsacross the US this week. The president’s ardent supporters spent the past decade fulminating over various foes, from Barack Obama and the deep state to undocumented immigrants and transgender children. Now they have a new target: Donald Trump himself.The “Make America Great Again” (Maga) base is in revolt as never before. The trigger was Trump’s broken promise to publicly release details aboutJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, who was facing federal charges of sex-trafficking minors when he died in jail in 2019.Spurredby the presidentand his allies, Trump’s movement has long latched on to the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up. But last week the justice department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)announced there was no evidencethat the disgraced financier kept such a list or was blackmailing powerful figures.Far from closing the case, the memo deepened supporters’ obsession and sense of grievance. A movement defined by the view that elites rig the system against them felt cheated. Trump made efforts to douse the flames with ever-shifting explanations, excuses and distractions but merely poured fuel on the fire.To some, his erratic and evasive behaviour implies a guilty secret. It also evokes a line from President John F Kennedy’s1961 inaugural address: “Those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.” Having spent years embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts him as the only saviour who can demolish the “deep state”, Trump is now seen as co-opted by its corrupt bureaucracy.Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman who ran against Trump for president in 2020, said: “I talk to the base every day and nothing animates the base more than the deep state. This Epstein thing was Trump’s promise. This was going to finally expose the deep state. Now Trump says nothing there? It ain’t going to stand.”Epstein was first charged with sex offences in 2006 after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police that he had molested their daughter at his Florida home. He avoided federal charges due to a controversial plea deal that saw him jailed for just under 13 months. In 2019 he was arrested again in New York and charged with trafficking dozens of teenage girls and engaging in sex acts with them in exchange for money.A separate case against Epstein’s girlfriendGhislaine Maxwell, who was jailed in 2022 for helping him abuse girls, detailed Epstein’s connections with high-profile figures such as Britain’s Prince Andrew and the former US president Bill Clinton. Both have denied any wrongdoing.In 2019 – during Trump’s first term as president – Epstein was found dead in his prison cell after hanging himself, according to the authorities. Sceptics point to suspicious circumstances such as the security cameras around his cell apparently malfunctioning on the night he died, along with other irregularities.They also speculate that the government is concealing details about the Epstein case to protect wealthy and influential clients, including Trump, a longtime associate who in 2002told New York magazine: “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”On Thursday theWall Street Journal reportedthat Trump sent a letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman to Epstein in 2003. The president denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, andsued Rupert Murdoch and two Wall Street Journal newspaper reporters on Friday.When he was running for president, Trump said he would release files related to the case. But a bundle put out in February contained little new information. Then in June the spotlight turned back on the president when his former adviser Elon Musk claimed – in a now-deleted X post – that Trump is “in the Epstein files”.Just a month later, a memo from the justice department and FBI said the Epstein files did not contain evidence that would justify further investigation. An almost 11-hour video published to dispel theories Epstein was murdered showed a section of the New York prison on the night Epstein died but appeared to be missing a minute of footage.The Maga faithful erupted in fury. Media personality Tucker Carlson,activist Laura Loomerand Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon claim the government’s handling of the case lacks transparency. The far-right commentator Jack Posobiec said he would not rest “until we go full Jan 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files”.Baffled, flailing and unusually out of step, Trump used his Truth Social platform to call supporters off the Epstein trail amid reports of infighting between the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI deputy director, Dan Bongino, over the issue.“What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals’?” Trump wrote. “They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening.” He suggested the turmoil was undermining his administration – “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein”.View image in fullscreenPeople holds signs calling for the release of files regarding Jeffrey Epstein in Houston.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesYet while Trump has defeated many political foes, he has never had to take on his own base. Taking a scattergun approach, he said he supported the release of any “credible” files related to Epstein while downplaying the case as “pretty boring stuff”. He suggested without citing evidence they were “made up” by former FBI director James Comey and former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.The president even lashed out at his own supporters, calling them “weaklings” for falling for what he called a “radical left” hoax by the opposition to discredit him. “I don’t want their support anymore!” he wrote. Some responded byburning their Maga capsin protest.Still the pressure continued to build. Mike Pence, his former vice-president, said in aninterview with CBS Newsthat “the time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s investigation and prosecution”. Even Mike Johnson, the loyal Republican speaker of the House, broke from Trump on the issue and urged the justice department to make public any documents linked to Epstein.A small but growing band of House Republicans followed suit. Musk putdozens of posts on Xaccusing Trump of a “cover-up”. On Thursday the president made a concession by announcing that he will ask a court to allow therelease of grand jury testimonyin the case. It was the latest effort to defuse a crisis of his own making.His political career gained traction with the help of the “birther” movement, pushing the racist idea that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore an illegitimate president. He was content to accept support from followers of QAnon, an antisemitic theory involving Satan-worshipping cannibals and a child sex-trafficking ring.Trump also cultivated the ultimate political conspiracy theory that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him by Joe Biden, a “big lie” that culminated in the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Now he is finding that the nothing-to-see-here approach does not work for those who learned from him they must not give up until the government’s secrets are exposed.Charlie Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, said: “He’s being eaten by the very sort of conspiracy theory that propelled him into office in the first place. Donald Trump is a product of as well as a purveyor of conspiracy theories. He has marinated in conspiracy theories and used them to put him into the presidency so you do have what appears to be a giant irony that this particular conspiracy theory is the one that is haunting him.“The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein is haunting Trump’s presidency far more than any of the other issues that are out there now. Trump is finding out that, if you’ve pushed a conspiracy theory for years, it’s very difficult to suddenly declare that it’s non-existent or a hoax. He’s doing thisJedi mind trickwhere he is trying to say, no this is not the conspiracy theory you actually care about.”For once Trump has overestimated his ability to shape reality to his own willCharlie SykesTrump has already tested his base’s loyalty in recent weeks bybombing Iranand pledging support for Ukraine, despite a pledge to avoid foreign entanglements, as well as signing a tax and spending bill that will strip health insurance from millions of people. But Epstein is different: a binary view of liberal elites as paedophiles, and Republicans as protectors of children, has become foundational.Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, commented: “One of the reasons why the Maga base was so obsessed is that it gave them licence to genuinely hate and loathe their political opponents, to consider that the Democrats were not merely wrong on the issues, that they were part of this evil paedophile cabal.“That is the justification for so much of what Trumpism has become and suddenly to pull the rug out from under the base was a radical and a risky move. For once Trump has overestimated his ability to shape reality to his own will.”It is a rare political gift for Democrats, who have been reeling since Trump’s victory in November and struggling to thwart his expansion of presidential power. Several Democrats on Capitol Hill havecalled for the releaseof all Epstein files and suggested that Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them.Ro Khanna, a congressman from Californiawhose measurethat would have forced Bondi to publish all documents related to Epstein online was blocked by Republicans, said: “The Republicans are basically protecting the rich and powerful. That’s what the Epstein case is about: the rich and powerful men who were allegedly sleeping with underage girls and they should not have impunity.“They’re being protected, possibly because they’re donors to people in Washington, because they play golf with people in Washington. So this is a question of whose side are you on? The Democratic party has a chance to have a rebirth of populism, to say we’re on the side of the people, we get that this town hasn’t worked for ordinary people for too long.”Some veterans of bareknuckle political fights of the past, however, warn that Democrats are still not rising to the moment. If the tables were turned and a Democratic president was suppressing such delicate information, it seems likely thatRepublicanswould be aggressively flooding the airwaves demanding investigations and impeachment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

From a leadership perspective, there’s an inability to put the knife in and twist it.“There is a reluctance because of the tawdriness of it all to appreciate that for Democrats, they lost an election to the most prolific liar because he was perceived as being more honest in the eyes of the American people. This is a prime example to strip him of that in the eyes of his most fervent supporters, and at least move them by some percentage to the sidelines and demotivate them.”Schmidt advocates a national advertising campaign and series of town halls in which Democrats demand an end to the cover-up and ask what Trump and Bondi are hiding. “This is a moment where Trump is weak, he’s perturbed, he’s disturbed – and what you do is you hit him.”Public opinion is turning against the president. AReuters/Ipsos pollfound that 69% of respondents thought the federal government was hiding details about Epstein’s clients, compared with 6% who disagreed and about one in four who said they were not sure.‘He’s a lot of fun to be with’: Trump and Epstein were close friends for 15 yearsRead moreTara Setmayer, a Trump critic and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, believes the sense of betrayal could translate into a repudiation in next year’s midterm elections for the House of Representatives and Senate.She said:“Is there perhaps a political awakening happening with the most rabid of the Maga base? There may be some weakness here that could be exploited. Where it could hurt Trump in the midterms is by depressing the vote of Maga. They’ll stay home and in these key swing districts where one or two percentage points difference can make all the difference in the House.”Walsh, the former congressman, agreed. He commented: “It’ll cause a lot of Trump supporters to not even vote because remember a lot of his supporters aren’t Republicans; they are attached to him. If they’re utterly disillusioned that the guy they thought was going to be the ultimate slayer of the deep state now is part of the deep state they’re going to check out and that’s going to hurt Republicans.”He added: “Trump’s legacy is the destruction of truth. He lies as he breathes and his lies to his supporters have made him popular among his supporters, so it’s beautiful that he may actually be crucified on one of his lies.”"

When it came to the last six miles, however, “I run while talking to God.”The fact that he was attempting the distance at all might seem, to some, proof of divine assistance. Singh was 89 when he first took up distance running, having stumbled across a TV snippet of people running a marathon, and decided to give it a go. By his mid-90s he was a marathon veteran, a record holder for his age group and even aposter model for Adidas; aged 101 – or at least so he believed, since he never had a birth certificate – he became the oldest person ever to run the distance.This week, at the age of 114, Singh’s race finally came to an end. He washit by a carwhile crossing the road in his birth village of Beas Pind, near Jalandhar in Punjab, and suffered fatal injuries. A man has been arrested, according to Indian police.At Singh’s former home in Ilford, eastLondon, where he discovered running and trained for his athletic feats, his friends have been remembering a man who, in the words of his former trainer Harmander Singh (no relation), was “an icon of humanity and a powerhouse of positivity”.“We wouldn’t say we were ready for [his death], but these circumstances certainly didn’t help,” he said on Thursday, from the park where they used to train together. “It did catch us by surprise.”View image in fullscreenHarmander Singh, Fauja’s former trainer and chair of the multicultural running club Sikhs in the City, at Valentine’s Park, Ilford.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianFauja Singh had spent the first eight decades of his life as a farmer in his small Punjabi village, where he was born in 1911, had married and raised six children, but never learned to read or write. After his wife died in the early 90s and their sole remaining son in the village was killed in an accident, he moved to Ilford to be close to other family members.It was here that Singh, griefstricken and speaking no English, was flicking through a TV set when he stumbled across footage of the 1999 New York marathon. “He wanted to know what this race was because he couldn’t relate to why people were running for so long,” says Harmander, 65. “He didn’t know what a marathon was. He was told it was 26 miles. He’d done a 20km walk a few months earlier, and he couldn’t tell the difference between a mile and a kilometre. He said, ‘Well, I can do another six.’”Through mutual friends he was introduced to Harmander, a keen amateur distance runner who had informally trained a few others, and had a keen eye for publicity. Though applications for the coming London marathon had closed, he helped to secure Singh a charity place. “Then I had to explain to him what a charity was and what kind of different charities there were.”It was to be the first of many marathons, and other feats besides. The 52kg (8st 2lb) runner in his trademark yellow turban and long white beard may have seemed fragile, but a lifetime of hard physical work had made him strong. At 100, he set five age-related world records in a day, at distances from 100 metres to 5,000 metres.But though Singh was widely acclaimed as the first centenarian and oldest ever marathon runner, his lack of paperwork meant that his feat was never acknowledged by the Guinness World Records (the lack of paperwork did not, incidentally, stop him acquiring a British passport at around the same time).It’s a subject on which his coach is still sore on his behalf, but Singh was untroubled, he says. “He didn’t care. He said, ‘Who’s Guinness?’” Any money he earned was given to charity, says his coach.View image in fullscreenSingh, 101, is flanked by friends as he runs in a 10K race in Hong Kong in 2013.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APNonetheless, Singh undoubtedly enjoyed his celebrity: a children’s book,Fauja Singh Keeps Going, and a Bollywood movie,Fauja, were inspired by his story. “I think the attention kept him alive,” says Harmander. “Another one of his sayings was, ‘When you get old, you become young again, because you want attention.’“He was fascinated, dazzled, because everything was glittering to him.”Needless to say, Harmander believes Singh’s example shows you are never too old to run. “I never ask people for their age,” he says – assuming they have been cleared by their doctor to run, he’ll ask them to focus on their motivations. “Because I’ll remind them, when they’re slacking later, why they wanted to do it in the first place.”The east London running club he founded, calledSikhs in the City, is now fundraising for a new clubhouse in memory of its most celebrated former member. Despite its name, says Harmander, it is open to all.In Singh’s case, after a hard physical life and so much loss, running represented a distraction from his immense grief, his coach says. “When I asked him about his motivations, he said, ‘I just wanted to do something useful rather than dwell on the past.’”Explore more on these topicsOlder peopleMarathon runningIndiaSouth and central AsiaLondonMarathonRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than pictures from a recent jaunt to Ibiza clubs such asUshuaiaorquestionable birthday parties, his Instagram is dominated by books.Images of paperbacks he’s read are all over his feed, a mix of classics and contemporary novels, with a majority fromSpainand South America.Alana Portero’s celebrated (andPedro Almodóvar-approved) novels about queer life in 80s Madrid feature on his read pile, alongside the Mexican Juan Rulfo’s classic surrealist novel Pedro Páramo, whichinspired a young Gabriel García Márquezto write One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Federico García Lorca’s Gypsy Ballads.Bellerín, who played forArsenalfor nine years before moving back to his native Spain with Real Betis, talks about literature’s transformative power.View image in fullscreenHéctor BellerínPhotograph: H&M“Literature has become something that has – and I know it’s a cliche – but to me, it has completely changed my life,” he said from a Betis training camp in Portugal.Bellerín’s love of literature was sparked during the Covid-19 lockdowns, when the young full-back was isolating in his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He began reading the novels ofCharles Bukowskiwhile he was still playing for Arsenal.He made his way throughHollywoodandPost Office, the American writer’s autobiographical debut, which follows the life of the sardonic anti-hero Henry Chinaski. “I was miserable in quarantine,” said Bellerín. “I didn’t know when football was going to come back. I was even drinking a lot … I had a bit of a tough time. Literature, I’m not gonna say made me survive, but it made my life way easier.”Some footballers might shy away from sharing their love of reading, especially in a climate when anything outside the football bubble is deemed a “distraction”, but Bellerín has made no secret ofhis interestsbeyond sport.He’s flirted with fashion, and even started his own label. Heloves photography, and believes passionately in the power of art to help with mental health. He has been a vocal advocate for sustainability in football, and in 2022 he criticised the lack of media coverage of conflicts inPalestine, Iraq and Yemencompared with Ukraine.Bellerín grew up in a house of books. His father had a passion for ancient Greece, which inspired Bellerín’s first name. But between the ages of 19 and 26 he read mostly nonfiction (mirroring thehabits of many young men).View image in fullscreenBellerín spent 11 years at Arsenal.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/ReutersReading was something he did to learn something, rather than for pleasure. “When I read something, it had to have a purpose and then I realised it was the other way around,” he said.The work of the German-Swiss novelistHermann Hessefollowed Bukowski, but after making his way through 10 books, the Spaniard realised that he’d only read male writers and made a conscious decision to read more women.He moved on toThe Vegetarianby the Nobel prize winner Han Kang, andNaomi Klein’s Doppelganger, while cool, contemporary Spanish writers such as José Luis Sastre, Adrian Daine, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Carolina Yuste and the Granta young writerCristina Moralesdominate his book piles.View image in fullscreenBellerín during an H&M shoot.Photograph: H&MSergio C Fanjul, a culture writer at the Spanish daily El País, said the list showed Bellerín was “closely attuned to the pulse of the publishing world”, with writers such as Portero, Leila Guerriero, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Juan Tallon and Alejandro Zambra being some of the “most critically acclaimed writers” of recent years. “I think Bellerín is a reader who doesn’t simply follow mainstream trends,” Fanjul added.On his Portuguese training trip he’s brought a book of Leslie Jamison essays, Mary Karr’s Art of Memoir, Sara Mesa’s Cara de Pan, Simon Critchley’s What We Think About When We Think About Football and Samanta Schweblin’s Little Eyes, which the Guardian called “ingenious”.View image in fullscreenBellerín playing for Sporting.Photograph: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty ImagesThe footballer gets recommendations from a writing group he attends every Tuesday night in Seville. Made up of students, doctors and engineers, the group has introduced him to the contemporary Spanish literary scene.“We feed off each other, recommending books and movies. My taste has also changed, because the people I’ve got around me have great taste and give great recommendations, new names and new faces and new ways of writing.”There’s only one book that’s defeated him.He tried Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights in the original English before reverting to the Spanish translation, titled Cumbres Borrascosas. “I couldn’t get through that in English,” Bellerín confessed. “I tried it, but couldn’t.”Explore more on these topicsBooksSpainEuropeArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Last year, I won a grant from theenvironmental charity Hubbubto develop a food-waste-saving ice-cream brand. The learning curve was steep. Ice-cream is one of the most competitive and technically challenging foods to get right, because it has to be smooth, creamy and, crucially, shelf-stable. That has led some producers to be over-reliant on emulsifiers and stabilisers, some of which may be plant-derived, but they’re still ultra-processed, which may be a concern for some consumers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My tasting revealed a very clear quality scale. At the bottom are the foamy, highly processed tubs that shouldn’t even qualify as ice-cream. Others offered a slightly better texture and taste, but still have a processed edge, while others sit awkwardly in the middle, all food-dye yolk-yellow. But once the price hits 68p per 100g, things shift and we finally enter “real” ice-cream territory, featuring true frozen custards made from creme anglaise, and with recognisable ingredients and far cleaner flavours.Across the test, it became obvious that what’s sold as ice-cream spans from gorgeous churned custard to food-like industrial substances. Understanding what goes into these tubs, and how to taste the difference between them, can help us choose treats that actually nourish us (albeit in moderation), rather than just simulate satisfaction. My advice would be to invest in the most delicious you can afford and serve 50% smaller portions (eating by the scoop rather than the tub will help, too!).

Despite the name, this highly processed dessert isn’t real ice-cream, because it’s made with reconstituted skimmed milk, coconut fat, glucose-fructose syrup and a slew of stabilisers and emulsifiers, including E471.Wall’s soft-scoop vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 1.8 litres at Ocado (15p/100ml)£2.75 for 1.8 litres at Tesco (15p/100ml)☆☆☆☆☆Bright yellow, with a light, aerated texture and synthetic sweetness. Not technically ice-cream (it contains zero cream) and loaded with additives such as carrageenan and mono- and diglycerides (E471). Ultra-processed and lacking any real dairy character. So cheap, it’s a parody of itself.Co-op vanilla flavour ice-creamView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 900ml at Co-op (33p/100ml)☆☆☆☆☆Bright yellow with a synthetic vanilla flavour. Moussey, spongy texture and artificial creaminess. The main ingredient is water, bulked with sugars, emulsifiers and stabilisers. Incredibly, it actually contains ground vanilla pods, though you’d never guess. Unbelievably terrible.Explore more on these topicsIce-cream and sorbetThe FilterFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve done both and know which one I preferGillian HarveyWith vacations of up to 14 weeks on the continent, education can suffer – although on the plus side childcare and holidays are much more affordableSat 19 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareRemember the summer holidays of your childhood – the seemingly endless, sunny days many of us look back on fondly? Those six “precious” weeks look very different when you’re a parent. Having to feed, entertain, look after and fund your offspring during the extended break can sometimes make the summer seem endless for all the wrong reasons.Parents in England where, as in Scotland and Wales, the school summer break is six weeks, have complained that this is too long, and are backing areduction to four weeks. Pity then the parents in mainland Europe: French school holidays last for eight weeks. In some regions of Italy, summer is awhopping 14-weeks long. Having birthed and brought up my five children in France, only moving back to England in April last year when my eldest was 14 and my youngest nine, I’ve experienced summers on both sides of the Channel. And it will be no surprise that I prefer the six-week version.But not for the reasons you might think.I’m lucky. I may have five children to entertain, but I work from home and have a husband who’s retired. I have to combat additional noise and break up the odd skirmish, but at least I don’t have to worry about childcare during the summer months.Then again, inFrance, nor did most of my friends. France is set up differently for the summer break. For starters, there are affordable play schemes in most areas. In my small town in Limousin, children could have a day of fun, sport and supervision from 7.30am to 6.30pm, plus a cooked meal, for as little as €9 (about £7.80).Rather than the odd snatched moment or week off, many children in France benefit from a healthy dose of family time over the summer as their parents are also on holiday. August is sacrosanct in France. Many businesses close or pare down, and people often take a fortnight – or even the month – off. (Need a routine scan in August? Good luck: even hospital services seem lighter on staff during the summer.)And while it’s traditionally expensive to take holidays during peak times, in France help is available to those on modest incomes. TheVacaf voucheris a means-tested benefit that families can offset against a holiday at more than 7,000 hotels or holiday parks, saving up to 70%.Money won’t be made tighter by “back to school” shopping, either. France gives parents a “rentrée” payment ofmore than €400 a childin August to cope with these costs. It’s means tested, but generously so, taking into account income and family size.If additional childcare is needed, help will probably be available from grandparents. Of course, many UK-based grandparents also help with childcare, but in France it seemed the expected norm rather than the generous exception. Kids are shipped off to Mamie and Papy for two weeks at a time, leaving parents free to enjoy the sunshine.Eight weeks seemed long, but in France they were manageable. Even – whisper it – fun. So why do I prefer the six-week option?Well, first, it’s better educationally. The “summer slippage” children experience from the six-week break is well documented;pupils are thought to loseup to 40% of the gains they have made over the school year during this time. Another two weeks to forget everything could be catastrophic. And, however well supported children are, eight weeks is a long time to be away from the structure and routine of school. By the end the kids seemed feral, and were so accustomed to getting up later they found it hard to adjust to the 6am start.Despite moaning that their French friends are already sunning themselves, my children have had fun during those “extra” two weeks at school. Lessons have been wound down and learning tied up. School plays have been performed, awards dished out, sports days (something they didn’t experience in France) enjoyed. Classes have met their new teachers for September, and new schools have been visited. There’s a sense of growing anticipation of the break ahead when teachers and pupils relax and (dare I say) enjoy each other’s company. It’s true that, in my experience, not a huge amount of learning occurs during this time. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t value in spending another fortnight in the classroom.Some might argue that even six weeks is too long for a summer break. But despite the summer slippage, I’d be loath to have holidays reduced further. This six-week break is a childhood rite of passage and I’d hate to see kids lose it. (Plus, as an ex-teacher, I know it’s one of the few times staff get a proper break not filled entirely with marking and planning – mess with it at your peril.)Instead, imagine if the UK government took a lesson from France and provided better, affordable care for families, and helped those who need support take their holiday during these expensive months (not necessarily by subsidising, but by staggering school holidays across the country or working with providers to ensure fairer pricing). Then, perhaps more parents would actually look forward to the summer.Gillian Harvey is an author and mother of five living in Norfolk.

What is it about her that makes people listen?Sat 19 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTShare‘Putting yourself in this room today,” booms Mel Robbins from the stage of a sold-out London theatre, “is a decision that’s going to change the trajectory of your life.” Rows and rows of (almost exclusively) women gaze at the podcaster and self-help superstar, her image on a huge screen behind her. It’s the final day of Robbins’s first tour, this one to promote her latest book and viral sensation, The Let Them Theory – her tool for helping people detach from other people’s dramas. Outside forces, she teaches, from annoying relatives to strangers in a traffic jam, are not in your control; nor are you responsible for what they do, feel or think (so long as they are not your children). It’s a waste of time, energy and emotion to even try. Instead, you should just say to yourself: “Let them.”Robbins is bounding around, sparkling with charisma and no-nonsense charm, first in a comfy tracksuit (available from her website for £150), then in boss-lady blazer and sexy denim. For nearly two hours, she commands the stage – occasionally joined by her two grown-up daughters, one of whom, Sawyer, is the book’s co-author – and the women in the audience smile, nod, hug each other and cry. By the finale, when the confetti cannons go off and yellow ribbons rain down to Coldplay’s booming A Sky Full of Stars, I have promised myself I will (in no particular order) lose my perimenopause tummy, be nicer to my children and care less what other people think. I am, I decide, beaming to myself, ready to change the trajectory of my life.Three days before I was fully indoctrinated into the cult of Mel Robbins, when I still had some semblance of cynicism and didn’t have phrases such as “You have everything you need inside you to make it” flashing across my brain like ticker tape, I meet her in a London cafe. Robbins has flown in this morning, but you wouldn’t know it. The qualities that make her such a good podcast host – warmth, energy, humour – are intense in person.People, she argues, mostly need encouragement. “I think that’s the number one thing in people’s way,” she says, untouched iced coffee in front of her. “This sense of discouragement: my life is fucked, so nothing I do is going to matter, or I’m too old, or I’m too late, or too this.” This is where Robbins comes in, and it seems to work. The 56-year-old has a huge, cultish following. Her podcast has had more than 200m downloads, she has 10m Instagram followers and Let Them has sold 5m copies since it was published in December.View image in fullscreenMel Robbins greets fans on the second night of her sold-out Let Them tour in May. Meeting them, she says, is ‘just a reminder that I’m reaching normal people trying to get up every day and do a little better’.Photograph: Scott Eisen/Getty Images for Mel RobbinsShe has celebrity stans, including Chrissy Teigen and Davina McCall,who called herthe “queen of beginning again”. Oprah has anointed her, saying, “I have over the years read probably thousands of books. And Let Them is by far just one of the best self-help books I’ve ever read. It is right up there with all the greats … saying everything I was trying to say for 25 years.”If you have spent any time on Instagram, Robbins will probably have been served up to you at some point, face framed by blond hair and heavy-rimmed black glasses, to dispense some no-nonsense advice. Someone may have sent you one of her podcast episodes, in which she interviews renowned doctors and professors, such as the Harvard psychiatrist and happiness expert Robert Waldinger or the orthopaedic surgeon Vonda Wright (though not all guests are so rational – at least one medium has appeared). Other shows might find Robbins spending an easy hour talking about herself and the lessons she has learned about everything from diet and relationships to boosting confidence and setting boundaries. Even if you don’t know her name, you have probably been touched by her rules for empowered life. Maybe people have begun saying “let them” around you when they’re frustrated by friends’ behaviour, or used the five-second rule (counting down from five before doing something uncomfortable) or high-fiving themselves in the mirror before breakfast – blame Robbins for all of that. She is the ultimate in personal brand-building – a lawyer turned motivational speaker who, according to legend, dragged herself out of an $800,000 debt to become a star of the advice economy in her 50s.She wanted to do the tour, she says, to look her audience in the eye. “It’s just a reminder that who I’m reaching are normal people trying to get up every day and do a little better. I’m not trying to reach people who want to be billionaires.” Does she feel like a rock star, soaking up the adulation? “I don’t think about that,” she insists. “When you have something this extraordinary happen this late in life, you’re very clear about what matters – my family and my friends, and I’m mostly driven by the impact that I can make.”The uglier I look on social, the better the content does. I don’t even think about it as being vulnerable. To me, it’s just easier to be honestSelf-development is huge, from questionable wellbeing influencers to any number of writers and podcasters exploring what it takes to be healthy, happy and successful. What does it say about us, in the affluent west, that we all crave it? Are we all narcissists? “No,” Robbins says with a smile, “but we all have that self-centredness. I personally feel we’re so overoptimised for productivity, but what I also hope happens is that, in listening to podcasts and reading this book, you’re reminded of what’s actually important to you. Most of us focus on the wrong things for too long, and then we realise we didn’t spend the time we wish we had with our parents while they were here, and we realise we worked too many late nights at work and we didn’t spend time with our pets or our friends.”Is all this advice, overwhelmingly aimed at women, just another way to make them feel they need more, or to change, or be perfect? Robbins brushes over the question, saying, “I guess what I want women in particular to know is you have more power than you think.”She is sometimes criticised for not being a qualified psychologist or therapist, or for dispensing obvious or age-old advice, but that is to miss her talent – she has an ability in the way she distils and communicates information to mainline it straight to your brain. I know, because for years I’ve had her voice in my head in a way that few other wellbeing podcasters – and I’ve listened to them all at some point – take up residence.Robbins acknowledges that her insights aren’t necessarily new. “Everybody has said ‘let them’ a bazillion times,” she says. “This is stoicism. It’s radical acceptance. It’s the serenity prayer.” What is it abouthersaying it that makes people listen? She ponders for a second. “I think this is a moment. I’ve said to our team: we never would have been able to orchestrate something as extraordinary as the timing of this – a modern twist on a timeless rule of life, for a moment where it feels like the Earth is spinning off its axis. All of the things that have lined up, I don’t feel that it’s me; I feel in service of something bigger.”As a child growing up in Michigan, Robbins wanted to be a doctor like her father (her mother ran a kitchenware shop). Was she a confident teenager? “I think people who knew me would say yes. What I would say is I was deeply anxious and insecure.” Her anxiety made her driven, she thinks, “but I wouldn’t call it confidence”. She “barely made it through” law school – she had undiagnosed dyslexia and ADHD – but thrived in mock trials and oral argument. For three years, Robbins worked as a legal-aid criminal-defence lawyer in Manhattan, representing people who couldn’t afford to pay for representation. It taught her to develop intimacy fast. “The job is actually about trust, and building trust with somebody that didn’t pick you.” And it exposed her to people who had had extremely difficult lives. It was around the time New York City was being cleaned up, and with so many petty arrests to process, Robbins would often work in the night court. “When you’re representing somebody in a bail hearing, one of the things the judge considers is ties to community. Night after night, I would go into that courtroom, and I would call out for family or friends for this person, and no one was there. It broke my heart.” Later, it would be the reason she ends her podcast with the words: “In case no one else tells you today, I wanted to be sure to tell you I love you.”By this time, Robbins had met her husband, Chris. When he got a place at business school in Boston, they moved. “I went to a large law firm and wanted to die,” she says. With four weeks of her maternity leave with her first child left, she reveals, “I had a mental breakdown and said, ‘I’m not doing that any more.’ An interesting thing about human beings is that when you have a defined problem, most of us are good at solving it. I found a new job the night before I was supposed to go back.” For the next few years, Robbins worked for tech startups and digital marketers, and wondered what to do with her life, so she hired a life coach, who suggested that actually Robbins would make a good coach herself. She loved it, and was good at it. She started a daily call-in radio show, Make It Happen With Mel Robbins, and a newspaper column, and was already laying the foundations of her empire: there was a development deal with Disney, and books and a talkshow planned. In a 2007 magazine profile, Robbins, then in her late 30s, sounds hyper, talking up everything about herself – her sex life and marriage, her body, her work. Call it hubris.Within a couple of years her husband’s business was struggling, leaving them $800,000 in debt. How did she cope? “I wanted to kill him. I’m serious. I wanted to absolutely kill him. Those moments when things go off the rails in your life, it’s easier to be angry than it is to be afraid, and I could tell he was afraid, which just made me even angrier, because I felt fearful that we’d never get out of the situation.” She felt incapacitated for about six months, she says. “I drank myself into the ground. I was a bitch every time he was around. I withdrew from my friends. I didn’t tell my parents what was going on.” She lost a long-term coaching job. “I felt, how can I possibly give anybody advice when my life looks like this? I’m not even an impostor; I’m just a liar. And so my whole life kind of collapsed.”View image in fullscreenRobbinsPhotograph: Shane BensonBlame seemed the obvious response. “And then you avoid doing what you really could be doing. It goes back to what we were talking about: discouragement. I believed at that moment, at 41 with three kids under the age of 10, and liens on the house and no income coming in, that I would never get out of this.” It was in this state, slumped in front of the TV and seeing an advert that used images of a rocket launch, that Robbins had the idea that, instead of staying in bed the next morning, she would count down from five and launch herself out of it.It worked for other things – the idea being that if you give yourself more than five seconds, you will talk yourself out of doing something difficult or hard. In 2011, Robbins, who was still earning a living as a coach and motivational speaker, and had just published her first book, Stop Saying You’re Fine, was invited by a friend to speak at a Tedx event in San Francisco. “That was like a 21-minute-long panic attack,” she says with a laugh. She didn’t intend to make her “five-second rule” a thing, but she blurted it out towards the end. The video went viral (it has now had more than 33m views), then she published her second book, based on the “rule”, in 2017. Her next book, The High 5 Habit – essentially, high-five yourself in the mirror in the morning, setting a plan for the day, boosting confidence and silencing your inner critic – became a bestseller, and in 2022 Robbins launched her podcast.It’s in this arena that Robbins, by talking about overcoming adversity, feels infinitely more relatable. In her episodes on trauma, she has described being sexually abused by an older child while on a family holiday, around the age of 10. She has also talked about the impact of getting a later-life ADHD diagnosis, and issues her husband and three children have gone through; part of her live show is about how she improved her relationship with her eldest child. How does she feel about using her personal life and trauma in her work? “It’s easier than hiding it,” she says. “So many of us are putting on a front, yet every one of us is going through something. I feel that sharing, like any good friend does with another friend – that’s a way to make all of this scientific research relatable and understandable.”When she’s more open or vulnerable, is listener engagement greater? “Here’s what I do know – the uglier I look on social, the better the content does,” she says with a laugh. “I don’t even think about it as being vulnerable. To me, it’s just easier to be honest. When you feel like you can’t disclose something, you’re judging yourself. Being free with your history and what you’ve learned from it means you don’t judge, and you don’t have shame around what’s happened to you.”If Robbins was successful before, her Let Them theory has taken that to another level. Essentially, it’s simple: if you spend too much time worrying about what other people do or say, which you can’t control anyway, you’re giving them too much power. Focus on yourself. It isn’t about being a doormat, or about resignation, she says. “When you say, ‘let them’, you’re notallowinganybody to do anything. You’rerecognisingwhat people are doing, and what’s in your control and what’s not.”In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreThis is only the first stage in the process. One problem with saying “let them”, she acknowledges, is that it can put you in a position of judgment and superiority. “That’s why it works, because when you feel superior, that unhooks you from the frustration or hurt you may feel.” But if that’s all you do, she warns, you can end up isolating yourself. “At some point you’ve got to use the ‘let me’ part. I think what keeps you from becoming an asshole and cutting people out of your life is:let me decide what I’m going to do in response.” Maybe that will be accepting you’re the sibling who always checks in, or the friend who invariably makes the plans. “Maybe, conversely, you’re going to realise: I’ve been chasing these people all this time; they don’t give me anything in return. Is this what I deserve? Maybe I should pour my time into creating other types of relationships.” That’s the harder part. But, Robbins adds, “If all people want to do is say, ‘let them’, then let them.”How has her theory changed her life? “I had no idea how much I allowed the outside world and meaningless bullshit to penetrate me and my peace, whether it was traffic or people walking slowly, or somebody who didn’t text me back when I thought they should, or somebody’s mood.” Applying her tactic helped, she says, “to let them have their emotions and opinions, and then remind myself: what do I want to think about this? What do I want or not want to do?”.Robbins’s style can be quite tough. “You think I’m tough?” Forthright, then. “I think I’m honest,” she says. In her book, she writes that, if you’re stuck in a job you hate, “the harsh truth is you’re the one to blame – because you are choosing to stay in a job that makes you miserable”. Doesn’t that underestimate the reality for people who don’t have the privilege of walking into another job? “You always have options,” Robbins says. “You may not have options tomorrow, but you have options. Even if you are living paycheck to paycheck and you are sleeping on a friend’s couch, if you believe there are no other options, you won’t look for them. It is important to recognise that, with time and consistent effort, you can create different options.”We’re in a moment, she says, “where the headlines are terrifying, economies are faltering, AI is coming, jobs are redundant. You don’t know if you’re going to get laid off.” That’s beyond your control, she says. “Say: let them lay you off. You’re recognising it could happen, and reminding yourself to not waste time and energy worrying, feeling like a loser, feeling like you’ve got no options. Solet me, every day after work, spend an hour getting my résumé together, networking and doing what I need to do to build skills. You will feel empowered when you focus on what’s in your control, and what’s in your control is what you put your time and energy into.”It can be applied to big or small things. Robbins describes herself as a “very political person”. “If we’re ever going to get things back on track in terms of people feeling stability and peace and support, you can’t burn through all your energy feeling powerless. You’ve got to remind yourself: I actually have the power to change this. If it bothers me, the more energy I spend arguing about it and venting about it, the less time I’m spending getting myself organised to change this.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Scott Eisen/Getty Images for Mel RobbinsWith Robbins’s increased success and profile has come, inevitably, more criticism. How does she deal with that? “Let them,” she says instantly. Does it not hurt when she reads horrible comments about herself online? “No.” She doesn’t look, anyway – people who are intent on misunderstanding aren’t her problem, she adds. Does she think male podcasters get an easier time? “Yes – no question. Absolutely.”One of the persistent allegations is that Robbins plagiarised “let them” from a poem that went viral in 2022. She has always said she hadn’t seen the poem and her inspiration came from the night she was trying to micromanage her 18-year-old son’s school prom, and her middle child, her daughter Kendall, told her in a moment of exasperation to “let them” – get soaked in the rain, have tacos if they want them, just let them. “Anybody that can’t see that a poem is very different than a book that makes a case for a theory, with an 18-page bibliography, doesn’t want to see, and doesn’t understand the word plagiarism either,” Robbins says.I agree it’s a fairly weak criticism, as is the complaint that she has stretched a basic idea into a whole book (and now tour) – something that could be applied to just about every self-help book ever written. Her podcast remains free and, unlike many other motivational “influencers”, she doesn’t flog online courses, or supplements. I take more issue with some of the oversimplistic things she says: “Success, love, happiness, money, friendship – these things are in limitless supply,” said the multimillionaire Mel Robbins to the billionaire Oprah Winfrey, on the latter’s podcast.‘Let them’: can this viral self-help mantra change your life?Read moreRobbins says she follows her own rules “about 90% of the time”. When she’s at home in Vermont, she gets up around 6am, makes her bed, “so I don’t crawl back into it”, and high-fives herself in the mirror. She might take a bite of a banana, “because of what Dr Stacy Sims said about cortisol and women never working out fasted”. Sims, a physiologist and one of her podcast guests, says that, for women, exercising on an empty stomach means burning lean muscle and holding on to fat. “I was like: motherfucker, we’ve been gaslit by the fitness industry. It’s incredible what she shared about women not being little men.” Robbins walks her dogs to get her early sunlight (it helps with the circadian rhythm), drinks water before her coffee, has breakfast. She has a regular walking group with friends. She likes to cook, so she’ll start prepping dinner when she does lunch, then it’s bath and bed not long after 9pm. “I’m so fucking old,” she says with a laugh. “But I love my sleep.”In the middle of it all is work. She wants, she says, to be an example “of leaning into new things and reinventing myself over and over, and clawing our way out of debt in our 40s. There’s so much you can do.” Robbins, similarly to Oprah, controls her empire. “I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m pissed off about the deal I made, and if I’m in control of what happens, the only person I can truly be mad at is me.” Is she a life coach or a media mogul? “I’m just your friend, Mel,” she says with a bright smile.A few days later, on stage, Robbins is so overcome with emotion, she can barely get her last words out: “I love you, I do, and I believe in you.” There are cheers and whoops, and that blast of confetti and Coldplay, and we leave on a high. I chat to two women, in their 40s, who had been sitting behind me, emotional at points; one has a delicate tattoo on her arm of a dandelion releasing its seeds and the words “Let them … Let me”. They love Robbins, says Eva (with the tattoo), “because she’s so normal. She’s been through stuff like all of us have, but she’s got grit and determination, and she’s an example that, if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything.” Her friend Hayley says the years and the struggles since the pandemic have left her feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. “I know that I need to make a change,” she says, eyes shining. “She makes you believe you can do it.”The Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins is published by Hay House UK at £22.99.

He told investigators he did not recall the incident.Dann, who was in the £120,000-a-year post for four years, faced other allegations of misogynistic name-calling and making comments to women with sexual connotations, according to Home Office sources.He denied the allegations, suggesting comments had been taken out of context and that selected evidence had been used during the investigation by the Home Office’s professional standards unit (PSU). He acknowledged during the process that some of his comments may have been careless, but said he had never intended to upset or offend.After a chaotic HR process, which one source said was littered with “procedural errors and delays”, the original grievance was eventually upheld on appeal.However, Dann was not informed about the process until the initial stage was completed. He was also subject to a parallel misconduct investigation into the claims which was not upheld.Dann decided to leave the Home Office in December last year, standing down as the COO of Border Force, a role that placed him at the centre of the organisation’s key responsibilities, including securing the UK’s borders by enforcing immigration regulations and patrolling coastlines during the small-boats crisis. He has since entered the private sector in the field of security and law enforcement operations, and public safety.The complainant first reported Dann in February 2024, after working with him for 18 months. An initial internal grievance inquiry was launched two months later, with the final PSU report quoting named Home Office officials who appeared to confirm a series of sexist and misogynistic comments, according to sources.While the complaint was not initially upheld, it was later upheld on appeal in October 2024. Dann was not involved in this process and was not given the opportunity to respond.At the same time a separate misconduct process was launched, also based on evidence in the PSU report. This was not upheld, no formal disciplinary sanction was imposed, and there was no record of it on Dann’s file, although Home Office sources said he was asked to undergo training in response.The claims being investigated included the colleague being told in a voice note that she was “very pretty”, which the PSU report concluded was “reasonable” for her to have interpreted as harassment. Other comments were described by the report as “inappropriate and offensive” and “unprofessional topics with a sexual connotation”.According to sources, the report said he messaged about one person who attended a meeting suggesting that she had a “porn star name”, which he told the inquiry was meant in a “lighthearted” way. On a separate occasion, he was said to have misnamed a female colleague “kinky”, although he later admitted this had been a “careless” thing to say.During a discussion on the diversity of his office, Dann allegedly said: “Don’t forget the sweaty woman in the corner”, referring to a colleague going through menopause. In the report, he denied making this comment.In another meeting, in December 2022, he asked junior colleagues if they knew what a “fluffer” was, and then explained it was “someone whose job was to keep a porn star’s penis erect”, sources said. He denied to investigators that he had made the remarks.On the official visit to Border Force in Paris in April 2023, he brought up the Channel 4 naked dating show Naked Attraction to two female officers working in intelligence. In remarks corroborated by witnesses, he added: “We were thinking it could be all the regional directors and, you know, people had to look at it and guess whose penis it was.”The officers were “very shocked” by the conversation and felt “incredibly uncomfortable”, a senior official told investigators, but when they were asked if they wanted to make a complaint they said they would prefer that Dann not return to the Paris office. This was reported to Border Force chiefs. Dann told them he did not recall the incident.One senior official who witnessed the exchange said they were “disappointed” by Dann’s conduct, which they felt was “inappropriate”. Several others said they considered that he was “prone to oversharing” about his private life at work, sources with knowledge of the report said.Do you have information about this story? Email: pippa.crerar@theguardian.com. For the most secure communications see theguardian.com/tipsThe appeal, which was based on the same evidence in the PSU report, was finally concluded eight months after the initial complaint. It was after the Labour government entered office, and six weeks later Dann left his role, declaring that after nine years at the Home Office it was time to “embrace new challenges”.In a letter to the complainant in October 2024, the Home Office upheld the grievance, acknowledging that Dann’s conduct had fallen below the standards expected from a senior official and was in breach of the department’s policies on appropriate behaviour, sources said.However, Dann – who was previously a “people champion” and diversity lead in the civil service, roles that focused on improving the workplace environment, as well as representing the organisation in parliament and in the media – avoided any formal consequences because the separate earlier disciplinary process had already concluded and the rules meant it could not be reopened.According to sources, Dann told the initial investigation he had worked incredibly hard in a stressful frontline environment. Much of his time running Border Force operations was when the Tory government was struggling to get control of irregular migration, including small-boat crossings.Several of the witnesses said they had not been offended by his behaviour. However others, including senior civil servants and junior frontline operational staff, found his conduct inappropriate and unprofessional, according to sources who have seen the final PSU report and with knowledge of the final outcome.During the PSU investigation, Dann denied some of his conduct and said other incidents had been taken out of context, and that selected evidence had been used. But sources said he added that “on reflection” there had been times when some of his comments had been “careless”, although they were not meant in a malicious way. When approached by the Guardian, he declined to comment.Yvette Cooper, who was home secretary throughout the latter part of the grievance process, has repeatedly and vocally called out workplace discrimination, misogyny and harassment. The case was flagged with her office although she is understood not to have been personally aware.A Home Office spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on individual HR cases, where there are allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual harassment the Home Office will investigate and take appropriate action.“The Home Office expects the highest standard from all members of staff and does not tolerate anyone displaying or taking part in unacceptable behaviour.“The new permanent secretary has already commissioned a review of complaints, conduct and disciplinary procedures, to ensure absolute confidence in the integrity of the system.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

However, these mechanisms are profoundly inadequate to meet the urgent needs of children in Gaza,” said Carolin Ott from the law firm Leigh Day, who is leading the action.The families of the three children, aged two and five, have said an urgent evacuation is needed for critical medication and treatment they are unable to access in Gaza. To date, the UK has yet to offer itself as a receiving state for medical evacuations from Gaza,and campaigners have been pushing for a separate immigration route.The two-year-old, referred to as Child Y, has an arteriovenous malformation in his cheek which causes daily bleeding and has left him in critical condition.The other children, two siblings referred to as Child S, have been diagnosed with cystinosis nephropathy, a chronic condition also known as leaky kidney. They have already developed kidney failure and may need transplants. One of the siblings is no longer able to move.The action comes as Israel’s war on Gaza passed 650 days. Since 7 October, more than 17,000 of the 58,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the territory were children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that as many as 12,500 patients in Gaza require medical evacuation. As of 10 April, 7,229 patients have been evacuated to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the EU and the US. Of these patients, 4,984 have been children.However, organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, which has evacuated 22 patients, have called on more nations to help, as the limited destinations remain a challenge, said Dr Hani Isleem, MSF project coordinator for medical evacuations from Gaza.“Some countries are reluctant to take in patients, fearing they might be perceived as facilitating ‘forced migration’ or as taking on the burden of the patients’ extended stay,” he said.A government spokesperson said that since the start of the conflict the UK has provided healthcare to more than 500,000 people in thePalestinian territoriesthrough supporting field hospitals and medical supplies. In May, the UK announced a £7.5m package of support for medical care in Gaza and the region.“We have helped several children with complex paediatric conditions access privately funded medical care in the UK, supporting an initiative by Project Pure Hope, the spokesperson said.In May, two children arrived in the UK for medical care with the assistance of Project Pure Hope. It was the first time the UK let in a child from Gaza for medical care, which was privately funded, and is the only existing route for those in need of critical care. According to legal documents, the charity had requested a Gaza-UK pathway at the government’s expense and was refused.“We have been clear the situation in Gaza is intolerable and that there must be an immediate ceasefire. We urge Israel to let vital humanitarian aid in and allow Gazans to receive urgent healthcare, including allowing the sick and wounded to temporarily leave the Gaza Strip to receive treatment,” the government spokesperson said.The prime minister has also been urged to engage by Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, who wrote to Keir Starmer this month saying they “stand ready” to receive injured children from Gaza to be treated in the NHS.“We can’t do so without the support of the Labour government to get the children through the UK visa system and into Scotland,” said Swinney, who has not yet received a response from Starmer.The government has until 28 July to respond to the pre-action letter.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

No pretext, nothing. It’s about destroying things and showing the territory belongs to you.”Prosecutors said vehicles, some with families and children, were attacked but there were no immediate reports of wounded drivers. “None of the motorists were physically assaulted. However, several are particularly shocked,” prosecutors said in a statement.Unrest had erupted nearby, in Val de l’Aurence, on the night of 14 July, France’s national day. Lombertie said this “very poor neighbourhood, with young people from immigrant backgrounds” had become a “lawless zone”.The Limoges prosecutor, Émilie Abrantes, said that although the neighbourhood was known for drug trafficking, there was no evidence linking the unrest to recent investigations into drug trafficking.France’s interior ministry said it would deploy a special security force to the city.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He is in custody waiting to be questioned.Two peoplewere arrested on Fridayin relation to the protests.Riot police wore helmets while crowds of men, some masked, surrounded a small counter-demonstration by anti-racism activists.Counter-demonstrators and police were pelted with plastic bottles, eggs and flour but the violence worsened as those in the crowd directly attacked officers and vandalised police vans.Dean Walters, 65, of Corner Meadow in Harlow, has been charged with affray and will appear at court in September after a separate protest on Sunday 13 July.A second man arrested for a breach of a dispersal order has been released on conditional bail.Thursday’s demonstration was the latest in a series of protests outside the hotel since an asylum seeker was charged with three counts of sexual assault.Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denied the offences when he appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court on Thursday, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month.Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: “The events in Epping on Thursday were shocking and have no place in our neighbourhoods.

Some people were carried away while others were led away in handcuffs.The Metropolitan police said 55 people had been arrested in Parliament Square under section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for displaying placards in support of Palestine Action.The force added a further nine people were arrested for supporting Palestine Action within a separate large-scale march to Whitehall by the Palestine Coalition.Defend Our Juries said on X: “The UK government is complicit in Israel’s genocide against Palestinians. They are attempting to silence those who expose this complicity.”A woman who was detained in Parliament Square said: “We demand that Palestine Action is de-proscribed.“Our government is not only arming a genocide, they are using terrorism laws to silence people who speak out.“Palestine Action are campaigning for peace. They are dismantling weapons factories.”Greater Manchester police said they arrested 16 people, who remained in custody for questioning. Avon and Somerset police said 17 people were arrested during a protest in Bristol.At Truro Cathedral in Cornwall, eight people were arrested after protesters gathered to show support for Palestine Action. .Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement that about 30 protesters were involved in a “peaceful” Defend Our Juries demonstration.“A number of placards which were contrary to the law remained on display despite police advice,” the force said. “Eight people, two men and six women, were arrested on suspicion of offences under section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. They remain in police custody.”At a high court hearing on Monday, the co-founder of Palestine Action, Huda Ammori, will ask for permission to challenge the home secretary’s decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws.UN experts, civil liberties groups, cultural figures and hundreds of lawyers have condemned the ban as draconian and said it sets a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.More than 70 people were arrested last week at demonstrations across the UK where references to Palestine Action were allegedly made.Police Scotland arrested a man in Glasgow on Friday “for displaying a sign expressing support for a proscribed organisation”.The sign read “Genocide in Palestine, time to take action” with the words “Palestine” and “action” larger than the others. Another man wearing a T-shirt with the same slogan was charged with a similar offence last weekend at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans to ban Palestine Action last month, days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.The ban means Palestine Action has become the first direct action protest group to be banned under the Terrorism Act, placing it in the same category as Islamic State, al-Qaida and the far-right group National Action.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He also said Israeli intervention “pushed the country into a dangerous phase”.Late on Saturday, the interior ministry said clashes in Sweida city had been halted and the area cleared of Bedouin tribal fighters following the deployment.The presidency added in a statement that any breaches of the ceasefire would be a “clear violation to sovereignty”, and urged all parties to “fully commit” to it and end hostilities in all areas immediately.Syria’s internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida “with the aim of protecting civilians and putting an end to the chaos”, the interior ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba said in a statement on Telegram.A statement on Saturday by one of the three religious leaders of the Syrian Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri,saidthe ceasefire would guarantee safe exit for community members and the opening of humanitarian corridors for besieged civilians to leave.Correspondents with Agence France-Presse, however, reported clashes in the west of the provincial capital as Druze fighters battled armed Bedouin supported by tribal gunmen from other parts of Syria. The Druze fighters said those who had arrived to support the Bedouin were mostly Islamists.One armed tribesman, who identified himself only as Abu Jassem, told AFP that “we will slaughter them [the Druze] in their homes”.France’s foreign ministry urged all sides to respect the ceasefire. “France welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire in the Sweida region. It urges all parties to strictly adhere to it,” the ministry said. “Fighting and violence must cease immediately.”The US special envoy, Thomas Barrack, had announced early on Saturday morning that Israel and Syria had agreed to a ceasefire, after Israel sided with the Druze factions and joined the conflict, including by bombing a government building in Damascus.Barrack, who is the US ambassador to Ankara, said the deal had the backing of Turkey, a key supporter of Sharaa, as well as neighbouring Jordan.“We call upon Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbours,” he wrote on X.Sharaa followed up on the US announcement by renewing his pledge to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities.“The Syrian state is committed to protecting all minorities and communities in the country … We condemn all crimes committed” in Sweida, he said in his televised speech.He also paid tribute to the “important role played by the United States, which again showed its support for Syria in these difficult circumstances and its concern for the country’s stability”.The EU welcomed the deal between Syria and Israel, saying it had been appalled by the deadly sectarian violence of recent days.But Israel expressed deep scepticism about Sharaa’s renewed pledge to protect minorities, pointing to deadly violence against Alawites as well as Druze since he led the overthrow of the country’s longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.In Sharaa’s Syria “it is very dangerous to be a member of a minority – Kurd, Druze, Alawite or Christian”, the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, posted on X.The UN had previously called for an end to the fighting and demanded an independent investigation of the violence, which has killed at least 940 people from both sides since Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).Map of Sweida provinceThe SOHRreported on Friday that the humanitarian situation in Sweida had “dramatically deteriorated” owing to an acute shortage of food and medical supplies. All hospitals were out of service because of the conflict and looting was widespread in the city.“The situation in the hospital is disastrous. The corpses have begun to rot, there’s a huge amount of bodies, among them women and children,” a surgeon at Sweida national hospital said over the phone.The renewed fighting raised questions about the authority of Sharaa, whose interim governmentfaces misgivings from the country’s minoritiesafter thekilling of 1,500 mostly Alawite civilianson the Syrian coast in March.‘Shot in the head, as if executed’: four days of violence end with hundreds dead in southern SyriaRead moreIt was Sharaa who ordered government forces to pull out of Sweida, saying that mediation by the US and others had helped to avert a “large-scale escalation” with Israel.A number of sources told Reuters that Sharaa had initially misread how Israel would respond to him deploying troops to the country’s south earlier this week, having been encouraged by Barrack saying Syria should be centrally governed as one country.When Israel targeted Syrian troops and Damascus on Wednesday,bombarding the Syrian defence ministry headquartersin the centre of the capital and striking near the presidential palace, it took the Syrian government by surprise, the sources said.1:10Israel launches strikes on Damascus as sectarian violence flares in southern Syria – videoDruze people are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes were a message to Syria’s president regarding the events in Sweida.But the Syrian government mistakenly believed it had a green light from the US and Israel to dispatch its forces south despite months of Israeli warnings not to do so, according to the Reuters sources, which included Syrian political and military officials, two diplomats and regional security sources.The violence erupted last Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, the SOHR said.The government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and the SOHR said the troops had sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters. The organisation reported that 19 civilians had been killed in an “horrific massacre” when Syrian defence ministry forces and general security forces entered the town of Sahwat al-Balatah.A truce was negotiated on Wednesday after the Israeli bombardment, allowing Druze factions and clerics to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out.Sharaa said in a speech on Thursday that Druze groups would be left to govern security affairs in the southern province in what he described as a choice to avoid war.“We sought to avoid dragging the country into a new, broader war that could derail it from its path to recovery from the devastating war,” he said. “We chose the interests of Syrians over chaos and destruction.”But clashes resumed on Thursday as Syrian state media reported that Druze groups had launched revenge attacks on Bedouin villages. Bedouin tribes had fought alongside government forces against Druze fighters earlier in the week.On Friday, about 200 tribal fighters clashed with armed Druze men from Sweida using machine guns and shells, an AFP correspondent said, while the SOHR reported fighting and “shelling on neighbourhoods in Sweida city”.Sweida has been heavily damaged in the fighting and its mainly Druze inhabitants have been deprived of water and electricity. Communication lines have also been cut.Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the local news outlet Suwayda 24, said the humanitarian situation was “catastrophic”. “We cannot find milk for children,” he told AFP.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, has demanded “independent, prompt and transparent investigations into all violations” adding that “those responsible must be held to account”.The International Committee for the Red Cross said “health facilities are overwhelmed, medical supplies are dwindling and power cuts are impeding the preservation of human remains in overflowing morgues”.“The humanitarian situation in Sweida is critical. People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.Syria’s minority groups have been given what many see as only token representation in the interim government since the former president fled the country, according to Bassam Alahmad, the executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a civil society organisation.“It’s a transitional period. We should have a dialogue, and they [the minorities] should feel that they’re a real part of the state,” Alahmad said. Instead, the incursion into Sweida sent a message that the new authorities would use military force to “control every part of Syria”.“Bashar Assad tried this way” and failed, he said.Government supporters, however, fear its decision to withdraw could signal to other minorities that it is acceptable to demand their own autonomous regions, which they say would fragment and weaken the country.If Damascus ceded security control of Sweida to the Druze, “of course everyone else is going to demand the same thing”, said Abdel Hakim al-Masri, a former official in the Turkish-backed regional government in north-west Syria before Assad’s fall.“This is what we are afraid of,” he told the Associated Press.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

At the age of 38, Usyk outclassed and outfought his British rival, who is 11 years his junior, to establish himself definitively as the best heavyweight, so far, of the 21st century.The end was as conclusive as it was crushing. A sharp combination set up an opening for Usyk’s crunching right hook. Dubois crumpled to the canvas then, bravely, he rose unsteadily to his feet. But the outcome had already been decided. Usyk moved in with shark-like speed and stealth. A shuddering overhead left detonated against the already listing head of Dubois who fell heavily to the canvas, his gumshield spitting helplessly from his mouth.Oleksandr Usyk v Daniel Dubois: undisputed heavyweight championship – live reactionRead moreThe referee began his count but even before he could reach 10 a white towel fluttered from Dubois’ corner. But the knockout was complete and the culmination of another masterclass by Usyk who, in only his eighth fight as a heavyweight, having moved up from cruiserweight, sealed his domination of boxing’s flagship division.Usyk raised his arms high as Dubois managed the slow, bleak walk back to the refuge of his shocked team. The champion then sank down on his knees on the blue canvas, covering his face with the gloves as the magnitude of his brilliant performance sank in. Usyk has now regained the IBF title which boxing politics had taken from him and gifted to Dubois last year. That largely meaningless trinket joins the WBA, WBC and WBO baubles which Usyk already owns and restores his status as the unanimous king of the heavyweight division – a position he first achieved 14 months ago when beating Tyson Fury. Dubois joins both Fury and Anthony Joshua in having suffered successive defeats by the Ukrainian wizard.View image in fullscreenDaniel Dubois on the canvas in the fifth round.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesBefore he left the dressing room to start the fight Dubois was embraced by his father, Stan, who has exerted such a controlling influence over his career while always predicting that he would one day become the dominant heavyweight on the planet. Usyk, however, awaited.Dubois walked to the ring first as the words “It’s my redemption story” were emblazoned across the screens inside Wembley. By the time he reached the entrance to the arena he was moving at a fast lick, almost breaking into a little jog at one point, looking full of menacing intent. Dennis Brown’s old-school reggae classic, Want To Be No General, boomed around him.At the first sight of the great Ukrainian, chants of “U-syk … U-syk … U-syk” reverberated around Wembley as he began his far more stately march to the ring. An eerie version of Ave Maria accompanied him. His face was etched in concentration and determination until, climbing over the ropes, he raised his right arm high. He was kissed and hugged by his cornermen just before the first bell.Usyk landed the first jabs as he showed his readiness to match Dubois in an immediate desire to control the centre of the ring.Boxingout of his usual southpaw stance, Usyk snaked out his crisp right jab, clipping Dubois cleanly. But with 30 seconds left in the round Dubois backed up Usyk in his corner. Usyk recognised the danger and managed to ghost away and then detonate a hard left against Dubois’ head.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk lands the knockout blow on Daniel Dubois.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIn the second round, sweat rolled down Dubois’ back as Usyk ducked under a scything right and snapped back his rival’s head with a beautiful straight left. Dubois’ corner urged him to impose himself and he closed the distance much more successfully in the third – only for Usyk, like a savage scientist, to nail him with punches as jolting as they were precise.Usyk was locked in, watchful yet spiteful, as he made sprays of sweat fly from the shaven head of Dubois. He only grimaced when late in the fourth round Dubois landed to the body and Usyk made a slight gesture to indicate that it had been close to the beltline.

During the buildup to this fight, Usyk had spoken strongly against Vladimir Putin and invited Donald Trump to live in his house near Kyiv for one week so that the US president could finally understand the relentless brutality of the Russian onslaughtView image in fullscreenDaniel Dubois (left) and Oleksandr Usyk in action at Wembley.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PADubois was an obviously more limited opponent in comparison with real life conflict but Usyk showed again that he is a master of the ring. There had been fevered speculation among Dubois’ backers that his relative youth, more imposing physical attributes and considerable power would be enough to result in the first defeat of Usyk’s decorated professional career – which also includes him becoming the undisputed cruiserweight champion of the world.Dubois appeared to be booming with an ambition and conviction which meant he had left behind the callow and deeply reserved young man who had once been so awkward outside the ring. A run of three impressive wins, culminating in a knockout of Joshua in this same stadium last September, had apparently transformed Dubois.But Usyk was simply too skilled, too smart and too seasoned for his younger rival. He remains the king of the hill, the most impressive man in boxing, and a symbol of soaring hope and searing defiance to Ukraine. The rest of us on a raucous night at Wembley are just lucky to have seen another burst of Usyk’s majesty.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsyknewsShareReuse this content"

The rioters, after all, got what they wanted. They won.Dozens of Romanian and Bulgarian Roma families that fled have not returned and those that remain keep a low profile – they do not linger on the streets and are scarcely visible.The mobs who smashed windows, burned houses and battled police in order to expel Roma – and some other foreigners – from this corner ofNorthern Irelandsee it as a victory.“That’s them away back home. Everybody is relieved,” said Leanne Williamson, 42, who witnessed, and endorsed, the unrest. “It was madness but it was long overdue. The Romanians were ignorant and cheeky. Everyone now is at peace.”In the main flashpoint – Clonavon Terrace and adjoining streets – houses that were torched remain gutted and boarded up. Of the Roma families who inhabited them there is no sign. There are no official figures but one informed source with ties to the community estimated that of the approximate pre-riot population of 1,200, two-thirds are gone – or, to use a loaded term, ethnically cleansed.View image in fullscreenGutted homes previously occupied by foreigners in Ballymena, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian“The place is empty, a lot have left,” said Kirsty, 35, a Clonavon Road resident who withheld her surname. She did not miss her former neighbours, or what she said had been a transient flux. “You didn’t know who was coming and going. Now it’s a lot calmer. You can let your weans [children] out on the street a bit further.” Did the riots achieve their goal? “Yes.”Another local person, who did not want his name published and did not endorse the riots, said the aftermath was striking. “Ballymena was like a whole new town, there was an amazing atmosphere. It was like something out of a movie where the bad gang has been kicked out and people come out to celebrate.”The sentiment this week felt closer to quiet satisfaction, not jubilation, but it was still a counterpoint to the condemnation last month – from Keir Starmer and politicians acrossNorthern Ireland– of mayhem that left dozens of police officers injured. The Police Federation likened the outbreak to an attempted pogrom. Violence abated as quickly as it started and apart from reports of prosecutions the story disappeared from headlines.Plenty in Ballymena, a largely working-class Protestant town 25 miles north of Belfast, feel shame at what happened. “They were wrecking places and causing harm to people,” said Padraig, a teenager. “It was racist,” said his friend Robert. “I don’t think it was the right thing to do.”Their reluctance to be fully identified reflected the fact that for others in Ballymena, it was mission accomplished.View image in fullscreenAuthorities are unable to say how many people fled or have since returned to Ballymena.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianFilipinos and people from central and eastern Europe, drawn by factory work, have increased in number in the past decade, mostly without incident, but the Roma people were singled out for allegations of antisocial behaviour and criminality. An alleged sexual assault on a teenage girl by two 14-year-old boys, who appeared in court with a Romanian interpreter, triggered the riots. A third suspect fled to Romania.“Where are the foreigners?”the mob shouted during a free-for-all against anyone deemed non-local – a scene that echoed anti-immigrant riots in Belfast andEngland last summer, andfuelled warningsthat the UK is a “powder keg” of social tension.However, rioters and sympathisers later apologised to non-Roma families who were “accidentally” targeted. Posters that declared “Filipino lives here”, and loyalist bunting, sprouted on doors and windows to deflect attack.In a sign of reduced tension the stickers have gone and Filipinos said they felt safe. “We are staying, we are OK. Our dreams will not stop with the trauma,” said Karen Estrella, 35, a care home worker. Posters that declare “Locals live here” have also dwindled.View image in fullscreenA Ballymena residence with a flag and poster that declare the occupants are British.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianFero, a 45-year-old from Slovakia, said he liked Ballymena and blamed the riots on misbehaviour by Roma and Bulgarians. “I’m happy with what happened. Now they’re gone.”Authorities are unable to say how many people fled or have since returned, and appear reluctant to comment on the riots’ aftermath. Ballymena’s mayor, deputy mayor, constituency MP and several other public representatives declined or did not respond to interview requests.The Department for Communities referred questions about the vanished Roma to the Housing Executive, which said it did not hold such information but that 74 households – not necessarily Roma – sought assistance during the disorder. Of these households, 21 were placed in temporary accommodation and others made their own arrangements, said a spokesperson.Critics have accused unionist parties of turning a blind eye to racism – such as a loyalist bonfire in County Tyrone thatburned an effigy of migrants– to avoid losing votes. In Ballymena reticence extends to some civic society organisations that declined to be interviewed or quoted.A paradox underpins the vigilantism. Some local people accuse the Roma of peddling cannabis and vapes, and credit paramilitaries with leading the expulsions, yet they acknowledge that paramilitaries sell drugs. “Aye,” said one, with a shrug. “That’s it.”View image in fullscreenLeanne Williamson, a Ballymena resident, said ‘everyone now is at peace’.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianDuring the Guardian’s visit this week, the only visible Roma presence was a family at a fast-food restaurant. It was raining yet they sat at an outside bench, getting wet, rather than inside.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRaceImmigration and asylumMigrationRomaniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Women who wish to become surrogates must offer voluntarily.The regulatory environment has meant those seeking a surrogate, and those keen to be one, must turn to informal structures to find each other – the most significant one being a closed Facebook group where intended parents and surrogate candidates post their photos, introductions and bona fides as potential parents or surrogates. Then, interested parties slide into each other’s DMs, hoping to match with each other.I was curious to learn more about the women who lend their wombs to carry a baby for strangers they’d met online.As we climb into a convoy of cars to head to the farm in Bothwell, an hour’s drive from Hobart, where the retreat is being held, D’Arcy is busily pasting up “Surrogacy Express” signs on each vehicle – also in hot pink writing.D’Arcy was exposed to surrogacy through working at anIVFclinic. She became fascinated by the concept after witnessing some of the first Tasmanian surrogacy arrangements come through the clinic, shortly after it became legal in 2012.“I felt so deeply for these people who couldn’t have a baby, knowing that I have always wanted a family. I really thought maybe I could be a surrogate. It felt like something I was capable of.”At the time, she had not yet had her own two children.“Then, when I fell pregnant [with my first child] so easily, I thought, ‘Wow, I could really help someone else do this’,” she says. “And then, when I was pregnant with my second child, I started researching how to become a surrogate.”D’Arcy stumbled across the Australian Surrogacy Community group on Facebook. She met some couples, but they didn’t hit it off. Then she connected with a same-sex couple.“I just really liked them. And after conversations via social media, when I met them in person, I just clicked with them really, really well.”When I met D’Arcy at the retreat, she was almost seven months into her second surrogacy pregnancy for the same couple.Sorry, Lily Collins, but when people outsource childbirth, their motives really count | Martha GillRead moreWhy go through all that for someone else?Over the weekend, the activities include chats around the fireplace, communal meals, nature walks, yoga and crafts. Every activity is optional, and some take place simultaneously. While the bulk of the Queensland contingent decides to drive out to see the snow, the Victorian and Tasmanian surrogates opt for a yoga class. Apart from mealtimes, no schedule is set.Through it all, there are deep and candid conversations about womanhood and motherhood. From the mundane logistics of parenting to surrogate heart-to-hearts: the venting of niggles or annoyances of their relationships (with their partners and with the intended parents they carried for) to detailed and graphic descriptions of intimate medical procedures.The mood is one of total release. But the one topic that dominates every conversation is pregnancy, and how pregnancy affected each of these surrogates.Even under the best, low-risk circumstances, pregnancy takes its toll on mind and body, so I ask, “Why go through all that for someone else?”Time and time again, the women report that they want to help someone else create a family. But that isn’t the only reason – another powerful driver many raise is the need to satiate a deep, personal feeling of “not being done”.View image in fullscreenSJ said after she had her two children, she experienced a feeling of ‘being unfinished’.Photograph: Secrets We Keep: By Any Means podcastSarah Jefford became a surrogate and an egg donor after an excruciating IVF experience. Once she finally became a mother of two, she felt she wanted “to have another pregnancy and birth and not raise the baby”.“If you’re wanting to be pregnant and then you find out you’re pregnant, it’s just the best,” Jefford adds. She describes this feeling as “baby lust”.Some surrogates, such as Queensland educator SJ, who did not want to use her real name, told me that upon birthing her two children, she experienced a persistent feeling of “being unfinished”. Although she felt her own family was complete, she couldn’t shake a yearning to experience pregnancy and childbirth again. She would wake in the middle of the night to research how to become a surrogate.Tasmanian trail runner Chelsea had a daughter and didn’t want any more children of her own, but also wanted to experience birthing again, while helping someone else experience parenthood.“Now that I knew the course of the race, I thought I could try and do it and be a bit more present within my body and run a better race, so to speak.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They used an egg donor (also a friend) and the sperm of one parent. She found out she was carrying twins during a check-up, where the dads and egg donor were also present.“The reaction from everyone was slightly different. They had tears of joy. I had tears of joy, but a little bit of fear of the unknown, because [twins weren’t] something we had talked about beforehand as a possibility.”The babies were monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins; they shared one placenta. That meant Chelsea required significantly more medical monitoring.She gave birth to healthy identical twin girls three months before the retreat.“The number one question that I get about being a surrogate is how did you feel about giving the baby away? Or in this case, babies. And I never, ever thought of it that way. I always thought of it that I was growing their babies, not that I was giving anything away.An English couple, a Ukrainian surrogate and a baby: the extraordinary story of how war united two unlikely familiesRead more“And once the girls were here it was just amazing to see them [the parents] within the space of a day, just become the amazing dads that I knew that they would be.”Chelsea refers to the four people – the two dads, the egg donor and herself – who created the twins as a “team”. They experienced the whole process together: from the embryo transfer to monitoring appointments, and they continue to spend time with each other.But as I sat around the fireplace and shared meals with these women at various stages of pregnancy and postpartum, I couldn’t help but think they’d giving up a lot to carry for free.The costs of altruismPregnancy and childbirth are not free. In Australia, while payment for surrogates is illegal, intended parents must pay for all their surrogate’s “reasonable expenses”, including medical expenses, maternity clothes and lost wages.“But then there’s a question mark because the legislation says it must be reasonable. What’s reasonable? Reasonable for you might be different to reasonable for somebody else,” Jefford explains.“Most surrogates will use their own money to pay for things, not because the intended parents are stingy, but because we are the sort of people that will just be like, ‘I’ll just pay for hospital parking myself, or I’ll pay for the maternity pads.’”In December last year, the federal government announced a review of Australia’s surrogacy laws. The review aims to identify reforms and propose harmonised laws across the country. A response to the review is due by the end of July.I used to say, when we introduce money into surrogacy, we commodify women and children. What I say now is it’s much more nuanced than thatSarah JeffordWhen Australia’s surrogacy laws were drafted, legislators opted for the altruistic surrogacy model as it’s often deemed ethically superior to commercial surrogacy, which is susceptible to human trafficking and the exploitation of vulnerable women.Jefford has long been opposed to paid surrogacy but recently has come to favour a compensated model of surrogacy in which surrogates are perhaps paid some amount of money, “as if it’s a job”.“I used to say, when we introduce money into surrogacy, we commodify women and children. What I say now is it’s much more nuanced than that,” she says.Jefford explains the idea of compensated surrogacy is different from paying a fee in exchange for a baby. “That is human trafficking and it’s illegal.“Pregnancy is hard work and risky,” she says.“This woman comes along and says, ‘I’ll do this for free’. And I think, ‘Well, I’m not giving legal advice for free, and the IVF clinic is not giving free IVF treatment. Why is it that we think that she should be unpaid for what she’s doing?’”Despite guardrails, things can go sourIn Australia, before intended parents and surrogates are legallyallowed to undergo surrogacy, they must attend various counselling sessions to ensure they are emotionally equipped to go through the process, that it is consensual, and there is no exploitation.During these sessions, intended parents and surrogates discuss thorny issues such as body autonomy, what happens if anything goes wrong with the pregnancy, what happens if there are signs of genetic abnormalities in the embryo, or any complications that could endanger the life of the surrogate. The aim is to set expectations beforehand, to avoid issues once the baby is born.Despite all the guardrails, things can go sour. At the retreat, surrogates share horror stories about some relationship breakdowns.There was one case in which the surrogate and intended parents had fallen out and were not on speaking terms until shortly before the birth. Another in which the intended parents failed to show up on the day of the birth, leaving the surrogate and her family to care for the baby for a few days, which was distressing.There have been more serious incidents that have ended up in court, one in which a surrogate absconded with the baby, another where a surrogate refused to relinquish the child and consent to a parentage order, the legal document that transfers parentage from the birth parents (usually the surrogate and her partner) to the intended parents. In both cases, the courts ruled in favour of the intended parents, after establishing it had been a surrogacy arrangement.The majority of surrogacy arrangements are successful, however. Surrogates at the retreat, such as D’Arcy, say their lives have been enriched by the experience.“It’s been beautiful to watch this modern family created and seeing all the love that’s involved,” she says.Claudianna Blanco is a senior journalist and producer for LiSTNR.Secrets We Keep: By Any Means podcastis out now.Explore more on these topicsSurrogacyFertility problemsPregnancyFamilyAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is simple, teachable and obviousHow do we get better at discussing sexual satisfaction when our genitals are synonymous with the word ‘unmentionables’? It takes no luck, no money and can be learnedAlyx GormanSat 19 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 19.48 EDTShareIn the fifth season of the British cringe comedy series Peep Show about two dysfunctional flatmates, Mark tells Jeremy that, for the first time in his life, he thinks he’s getting sex right. This is thanks to new partner’s very explicit instructions. “That’s cheating,” Jeremy complains. “Anyone can please a woman if she tells you what to do. You’re not allowed to ask. That’s the whole point.”I’ve spent a year trying to figure out why straight women arestatistically last on the listwhen it comes to having pleasurable sex, but that one minute of television pretty much sums it up.I’ve asked 55 women about the hottest moments of their lives and have never heard the same answer twice. When it comes to sex, the things that light us up are so specific and individual, I suspect that if I asked 1,000 women I would get 1,000 different answers.Bigger is always better – and nine other sex myths bustedRead moreWhen I asked women what they think their partner did to enable that one overwhelming moment, however, there was far less variety. Instead, I heard three answers over and over. The first two – great circumstances and great chemistry – happen by chance.But the third answer is astonishingly simple – and obvious. It takes no luck, no money and can be learned. It is: “He just asked.”Everyone responds to physical touch in different ways. Every woman’s fantasy life is different. Given the infinite diversity of taste, the best way to understand the person you are with is by asking them what they want.“Ask your lover” is the only universal sex tip. Yet few men are taught it. Instead, through Hollywood films, pornography and locker-room talk, they learn that they should already know the answer (impossible). As Jeremy says to Mark, they are taught success is about the right guess.Maya*, who is in her mid-50s, once assumed her sex life was over. With her husband of 30 years, it certainly had been. But when she started dating post-divorce, she met a man who changed her mind.With him she went from “a fairly vanilla experience of sex” to a “whole multitude of experiences”. This partner was adventurous and knowledgable, and together they went on a “deeply physical” journey. Through this relationship she learned what she really likes and what her body is capable of.In the early stages of this discovery period, she felt self-conscious about her inexperience and her appearance. She “hadn’t really ever experienced really great sex”, she says. “You don’t know what you don’t know.”But her partner kept asking about her fantasies, her desires and what felt good for her. He would bring her toys to try, to see what she might like. Slowly she opened up.So many women have never had an experience of being touched exactly the way they want. They just don’t know it’s possibleBetty Martin, School of ConsentShe learned that with the right setting and partner, she is multi-orgasmic and can experience orgasms from varied stimulation. Although that partner is out of the picture now, Maya still hums with sexual energy. It’s an energy she has brought into new relationships. Now she knows what she wants and is confident asking her partners what they want too.Like Maya, some women I’ve spoken with did not know how to answer the first time someone asked them what they wanted. Others felt liberated, or relieved. And some women, upon realising that asking is the only trick, grew incandescent with rage. Not at the man who asked but at all the men who did not.Talking may be the only key to a fulfilling sex life – especially in long-term relationships – but for many people, sex is easier done than said. So how does one get good at discussing sex when our genitals are synonymous with the word “unmentionables”?Betty Martin, the founder of theSchool of Consent, suggests starting with a game. Given the paucity of good sex education, and the awkwardness and vulnerability that sex talk can entail, Martin says without deliberate practise “it’s amazing that anybody has a good time at all”.For Martin, learning to ask and answer lies in action, not description. Which is why the Three-Minute Game is her cure-all.The game is played in pairs and consists of two questions. In Martin’s version, these are: “How would you like me to touch you?” and “How would you like to touch me?” Each player takes turns asking and answering, giving feedback along the way, for three minutes at a time. The goal is to make the implicit explicit, teach turn taking and bring clarity to the sometimes murky waters of who does what and for whom.Playing in this way expands your repertoire as you learn to ask for new things, Martin says: “So many women have never had an experience of being touched exactly the way they want. They just don’t know it’s possible.” But in the game, “nothing happens except what you asked for”.At first, the game will feel awkward, she cautions, but, like most good things in life, it gets easier with practice.View image in fullscreen‘Great partnered sex is an act of co-creation, in which all parties can take turns to ask, listen and learn.’Photograph: KatarzynaBialasiewicz/Getty Images/iStockphotoI also sought out men who women had nominated as excellent lovers, which is how I came to talk to Paul.Paul also asks questions and takes a creative approach to discovering his partners’ desires. He asks them to write a list. He says the act of writing something down makes you really, rationally consider what you do and do not want. If you write that you want to be tied up, for instance, you “already have the picture in your mind”. So you have to ask yourself twice before you say, “I’m really writing that”.I’ve been in a sexless marriage for 35 years. What can I do? | Leading questionsRead moreWriting lists is also a game with a name: Yes/No/Maybe. Playinginvolves writing down every sex act and scenario you can imagine (or taking one of the several hundred prefab lists you can easily find online), and sorting them into three columns: Yes for “I think I’d like this and want to try it”; Maybe for “I’d be prepared to try this if the circumstances were right”; and No for “I never want to do this and I don’t want you to do it to me”. While you’re working on your list, your partner gets busy doing the same. Then the two of you get together, compare lists and discover all the ways in which you are compatible.For Paul, a Yes/No/Maybe list is “like a perimeter” around where to explore.A sex psychology researcher, Dr Justin Lehmiller, has found that people who share their fantasies with partners tend to have more fulfilling sex lives – but also that not many people are willing to do so. When he surveyed more than 4,000 Americans on their fantasy lives, he learned that supposedly taboo sexual desires like BDSM and group sex are actually incredibly common. More than half his research participants report having these kinds of fantasies sometimes, which means many couples may have a lot of unexplored common ground.Paul says that during sex there is pressure from a young age to know everything about yourself, what you like and how to get it. This feels like a form of insanity to him. “We don’t say that for food, we don’t say that for travelling, we don’t say that for friends,” he says. Sexual exploration, just like travelling or trying a new hobby, can yield many self-discoveries. This is why he has learned to ask his partners many questions, “and I love to pay attention to their answers”.View image in fullscreenThere’s a reason the Three-Minute Game and Yes/No/Maybe, both of which are sometimes used by sex therapists, require mutual disclosure. Great partnered sex is an act of co-creation, in which all parties can take turns to ask, listen and learn.Before Maya re-entered the dating pool, she always thought of sex as “something that’s quite organic … just this sort of fluid thing” that did not need much discussion.But the partner who changed her approach to sex planned in advance and asked her for feedback. She says he was curious about her body: “He was like, ‘Oh, I wonder what she’ll think of this. How will this feel for her?’” That attention made her feel, “completely sexy and desired”. She learned to trust him, to relax into the situation and be “excited for … what’s next on the menu”.* Name has been changedAlyx Gorman is Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor and the author ofAll Women Want, published by HarperCollins, out nowExplore more on these topicsSexRelationshipsDatingWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Approaching Glen Buck along the A82 before Invergarry, drivers come across a macabre monument dedicated to a series of 17th-century reprisal killings among the clans.The obelisk next to Loch Oich is initially unassuming. However, closer scrutiny reveals it is crowned with a carving of a hand holding a dagger, and seven severed heads.Called the Well of the Seven Heads, the name refers to revenge killings after two members of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, a branch of Clan Donald, were murdered by their cousins.The seven killers were tracked down two years later and themselves killed. They were decapitated, with their heads washed in a well underneath where the obelisk now stands. Their heads were then presented as proof of their deaths. The well can still be seen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Regiments from the area joined the Jacobite army that attempted to restore the House of Stuart to the British throne.The nearby village of Fort Augustus was the scene of a siege during the uprising of 1745, and again a year later, as the area was contested between Jacobite forces and those loyal to the British crown.Luckily, it has been far more peaceful since then. Glen Buck fronts on to the Caledonian canal, which connects the east and west Scottish coasts.It covers low-lying ground, upland terrain and hill grazing to more than 800 metres at Carn Dearg, and includes native woodland as well as buildings including a farmhouse, bothies and a cottage used for holiday lets.The leased Glen Buck Hydro Scheme is an electricity generation facility on the estate that will provide rental income until 2065.The sellers also pointed to “natural capital opportunities” on the estate in the form of peatland restoration potential, and woodland creation supported by “compensatory planting arrangements”.Meanwhile its “sporting appeal” is represented by well-established deer stalking across open country and areas of woodland, the sellers saying this could be further developed.Christie said: “With high hills, ancient woodland, open moorland and good-quality farmland, Glen Buck represents the best of the Highlands and enjoys access to, and a spectacular outlook over, Loch Oich.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandPropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It takes the genre somewhere totally newRhik SamadderSat 19 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTShareTelly assassins have many good qualities, as well as one obvious red flag. We admire their prowess, method, patience and improvisation. We may be jealous of their efficiency, or their extraordinarily brief phone conversations, some of which merely involve listening to the words “Is it done?” or “Call me when it’s done.” The Assassin (Friday 25 July, Prime Video) features a supremely confident title and many of these aspects. It is also funny.The set-up is low-key. Journalist Edward Green visits his estranged mother Julie on a Greek island. Following an attempt on her life, which she settles with brutal efficiency, he discovers she is actually a deactivated hitwoman. Fleeing across Europe, he attempts to learn about her past as they untangle a giant conspiracy threatening their lives. There’s also a mystery around who his father is, so it’s a bit Mamma Mia, too.“Are you really not going to tell me why you’re some kind of perimenopausal James Bond?” Edward boggles, after she dispatches another assailant. ActorFreddie Highmorespends a lot of time in this mode, trailing his mother with anxiety and admiration, like a live-action Rick and Morty.Keeley Haweshas more fun as the reluctantly maternal asset, whether kicking a child’s football into the sea or stabbing someone in the neck. David Dencik, as a shrewd IT specialist, has a Peter Lorre skittishness, whileAlan Dalemakes a villainous boss, though I still think of him as Jim from Neighbours.Acting schmacting. The Assassin opens with an intense, one-shot sequence of a younger Julie carrying out a mission, like something out ofThe Raid. Later fight scenes are more cartoonish, which isn’t to say sanitised: fingers are as disposable as Ikea pencils. There’s a blood specialist credited, so corners are the one thing not being cut. While the physicality of the performers isn’t on a par with the best of this type of action, it is able to wield humour with violence – and that is a very specific set of skills.I don’t usually like killing capped with a zinger. My taste is for the clean lines of Chad Stahelski-choreography, or the scrappy but character-revealing grit of a film like Nobody. Snappy dialogue undermines reality, in the same way as physics-defying choreography. That’s why it’s better to choose one.The Assassin, though, understands visual wit. That intense opening sequence is capped by Julie, still at the kill site, checking a pregnancy test and swearing. In another scene, she uses a cheese fork as a lethal weapon, elsewhere a sauna as an interrogation device. There are shades of last year’s Mr & Mrs Smith, which similarly explored domesticity through extreme conflict. Still, I’d be happy with a little less conversation, a little more action.View image in fullscreenThe getaway … Hawes with Freddie Highmore in The Assassin.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoThe scenes between the Greens play best. Julie has lied about her job his whole life – although as half-truths go, calling herself a “headhunter” is pretty good. Edward repeatedly calls out her casual deception, violence and ease with backstabbing. Accurate but painful, she concedes. “That should be on your business card,” he responds. For her part, she thinks her son is boring and pale. On the run across Athens, France and Libya, he’s unlikely to remain either. But can motherhood be exciting enough for Julie? It’s a provocative question.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four episodes in, we don’t know what Chantaine is. It might be an AI, assassin training program, a password or a white wine. Moreover, many of the actors pronounce the word so it sounds like “Sean Penn”. There are frequent scenes of characters demanding “What is Sean Penn?” which is distracting.These types of shows generally feature a monastic, taciturn, near sociopathic lone wolf, almost invariably male. By centring on a retired, middle-aged mother’s relationship with her son, the show kicks away most of the genre’s crutches, forcing itself to do something new. All in all, its confidence is earned.

Jet2’s holiday advert finds new life as joke memeIn a social media trend, the airline’s joyful advert jingle is being played over cheerless summer holiday footageMabel Banfield-NwachiSat 19 Jul 2025 03.29 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 03.35 EDTShareYou’re the boss of a travel company, it’s early summer and your brand is going viral. Millions of people are watching and sharing social media clips of people on holiday, the soundtrack to which is your company jingle.It sounds like a PR dream, but is it?That’s the question no doubt being pondered at the headquarters of Jet2 – the budget travel firm that has found itself at the centre of a runawayTikTokmeme which shows the less glamorous side of British summer holidays.The trend began as a joke: Jet2’s relentlessly cheerful jingle, Jess Glynne’s Hold My Hand, played over the most cheerless summer holiday footage found on social media.Plane fights, water sports accidents and drunken disasters are all soundtracked by the theme tune as the tagline “Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” is announced the saccharine voiceover.The line has become social media code for travel plans gone wrong, with users pairing the audio with clips of holiday mishaps, minor chaos and anything that falls short of the usual polished posts.In oneTikTok video with more than 1.6m likes, a woman almost drownsin waist-high water and has to be saved by a lifeguard after coming out of a water slide in Tenerife.Anotherpost set to the soundwith 16k likes shows a man laying on a sun lounger by the pool as rain drenches him. More than1.3m other videoshave used the sound and the hashtag #nothingbeatsajet2holidays has more than 25.5k posts.Jet2 has not commented on the trend, but the company has leaned into it on social media, posting its own clip using the same audio and launching a challenge, offering a £1,000 holiday voucher as a prize.0:17Singer Jess Glynne re-enacts Jet2 jingle – videoZoë Lister, the voice actor who utters the now famous line, and singer Jess Glynne have both weighed in. Glynneposted a TikTok video miming the voiceover, andLister has appeared on radiore-enacting the famed slogan.Campaigns like Jet2’s challenge show how brands are trying to meet users where they are, but doing so means learning to speak the platform’s language, said Dr Andreas Schellewald, a researcher in digital culture.“From a brand point of view, this is still tricky terrain and more tactical rather than strategic. This definitely adds great reach for the Jet2 brand – at the same time, brand marketing is not just about awareness but also resonance and reaction, for which I assume brands usually still prefer to have more control over how they are perceived publicly”, he said.The ‘death of creativity’? AI job fears stalk advertising industryRead moreThe advert may have found new life as a meme, but its social media DNA was there from the start, according to Adam Gordon, a social media strategist and co-founder of the social media agency a Friendly Bunch.“The original Jet2 TV ads were deliberately social media led – the hold my hand line was always married to an on-screen POV shot of someone holding someone’s hand – a classic Instagram holiday shot – so the seeds were sown early, and deliberately.“The irony is that the Jet2 ad was born out of the old glossy age of Instagram perfection, but this meme has dragged it into the messy imperfection of the TikTok era. A crystal clear sign of the times in the world of social media,” he added.Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingAir transportTikTokJess GlynnenewsShareReuse this content"

Here are six of our favourite pieces from the past seven daysSat 19 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShare1.How the rightwing sports bro conquered AmericaView image in fullscreen‘A new set of rules’ … the sports-based manosphere.Illustration: Ben Denzer/The Guardian“Today’s sports broadcast world,” wrote Aaron Timms in this fascinating exploration of the sports-based manosphere, “runs according to a new set of rules, in which ‘respectable’ TV and the demimonde of sports podcasts, streaming, and shitposting increasingly intersect: all engagement is good engagement, and the best type of filter is no filter. Whatever faint norms of decorum constrained earlier generations of professional sports talkers have faded completely. There’s a reciprocal flow of testosterone and ideas between these shows, the world of sports, social media and real life. A handful of subjects and themes recur: veneration of the military, glorification of strength and traditional ‘male’ values, celebration of gambling, the denigration of women and anything thought to represent ‘woke’ culture.”Read more2.‘People here are as strong as concrete’: the stunning architecture of war-torn KharkivView image in fullscreenThe Ukraina cinema and concert hall in Kharkiv.Photograph: Pavlo DorohoiA new architectural guidebook was written as a love letter to the Ukrainian city – then Russia started bombing it. How will this home to Tetris-like offices and daring curved cinemas be rebuilt, asked the Guardian’s architecture critic, Oliver Wainwright.If you liked this piece, you might also be interested in Charlotte Higgins’s featureon the ghost museums of Ukraine.Read more3.‘This is going to be a real hatchet job, isn’t it?’ Janet Street-Porter on ‘bitchiness’, backstabbing and her remarkable careerView image in fullscreenJanet Street-Porter outside her old school in Parsons Green, west London.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianOne of the giants of British media, Street-Porter is a regular on Loose Women, a former TV executive, newspaper editor and author – and about to launch a one-woman stage show. Before she dashed out of the restaurant where they met for lunch, she told Simon Hattenstone about love, regrets and her fury with her late mother.Read more4.The Shining: my trip to the G7 horror show with Emmanuel MacronView image in fullscreen‘Hating Macron is a national sport in France,’ wrote Emmanuel Carrère.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPANearly seven years ago, Emmanuel Carrère travelled on the presidential plane with Emmanuel Macron, to profile him for the Guardian. It was at the start of his first term in office, and everything seemed to be going well for him. Now, Carrère wrote on Tuesday, hating Macron is a national sport inFrance. For the long read, Carrère travelled once more with the French president, this time to Kananaskis in Alberta, Canada, for the recent G7 conference most notable forDonald Trump’s abrupt departure: “With [Trump] gone, the tension subsided. We could breathe again but there was no denying that the game had lost some of its appeal. Even though the second day was no more than a half day it dragged on, which was all the crueller given that its star was Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Invited by the G7, he had travelled more than 3,000 miles just to see Trump and beg him once again not to completely abandon Ukraine, and Trump once again humiliated him, this time by leaving just before he arrived.”Read more5.‘A relentless, destructive energy’: inside the trial of Constance Marten and Mark GordonView image in fullscreenConstance Marten and Mark Gordon were found guilty of the manslaughter of their newborn daughter.Composite: Alex Mellon for the Guardian ; PA/Getty ImagesOn Monday, Marten and Gordon were found guilty of the manslaughter of their newborn daughter, who died after they took her to live in a tent in freezing wintry conditions to evade social services. Their story – of a woman born into extraordinary aristocratic privilege and her life with a violent convicted rapist – grimly fascinated Britain. For an extraordinary long read, Sophie Elmhirst spent months attending their retrial and chronicled the chaotic scenes as Gordon chose to defend himself and Marten pushed the patience of the presiding judge to its limits.Read more6.Where Oasis, the Killers and Noddy Holder raised hell: Britpop’s debauched HQ, the Columbia hotelView image in fullscreenColumbia hotel became the place to be in the 1990s.Photograph: Roberto Herrett/AlamyThe Columbia hotel in west London was known for its cheap rooms, its bar’s flexible opening hours, and its look-the-other-way attitude. It became a go-to spot for musicians in the 1980s and, in the 90s, becametheplace to descend on. In this fun history, Daniel Dylan-Wray spoke to those who remember (or perhaps don’t) its hedonistic glory days.Read moreExplore more on these topicsPodcastingSix great readsUkraineArchitectureJanet Street-PorterEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

In an era defined by new takes on old IPs, it’s perhaps surprising it’s taken so long to get around to a reboot of this one, but it’s here now, and it’s a sequel, with Freddie Prinze Jr and Jennifer Love Hewitt reprising their roles.HarvestOut nowThis dark historical drama, which premiered at the Venice film festival, is the English-language debut of the well-regarded Greek director Athina Rachel Tsangari, and is an adaptation of the Jim Crace novel. Set in an ambiguous preindustrial time period, a juicy ensemble cast (Harry Melling, Caleb Landry-Jones, Rosy McEwen) contend with universal themes: the march of progress, harmful traditions and the scapegoating of the outsider.FriendshipOut nowPaul Rudd plays Austin, a charismatic weatherman who moves to a new neighbourhood and is initially open to a new friendship with Tim Robinson’s misfit marketing executive Craig. Those familiar with Robinson’s oeuvre will know that the path of true bromance n’er did run straight, with the escalating awkwardness and discomfort in this cringe comedy about male loneliness.Human Traffic 4K restorationOut nowNice one bruvva!

Dadaist mayhem-maker Monster Chetwynd stars along with Cooking Sections, Dorothy Cross, Katie Paterson and more, all exploring landscape and deep time.Sculpture in the CityVarious public sites, City of London, to spring 2026Ai Weiwei and Jane and Louise Wilson are among the artists unveiling new public sculptures in this annual free event that leads you on an intriguing walk through the City of London’s jumble of ancient and modern buildings. There are also works by Julian Opie, Elisa Artesero and Daniel Silver.Louise Bourgeois, Robert Mapplethorpe, Helen ChadwickModern One, Edinburgh, to 2026Three artists who investigated the body and desire are celebrated by the Artist Rooms collection, whose excellent holdings guarantee insight.

More of a snarl perhaps, or a baring of the gumshield, as Dubois let his arms drop, giving Usyk time to freeze the moment, load up, take aim and unleash a fully extended left hand to the side of the jaw that made Dubois crumple, legs folding under him as his father, Stan,threw in the towel.Usyk defeats Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion once moreRead moreThis was always huge occasion for both fighters. For Dubois it was a chance to do something unprecedented, uniting the the heavyweight belts on British soil in front of 90,000 people. For Usyk it was another opportunity to assert his own greatness, to walk in with three belts and leave with four, and at the same time complete his constant secondary arc of representingUkrainein a time of war.Usyk is now the two-time undisputed heavyweight world champion. Most astonishing of all he seems to find with each of these fights new depths of will, control and finishing venom. Perhaps the best part here was Dubois got to execute his own gameplan, to look sharp, edge a couple of rounds and leave with his reputation, if not enhanced then at least preserved, and to do all this while also being violently outmatched. Facing Usyk at this level must feel like being battered off your feet while being simultaneously triple check-mated, thrashed at Cluedo and losing a game of dominos.At the end, Usyk said: “I want a rest.” He didn’t look like he wanted a rest, or needed one, or even really understands what one is. He mentioned Tyson Fury, Derek Chisora and Anthony Joshua. Do them all in one night, Oleks. In different ways. With a different walkout, and maybe just a single toilet break.This was another night when Riyadh season came to Wembley. Fight nights have a kind of festival vibe here, the pitch lassoed into a series of zones and stages, gangways thronged. The crowd was starry in the plush seats. Here is Jake Paul doing a peace sign. Here is Jason Statham in sunglasses. Closer to the ring it was the familiar royal court of influencers, oddballs, showmen faces, movers, shakers, Mr fix-its, Mr pay-for-its.View image in fullscreenDaniel Dubois looks dazed after being knocked down by Oleksandr Usyk.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesAs the main event approached Wembley had the feeling of a vast, humid, tropical shed, seized with an ever-rising field of event-glamour and title-flash. It felt like a blend of Vegas and a mass celebratory Saturday night out, Sweet Caroline, pints in the air, and all of this mixed with legacy issues, hall-of-famer ascent, the flags of war, the $200m purse, the Saudi project staging.Michael Buffer appeared, gravely tuxedoed, to do his town crier act. Nadya Dorofeeva, a kind of Ukrainian Cheryl Cole, sang a very affecting champions anthem. God Save the King got the full singalong treatment. Wembley looked magnificently alive, light show thrilling, crowd bobbing along to Chase & Status as Dubois emerged to flames and fireworks, dressed in a stark black T-shirt cut to reveal the vast expanse of his neck, swarming up from the foothills of his tiered and slabbed shoulders.Dubois waved a fist and looked focused. But there is always going to be a basic imbalance in the energy fields around these two fighters. Usyk is a one-man cause. He’s a battle standard, a living embodiment of his nation’s defiance of the Russian invasion. No boxer has ever represented his country to this degree, travelling the world draped in the flag while a bloody invasion continues in real time. It is an extraordinary state of being.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian flag on the big screen as the national anthem is played before Oleksandr Usyk’s fight with Daniel Dubois.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWhat does Dubois represent? How does he confront this one-man instrument of war? What is his narrative? Even Tyson Fury managed to concoct a kind of base, a following, the mental-heath activism, the deep male, Iron John, man-of-the-forest vibes. Dubois can’t be the bad guy. He’s a nice guy. He is in effect a one-man project, a sole trader. He represents hard work, clean living and paternal control. He represents the ability to do five thousand press-ups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He doesn’t actually need music and storytelling. He just needs to exist in the middle of all that noise, a cold, still centre, with a beautifully contained sense of menace just in the way he moves. At the weigh in Dubois had flared his neck muscles like a giant salamander. Usyk just stood there, 16lb lighter in his jewellery, all legacy, presence, certainty.‘Thirty-eight is a young guy’: Oleksandr Usyk mocks his critics after victoryRead moreDubois started as promised, taking the centre of the ring, working behind his jab, following it in a little more. It was an even start, and thrillingly intense from both men. Dubois was working hard, making Usyk think. This is always a high-wire act. Usyk is learning you while you come forward, decoding your moves, building his own own set of counter-patterns.Dubois brought challenger work rate and disruptive aggression. But there was also a sense of a fighter expending his energy, of Usyk absorbing it, and moving into ever-more dangerous territory. By round five Dubois had slowed. He was being encircled clockwise, picked off with combinations.Usyk is a small heavyweight by modern super-sized standards (he is the exact same dimensions, height and weight, as Muhammad Ali), but the mistake is to see this as a disadvantage, as opposed to his defining super-strength, bringing with it with it speed, agility, startling power. Here it was the viciousness of his finishing, the sense of a little genuine champion anger, that really stood out.Dubois deserves credit for being willing to fight everyone in front of him. There is a kind of freedom in this. Defeat here will still leave him in the top tier, with other pathways back towards this level. Usyk, meanwhile, remains in his own distinct space, endlessly adaptable, physically undiminished, a man fighting with a kind of light around him.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

History tells us leads can evaporate in just one. Dense rough, links bunkers, the scale of pressure attached to the oldest major. Open calamity is written in folklore. The ghost of Jean van de Velde still lingers. And yet, the bookmakers had Scheffler at only 1-8 to lift the Claret Jug. The fat lady had cleared her throat. Twenty holes. What sporting planet is this?It is possible to run out of adjectives for Scheffler. Unflappable, remarkable, relentless. Nobody will ever match the impact of Tiger Woods on golf but it really is no exaggeration to suggest Scheffler can be similarly dominant. Come Sunday evening on the Causeway Coast, Scheffler will surely be a four-time major winner and three-quarters of the way towards a career grand slam. This is only his 24th major start as a professional. In one of them, his pursuit of glory was undermined by being thrown into a police cell.The Open 2025: third round – as it happenedRead moreImmediately before the pandemic, nobody beyond golf geeks knew who Scottie Scheffler was. Confidence – or certainty – attached to what happens next is backed up by Scheffler winning on the last nine previous occasions when he has held a 54-hole lead. He is in pursuit of a 12th victory since spring of 2024.This advantage is to the tune of four shots. Li Haotong’s 69 means he is the closest to Scheffler’s 14 under par. Li will play in the final group of a major for the first time in an up-and-down career. Scheffler; 68, 64, 67. He has barely broken sweat.View image in fullscreenSecond-placed Li Haotong of China will play in the final group of a major for the first time on Sunday.Photograph: Stuart Kerr/R&A/Getty ImagesSaturday’s hope of a tussle was a brief one, as Matt Fitzpatrick chipped in for an eagle at the 3rd to tie the lead. Scheffler jabbed back by collecting two shots of his own at the 7th but Fitzpatrick’s birdie at the same hole kept matters interesting. Scheffler reached 13 under par by picking up a shot at the 8th.On the back nine there were two ridiculous par saves from Scheffler, at the 11th and 14th after finding deep foliage. The 16th is called Calamity for a reason; Scheffler made a mockery of its reputation courtesy of a birdie two. Fitzpatrick had erred at the short 13th, with his birdie two holes later offset by another mistake on the penultimate hole. The Yorkshireman closed on nine under after his level-par 71.Scheffler has promised not to overthink his position. This seems his finest attribute, a mindset that does not move dependent on leaderboards. “I like being out here competing,” Scheffler said. “This is why we work so hard, to have opportunities like this and I’m excited for the challenge of tomorrow. Winning major championships is not an easy task and I’ve put myself in a good position.“Going into tomorrow I’m going to step up there on the 1st tee and I’m going to be trying to get the ball in the fairway. When I get to the second shot I’m going to be trying to get that ball on the green. There’s not really too much else going on.” Simple, so blissfully simple. Try telling that to poor Matti Schmid, who shot 79.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was the issue with putts, Matt? “They just wouldn’t go in,” he replied with admirable candour. Fitzpatrick added: “Let’s be realistic, he’s five ahead. It’s not easy. But if you get off to a good start, then obviously put a bit of pressure on early doors and hope for the best ... You get three under through six, like some of the guys today, the 7th the par five and all of a sudden you’re kind of right back in it, you would hope. It’s clear what I have to do tomorrow.”The tournament minus Scheffler is a decent one. Rory McIlroy reached eight under par with a dramatic 66, his lowest score of the week, before wonderful crowds. McIlroy’s homecoming has been already been everything he could have imagined. The Belfast boy has Chris Gotterup, Harris English and Tyrrell Hatton for scoring company.On a day when chances were aplenty, the defending champion, Xander Schauffele, posted five under par to move to minus seven. Lee Westwood is out of winning contention at minus five but a back nine of 29 in glorious sunshine proved hugely enjoyable for the veteran. Westwood credited his wife and caddie, Helen, with triggering the run by providing the former world No 1 with a tuna sandwich on the 10th tee.Bob MacIntyre, who is now eight shots adrift, summed up the hopelessness of it all for mere mortals. At the start of 2025, MacIntyre asked his caddie to assess how far behind the world’s top-ranked player he was in various statistics. Said bag man gave up the process after swiftly realising MacIntyre, then 16th in the rankings, was closer in all departments to No 2 than No 2 was to No 1. It is not the sea air dominating in Portrush. Instead, an air of inevitability.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a blatant, cynical foul and frankly bizarre behaviour from the 33-year-old Hendrich, one of the most experienced players on the pitch. Grace Geyoro duly stepped up and did what just under half the takers have been able to do in this tournament and converted her penalty. Berger got a hand to Geyoro’s spot-kick but could not keep it out and the midfielder became France’s all-time top scorer at Women’s European Championships.For the remainder of the first half, Germany defied their numerical disadvantage with a brave performance of counterattacking football and they equalised when Sjoeke Nüsken darted to the near post unmarked to meet Klara Bühl’s corner and loop an excellent header into the far corner. The game ended 1-1 after extra time and the Germany coach, Christian Wück, was immensely proud of his side’s resilience with 10 players, saying: “I can say for certain that tonight was the best and hardest-fought performance I’ve seen from the team since I’ve known them – against an opponent who demanded everything from us. That was incredible.”View image in fullscreenSjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser after her side had already been reduced to 10 players.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesFrance thought they had scored an outstanding team goal before half-time, when Delphine Cascarino’s instinctive back-heel into the net rounded off a flowing move, but she had been in an offside position. Another offside decision, confirmed by the VAR, also ruled out a French “goal” early in the second half, when Geyoro tucked in on the rebound from Berger’s close-range save from Marie-Antoinette Katoto; Maëlle Lakrar was offside and deemed to have interfered with play, much to the frustration of France and Geyoro, who had run to celebrate with her teammates next to the substitutes’ bench.Sjoeke NüskenGermany were doing an excellent job of stifling their opponents with a valiant defensive display and then – suddenly – at the other end, they were awarded a penalty when Selma Bacha clumsily fouled the superb Jule Brand. Cue German joy in the stands, but it was short-lived as Pauline Peyraud-Magnin saved Nüsken’s penalty, which had been fired slightly to the left of centre, and a relatively kind height for the keeper.Berger produced the save of the tournament so far in the first 15 extra minutes, wowing everybody in the stadium asshe somehow leaped backwardsto make a one-handed save to prevent an own goal from her teammate Janina Minge, with the keeper magnificently managing to claw the ball off the line when it had been behind her body. She was superb again in the shootout, making two saves – including the decisive one from Alice Sombath’s sudden-death strike – to complete a stunning result. On the way she also scored a spot-kick of her own. Modestly, she said afterwards: “All the credit should go to the team, not me. Everybody here should talk about the performance of the team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The France head coach, Laurent Bonadei, denied that his team had a psychological problem, saying: “My team has progressed very much and gave us a lot of hope. Rome was not built in one day. We will continue to work really hard so that one day this team will get a trophy.“Germany deserves their qualification because they defended very well. Usually we manage to create more chances.

The team car was in the middle of the road, about 200 metres from the top of the ascent, when it struck the spectator, who was cheering the riders on.Tour de France 2025: Arensman wins blockbuster stage 14 in Pyrenees – as it happenedRead moreThe driver, the sports director, Oliver Cookson, was handed a 5,000 Swiss franc (£4,650) fine and a yellow card for “dangerous behaviour that endangered spectators”. A second yellow card triggers exclusion from the race. Local police have been investigating the accident.In a statement, Ineos Grenadiers said: “Our thoughts and sincere apologies go out to the fan who was accidentally and regretfully hit by one of our race cars while supporting the riders during today’s stage. Like all teams we take great care to maintain a safe race environment for everyone – including the passionate fans who make our sport so special.”On a murky day in the Pyrenees,Tadej Pogacarfinally allowed others their chance. Already the winner of four stages, the Slovenian controlled some tentative moves by Jonas Vingegaard in the closing kilometres, before outsprinting the Dane in the final 150 metres to increase his overall lead to 4min 13sec.Pogacar said the wet and misty conditions had affected his enthusiasm for the stage. “We were riding strongly, but also thinking to be safe. I was quite scared descending in white fog, you don’t even see the road,” the Slovenian said. “When you are riding super-hard for two and a half hours already and you come to top of the Tourmalet and you think: ‘Ah, it’s a descent, it’s easy,’ but then [there is] this really thick fog on the top – mist, bit of rain, slippery road – you still need to focus so much on the downhill.“It’s so different to when it’s dry and sunny. In this fog today, you could see maybe 20 metres ahead of you. We went really conservatively on the downhill and we managed in the end without any stupid mistakes.”View image in fullscreenIneos Grenadiers’ Thymen Arensman crosses the finish line to win stage 14.Photograph: Jasper Jacobs/Belga Mag/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Oscar Onley, who finished sixth on the stage, has moved into the top four as the Tour ends its second week. The Scot benefited from the withdrawal of Remco Evenepoel, who started the day third but quit the Tour at the base of the Col du Tourmalet.Evenepoel, clearly at the end of his rope afterFriday’s time trialto Peyragudes, was drifting behind well before the peloton arrived at the foot of the Tourmalet, but as the 19km climb began, it became apparent the Belgian’s race was run.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He didn’t have the legs to suffer. I think it’s wise not to continue. He still has some goals this year, and maybe if he’d continued in the condition he had, maybe the rest of the season would be lost.“Remco was very disappointed he had to leave the Tour. He is not himself. Already, this was the third day in a row that he didn’t feel great. You have to be very careful not to go over the limit and lose months instead of days.”With almost 5,000m of climbing packed into 125km of racing, it was one of the most brutal stages in recent Tours, but Pogacar was happy to let an earlier breakaway, which included Arensman, move clear, with Lenny Martinez, chasing yet more points in the King of the Mountains classification, also in the move. Crucially, the French rider was first over the mammoth and mist-shrouded Tourmalet and harvested enough points to move into the polka dot jersey lead, as the Tour exited the Pyrenees.Sunday’s stage to Carcassonne offers the sprinters a further opportunity for success, before the second rest day and the final week’s assault on the Alps.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingTeam IneosnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s only me and the girl working the bar, and she doesn’t have a strong opinion on whether or not Tom Curry should be playing No 7. “Which paper did you say you were with, the Ballymena Guardian?” No, it’s the other Guardian, I say. “Oh, the Antrim one.”Just about the time I was beginning to think that all of Ballymena’s thousand-or-so members must have been among the tens of thousands going the other way into Portrush for the Open, they began to trickle in, one, two, three, four dozen, and more.Australia 19-27 British & Irish Lions: first Test player ratingsRead moreSoon enough everyone’s comparing the vintages of their Lions jerseys. There’s one from ’01, another from ’05, a few from 2013, and a couple of little kids, more interested in playing their own game than following the one on the TV, have the 2025 edition.They’re too young to understand anything much about the match except that it matters to the adults. The Lions is an idea that gets passed on from one generation to the next, follow it back long enough and you’ll end up at to two men who were born and bred in this very club, Willie John McBride and Syd Millar, who did as much as anyone to make the team into what they are today.Millar, the son of a butcher, and McBride, the son of a farmer, were both Ballymena men. There’s a wood-panelled room upstairs in the clubhouse which is named after them. It’s filled with their memorabilia. They played, coached, managed, and chaired nine Lions tours between them, and led the legendary 1974 tour, when Millar was coach and McBride captain of the team that went unbeaten in South Africa.View image in fullscreenThe late Syd Millar at the end of his tenure as president of the International Rugby Board shows off the Webb Ellis Cup at Ballymena RFC in 2007.Photograph: Paul Faith/PAThere’s a huge picture of McBride in the moment after the third Test all along one wall, signed by every one of his squad. When Scott Quinnell visited here four years ago, he broke down in tears standing in front of it. “Attitude is the first thing a Lions team needs to have,” Millar said. “If the attitude is right, the other things fall into place.”Downstairs, the Lions’ attitude seems to be shaping up just fine. They are 10-0 up already, and the sting has already gone from the game. Truth is, it doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of jeopardy on this tour. Most people in the bar seem worried for Australia, who are in the unfamiliar position of being seen as easy-beats. “I’d hoped the Wallabies would give them more of a game than this,” says the man on the next barstool along. Turns out he has a Lions jersey of his own at home, 1989 vintage, although he’s not wearing it. “But then,” he says, “I was only a midweek player.”Stevie, as they all call Steve Smith, was the reserve hooker for Finlay Calder’s Lions team, who came back from 1-0 down to beat Australia. “I played against his da’,” he says, watching the young Tom Lynagh on TV. Smith has the look of a man who’s done some hard living. Maybe his busted knuckles are still recovering from the time he knocked out four of Sean Fitzpatrick’s teeth.He still seems a little in awe of McBride. “They were big shoes to fill.” But he loves Millar, who gave him a break by picking him for the Barbarians when he had been banned from playing for Ulster because of his misadventures on tour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He even came back to serve as the club rep after he finished his four-year stint as the chair of the International Rugby Board (now World Rugby). They say he used to give the union hell in the provincial committee meetings. When the French decided to award him theLegion d’honneur, they asked if he would fly out to Paris for the ceremony. No, Millar, told them, but you’re welcome to come here, and we can do it upstairs in the Ballymena clubhouse.In Millar’s day Ballymena were the best club in Ulster, and Ulster were the best team in Ireland. Smith was part of the Ulster team that beat the Wallabies during their famous grand slam tour in 1984, 15-12 at Ravenhill, “a better Australian side than this one”, I say, and he doesn’t disagree. When Ulster won the Heineken Cup in 1998-99 they had 15 Ballymena players in the squad. No wonder the club won the all-Ireland title a few years later.It’s different now. This is the first time in 20 years there’s not an Ulsterman on tour with the Lions, but no one’s complaining, Ulster are on their uppers, three million in debt and third-bottom in the URC. At Ballymena, too, there are members who ask why the club aren’t winning like they used to.But back then McBride, Millar, Smith, Trevor Ringland and all the rest of the international players used to turn out for the club at every opportunity. These days their best young players get funnelled into the professional system, and they don’t see them again till they’re spat out the other end. They even took down a photograph of one of their more recent international players because he had never actually turned out for them, only been registered to the club by the governing body.So Ballymena’s changing. They’ve become a community hub, and a participation club, with five adult sides, and a full slate in age groups, and a side for players with learning disabilities. “The Lions built this club,” Smith tells me. “It put us on the map.” But it’s true, I say back to him, that once upon a time a couple of men from this club built the Lions, too.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Australia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ball is flying. A few yards away, near the penalty spot, Clara Mateo of France already has her arms raised in celebration. A heroic German defensive rearguard is about to end in a misdirected defensive header, a looping own goal and a heartbreaking defeat. But a 34-year-old double cancer survivor, largely written off by her own country’s media before this quarter-final, has other ideas.The mechanics of the save itself are easy enough to explain. Berger is about five yards out of her goal, and so has to back-pedal furiously while also keeping her eye on the flight. At the last moment, it looks like the ball is about to beat her. Which is the point at which Berger flings herself backwards and upwards, finding every last gram of strength, straining every last muscle, the sort of moment you spend a lifetime training for. She claws it away with her fingers. Falls heavily on her shoulders. Accepts the congratulations of her teammates, who look like they have just seen a biblical miracle.And, you know, perhaps they had. Was this the moment Germany wrote their destiny? It certainly didn’t feel that way at the time. Twenty minutes still remained. France still had all the possession and an extra player. But maybe it was the moment when Germany’s mission sharpened to the finest of points, when they determined above all that a save of such cosmic brilliance must not be for nothing.View image in fullscreenAnn-Katrin Berger launches herself backwards to claw away a deflected effort.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesIt had been an epic night, an excruciating night, and for the depleted, exhausted Germany a night of sheer refusal. Forced to play for almost two hours (including added time) with 10 players after the early dismissal of Kathrin Hendrich, boasting a passing accuracy of just 51%, they withstood one of the deadliest attacks in the tournament with their bodies and every last breath in them.By this point the game had long since ceased to take any recognisable form or shape: just two tired teams finding increasingly creative ways to collide with each other. At one point in extra time the sensational Jule Brand went on a dribble past halfway and, seeing three blue shirts congregating on her, basically changed her mind, let the ball go and decided to get back into position.As for France, it was a night for reverting to type. For confirming every pre-existing stereotype of them. For demonstrating why this team of such incredible individual talent have never been able to fulfil that talent as a collective. Forced to break down a team with no intention of giving them the space in behind they love to exploit, they were utterly devoid of ideas, of creativity, of passing guile, of any real strategy beyond giving it to the wingers and seeing if the next stepover might work any better than the last.Ann-Katrin BergerPerhaps you could argue that Hendrich’s red card for pulling the hair of Griedge Mbock actually simplified Germany’s task. Even so, it would have taken a brave seer to predict anything but a French victory at that point, especially after an injury to Sarai Linder at right-back. But her replacement, Sophia Kleinherne, was immense, as were the two big pre-match selections by Christian Wück: Giovanna Hoffmann up front and Franziska Kett at left-back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But of course these were not the key milestones. Try Rebecca Knaak’s 13 clearances, Janina Minge’s 11, the 16 tackles, Sjoeke Nüsken’s first tournament goal. And of course there were nine saves from the hands of Berger, a goalkeeper who could have been cherry-picked for this assignment, one relying less on silky ball-work than on sheer, gravelly defiance.Berger had come in for considerable criticism after some misplaced passes in the4-1 defeat by Sweden. And of course her old-school style sometimes feels at odds with the more progressive, possession-based kind of football the modern Germany want to play. But give her a goal and she will protect it with her life. She’s beaten thyroid cancer twice. She can probably deal with your inswinging cross.View image in fullscreenAnn-Katrin Berger scores Germany’s fourth penalty in the shootout pass Pauline Peyraud-Magnin of France.Photograph: Álex Caparrós/Uefa/Getty ImagesAs the minutes leaked away, as France had a goal disallowed, as Germany missed their own penalty, the German fans behind Berger’s goal slowly began to warm to their task. Increasingly the French players were bearing forlorn expressions, negative body language, crushed by the burden of having to win this match several times over simply to win it once.Or perhaps not at all. Because after two hours and 13 penalties, Berger was flying again. Amel Majri had been the first to fail, then Berger had scored a penalty of her own, and now Alice Sombath had put her kick at a pleasant height, and once more Berger was the commander of angles and time. She palmed the ball away. Rose to her knees. And in the moments before her victorious teammates mobbed her, Berger was simply kneeling there: imploring us to adore her, a woman who through everything had never stopped believing in herself.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Germany women's football teamFrance women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

I always had faith.”Besides Morgan, Sarina Wiegman was able to bring on Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead, Grace Clinton, Niamh Charles and Michelle Agyemang, who scored England’s equaliser. Their efforts helped book a last-four spot against Italy on Tuesday, after a penalty shootout.Morgan added: “The depth we have in the squad is such an incredible thing for us to be able to fall back on through this tournament. That’s something we’re going to continue to rely on. When all of us sat down on the bench for the second half it was just: ‘Be ready to come on and change the game’ – and all of us were. We’ve just got such amazing character, grit and determination within the group that we’re never beaten.”Morgan’s own substitute appearance was her major tournament debut, and she was thrilled that her mother was there to witness it. “It was really, really special,” the 24-year-old said. “Apparently my mum was sobbing when I came on, bless her. It was just really nice to get that opportunity. I have been working hard throughout the tournament to stay prepared if I was called on.”Of the 19-year-old Agyemang, who scored her second international goal on only her third cap, Morgan said: “I’m so proud of the impact she’s been able to make. That’s twice now she’s stepped up in pressure situations. She’s someone that we know we can turn to in stressful moments to be a presence, holding the ball up and linking play, making runs in behind.“She’s just so chilled and positive all the time, and ready to take her opportunity. She’s such a hard worker in training and so you know that in those moments she’s absolutely ready to come on and make an impact, which is exactly what she did, just getting in great positions around the box. She’s proven all the times that she’s come on that she’s ready to go and make an impact when we need it.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan and fellow substitute Chloe Kelly (right) take off after England’s shootout win.Photograph: Ennio Leanza/APEngland were also grateful to two decisive crosses from the winger Kelly. “She’s an incredible player,” said Morgan. “She’s been training amazingly in the last few days, scoring a lot of goals, so she was high on confidence coming into that game. She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her to pull a performance out of the bag. When I saw her cut in, I just knew she was going to land it on someone’s head.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now another English player’s stoic display against Sweden – this time with a bloodied nose – will be etched into the annals after Hannah Hampton’s heroics during the Lionesses’remarkable shootout victoryover Sweden in Zurich.Hampton, with an absorbent shoved up her right nostril after an extra-time collision in the penalty area caused a nosebleed, found the composure, focus and agility to save two Sweden penalties to help Sarina Wiegman’s team win 3-2 in the shootout and book Tuesday’s semi-final meeting with Italy after an unlikely comeback to draw 2-2 after extra time.It was a coming-of-age performance for the 24-year-old from Birmingham, who also produced two pivotal saves when England had been 2-0 down, and surely banished any lingering uncertainty about her readiness to be England’s first-choice goalkeeper. Hampton was confirmed by Wiegman as England’s No 1 after Mary Earpsretired from international footballin May. It had been the direction of travel but those were big gloves to fill. Hampton’s player-of-the-match performance in the quarter-final on her 20th senior international appearance means England fans have a new keeper to idolise.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

She underwent multiple operations as a youngster to try to correct her vision but still has depth-perception issues. Hampton, though, has defied the medical odds to thrive for club and country, winning a domestic treble of trophies with Chelsea this year. Her performance against Sweden, nosebleed and all, was her biggest moment yet with England.“As a few of the girls have said, I’m better with one nostril so maybe I’ll have it [a nosebleed] again in the next game to be honest,” Hampton joked after the match. “The girls have got behind me a lot. They know how tough it’s been for me while being in and around the England environment. To be able to go out and help them tonight, for the whole team to put on a performance like we did, it’s a lovely moment.“All the girls were ecstatic. They’ve seen all the hard work that I’ve put in and how difficult it’s been and how they’ve helped me get to the point that I am now and being happy to be wearing an England shirt again. I just want to do whatever I can for the team to get that win. I don’t care if I have one touch in a game or if I have multiple … We just didn’t want to go home.”Hampton appeared to be alluding to a period in the autumn of 2022 was she wasdropped from the England team, with Wiegman saying at the time “she has some personal issues that she has to solve so for her, at this moment, it’s better for her to stay at her club”. On Thursday night, Wiegmanwas full of praisefor Hampton and said there had never been doubts within the Lionesses camp over whether Hampton could deliver. The England forward Beth Mead said: “Sometimes you need your goalkeeper to step up and Hannah did that today. Hannah made some amazing saves.”View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton joked that she was ‘better with one nostril’ after an extra-time collision.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesIt was the first Women’s European Championship fixture to be decided by penalty kicks since 2017, no shootouts having been required when England hosted the tournament in 2022, and the nerve-shredding drama in Zurich appeared to be trying to make up for that long wait. Sweden twice missed kicks to win the contest and only five of the 14 spot-kicks were successfully converted. The player who scored England’s crucial seventh penalty was the right-back Lucy Bronze, who also offered up some imagery that will define how the night will be remembered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Barcelona player then ripped off her bandages moments before stepping up to fire her penalty emphatically down the middle of the goal and put England on the verge of victory. When Sweden’s Smilla Holmberg then blazed over the Lionesses were through.Bronze, who had taken the captain’s armband after Leah Williamson was substituted with an ankle injury but had worn it on her wrist rather than in the usual place above the elbow, said of her strapping: “I thought: ‘I just need to get through to make sure I can keep going.’ But then I thought: ‘It’s going to hinder me in a penalty.’ I didn’t expect it to go to the sixth penalty, so I didn’t take it off and then it was my penalty and I thought: ‘I need to take this off, I’m going to smack it.’”The late-night drama delayed the News at Ten on BBC One and millions of television viewers will tune in again on Tuesday – on ITV – when England meet one of the tournament’s dark horses in Geneva. It will be the Lionesses’ sixth consecutive appearance in a major tournament semi-final, a sequence that began in 2015. Their impressive runs in the big events continue and new heroines are emerging all the time.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamChelsea WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What if famous and attractive Tennis Player X were having a fling with famous and attractive Tennis Player Y? And what ifArsenalactually signed a centre-forward?There hasn’t yet been time for reality to intervene. It’s like the day after the World Cup draw when everything exists in a realm of pure perfection and you can imagine theplatonic idealof each country facing off, unsullied by form, injury or disputes over bonuses.Club A needs a left-winger who can cut in on to his right foot, contributing six-to-eight goals a season and opening space for the overlapping full-back. Player B is a left-winger who can cut infield, and therefore this must work, earning Club A imaginary points to contribute towards that absurd modern notion: winning the window.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreThe truth is that football teams are almost infinitely complex organisms, minute imbalances or frictions potentially having enormous consequences elsewhere. And players are human. Sometimes they struggle to deal with change: new teammates, a new manager, a new environment. No transfer is ever without at least some risk; nothing is ever guaranteed.Still, the early moves in the market are revealing, if not necessarily for what they may mean for how the title contenders may play next season, then at least for what they say about the state of those clubs and their perceived priorities.Getting your transfer business done early is one of the supposed markers of a decisive side that knows its own mind, which is good news for the four teams likely to be Premier League contenders – and rather less good news for Manchester United, who have moved to signMatheus CunhaandBryan Mbeumo, while struggling to offload any of the half dozen players who are surplus to requirements.The best time to build, the ancient wisdom has it, is from a position of strength, and Liverpool have done that, bringing in a pair of full-backsand Florian Wirtzat a total cost of around £165m. With Trent Alexander-Arnold gone and Andy Robertson now 31, the acquisitions of Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez are straightforward enough replacements and suggest the policy of attacking full-backs will remain.View image in fullscreenCould the arrival of Florian Wirtz (left) mean a change in position for Dominik Szoboszlai (centre) at Liverpool?Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesWirtz is a more complicated case, in part because of his versatility. He could operate as a false 9, or on either flank, but the likelihood is he will be used as a central attacking midfielder as part of a shift to more of a 4-2-3-1 shape than the hybrid 4-3-3/4-2-3-1Liverpooltended to use last season. That would mean either Dominik Szoboszlai plays less or that he is used deeper at times to add creativity against opponents who sit in a low block.Given Arne Slot’s lack of faith in Darwin Núñez, a move for a centre-forward was always likely. Exactly what game of bluff and counter-bluff – if any – wasbeing played around Alexander Isakremains unclear butHugo Ekitike is now the prime target, a mobile goalscorer who should improve Liverpool’s options playing in transition even if concerns remain about his effectiveness when he doesn’t have space to run into.While there has beeninterest in Luis Díaz from Bayern, Liverpool’s position on profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) is healthy enough that there is no need to sell the Colombian. Perming three or four from Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Harvey Elliott, Wirtz, Díaz and Isak or Ekitike marks a significant upgrade on last season.For Arsenal, after becoming the fifth club to finish as runners-up three years running, there is a sense of urgency. If not now, then when? How many more chances will this side have before the rump needs refreshing? That perhaps explains their targets.Christian Nørgaardis not especially eye-catching but adds useful defensive depth.Martín Zubimendishould have the tactical intelligence to protect the back four and so release Declan Rice. There will be those who doubt whetherNoni Madueke is worth £48.5m, but a winger who can play on either flank makes sense to ease the burden on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Benjamin Sesko had been the long-term target before Arsenal turned their attention to the older andslightly cheaper Viktor Gyökeres. Given Arsenal almost certainly do need a high-class centre-forward, saving £10m-£15m for a player five years older about whom doubts remain about his capacity to get shots away in tight spaces seems a questionable economy.Manchester City’s transition continues apace, with the arrival ofRayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders andRayan Aït-Nourito go with the four players they signed in January. All played some role in the Club World Cup. City’s4-3 defeat by Al-Hilalin the last 16 does not augur well, but it’s far from clear yet how reliable a guide the tournament will prove.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi is Arsenal’s marquee arrival in midfield.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesAfter all, Chelsea, fourth in the Premier League, won the thing by hammering Paris Saint-Germain, who beat three English sides on their way to the Champions League last season. Have Enzo Maresca’s side really improved so much?João Pedrolooks an immediate upgrade on Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward whileJamie Gittensshould be a useful addition on the left.Although a functioning team does seem belatedly to have emerged from the churn, it’s the sheer traffic through Stamford Bridge that is most eye-catching, less the careful accumulation of ingredients than a crazed trolley dash, with a lot of wastage as Maresca assembled his dish.And that perhaps is the underlying sadness in any discussion of transfers, the way that the game is instinctively viewed through a mercantile lens. It’s never about developing a player or tweaking a system, always about buying the next glossy off-the-shelf solution.Will any of it work? Who knows? But the feeling is all a little like 2016 after Leicester won the league and Southampton and West Ham finished in the top seven, when the elite went on a spree to reaffirm their status.

The Newcastle manager claimed the decision was taken to manage the striker’s minutes in pre-season, but also as a consequence of recent transfer speculation.Liverpool’s long-held interest in the Sweden international was confirmed this week with the Premier League champions being prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make him their new No 9.Marcus Rashford in talks with Barcelona after Manchester United agree loanRead moreLiverpool have since turned their attentions to Eintracht Frankfurt forward andNewcastle target Hugo Ekitikeafter being informed Isak is not for sale. The champions remain in talks over a fee for Ekitike, who is understood to have a €100m (£87m) release clause in his Eintracht contract, with a deal expected to be completed next week. Germany’s Sky Sport reported on Saturday night that a second written bid had been submitted.Howe admitted Newcastle are “desperate” to keep Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, but added he could not give “100% clarity” on any player’s future.The Newcastle manager said of the striker’s absence in Glasgow: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”Howe, who also omitted Joelinton against the Scottish champions, added: “It’s difficult for me to give 100% clarity on any player. Alex is happy at Newcastle, he loves the players, the staff, the team. I’m confident he’ll be here at the start of the season. Yes, I’ve had discussions with him but that’s not abnormal. I respect a player’s career and how short it is. Alex has been really good, he’s trained really well and I realise there’ll be noise around him.”Liverpool’s decision to go for Ekitike, who made it clear he favoured a move to Anfield over St James’ Park before Newcastle pulled out of the race for the striker, represents another frustration in what has been a problematic transfer window for Howe.Newcastle have also missed out on João Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo and Liam Delap while their long-running pursuit of Burnley’s £40m-rated goalkeeper James Trafford is now in doubt with Manchester City linked with their former player.Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing much of Newcastle’s recruitment this summer, with Paul Mitchell having left as sporting director and Darren Eales due to depart on health grounds. They have completed only one signing so far, the £55m purchase of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a slightly odd piece of theatre involving Heather Knight, Lauren Filer and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, which culminates in Wyatt-Hodge attempting to run out Filer with a samosa.England v India: second women’s cricket one-day international – as it happenedRead moreNone of the above were actually on show at Lord’s on Saturday – Knight is injured, Wyatt-Hodge is not in the ODI squad, and Filer was dropped for this fixture in favour of Em Arlott – but the key players on this stage were actually a different pair. Because, of course, the “Whack It Like Wyatt-Hodge” trailer was gently poking fun at the storm which erupted in September 2022, when Deepti Sharmacontroversially ran outCharlie Dean at the non-striker’s end.On Saturday, therefore, there was inevitably a certain frisson when Deepti came to the crease with India 72 for five, and quickly found herself facing Dean. A crowd that had patiently sat through the four-hour rain delay, which meant the match was reduced to 29 overs a side, were suddenly on the edge of their seats.Deepti narrowly survived the first ball of Dean’s second spell, which turned sharply and beat her bat. But she then saw off her remaining 11 balls without theatrics – eventually progressing to an unbeaten 30 as she tried to wrestle back some advantage for India, who struggled to 143 for eight on a pitch made stodgy by the rain.View image in fullscreenCharlie Dean boots the ball away after taking a catch off Smriti Mandhana.Photograph: Steven Paston/PADean had to be content with holding on to a catch at extra cover to see off Smriti Mandhana for 42, after earlier taking the return catch proffered up by Jemimah Rodrigues. Sophie Ecclestone, meanwhile, took three for 27, including rattling the stumps of Harmanpreet Kaur after Sophia Dunkley had twice let off the India captain at cover.Perhaps this match might pass without controversy, despite the recent tensions between these sides (Pratika Rawal was fined 10% of her match fee this week after barging Ecclestone and Filer duringthe first ODIat Southampton)? No: it was simply biding its time. The real drama came in the second act, in the fifth over of England’s run chase, when Tammy Beaumont appeared to deliberately kick the ball out of the way of the wicketkeeper, Richa Ghosh. Ghosh appealed for Beaumont to be given out obstructing the field, the umpires referred it upstairs, but Jacqueline Williams adjudged that Beaumont had merely been making her way back to her crease after deciding against taking a single.“Richa [Ghosh] and Jemi [Rodrigues] definitely felt that maybe she kicked it, but the umpires referred it and it was not out,” Mandhana said. As for the fact that the bowler who sent down the ball in question happened to be Deepti Sharma? “We cracked a joke about Lord’s and Deepti.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was despite an attempt at time-wasting by India, who referred a not-out caught-behind decision against Dunkley, despite Ghosh being overheard on the stump microphone telling Harmanpreet that Dunkley had not made contact with the ball. “We tried not to get drawn into it,” Jones said.The series decider takes place at Durham on Tuesday: don’t be surprised if there is more drama still to come.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamIndia women's cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Call the expert, of course. When she concluded a remarkable first full season as a runner withOlympic 1500m bronze in Parislast summer, Georgia Hunter Bell’s path appeared to be set. Why change a successful formula?But change she has, and victory over 800m in London on Saturday provided a second win in her past two Diamond League races over the distance, having won in Stockholm last month.This is where the problem has arisen for September’s world championships in Tokyo. Should she stick with the event in which she won her Olympic medal, should she target the shorter race over two laps or should she attempt an audacious double that has increasingly fallen out of fashion over recent years?View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell celebrates after winning the women’s 800m in her second-fastest time ever.Photograph: S Bardens/British Athletics/Getty ImagesHelpfully, she has the perfect sounding board in her contacts book: “I might actually reach out to Kelly Holmes and see what she thinks.”Holmes, who memorablywon Olympic 800m and 1500m goldin 2004, initially contacted Hunter Bell after the Paris Games last summer. The relationship has since developed into something akin to a mentor and a mentee. So, after triumphing over a strong field at the London Stadium in 1min 56.74sec – the second-fastest time of her life – Hunter Bell is keen to hear what Holmes thinks of it all.World Athletics Championships: London’s 2029 bid gets Starmer backingRead more“Doing the double [at the world championships] is an option because the schedule’s actually quite generous for it,” she said. “There’s proper days off; one event completes before the second starts. But I just think it’s really hard and you might stuff your chances at both. So I don’t know. A lot of people can have their opinion but there’s very few that have actually done it. I’d like to see what Kelly has to say about it.”There is an additional factor. Shorn of her training partner, and Olympic champion, Keely Hodgkinson – who is expected to return from a hamstring injury in the coming weeks – 800m times have somewhat stagnated. By contrast, increasing numbers of 1500m women continue to break new ground.“You’ve got to look strategically at the events,” said Hunter Bell. “The 1500m has got even faster than last year. I didn’t think that was possible, but it has again. Whereas the 800m, at the moment, is not as fast as it was last year. So if you’re trying to get a medal, what is actually the best thing to do?”Elsewhere, the anticipated battle of the British runners failed to materialise in the men’s 1500m as the young Kenyan upstart Phanuel Koech upset the 60,000-strong sellout crowd by outkicking reigning world champion Josh Kerr in the home straight to claim victory.View image in fullscreenPhanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockKoech, 18, had never run a 1500m race before last month, but now owns three of the six fastest times in the world this year after triumphing in a meeting record of 3:28.82. Despite tracking him for most of the race, Kerr was unable to keep pace in the home straight, finishing second in 3:29.37. Former world champion Jake Wightman came fourth, while George Mills fell with 200m remaining.Ever bullish, Kerr remains confident that the world title he claimed from Wightman will remain in Britain. “Yeah, 100%,” he said. “The title lives here and it will continue to live here for the next year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only rational long-term strategy is to rejoin the EU, but our politics is far removed from thatSat 19 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 06.46 EDTShareLike a chronic ailment, strategic incoherence gnaws at everything Britain does in the world. Keir Starmer’s real achievement in resetting relations with mainlandEurope– witness the recent visits of the French president Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor Friedrich Merz – does not obscure, and in a way even highlights, this deeper confusion.After 1945, Winston Churchill envisioned Britain’s global role at the intersection of three circles: the British Commonwealth and (then still) empire; the Europe whose postwar recovery and unification he strongly supported; and the United States. As Commonwealth countries have formed stronger ties elsewhere, the first circle is no longer of strategic significance. Having committed itself in the 1970s to the most developed political and economic form of the second circle, now theEuropean Union, Britain has withdrawn from it. With the revolutionary nationalism of President Donald Trump, the third circle is also fading fast. So here’s an 80-year countdown of Britain’s strategic circles: three … two … one, going on none.Instead of being at the intersection of three circles, Britain finds itself caught between three elephants. “There are three elephants in the room and we just have to be careful we don’t get trampled” is howone British official describedto the Financial Times Starmer’s attempt to navigate between the global economic powers of the US, EU and China.Just like Tony Blair a quarter-century ago, this government has talked of Britain being a “bridge” between Europe and the US. But what kind of a bridge can it be today, when the UK is outside the EU and Trump is putting in question the whole transatlantic relationship, with a special animus towards the EU?There was only ever one way to take Brexit to its logical conclusion, and that was to become an offshore Greater Switzerland, a north European Singapore. To seek profit wherever you could find it, whatever those states were doing to their neighbours or their own citizens; to be a nation with the morals of a hedge fund. Ironically enough, the European country that comes closest to this cynical “multialigning” is Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, a full member state of the EU. But this was never a serious option even for the majority of Brexiters, who had five or six different (and generally vague) visions of what a post-Brexit Britain should be. For most Britons, it would be completely incompatible with our sense of what Britain should do and be in the world.With Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Britain’s Churchillian instincts kicked in again and have brought us to a place where we are working shoulder to shoulder with countries such as France, Germany and Poland for the defence of Ukraine and Europe as a whole.Merz and Starmer have just signed a German-British treatythat gives a framework for enhanced cooperation in many areas. Faced with uncertainty about Trump’s commitment to nuclear deterrence on Nato’s eastern flank, Macron’s state visit to the UK produced the unprecedented announcement that Europe’s only two nuclear-weapon powers will “coordinate” their nuclear deterrents and “there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by both nations”.This takes us back to the strategic question. If we are prepared to risk even our very national existence for the defence of Europe, wouldn’t it make sense to have some say in how that Europe develops? And if you’re a government that has staked everything domestically on economic growth, as Starmer’s has, wouldn’t it help to get closer to your largest single market?The situation now is that Britain is fully committed to the defence of Europe but has none of the economic advantages of belonging to the EU. Indeed, it even has to pay a price – for example, in concessions to the French on fishing – for the privilege of contributing to the rest of Europe’s security. Addressing British parliamentarians, Macron said: “The European Union was stronger with you, and you were stronger with the European Union.” True on both counts. But of the two sides, Britain is definitely the more weakened. In the language of diplomacy, Britain is now thedemandeurwherever it turns,wanting something from the other party. Indeed its diplomatic triumphs, be they in the “reset” with the EU or the trade deal with Trump, largely consist in the removal of obstacles that didn’t even exist before.The only strategically coherent long-term answer to this conundrum would be for Britain to rejoin the EU, painfully swallowing its pride and accepting that the new membership terms would be less favourable than those it had before. Halfway houses, such as theUK-EU customs unionproposed by Britain’s Liberal Democrats, would bring some modest economic advantage. Only full EU membership would give the large-scale economic benefits and the political influence in shaping the future of Europe – and, through Europe, the world. In a jungle full of elephants, you’d better be – or at least ride on – one yourself.Any British government seriously committed to advancing the national interest should keep in mind that long-term strategic logic. But British politics is nowhere near this point. Not even the Liberal Democrats advocate Breturn and the political running is being made by the country’s most successful anti-European politician, Nigel Farage. People in the EU see this and are themselves in no mood to start thinking about remarriage. The wounds of Brexit are still sore and the disjuncture between security and economics works better for them than it does for Britain. Anyway, the EU has more than enough on its plate already.So what’s left? Muddling through. Fortunately, muddling through is something of a British speciality. Some years ago I read an article about Britain in a German magazine which talked ofdie Philosophie des Durchmuddelns.(Only Germany could turn muddling-through into a philosophy.) Strangely maladroit in domestic politics, Starmer has been remarkably adept at forging good relationships with leaders such as Macron, Merz and Ursula von der Leyen, as well as Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has shown real leadership on Ukraine and certainly delivered on his promise toMake Britain Serious Again.His cabinet is full of individuals who, like him, seem well-intentioned, competent and decent. A little boring perhaps – but a glance at the Trump administration shows you there are worse things than that. The UK has a heap of problems, but so does every European country I know. British democracy has survived the stress test of Brexit better than US democracy is surviving that of Trump. Socially and culturally, there is still much to be said for Britain’s everyday tolerance, creativity and humour.So if anyone can make a success of muddling-through, Britain can. But Britain would muddle through better if it had a clearer idea of where in the world it wants to be in 10 years’ time. As I believe it says in the Talmud: if you don’t know where you want to go, any road is good.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsForeign policyOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDefence policyFranceGermanycommentShareReuse this content"

Robert F Kennedy doesn’t seem too botheredSat 19 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTSharePregnant women are increasingly shunning vaccinesDo you enjoy getting sick from preventable diseases? Do you have a hankering to make once-declining viruses great again? If so, why not pop over to the US where the health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, and his anti-vaccine cronies are making a valiant effort to overturn decades of progress in modern medicine?Let’s start with measles cases, which are at their highest ratein 33 yearsin the US. The blame for this doesn’t rest entirely with the Trump administration, of course, but officials certainly don’t seem too bothered by it all. RFK Jr hasdownplayedthe number of deaths that have occurred from measles and complained about all the headlines they’re generating.Like the rest of his peers in the Trump administration, RFK Jr seems to have absolutely no idea what he is doing, and appears to be just making things up as he goes along. Indeed, the health secretary memorably told Congress in mid-May that he doesn’t really think people should be takingmedical advice from him. He seems to have forgotten that statement the moment the words left his mouth, however. Not even a couple of weeks later Kennedy announced that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wouldstop recommending Covid-19 booster shotsfor healthy children and pregnant women. This was a highly unusual move, as the health secretary doesn’tnormally make unilateral changesto vaccine recommendations like this.While Kennedy seems to govern by vibes, actual medical experts, who rely on things like evidence and data, are deeply alarmed by the removal of the shots from officials’ recommended immunization schedule.“[D]espite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said in astatement. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”Kennedy’s decision is now facing legal opposition. In the same week that the US reached its dark measles milestone, a number of leading medical associationssued the Trump administration. “This administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,” said thelead counsel for the plaintiffsin a statement.Restoringtrustin public health agencies and vaccines, especially among pregnant women, will take far more than a lawsuit. Two new surveys, published as a research letter in Jama Network Open, have foundthat only 35% to 40% of US pregnant womenand parents of young children say they intend to fully vaccinate their child. To reiterate: we are now at a place where a majority of pregnant women and parents don’t plan to accept all recommended kids’ vaccines.“Given the high decisional uncertainty during pregnancy about vaccinating children after birth, there may be value in intervening during pregnancy to proactively support families with childhood vaccination decisions,”the researchers wrote. Unfortunately, under this administration, that’s a lot easier said than done.Epstein is dead but Trump can’t bury himThe president is throwing a fit over backlash to his administration’ssudden U-turn on the “Epstein Files”. On Wednesday he accused his voters of being gullible “weaklings” who had fallen for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax” which, according to him, is a “SCAM” cooked up by the “Lunatic Left” to discredit him. (If it’s all a hoax, why is Ghislaine Maxwell in prison, eh?) Then, on Thursday,Status News reported that Trumphad called the editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal to try to block its storyon Trump’s relationshipwith the disgraced financier. No matter how many insults he flings around or threats he makes, Trump can’t bury the bigger Epstein story. Instead people are more invested in finding out who Epstein’s associates were than ever before and polls show most Americans believe the government isconcealing information. Trump may want to look up theBarbra Streisand effect.Indian tennis player Radhika Yadav shot dead by her fatherThe 25-year-old’s fatherallegedly felt threatenedbecause she helped support him financially.Andrea Gibson dies aged 49The poet and performance artistdied of ovarian cancer. “Whenever I leave this world, whether it’s sixty years from now, I wouldn’t want anyone to say I lost some battle,” Gibson once wrote. “I’ll be a winner that day.” Gibsonwas a winnerthis week, but the world has lost a force for good.Lupita Nyong’o advocates for uterine health legislationBack in 2014, the Oscar-winning actorhad surgery to remove 30 uterine fibroids– non-cancerous tumors that can cause severe pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. Black women are three times more likely to develop fibroids than white women. July is Fibroid Awareness Month and, on Tuesday, the actor helped introduce a USuterine health legislative packageaimed at introducing better prevention and screening protocols and less invasive treatments. “I hope to seek answers for the far too many women dealing with uterine fibroids,” Nyong’o said. “We must reject the normalization of female pain.”Democratic Women’s Caucus demands investigation into treatment of women in Ice detention“We are deeply concerned about women’s access to health care, especially maternal health care, in ICE detention,” the caucus wrote in a letter.

And now Wesley Enoch as chair of Creative Australia has to fix adamaged sector.Archie Moore, Tracey Moffatt, Warwick Thornton, Deborah Mailman, William Barton,Tony Albert, Judy Watson, David Gulpilil, Christian Thompson, Ivan Sen,Emily Kam Kngwarray, to name just some of the many who have won accolades for their stunning, original work and taken their place at the peaks of cultural power and influence. Winning hearts and changing minds as they went.Not so long ago, this suggested a long overdue reckoning with the First Peoples; a reckoning that the rest of the world was watching in the detached way that those who can be bothered note what is happening elsewhere.‘Manifestation of creative genius’: Murujuga rock art in Western Australia placed on Unesco world heritage listRead moreAustralia is diffident about cultural diplomacy, reluctant to exercise its soft power (in anything other than sport), as the abandonment ofABC Asia Pacific TVdemonstrated – although the ABC has since revamped its international service.The global celebration of First Nations artists was a powerful way of showing that modern Australia had thrown off its colonial legacy, had grown into a truly mature and reconciled nation and come to terms with the ancient human heritage that makes it truly unique.Creative Australia put First Nations stories first in itsstrategic priorities, Dfat’s culturalgrantsemphasised the persuasive power of 65,000 years of unique civilisation, and Australia lobbied hard for Unesco recognition of cultural heritage at Gunditjmara and nowMurujuga.Yet as we approach the second anniversary of the decision by most Australians to reject meaningful recognition of First Peoples, the tension at the heart of this international celebration of the talent, stories and unique ways of seeing, being and doing comes clearly into focus.Is it simple hypocrisy or the old Australian way – one glide forward, two quick steps back?There are markers. The silence about discussing the referendum or to even consider national truth-telling. The ratty politics rejecting welcomes to country andAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. The patchy reporting of thecoronial findingsof institutional racism in the NT Police and theYoorrook inquiry’s findingsof historic genocide. The federal court’s hand-wringing decision that accepted government policies caused wilful destruction of culture and environment in theTorres Strait Islandsbut that it was unable to do anything about it.These recent events suggest that coming to terms with the enduring impact of the past is at best the latter, two quick steps back. At worst, to me, it suggests further signs of what Jeremy Bentham once called an “incurable flaw”.Culture is complicated, cultural diplomacy can take time, but culture might still lead politicsAll this came to mind as I stood outside Tate Modern waiting in line under an unusually hot summer sun for my bag to be checked. My English friend and I were on our way to the third floor of the vast former turbine to see the Emily Kam Kngwarray exhibition.“Why is it on now?” he asked. He knows Australia, has spent time in central Australia and understood how the voice referendum hung heavily there.It’s a reasonable question. And there are many answers. Some practical, others freighted with meaning. The director of the Tatetold the pressit was part of her plan to celebrate older female artists who should be considered great masters (mistresses?). Theart press buzzedthat this was one of three major exhibitions of Indigenous artists in London this summer – the others from Canada and Peru. Indigeneity is “a thing”.The collaboration to celebrate the“old lady’s”work between the Tate, National Gallery of Australia and the women of Alhalker country began not long after the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, declared there would be a referendum to secure meaningful recognition of First Peoples in the Australian constitution. These big retrospectiveshowsare years in the making, especially ones that require the active involvement of local communities as well as major galleries and high-profile owners around the world.When the extraordinary showfirst opened in Canberrajust months after the vote, there was sadness about what might have been, about how the exhibition might have celebrated a new beginning.In London two years later, this is a barely acknowledged backdrop.Those seeing her work for the first time grapple with what it represents, how someone who only started painting in her 70s produced work as fresh and innovative as any major 20th-century artist – but how it grew out of her knowledge, skill and dreaming.Like all great artists, the work is truly hers, grounded in her unique perspective. What comes as a surprise, to those who have only seen her images in books and posters, is their three-dimensional quality. Kngwarray layered paint to evoke stories of such extraordinary depth that they carrya fourth dimensionof infinite time, “everywhen”.It invites the viewer into a unique way of seeing and being.Another Australian artist is also celebrated on level 3 of the Tate.Leigh Bowery, who in his short life became a London gay style icon. Both Emily and Leigh speak to a distinctive Australian sensibility and energy. They prove that from an unlikely starting point anything is possible.Answering my friend’s question, I said I wished the curators had projectedThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, where flamboyant gay culture meets the outback, on the wall between the two iconoclastic Australians, to help viewers literally join the dots between the two exhibitions.Culture is complicated, cultural diplomacycan take time, but culture might still lead politics.Julianne Schultz an emeritus professor at Griffith University and the author of The Idea of Australia​Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansOpinionIndigenous artcommentShareReuse this content"

Now he is bedeviled by a conspiracy theory gapSat 19 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 15.41 EDTShareSome enchanted evening,Donald Trumpsaw a stranger across a crowded room.It is likely that there is hardly anyone living who knows exactly under what glowing lights Donald Trump met Jeffrey Epstein, except perhaps Trump himself and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping to procure minors for sexual abuse. Trump said in aninterviewin 2002, when his Epstein relationship was still tight, that it had been a 15-year mutual admiration society. Epstein was “a terrific guy” and “a lot of fun to be with,” and “likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side”. Epsteindescribedhimself as “Donald’s closest friend for 10 years”.The 1990s and early 2000s were the heyday of the Trump-Epstein romp. Roger Stone, Trump’sdirty tricksterwho was dumped from the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign when he and his wife were exposed apparently advertising for threesomes, was a hanger-on in the Palm Beach demimonde. “There’s 100 beautiful women and 10 guys. Look, how cool are we?” he told theWashington Postin 2016. “I was happy to be invited. I mean, it was great.”The Trump biographer Michael Wolff told me on my podcastThe Court of Historyhow Epstein opened his safe in his New York townhouse for him to retrieve a pile of about a dozen photographs of Trump at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. “They were kind of spread out like playing cards,” Wolff said. “And it was Trump – with girls of uncertain age. In two of them, topless girls are sitting on Trump’s lap. In another, he has a visible stain on his pants while several girls are laughing and pointing at it.” Wolff said: “I think it’s certainly not unlikely that they were in the safe when the FBI came in after his arrest and took everything.”Wolff initially mentioned his taped conversations with Epstein about his relationship with Trump in theDaily Beast, in which Wolff made a glancing reference to this incident, and in theYale Reviewin November 2024. In response to Wolff’s latest book on Trump, All or Nothing, on the 2024 campaign, the White HousestatedWolff had a “peanut-sized brain”. In June of this year, after Wolff claimed Trump held a “grudge” against Harvard because he had applied to be a student and was rejected, Trumppostedit was “False”, and that Wolff is “a Third Rate Reporter, who is laughed at even by the scoundrels of the Fake News”.Epstein has become the Ark of the Covenant in the cosmology of rightwing conspiraciesThe White House issued a statement that Trump “didn’t need to apply to an overrated, corrupt institution like Harvard”.Since 10 August 2019, when Epstein’s body was found in his cell with an orange sheet wrapped around his neck at the New York Metropolitan correction center under suspicious circumstances,declared a suicideby Attorney General William Barr, he has been raised into a phantasmagorical presence that will not vanish. Epstein has become the Ark of the Covenant in the cosmology of rightwing conspiracies. When its doors are opened it will supposedly reveal the ultimate secrets of deep state pedophiles. Apollin 2021 found that about a quarter of Republicans believed that “the government, media, and financial worlds in the US are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation”.The road from Pizzagate, the QAnon predecessor conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats held child sex slaves in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong Washington pizza parlor, to January 6 was a straight line. Half of Republicans believed that “leaked email from some of Hillary Clinton’s campaign staffers contained code words for pedophilia, human trafficking and satanic ritual abuse – what some people refer to as ‘Pizzagate’” was true or probably true, according to a December 2016 Economist/YouGovpoll.Trump gave credence to the QAnon pedophile theory in October 2020, when he was asked about it at anNBC News town hall. “Let me ask you about QAnon,” said Savannah Guthrie. “It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that.” After replying seven times that he didn’t know about it, Trump said: “Let me just tell you, what I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that. And I agree with it very strongly.”A few months later, many in the mob assaulting the Capitol were QAnon believers, though the percentage could not be tabulated. A group of social scientistsfoundthat belief in QAnon theories correlated directly with “support for the January 6 insurrection”. More than a third of Republicans believed that the FBI (ie the Deep State) “instigated” the January 6 assault, according to a Washington Post/University of Marylandpoll.For decades Trump has cultivated paranoid conspiracy theories to foster a cult around himself. His method existed long before Rush Limbaugh loudly burst into talk radio, but Trump inflames paranoia hour by hour to make himself unavoidable. When Trump makes an accusation it’s news – Joe McCarthy’s technique. The ever-shifting series of conspiracy claims from birtherism onward have been monetized into a reliable cash cow by rightwing media. Bottom-feeding serves the bottom line. Every newly invented plot keeps the machine whirring. Maga is constantly tantalized, addicted and perpetuated.The uses of Trump’s conspiracism are complex, from the profane to the holy. The demonology has elevated Trump into a savior of the Magatariat from the globalist elites and fiendish pedophiles. No greater evil can be projected. It’s more than a theory; it’s a theology. Epstein wraps it all up, explains all, proves all – Pizzagate meets the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Lyndon Johnson had his credibility gap with the Vietnam war. Richard Nixon had his 18-minute gap in his White House tapes. Trump now is bedeviled by his conspiracy theory gap.All the president’s men – and women – have stoked theEpstein plot. Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, demanded in 2023: “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” He urged listeners to his talk show “not let that story go” and blamed “people in the Washington swamp who are not telling you the truth”. Kash Patel, the FBI director, repeatedly claimed in 2023 that the Biden administration and Democrats in the Congress were withholding documents about Epstein “because of who’s on that list”.View image in fullscreen‘Since Bondi issued her statement that the Epstein “client list” did not exist, Trump’s attempts to stamp out the flames have become more frenetic.’Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersOn 27 February, Attorney General Pam Bondi welcomed 15 Maga influencers to a press event where she handed out binders labeled “Epstein Files: Phase 1”, which containedno new information. Anger simmered. On 14 March, Bondi stated on Fox News that the Epstein “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, raising the expectation among the Maga believers that such a “client list” existed and that powerful Democrats would be revealed. The “client list” allegedly contained the names of Democrats for whom Epstein trafficked girls and then blackmailed.On 5 June, Elon Musk, accelerating his orbit away from Trump’s gravitation,posted: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk then deleted his post.But, on 6 July, the Department of Justice issued an unsignedstatementthat there was “no incriminating ‘client list’”, “no credible evidence … that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals”, and that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted”.Bondi’s insistence that Epstein kept no “client list” of people he supposedly blackmailed may well be true. . But Bondi debunked a falsehood that had become an article of faith for Maga believers. It was bait for the base.Trump worked to kill a story about his friendship with Epstein. Now we know why | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe Maga world erupted. “Please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away,”Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,posted. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment.” Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, for example,posted: “GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” Tucker Carlsoncalledit a “cover-up” of Epstein as a secret agent for Israeli intelligence. “Why was he doing this, on whose behalf, and where was the money coming from?”Steve Bannon roused the rightwing cadres at the Turning Point USA convention on 13 July. “Epstein,” hesaid, “is a key that picks the lock on so many things, not just individuals, but also institutions, intelligence institutions, foreign governments and who was working with him on our intelligence apparatus and in our government.”Trump’s grooming of his followers cannot be undone. Decades of propaganda have become gospel truth. The Maga base and Republicans generally have not cared about Trump’s sexual abuse of women. After the two E Jean Carroll trials in which Trump was found liable for defaming her by claiming she was lying about his sexual assault, the hush-money payments to silence Stormy Daniels for her sexual relationship with him, and numerous credible reports of dozens of women who have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse by Trump, apollin the fall of 2024 conducted by a conservative thinktank, the American Enterprise Institute, showed that only 5% of Trump voters “believe he did commit sexual assault”.E Jean Carrolltold methat a number of women have come to her to relate similar assaults, but do not want to become public figures out of fear of retribution. For Maga, and Republicans, if there is any distinction, these stories are unworthy of attention. They sanitize and dismiss such predations, while claims of child molestation incite them. Justifying a sexual libertine like Trump, they have held him up as a white knight avenger against pedophiles, remade him into a purifying figure, the defender of the innocent.Since Bondi issued her statement that the Epstein “client list” did not exist, Trump’s attempts to stamp out the flames have become more frenetic. He went from urging his supporters to move on to telling them to get lost.Until evidence of Trump’s participation in Epstein’s transgressions is either established or discredited, Epstein will never dieHis firstremarkwas to chide a reporter who asked about it: “I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we’re having some of the greatest success, and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. It just seems like a desecration.”Trump got more frustrated. “For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump posted on Truth Social, blaming the files on Democrats. “Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden administration.” It was “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein”.Trump tried to rally his base. “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals’?” Trump posted. “They are all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!”Trump reportedlyphonedCharlie Kirk, the head of Turning Point USA, which had served as a forum for criticism of his handling of the Epstein affair, to quiet him. The glib talkshow host announced: “I’m done talking about Epstein for the time being.” As promised, Kirk shut up, but the Maga chorus kept chirping.Enraged,Trump posted on 16 Julythat the “new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker … Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats’ work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!” At a bilateral meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, Trumplashed outat “stupid Republicans”.Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson, invariably a loyal soldier, but who felt forced to respond to the disturbance of the base, called for an investigation. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, asked that Ghislaine Maxwell appear as a witness. Do they think an inquiry would not come to focus on the evidence perhaps in the FBI’s possession of Trump’s gamey relationship with Epstein, rather than the mythical “client list”?Under the stress of the Epstein controversy that will not disappear at Trump’s command, the unpopularity of his One Big Beautiful Bill, the public’s rejection of his brutal deportation methods, and the weakening of the economy as a result of his mad tariffs, Trump is becoming more unhinged, speaking openly offiring the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who, unlike Epstein, is a live target. Crashing the economy might serve as a temporary distraction. Then, in a fit of retributive pique, his administration fired James Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, a prosecutor in the office of the southern district of New York, who had handled the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases.Trump lost more control. Facing backlash,he asked Bondi to seek to releaseEpstein grand jury material, which almost certainly contained no reference to him and was a substitute for the full files, throwing oil on the fire. Trump pressured the Wall Street Journal and its owner Rupert Murdoch not to publish a letter he wrote in honor of Epstein’s 50th birthday. The Journalreported: “It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair. The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.’” On Friday, Trumpsued the Journal and Murdoch.The ghost of Epstein haunts Trump. He cannot dispel his spirit. “Not a fan, not a fan,” hemutteredin the past, trying to distance himself. But Epstein continues to swoop in – “a guy who never dies”. Until evidence of Trump’s participation in Epstein’s transgressions is either established or discredited, including the photographs that Michael Wolff claimed Epstein showed him, Epstein will never die.If Epstein were to appear to Trump at night as an apparition, his Marley’s ghost, he might warn him that there is no happy ending.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Germans haveFaust, Goethe’s play about the successful but dissatisfied scientist Dr Heinrich Faust, who makes a deal with the devil. Faust has been performed, referenced and read in schools for more than two centuries now. Interestingly, the most tragic character in this tragedy is not the protagonist, but his “love interest”, Gretchen – a teenage girl groomed by the old man, impregnated and socially ostracised. Her solution? She drowns her “illegitimate” newborn child, accepts her death penalty and rejects Faust’s offer to save her from prison. In God’s mercy, the Christian girl seeks salvation and off goes Faust with the devil to new adventures inFaust, Part Two.What would Gretchen do today, I wonder. Her fate is not only a result of sexual abuse and an inherently misogynistic morality, but also nonexistent reproductive rights. In today’s Germany, abortion isstill illegal under the criminal code. It is nonpunishable under certain conditions, particularly during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but nonetheless, in practice a modern-day Gretchen might have difficulty finding a doctor willing to perform a termination, depending on where she lives. Moreover, Gretchen might be intimidated by the stigma, which is not just societal but enshrined in German law.For decades now, theso-called paragraph 218that criminalises abortion has been subject to political debate. Poland and the US are living proof that, even if not prosecuting anyone for carrying out or procuring an abortion is the accepted practice, that can be toppled quickly when ultraconservatives are in power.The last German government, under the Social Democratic party’s (SPD) Olaf Scholz, made an attempt to reform paragraph 218 before losing power, but failed. Obviously, nobody expects the current German government, led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to take any progressive decisions on the right to physical self-determination. But what is now happening at the Bundestag goes further than preserving this outdated law – which must surely fall foul of international human rights standards.After weeks of an orchestrated rightwingsocial media campaign, the election by the Bundestag of three new judges to the constitutional court (Germany’s highest court) wasunexpectedly cancelledlast week. The reason: one of candidates, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a 54-year-old jurist and professor, stands accused of holdingextremist leftwingpositions, because shesupports the decriminalisation of abortion.View image in fullscreenAfD co-leader Alice Weidel at the Bundestag, Berlin, 11 July 2025.Photograph: Nadja Wohlleben/ReutersAnyone who has listened to or readBrosius-Gersdorf’s judicial reasoningknows that she fully relies on the German constitution in her arguments and carefully evaluates the rights of the mother and the embryo depending on the phase of pregnancy. In the early phase, according to Brosius-Gersdorf, the mother’s rights predominate. In the later phase, as soon as the embryo is viable, the embryo’s right to life has to be protected.Claims that Brosius-Gersdorf is in favour of abortions until the ninth month of pregnancy areblatant lies, spread by rightwing media as well as far-right Alternative for Germany(AfD) politicians.The fact that Brosius-Gersdorf, who was nominated by the SPD, also argues for a ban on the AfD due to the classification of it by German intelligence asrightwing extremistmight have been the real trigger for the propaganda campaign against her.Other accusations have circulated around the jurist’s recommendation for compulsory vaccination during the pandemic, and allegations that her PhD thesis was plagiarised (which wereproven to be false). But not until the focus fell on her allegedly radical views on abortion did the mobilisation succeed. Parts of the governing coalition – 50 to 60 Christian Democrat MPs – raised doubts about her nomination, which led to postponement of the vote, which will probably now be delayed until after the summer recess. Appointments to the constitutional court require a two-thirds parliamentary majority in a secret ballot.Her critics now expect Brosius-Gersdorf to withdraw, although the SPD, Greens and the leftwing party Die Linke continue to uphold her nomination.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some commentators speak of the “Trumpification of German politics”, since the whole debacle is founded on fake news and defamation. But the stigma of abortion itself is not an imported phenomenon. It is part of German cultural identity, perpetuated by the Gretchen tragedy, which has never really gone out of date.Paragraph 218, by the way, is a relic from the 1871 criminal code and almost as old as Faust. Gretchen would certainly be surprised that so little has changed when it comes to bodily autonomy.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The head of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Sergey Lysak,said a factory had been damaged, a fire station destroyed and a five-storey residential building hit.“A hellish night and morning for Pavlohrad. The most intense attack on the city. Explosion after explosion. Russian terrorists targeted it with missiles and drones,” he said.Drones could be heard flying over Pavlohrad in the early hours of Saturday. There were cacophonous booms and orange explosions lighting up the night sky. The streets echoed with machine-gun fire as anti-aircraft units tried to shoot them down.In the morning, thick black smoke hung above the city. There were several fires. One exhausted resident, Oleh, said it had been the worst night he had known. “Nobody slept. We were all in shelters. There was a thunderstorm as well. We had explosions and rain together,” he said.0:28Explosions seen over city of Pavlohrad during Russian drone and missile attack – videoThe attack came soon after Gen Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, flew back to Washington after a six-day visit to Kyiv.

Last month, Mohammad Abdul Momen said he had asked the NCA to consider freezing the assets of several individuals, amid a flurry of post-revolutionary property market activity.To freeze or not to freezeDisclosures to the UK Land Registry show at least 20 “applications for dealing” have been submitted in the past year in relation to property owned by figures under scrutiny by Dhaka. Such documents typically indicate a sale, transfer or change to a mortgage.Three relate to £24.5m worth of property ultimately owned by members of the Sobhan family, the powerful dynasty behind the multibillion-pound Bashundhara business group, a conglomerate that spans cement to media.One, a four-storey townhouse in Knightsbridge, has been the subject of two recent transactions, the purpose of which are unclear. Until April last year, it was owned directly by Sayem Sobhan Anvir, Bashundhara’s managing director, via a company based in the United Arab Emirates.Sobhan is among several family members under investigation by the ACC for allegations including money laundering, the Guardian understands.In April, the property was transferred – apparently free of charge – to a UK business called Brookview Heights Ltd. Brookview is owned by a director of Orbis London, a real estate advisory firm with offices in Liechtenstein and Singapore that has acted for the Sobhans on property transactions in the past.The London home appears to have subsequently been sold for £7.35m to a newly formed company, whose sole director is an accountant with no online profile. The accountant is registered as the owner and director of multiple other companies that appear to be special purpose vehicles for multimillion-pound London properties.Land Registry records show that UK law firms have made two more applications for dealing on properties owned by another member of the Sobhan family, Shafiat, including an £8m mansion in Virginia Water, Surrey.A family member did not return a request for comment but has previously said that the family deny “all allegations of wrongdoing and will robustly defend ourselves against these allegations”.Members of the Sobhan family are among a clutch of UK property owners whose assets the ACC has asked the NCA to consider freezing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further three applications, understood to relate to refinancing, have taken place since.Lawyers for Anisuzzaman Chowdhury said he did not believe that there was any legitimate reason for any of his assets to be frozen and that the sale of the Regent’s Park property was agreed in 2023, before the revolution.According to reports in Bangladesh, the ACC has previously been asked by the chair of a large local bank, UCB, to investigate whether Chowdhury helped the London-based property developer obtain loans irregularly from the lender.This year, a Bangladeshi court imposed a travel ban on the developer, who denies any wrongdoing.A further three applications for dealing relate to properties owned by the son and the nephew of Salman F Rahman, who runs the Beximco business group, one of Bangladesh’s largest conglomerates. Ahmed Shayan Rahman and Ahmed Shahryar Rahman are under investigation by the ACC.View image in fullscreenGrosvenor Square in central London, where a £35m apartment was recently frozen by the National Crime Agency.Photograph: AP S (uk)/AlamyThe properties, including a £35m apartment in Mayfair’s Grosvenor Square, were frozen by the NCA last month.Lawyers for the Rahmans said they denied any wrongdoing. They said “political upheaval” in Bangladesh had led to allegations being made against many people, adding that they would “engage with any investigation which takes place in the UK”.Joe Powell MP, the chair of an all-party parliamentary group examining corruption and tax, wants any such investigations to move quickly.“History tells us that assets can quickly evaporate unless swift steps are taken to freeze those assets while investigations are under way,” he said.Powell welcomed the action already taken by the NCA but urged it to “expand the net as soon as possible”.The Labour MP leads a group of parliamentarians that is targeting London’s reputation as a home for suspicious funds and those who enable the transfer of that wealth, particularly given the renewed focus on oligarchs that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A spokesperson said the firm had not been involved in any sales and that it took its due diligence obligations “extremely seriously”.Merali Beedle, a law firm that made applications for dealing on one £35m Rahman property and another £8m home owned by a member of the Sobhan family, declined to comment.A spokesperson for Transparency International said: “Professional services firms should exercise extreme caution when conducting regulated activities for clients known to be under investigation. They should perform comprehensive source-of-wealth checks and immediately report suspicious activity to police.“Without swift action, these funds risk vanishing into the international financial system, potentially placing them beyond recovery.”The ACC declined to comment on its investigations.Explore more on these topicsReal estateBangladeshSouth and central AsiaPropertySheikh HasinaLondonLand ownershipnewsShareReuse this content"

He was shot during the struggle, the LA police department said.The department described the suspect who shot the driver as “a Hispanic male, approximately 5t, 9in tall, 180lbs, bald, wearing a blue jersey, and possibly armed with a silver revolver.” The man fled the scene on foot.Images from the scene from photographers and social media show debris, including shoes, strewn across the road, as surrounding areas were sealed off and emergency response teams arrived.“This is under police investigation,” VanGerpen added. “This will be a large investigation with the LAPD.”Partygoers in the club came out immediately to help the victims before the emergency crews arrived, he said.“They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in.

Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula’s administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he wouldimpose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian importsas of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.On Friday, after federal police raided Bolsonaro’s house andfitted him with an electronic tagto stop him absconding, Rubio announced further moves in support of the defendant, who he claimed was the victim of a “political witch hunt”.Writing on X, Rubio said he had ordered visa revocations for the judge leading the investigation into Bolsonaro, Alexandre de Moraes, as well as “his allies on the court” and their family members. Rubio did not name his other targets but the Brazilian newspaper O Globoidentified themas Luís Roberto Barroso, José Antonio Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, Luiz Edson Fachin and Gilmar Ferreira Mendes.Two other judges who were nominated to the court during Bolsonaro’s 2019-23 presidency, André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques, reportedly avoided the sanction, as did a third judge, Luiz Fux.Lula denounced what he called “another arbitrary and completely groundless measure from the US government”.“Interference in another country’s justice system is unacceptable and offends the basic principles of national sovereignty and respect between nations,” the president said on Saturday, adding: “I’m certain that no kind of intimidation or threat – from whoever it may be – will compromise the most important mission of our nation’s powers and institutions, which is to act permanently to defend and safeguard the democratic rule of law.”The Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz welcomed Rubio’s announcement, calling Bolsonaro’s treatment “sick and wrong”.Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo, thanked Rubio for his decision. “Thank you very much for this fight in favor of free speech, we do believe in the same values,” tweeted Eduardo, who has been living in the US since February and has reportedly been lobbying officials there over his father’s plight.Trump’s interventions have appalled millions of Brazilians who hope to see their former leader held responsible for the alleged coup attempt, which culminated in the 8 January riots in Brasília.Lula’s institutional relations minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, called the visa cancellations “an aggressive and petty retaliation” and “an affront to the Brazilian judiciary and national sovereignty”.Even influential rightwing voices have criticised the US’s attempt to meddle in one of the world’s most populous democracies by imposing 50% tariffs.On Saturday, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaperdescribedTrump’s behaviour as “unacceptable external interference in Brazil’s domestic matters”. “Trump has not only attacked our national sovereignty … [but also] stained the history of diplomatic relations between the two largest democracies in the Americas,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote.While the Bolsonaros have hailed Trump’s actions, they also appear to have grasped how theannouncement of tariffs has backfired, allowing Lula to pose as a nationalist defender of Brazilian interests and paint the Bolsonaro clan as self-serving “traitors”.Lula, who had been facing growing public disillusionment and an uphill battle to win re-election next year, has enjoyed a bounce in the polls since Trump launched his trade war, the brunt of which will be borne by coffee producers and cattle ranchers in Bolsonaro-voting regions, such as São Paulo.Celso Rocha de Barros, a political columnist, said he suspected the Bolsonaros had been blindsided by the scale of Trump’s attack.“I think [Bolsonaro] wanted some kind of penalty - something he could use to say: ‘Look, Brazil’s being punished because of Bolsonaro’s persecution. But [the tariffs] went far too far … [they] screwed Bolsonaro’s base,” said Rocha de Barros, pointing to their potential impact on agribusiness.On Friday night, Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio, post on X, calling on Trump to suspend the tariffs and replace them with individual sanctions. Soon after, however, he deleted the post.Explore more on these topicsMarco RubioMigrationBrazilJair BolsonaroTrump administrationTrump tariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the closure led to the workforce scattering to various other employers – including carmaker Aston Martin’s plant at nearby St Athan – while others retrained.“Welsh cloud region”Coming up for five years later, the Ford site is still empty, but an industry of the future has big plans.The US-based datacentre company Vantage bought the land for areported £27.5m in 2024, the biggest industrial transaction in south Wales last year. In recent weeks it has submitted a planning application to the council to build a huge datacentre complex on the site, representing a multibillion-pound investment.“We recognise the importance of industry in Bridgend,” says Vantage in its application, stating that the cluster of 10 datacentres will “lay the foundation for future prosperity and regional economic regeneration”.View image in fullscreenMany locals bemoan the state of public services in Bridgend.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara ThomasFuture prosperity may, however, be some way off. Subject to gaining planning approval, Vantage intends to start construction early next year, and will build the complex over three phases up to 2040.Once operational, it is pledging 600 full-time jobs on site, with a further 350 in the supply chain. It says the average salary of Vantage employees is £75,000, more than double the average salary in Bridgend, or Wales.The company, backed by a consortium of investors including DigitalBridge Group, Silver Lake, Australian Super and others already operates one datacentre 30 miles east along the M4 motorway at Newport and has received planning permission for another in the Vale of Glamorgan. Vantage writes in its planning statement to the council that these three locations would “form the cornerstone of a Welsh cloud region”.A company spokesperson said its expansion in south Wales was linked to “many factors … from the availability of land, power and skilled labour to the support of the local councils and national government, and customer demand”.The company also estimates the development will help the town by generating £8.3m a year in business rates for the local authority, although in Wales these are pooled between councils and distributed centrally.View image in fullscreenLocal resident Jennifer Owen (right, with Marilyn James) says Nigel Farage is a ‘dangerous man’.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara ThomasMore money for the area would clearly be welcomed by locals, many of whom bemoan the state of public services.On a sweltering weekday morning, groups of retired women are dodging soaring temperatures inside Bridgend’s Aroma cafe. Many are former colleagues meeting for regular coffee catch-ups, where the lack of local public transport or the disappointing state of Bridgend’s town centre with many vacant stores are common themes.“It’s all right if you vape, or want a Turkish barber,” says Susan, sitting at one of the tables. “You don’t come into town if you want an outfit.”Home of heavy industryMany in Bridgend feel they have heard promises from large companies before.While the town itself was never home to heavy industry, the surrounding region relied on it, and the Tata steelworks at Port Talbot is just 14 miles up the road. When Ford opened in 1980, the area was already home to dozens of car parts companies and it was hoped the automotive sector would take the place of a declining coal industry, which employed 250,000 in Wales at its peak.Significant numbers of Welsh miners took part in the1984-85 miners’ strike, led by Arthur Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers. While the action ultimately failed to prevent pit closures, it left a lasting legacy in Wales’s coalmining heartlands.In the aftermath of the strike, Wales had some success in attracting foreign investment, often to Bridgend, helped by its proximity to the M4. However, many locals can reel off a list of the large multinationals that have come and gone, including LG and Bosch.While Ford’s closure did not cause a rise in unemployment in Bridgend, where it remains about 3.5%, according to official figures, the economic inactivity rate – measuring people neither in work nor looking for a job – has climbed 6% since the pandemic. While this picture is repeated across the UK since Covid, the rate in Bridgend stands at 30.6%, significantly higher than the British average of 21%.The main political parties are looking for ways to tackle persistent economic problems, but have differing views on how best to achieve it.Reform UK is hoping to capitalise on voters’ dissatisfaction, in a town that voted 54.6% for leave in the Brexit referendum, at a time when it is setting out its stall in Wales beforenext May’s elections for the Welsh parliament.View image in fullscreenCaroline Jones says Bridgend town centre ‘lacks vibrancy’.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara Thomas“The town centre is lacking vibrancy,” says Caroline Jones, who hopes to be selected as Reform’s candidate for the Senedd for Bridgend. . Recalling a busier time, when the high street was home to more shops and bank branches, she says: “Our aim is to enhance town centres, to bring local employment and to level up the playing field.”Jones, who previously served as the Senedd member for south west Wales for Ukip and as an independent, was Reform’s candidate for Bridgend in last year’s general election, coming second to Labour with a 19% share of the vote.“I want to see industry and manufacturing brought back into our area, which obviously needs a lot of planning,” she adds.It is unclear how Reform intends to attract this investment, and many of the policies Jones and the party are proposing – includinglowering corporation taxor raising the income tax threshold to £20,000 – are not devolved powers and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Senedd.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was where he made his pitch to Welsh voters,vowing to reopen closed coalminesand restart blast furnaces to usher in a new era of domestic steel making, fuelled by Welsh coal.The party has not yet named its leader in Wales and does not have any Senedd members. However, since Farage’s June visit to Port Talbot, Reform has topped two polls of voting intentions, with nationalists Plaid Cymru in second, pushing Labour into third place.Such an outcome would be a serious defeat for Welsh Labour, which has run the government in Cardiff ever since devolution nearly 27 years ago. The first minister, Eluned Morgan, is hoping to overturn a slump in voter support for Labour, but has said she is taking thethreat of Reform “very seriously”. However, even if Reform wins the largest number of seats in the Senedd, a new more proportional voting system makes itunlikely it will be able to form a majority government.Reform has just gained its first councillor, the youngest ever in the borough of Bridgend, in the shape of Owain Clatworthy, who clinched a surprise council byelection win in May, just days before his 21st birthday.View image in fullscreenOwain Clatworthy clinched a surprise council byelection win for Reform in May.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara ThomasHe has already gained some local recognition. Being photographed by the Guardian outside the council offices, a passerby claps him on the shoulder and congratulates him on “doing a fine job”.Clatworthy grew up in care from the age of six and now helps others in a similar situation as a support worker, but insists a job in heavy industry would appeal to some of his peers.“I don’t doubt that if you ask a young person who is struggling to get by, like I was a couple of years ago, I’d have snatched your arm off to maybe get down the mines,” Clatworthy says.“Coal runs through our veins in Wales,” says Bridgend resident Carwyn Jones, a former first minister of Wales and now a Labour peer, “but the mines have been flooded, capped, built over”. He does not believe Wales’s future prosperity lies in a return to past industries.“A word I’d use to describe it, which is a particularly technical term, is bonkers,” he says. “Is that what we are saying to people, ‘That’s what the Welsh want, to be stuck down a hole in the ground again’?”View image in fullscreenFormer first minister Carwyn Jones outside the Ford engine plant in June 2019.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesIn recent decades Bridgend has moved away from reliance on one large employer, Jones says, which makes the town “economically safer”.“We’ve got all these hidden gems,” he says, listing hi-tech local companies including Spectrum Technologies, which makes laser-marking equipment for aircraft wires and cables.“Green shoots”A burst of industry is visible and audible in the town centre, where there is a cluster or cranes and workers in hi-vis. Bridgend College’s new campus is under construction, scheduled to open next September. The £75m project will bring 1,000 of the college’s 7,500 students and staff into central Bridgend, which the principal, Vivienne Buckley, believes will help regeneration efforts, while it is hoped the campus theatre will bolster the growing night-time economy.“It’s the biggest investment that’s gone into Bridgend in generations,” says Buckley of the scheme which is two-thirds funded by the Welsh government, with the remaining third covered by the college. “People in Bridgend are excited about it. It’s not a panacea, but a huge opportunity.”The vocational further education college retrained some of Ford’s workers and has been responsible for training Tata Steel’s apprentices for 15 years. However, the region’s shift away from manufacturing means Bridgend’s future workers require different skills.View image in fullscreenVivienne Buckley hopes the new Bridgend College campus will help the regeneration of the town centre.Photograph: Dmitris Legakis/The Guardian“What we need to do is produce students who are able to adapt to the needs of the workforce they enter,” she says . “Even 10 years ago it was more about a bespoke skill set, now industry seems to be looking for a broad base of knowledge that can be moulded into what they need.”Bridgend’s Labour MP, Chris Elmore, whose constituency now includes the town, after boundary changes, insists there are “green shoots” in the local economy, listing the college development, new hospitality venues and housing developments.Elmore has been lobbying for an AI growth zone in south Wales, and is hopeful such projects could be achieved through better cooperation between Labour-run administrations in Westminster and Cardiff.“I think actually that relationship [between the UK government and Welsh Labour] is beginning to show positive signs, and it’s our job to make that case.”However, it is unclear whether Bridgend residents will be patient if they don’t see improvements to the local area and public services. Back at the Aroma cafe, there is a weariness with the Labour-run Welsh government, but little appreciation for Reform either.“I am not staunch Labour come hell and high water like many here,” says Ann. “I voted independent in the last election.”“I don’t likeNigel Farageat all,” adds Jennifer Owen. “I think he is a dangerous man.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryRise of the rightEconomicsFordNigel FarageRegenerationCommunitiesWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All three said they were taking action to improve their performances.After Monday’s report, ministers are expected to roll out new measures to tackle other significant causes of water pollution. They plan to tackle agricultural runoffs, which are mainly connected to animal waste or fertiliser residues running into rivers and can often cause high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in rivers, cresting toxic algal blooms.This year, the environment secretary announcedplans to loosen regulation for chicken farmsand came in for heavy criticism from green groups, who said the changes could worsen water pollution.According toan analysisby the Independent Water Commission for its interim report,published last month, 45% of water bodies in England are affected by pollutants from agriculture – slightly more than the 44% affected by runoff from the water industry.The same study said nearly 20% of water bodies saw pollutants from roads and transport, including oil, chemicals and the residues from tyre and brake wear, a problem made worse by heavy rain.A more minor contributor, but one that can last a long time, is the effect of chemicals in metals mines contaminating groundwater, even many years after they have closed.While the number of Environment Agency inspections of farms has increased, ministers are planning more action, including new measures to limit the impact from mining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We are cracking down on sewage pollution from water companies, but we need to tackle all sources of pollution, including from farming. That’s the only way to clean up our country’s rivers, lakes and seas.”The political pressure over waterways pollution, particularly connected to sewage spills, is intense, with polls showing consistent support for re-nationalising the industry, which the government has ruled out, and for jailing water bosses responsible for pollution.The Liberal Democrats have campaigned particularly hard on pollution in rivers, streams and coastal areas, with the subject forming a key element of the party’s election campaign last year.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That was just months before a general election that the Labour party, which had a longstanding pledge to hold an inquiry into what happened at Orgreave, was expected to win.The timing led to accusations that the force had destroyed the documents to avoid scrutiny of its officers’ actions.Map of area around SheffieldAt the Orgreave coking plant on 18 June 1984 an estimated 8,000 miners assembled for a mass picket called by the National Union of Mineworkers, met by 4,500 police officers from forces nationwide, led bySouth Yorkshirepolice.The violence that took place, withpolice charging on horsebackand hitting miners with truncheons, is remembered as a landmark confrontation of the bitter 1984-85 strike. A criminal prosecution of 95 miners for riot and unlawful assembly collapsed a year later after the miners’ barristers repeatedly accused police officers of lying and malpractice.TheOrgreave Truth and Justice Campaign(OTJC) has for years called for an inquiry into the police operation and the failed prosecutions. Northumbria police previously confirmed that they held documents relevant to the policing at Orgreave, including a report by a superintendent who was the liaison officer for 92 officers sent to South Yorkshire.In 2016 Northumbria’s then chief constable, Steve Ashman, wrote to Yvette Cooper, then the chair of the home affairs select committee, explaining that the superintendent’s report detailed an incident involving a police constable.“This officer was believed to have been involved in striking a ‘picket’ with his truncheon,” Ashman wrote. “This incident is identified as been [sic] the subject of television news reporting … the superintendent’s report details how [the PC] was ‘reported’ for the offence of assault to the director of public prosecutions (DPP). The report further outlines that the DPP subsequently decided there would be no criminal prosecution in the case.”Joe Diviney, a historian at the University of Sheffield who is researching a PhD on the Orgreave events, pointed out that this appeared clearly to be the PC Martin incident. Martin was identified, including in police documents, as the officer who struck Broomhead, and a report was sent to the DPP who decided, on the same day Martin was interviewed, not to bring charges.During an interview under caution, Martin denied wrongdoing, and said of the Orgreave policing: “It’s not a case of me going off half cock. The senior officers, supers and chief supers were there and getting stuck in too – they were encouraging the lads and I think their attitude to the situation affected what we all did.”View image in fullscreenThousands of officers were summoned to Orgreave in response to plans for a mass picket.Photograph: Mike Forster/ANL/ShutterstockBroomhead told the Guardian: “I would still like truth and accountability for what happened. If something is wrong, it stays wrong. I never knew in all these years that a superintendent had written a report on the incident that involved me. It’s unbelievable that the police can throw that document away, without asking me and people it affects.”Kate Flannery, secretary of the OTJC, said: “It now seems highly likely that one of the documents destroyed by Northumbria police could relate to the PC Martin attack. Any destruction of important information relating to violent police attacks on striking miners means that crucial evidence is no longer available to an Orgreave inquiry.“This all adds to the many concerns we have about police cover-ups and justice being denied.”A Northumbria police spokesperson said last month that the documents had been “disposed of … in line with force policy and the Data Protection Act 2018”.After criticism, including by theLabour MP Ian Lavery, the force has since said it is investigating its own decision-making. “We very much recognise the strength of feeling and concern within our communities at the disposal of information relating to the miners’ strike,” a spokesperson said. “We can confirm, we are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances around the disposal of the material.”The Archives and Records Association is calling for police documents to be preserved by law. The association’s chair, Ruth MacLeod, said: “Many people have no idea that police records, which are important for accountability, can be so easily destroyed. There needs to be legislation to protect them, and prevent the kind of destruction that has happened in Northumbria.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Achild died at Alder Heyhospital in Liverpool on Sunday after contracting the infectious disease.With cases increasing and vaccine uptake in some parts of the country worryingly low, nurseries are bringing back infection control measures last used during the pandemic to keep children safe and ease parents’ fears.Adam Rowles’ two-year-old daughter attends a nursery in south-eastLondonthat recently had four cases of measles. Although his daughter is fully vaccinated, his six-month-old son is due to start attending the nursery before his first birthday, when he would be eligible for his first measles jab.Rowles said: “It’s alarming, isn’t it? Because it’s something that you think has been eradicated, and we don’t have to worry about any more, but then all of a sudden here we are. It’s just baffling.”He has asked about postponing his son’s nursery place until he is vaccinated but was told that would cost him his place. The nursery said it had implemented strict protocols, such as dividing up walking and nonwalking babies to reduce the spread of infection and had brought back “Covid levels of cleaning”.“We felt slightly more at ease, but still not fully at ease,” said Rowles. “It made what seemed really bad and quite scary, still scary but less so. We’re basically just going to have to hope for the best for five months. And we have grandparents on hand to help if we have to take him out of there, if it comes to that.”Melanie Pilcher of the Early Years Alliance, which represents providers, said nurseries were equipped to deal with outbreaks after the Covid pandemic and were starting to bring back similar infection control procedures. “They’re using all those good hygiene practices, staff have got PPE, they’ve got aprons, gloves, some settings still keep masks,” she said. “They’re doing everything they can, while obviously not scaring the children either.“Thanks to Covid, we got very savvy at knowing what we needed to do in the case of a very serious illness occurring like this. It is a very real and present danger.”Pilcher said many nurseries were asking whether they could turn away unvaccinated children: “They can’t, and it wouldn’t be right to turn children away because it is a parental choice at the end of the day, and we have to respect that.”Experts said measles vaccine uptake had decreased in part because of misinformation online, missed appointments in the pandemic and limited access to GP appointmentsHelen Bedford, a professor of children’s health at UCL, said inequality driven by poverty was the key underlying issue. “People talk about vaccine hesitancy and true, people do have questions, they have concerns. But the biggest problem really is about access. Under-immunisation goes hand in hand with poverty,” she said.Parents being unable to take time off work to get their child to a vaccination appointment, or unable to afford the transport to get there, were regularly cited as reasons why children had not had both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella jab.Prof Matt Ashton, the director of public health forLiverpool, where measles vaccine uptake is 73% compared with 84% across England, said: “Measles is a disease people are used to not seeing. And people have complex, difficult lives, aligned to poverty and deprivation.“They are time-poor, often working really hard just to put food on the table. So that means they don’t prioritise a health intervention for a disease they don’t think is an issue.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We had almost elimination status in the UK just before Covid,” he said. “It’s also quite difficult to spot because the symptoms are very non-specific until the rash appears at day four.“Measles is 10 times more infectious than flu or Covid, so you only have to have a child sitting in a busy waiting room for 15 minutes and then you’ve got a potential spread.”He said he was increasingly speaking to families who had not had their children vaccinated, often for “personal reasons”.Dr Qasim Malik, a paediatric registrar and member of the British Islamic Medical Association (Bima), said a more targeted approach toward different communities was needed to boost vaccine uptake. “We’re often talking about people who probably have been traditionally excluded from accessing healthcare,” he said. “For instance, the marginalisation of asylum seekers and refugees means they’re more reluctant to seek out healthcare for their children.“At Bima, we use inclusive language sensitive to the Muslim community, such as considering if there is gelatine in the vaccine, for instance, whether that is affecting uptake and what alternatives are available. We need less demonisation and a kinder approach when looking at these issues by building relationships and looking at vaccine hesitancy alongside other issues such as lack of access to food and adequate housing.”Explore more on these topicsMMRNHSHealthVaccines and immunisationLiverpoolLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Studying exposure to those mixtures and other environmental factors is “essential” to protecting people’s health, said the authors, with the National University of the Littoral in Argentina.“The concept of the exposome, which encompasses all lifetime environmental exposures, underscores the importance of studying pesticides as mixtures rather than in isolation,” the authors wrote.The study comes on the heels of University of Nebraskaresearchthat found state cancer records and bio-monitoring data showed that exposure to multiple pesticides could increase the chances of children developing brain cancer by about 36%.The new study checked for pesticides in the urine of nearly 90 pregnant women in Santa Fe, Argentina, a heavily agricultural region, and monitored their pregnancy outcomes. About 40 different pesticides were detected.At least one pesticide was found in the urine of 81% of women, and 64% showed multiple pesticides. Of those, 34% had pregnancy complications.The number of women living in urban areas who had at least one pesticide in their body was only slightly lower than those in rural districts, suggesting that food is also a meaningful exposure route. But about 70% of women in rural settings showed multiple pesticides, compared to 55% of women in urban settings, highlighting a greater risk among the former.Rural participants were over twice as likely to have pregnancy-related complications compared to urban, in part because they are more frequently exposed to mixtures.The Santa Fe region grows dozens of crops, including lettuce, cabbage, chicory, tomato, parsley, spinach, carrot, bell pepper, potato and strawberry, and the wide range of crops leads to the use of more pesticides, the authors wrote.“The increased prevalence of pregnancy-related complications among rural participants highlights the need for a comprehensive review of pesticide use protocols, exposure limits and health risk assessments in agriculture and horticulture programs,” the authors said.Gestational hypertension was among the most common pregnancy-related complications, and the most common outcome was intrauterine growth restriction, a condition in which the fetus does not grow to a normal weight during pregnancy.The findings may also point to dangers in the type of pesticide to which women are exposed, the authors wrote. Those who had complications showed higher levels of triazole fungicides, a pesticide class that is widely used on crops like corn, soybeans and wheat. Some previous evidence suggests it’s a reproductive toxicant, and the authors say their findings show the need for more research on the class’s potential effects.Though not all the same pesticides are used in the US or other countries as in Argentina, the use of triazole fungicidesincreasedfour-fold in the US between 2006 and 2016, especially in the southeast and midwest. Still, it has drawn little regulatory scrutiny.Exposure to mixtures of pesticides in general “is the rule, not the exception”, said Nathan Donley, a pesticides researcher with the Center for Biological Diversity, who was not involved with the study.“For the most part we have absolutely no clue how different mixtures interact in utero, in a child or in an adult,” Donley said. “Some mixtures probably aren’t doing much of anything, others are probably causing significant harm that we have not identified yet.”There is little regulatory oversight of pesticide mixtures in the US, in part because determining health impacts of mixtures is complicated, Donley added.“The US tends to just default that it’s all safe until proven otherwise, and since there is very little research on pesticide mixtures, it’s rarely proven otherwise,” Donley said, adding that the unknown risks calls for the use of greater precaution.The authors note that the paper’s sample size is small, and the findings point to the need for a larger bio-monitoring study.“Greater efforts are required to deepen and expand the evaluation of human exposure to pesticides in vulnerable populations,” the authors wrote.Explore more on these topicsPesticidesFarmingHerbicidesAgriculturenewsShareReuse this content"

That, combined with his recent removal of a panel of more than a dozen vaccine advisers, signals that his dismantling of the science-based policymaking at HHS is likely far from over.“The current administration is waging a war on science,” warned Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease expert at New York University in a keynote talk in May to graduates of Harvard’s School of PublicHealth.‘Tremendous uncertainty’ for cancer research as US officials target mRNA vaccinesRead more“Today we see rising threats to the public health institutions that have kept our world safe for generations,” she said, citing “cuts to research that benefits the lives of millions, looming public health emergencies that are not being addressed with the urgency they demand, and a continued coordinated attack on the very idea of the scientific process.”Gounder added: “Over the past few months, we have seen the Trump administration engage not only in medical misinformation, but in active censorship of scientific discourse.”Since he took the helm at HHS, Kennedy’s unscientific views on vaccines and some other medical matters coupled with the agency’s widespread research and staff cuts, have prompted protests from scientists inside and outside HHS plus lawsuits.Medical experts say Kennedy’s policies are helping “sow distrust in vaccines” as measles cases soar to a more than three decade high, hurt vital healthcare research with draconian cuts, and helped foment a Trump administration “war on science” mentality.Kennedy sparked a firestorm in June by ousting 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends vaccines to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and votes to provide updates to its vaccine schedule. He then named a new eight person vaccine panel – half of whom share Kennedy’s distrust of vaccines – who quickly retracted recommendations for flu vaccines containing an ingredient which many anti-vaxxers have falsely connected to autism.That move sparked sharp criticism from veteran doctors with a national pediatric group, which opted to boycott its first meeting.“Among the reasons we decided not to participate was because it clearly appeared to be an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” Sean O’Leary who chairs a committee on infectious diseases with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the Guardian.Dissent has also spread at the National Institutes of Health, where dozens of science researchers and other staff in June released a detailed document, dubbed the Bethesda Declaration, warning that key missions of the premiere research agency at HHS were being damaged by the Trump administration’s budget cutting.Even before these moves, prominent healthcare scholars were sounding loud alarms about some HHS policies and the administration’s anti-science mentality – including its draconian budget cuts for research and staff cuts totaling over 10,000.Gounder said there has been a “flood of Orwellian doublespeak from public health agencies”, contributing to declining vaccination rates and making Americans more susceptible to diseases like measles, which recently hit a level not seen since 2000 when measles was declared eliminated in the US.Her critique has been amplified by public protests from healthcare experts troubled by its vaccine policies and large cuts to research and staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the NIH and other parts of HHS.On a separate legal front, a Rhode Island federal court in July ruled against HHS and Kennedy and put a temporary stop to the drastic revamping of HHS and some of its staff cuts.The ruling provided a court victory to a group of 19 Democratic state attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia, which in MaysuedKennedy – plus other HHS leaders such as the FDA commissioner and the CDC’s acting director – attacking the restructuring as an “unconstitutional and illegal dismantling” of the agency. Kennedy, they alleged, has “systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job”.The Rhode Island judge wrote that as members of the executive branch, Kennedy and the HHS do “not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress”.For his part, Kennedy in March issued a statement defending the early HHS move to cut 10,000 full-time jobs: “We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”Those jobs have since been cut, as of Monday 14 July, after an 8 July order from the supreme court that allowed the restructuring plans to proceed. Many employees who were supposed to be laid off during the agency’s first round of 10,000 layoffs in April have been in limbo as the order made its way through the court system and later paused by federal judges. The reorganization, in addition to cutting staff, was supposed to consolidate the department’s 28 divisions into 15 and cut regional offices from 10 to five.Democrats in Congress too have voiced strong alarms about the thousands of HHS job cuts and their adverse impacts on healthcare and science.Ten congressional Democrats led by congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, whose district is home to thousands of NIH and FDA workers, wrote to Kennedy in March demanding the rehiring of thousands of illegally fired workers, warning of the “harmful consequences” for patient healthcare and science research.Raskin told the Guardian that Kennedy and the Trump administration’s actions reveal a “complete disregard for the law making powers of Congress. Trump wants to be both the implementer of the laws and the legislative branch, but that is not his job. It’s totally unconstitutional. They’re trying to cut off funds that have been lawfully appropriated by Congress”.O’Leary and many other medical experts warn that the dangerous ideologically driven cuts at HHS will have long-term consequences.“What we’re seeing across HHS is deeply concerning,” said O’Leary “NIH funding has never been politically or ideologically driven, but clearly that’s what we’re seeing now. Those cuts are going to have serious consequences for our country and healthcare.”Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationUS politicsHealthVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

To qualify, it says the projects should strengthen Canada’s autonomy and security, provide economic “or other” benefits and support the interests ofIndigenous peoples, while meeting Canada’s objectives to tackle the climate crisis.The government has not yet said which projects will be fast-tracked, but the minister responsible for Indigenous relations, Rebecca Alty, said it would consult provinces, territories and Indigenous peoples to agree those suitable.Earlier this week, however, nine First Nations in Ontario communities launched a constitutional challenge against the federal government over Bill C-5, and against the province over similar legislation recently passed there.They allege that unchecked, fast-tracked development which is not subjected to laws and regulations, and which excludes consultation with First Nations on whose land some of the proposed projects will be built, violates the Canadian constitution, which mandates that Indigenous groups be consulted on any decisions that could affect their treaty rights.At the meeting on Thursday, held at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, Carney promised to hundreds of assembled First Nations delegates that new infrastructure would enrich generations of Indigenous peoples, and that First Nations communities affected by any development would be thoroughly consulted.Some leaders expressed cautious optimism at his remarks, but several others told reporters they were frustrated they did not get time to speak to the prime minister or members of his cabinet ministers, and that they felt they were not being listened to.View image in fullscreenMark Carney addresses delegates at the meeting.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockA delegation of First Nations youth also staged a protest, holding signs with slogans including: “We won’t be silenced.”Several First Nations leaders walked out of the meeting after a few hours, saying it was a crude attempt at public relations designed to mitigate the damage the Liberal government had already done in pushing the law through parliament quickly without first consulting Indigenous groups properly.“I don’t even know what this is, but this is not engagement. This is definitely not consultation. I’m speechless,” the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake grand chief Cody Diabo, who was among the leaders who left, told the Canadian Press.Gwii Lok’im Gibuu (Jesse Stoeppler), deputy chief of Hagwilget Village Council in northern British Columbia, told the CBC: “I didn’t have much faith in the process to begin with, and I’m leaving very concerned.”Carney told leaders at the meeting that he was optimistic about finding consensus, but the negative reception could increase pressure on him to urgently repair marred relations with First Nations communities, said Bruce McIvor, an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia who specialises in Indigenous law. Otherwise the government could face more legal challenges or wider protests, he said.“I’m not optimistic based on what this federal government has done to date. It’s more rhetoric and damage control than meaningful engagement with Indigenous people,” said McIvor, who is also a member of the Manitoba Métis Federation.First Nations communities have argued that consultation cannot be meaningful under legislation that is specifically intended to bypass legal obligations in order to build as fast as possible. McIvor noted, however, that the duty to consult Indigenous peoples has been made clear by Canada’s supreme court.“Unfortunately, now, in a rush, the federal government has decided we will abandon those principles,” he said. “What’s required under Canadian law is for the government to engage early on, take as much time as it needs and, importantly, do not simply make a decision and then say ‘trust us’.”Carney has said he will conduct more regional dialogues with First Nations communities this summer. Chief John Powell of the Mamalilikulla First Nation in British Columbia said he had spoken to the prime minster for a few minutes at the meeting, and that he had appeared sincere. He said it was hard, however, to believe the government would keep its promises when First Nations peoples were not consulted before the law was passed.“The fear is they’re going to push through projects,” he said.“After all, we’ve experienced over 150 years of the government being the people who benefit from all of the extraction of what they call our ‘resources’ and what we call our ‘responsibility’.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesShareReuse this content"

A colossal cleanup effort from the surrounding community enabled Camp Camp, a residential program serving youth with disabilities, to welcome visitors again this summer.“Our campers will be able to enjoy our riverfront activities much sooner now,” said Ken Kaiser, the director of facility operations for the camp. “In the midst of heartache, we got to see the best of humanity through these volunteers who came from all overTexasand beyond.”Camp Camp is located in Centre Point, Texas, and offers a series of five-night sleep-away sessions in the summer for children and adults aged five to 55 years old with mild to severe disabilities.The long road to tragedy at the Texas girls camp where floods claimed 27 livesRead moreThe camp welcomes more than 800 campers each summer, and every visitor is given a 1:1 counsellor ratio to accommodate their needs. It has been in operation for 46 years and hosts the same activities as regular camps, including horseback riding, swimming, sports, archery and more.The herculean rehabilitation of the area where Camp Camp is located, a 55-acre property nestled in the Texas hills along the banks of the Guadalupe River, all began with a Facebook post on 8 July from an Austin real estate agent, Cord Shiflet. Debris had covered the landscape, destroying the waterfront and crucial amenities for the camp, including picnic benches for the children to eat at, had been ruined.Shiflet made a plea for “money, manpower, and machines”. By the following day, 250 volunteers arrived. The numbers doubled by Friday, with people braving the mud and conditions to haul food supplies, excavators and chainsaws to the area. Some workers who came down to help reported meeting as many as 1,500 people while they were there.“The energy at Camp Camp was focused, focused on the mission of making it beautiful again,” said Colette Kerns, who drove down with her husband, Jason, to volunteer at the cleanup. “Everyone had a job to do and worked seamlessly together to get it done.”View image in fullscreenVolunteers grab supplies at Camp Camp after catastrophic floods in Center Point, Texas, on 11 July.Photograph: Sergio Flores/ReutersColette’s husband spent five hours a day using a chainsaw to clear fallen trees and debris, while she organized the kitchen area and helped load logs into trucks to be hauled away.The couple, who are parents of two children with special needs, said they understood how vital this camp is to the families who rely on it.“It’s more than just a place,” said Colette. “It is a space where children are embraced, understood and celebrated.”Another hero of the rehabilitation project was Rusty Bourland, who, in numerous Facebook posts about the cleanup, has been praised for his hard work, resilience and determination.Bourland was at a wedding in Dripping Springs, Texas, when he began receiving calls from people seeking assistance in the aftermath of the floods. Having helped with relief work during Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Bill, he had experience in rebuilding. Still, he had no idea when he packed one change of clothes that he would actually be down there for six and a half days. He told his wife he was loading a machine and driving south.View image in fullscreenVolunteers work to clear the area around the Guadalupe River near Camp Camp after catastrophic floods in Center Point, Texas, on 11 July.Photograph: Sergio Flores/Reuters“Driving down it felt unknown,” Bourland said. “We were all being told to not just self-deploy, but nothing compares to this in terms of human devastation.”Bourland, who owns a landscape construction business, said there were days when about 70 machines were on the property. He recalled that the energy was somber as volunteers witnessed many bodies being recovered from the surrounding area. He plans on seeking professional help now that he’s home.“I told everyone, ‘Look, we’re basically faced with the most difficult situation imaginable,’ but as Texans, we try our best to thrive on adversity,” he recounted. “I compartmentalized and tried to keep people positive.”The death toll from the flash floods, which started on the Fourth of July holiday, has now climbed to135 people.With more than 150 people still missing, authorities are warning that the number of casualties could continue to rise.The floods are being described as one of the worst natural disasters in Texas history.The Guadalupe River rose26ftin 45 minutes, and according to a preliminary estimate by the private forecaster AccuWeather, the economic toll of this could range from $18bn to $22bn. The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has since stated that he would allow debate in the Texas legislature on the state’s flood warning system, but has given no guarantees on how the outcome will unfold.For Gigi Hudnall, whose son Kenny was able to attend Camp Camp again this year, the camaraderie in the reopening has been remarkable. This is the 11th year Kenny will have visited, and Hudnall believes the work they did to make this happen was nothing short of miraculous.“It gives these kids something they don’t usually have – freedom,” she said.“When we heard about the floods, our hearts broke, for the lives lost and for the camps. It makes me proud to be among people who care and will give to help kids like my son.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025TexasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We asked artists, designers and historians to weigh in on the attractions that stand the test of timeLois Beckettin Los AngelesSat 19 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 11.01 EDTShareAvisit to Disneyland can be an exhausting experience. The line for a ride can be hours long; there are hordes of overstimulated children and the sheer quantity of gift shops is overwhelming. When the park first opened, on 17 July 1955, an adult ticket cost $1 and kids were 50 cents: now a single day’s entry for one person can easily run $200 or more.Despite all the kitsch and cartoon capitalism, though, Disneyland still delivers moments of actual magic, and that’s largely due to the inventiveness of its theme park rides.Disneyland’s most beloved attractions are not simply rollercoasters or carousels – they’re enduring works of immersive art. Teams of visionary designers and fabricators have collaborated to make and remake these rides over the decades: some popular rides from the park’s opening in 1955, such as the Jungle Cruise and the Mark Twain Riverboat, are still in operation, while thepark’s newest ride, inspired by Tiana, Disney’s first Black princess, opened just months ago.Alongside its beloved mid-century relics, such as Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, Disneyland has constructed new “lands” to woo new fandoms, including a replica of Batuu, the smuggler’s outpost on the Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy, which features new tech and more interactive Star Wars rides.Disneyland’s new work and its seven-decade creative legacy continues to inspire some of today’s leading experience design and immersive theater practitioners.“You could take any single medium from any of these rides and it would most obviously be art – whether it’s sculpture, scenic painting, the sound design, the storytelling,” argues Vince Kadlubek, a co-founder of Meow Wolf, an American art collective that has built interactive art experiences in five cities, including Las Vegas, Nevada, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. But the fact that many of Disney’s rides have been designed with children in mind means their creative merit and ambition is often discounted.“Why is fun not part of art?” Kadlubek asked. “Why is joy and play not a part of art?View image in fullscreenStar Wars fans can visit bars, restaurants and a giant version of the Millennium Falcon in a newly built area of the park.Photograph: Todd Wawrychuk/Disney Parks/PAFelix Barrett, the artistic director of Punchdrunk, a UK-based immersive theater company responsible for transformative hits like Sleep No More, agreed. A Disney ride “is a complete hybrid of all the disciplines, and will deploy everything simultaneously”, Barrett said. And with an amusement park ride “you’re feeling alive in a way you very rarely are when you experience single-discipline art, because you’re physically present”.Even the long wait times for Disneyland rides have been turned into opportunities for creative innovation, Barrett noted. Disney’s “mastery of queue design”, particularly on newer rides, is an inspiration: “It’s not just about the ride, it’s about the anticipation building up to that ride.”The park turned 70 this week, and to mark the occasion we talked to artists, designers and historians about five of Disneyland’s greatest artistic masterpieces, and why these rides continue to inspire new generations of storytellers.It’s a Small World (1964)It’s a Small World is a placid ride, without big thrills or surprises: visitors sit in small boats and glide past arrangements of animatronic figures dressed as children from cultures around the world. The ride’s tinkling theme song plays overhead.View image in fullscreenThe exterior of the It’s A Small World ride at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/APBut six decades after it first premiered as part of the 1964 World’s Fair, the ride still has long lines. The mid-century aesthetic of the ride’s building, scenes and characters, is mesmerizing in its detail. Mary Blair, the concept artist for Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, designed the look of the ride and chose its bold colors; Rolly Crump designed its gleaming tower and the Sherman brothers, who wrote many of Disney’s hits, composed its signature song, with major feedback from Walt Disney himself.The rides’ themes of youthful innocence and longing for global cooperation still resonate, said Bethanee Bemis, who curated an exhibit at the Smithsonian and wrote a book on thereflection of American history in Disney’s parks. “All children share the universal language of play,” Bemis said.Today, some of the cultural symbols chosen in the 1960s may read as racial or ethnic stereotypes: there is a snake charmer in one scene, and crocodiles and hyenas in an African tableau. Disneyland has tried to strike a balance between preserving the ride as a nostalgic time capsule and meeting more contemporary expectations about cultural representation, Bemis said. Some of its most successful updates have been adding new touches of cultural authenticity, like including traditional parol lanterns during the Christmas season for Filipino visitors.Pirates of the Caribbean (1967)Long before it inspired the early 2000s film franchise, Pirates of the Caribbeanwas a standalone ride – one that put visitors in a boat and sent them on a seafaring journey. The ride is the last one that Walt Disney worked on himself – and it’s ambitious, both in the quality of its audio-animatronic pirate figures and its narrative sweep – not to mention the engineering challenge of digging the tunnels underground necessary to build the ride, Bemis said.View image in fullscreenThe Pirates of the Caribbean Ride at Disneyland in 1968.Photograph: Dean Conger/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe experience begins gently, with riders drifting through the dusk of a bayou and listening to a banjo play. Then the boats descend into darkness, and with a sudden drop, emerge into the dangerous world of the pirates where cannonballs fly overhead, ships glide past cities on fire and pirate crews fight and carouse onshore.While the ride has been updated with details from the more recent film franchise – such as animatronic figures made to look like Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp’s character in the films – what makes it work is the attention to the ride’s fundamentals, designers said, from the pirate costumes that the ride attendants wear, to the temperature at different phases of the ride: humid and warm in the bayou, and then chilly when riders plummet into the skeleton-filled “Davey Jones’ locker” under the sea. “Somehow, they have manipulated the environment to set mood and tone through temperature and humidity control,” said Noah Nelson, the publisher of No Proscenium, a publication that covers the US immersive experience design industry. He called the technique “super effective”.“Every single aspect of these rides has been designed with the most care and attention. I don’t think we go inside a lot of places like that these days,” said Jeff Stark, who teaches a course on design for narrative space at New York University. “The craftsmanship that you encounter inside of Disney – the level of thought, of preparation – matches what it is like to go inside a cathedral.

The tower appears to grow to uncanny heights, as the oil paintings of ancient dignitaries on the walls expand to reveal their deaths. “We have 999 happy haunts, but there’s room for a thousandth,” a deep voice asks. “Any volunteers?”The ghostly figures and spooky tricks of Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion were created in the 1960s, and they’re decidedly low-tech, made with old-fashioned smoke-and-mirror devices likePepper’s Ghost. That only makes the ride more appealing, said Kathryn Yu, a Los Angeles-based game designer. “In a world that’s increasingly digital, it is charming to see these physical effects in person.”View image in fullscreenView of parkgoers waiting in line to enter the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland, Anaheim, California, February 1980.Photograph: Scott McPartland/Getty ImagesAs candles flicker, visitors are led through the dark halls to the tombstone-shaped “doom buggies” that will whisk them through one haunted scene after another: a ghostly banquet hall, a seance, a graveyard. Many Disneyland’s first “imagineers” came from backgrounds in animation, “so they really understood cinematography, and the perspective of the audience as a camera”, Yu said. In The Haunted Mansion, as in the Pirates ride, the designers packed each spooky vignette with “character development, backstory, an emotional connection to one of the ghosts”.One of the famous moments in the Haunted Mansion is when the “doom buggies” swing backwards before descending into the graveyard, putting viewers on suddenly their backs, staring upwards at skeletal branches, as if they themselves are being lowered into a grave. In creating Punchdrunk’s latest experience,Viola’s Room, a gothic mystery now playing in New York, the British team repeatedly referenced Disney rides, Barrett said, including discussing how to create theatrical surprises that would affect viewers’ bodies in the same way as a sudden drop in a roller coaster. (One tactic they’re trying is asking visitors to go through the experience barefoot.)View image in fullscreenA ghostly new bride in the attic of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland Park.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/Disneyland ResortRadiator Springs Racers (2012)The 2006 cartoon movie Cars, a toddler favorite, might not seem like the most inspirational source material for an immersive work of art. But Radiator Springs Racers,Disneyland’s Cars-inspired ride, is massive in its ambition: it’s nothing short of a full recreation of the red rock spires of the American south-west, complete with native plants and the replica neon-lined main street of a small desert town. (At a reported $200m, it was also the most expensive Disneyland ride at the time it was built).If you visit Zion national park in Utah or Monument Valley in Arizona after seeing Radiator Springs Racers, Bemis, the Smithsonian curator, said, “You feel like you’ve already seen the real thing.”View image in fullscreenVisitors ride on the Radiator Springs Racers inside Disneyland, in Anaheim, California.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe ride taps deeply into the American nostalgia for Historic Route 66 in the 1950s, Bemis said, an era of nostalgia that came too late for Walt Disney himself to appreciate, but that strikes a chord with the park’s other tributes to small-town American life.“It’s really stunning work,” said Kadlubek, the Meow Wolf artist. While the ride ends with a shriek-inducing car race and includes plenty of interaction with fast-talking cartoon automobiles, it begins with a more contemplative cruise through the faux desert landscape. “There’s this really beautiful romanticism to it,” Kadlubek said.Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance (2019)The most popular new ride in Disneyland’s new Star Wars-themed area “surpasses everything that’s been attempted before” in experience design, Kadlubek argued, calling it “ambitious to a pretty absurd degree”.The ride is set in a newly built area of the park, Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge, that allows movie fans to visit a replica of the battered frontier planet of Batuu. There are bars, restaurants, a giant version of the Millennium Falcon and Storm Troopers who stalk the streets, occasionally interrogating visitors. Several designers who are Star Wars fans said the atmosphere feels eerily like being inside the films: Nelson said he’s sometimes content just to sit in the replica Docking Bay 7, listening to audio of space ships streaming overhead, and drinking a cup of “Caf,” as coffee is known in the Star Wars universe. “My first time stepping into it, I felt like I came home,” he said.View image in fullscreenA boy walks past 50 Stormtroopers on a Star Destroyer inside Disneyland in Anaheim, California.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty ImagesRise of the Resistance tells an elaborate story that begins in the waiting line, where visitors are treatedas new recruits to the resistance against the villainous First Order. After an early mission goes awry, they are taken captive. Costumed actors playing members of the First Order mock them while marching them off to an interrogation cell: members of the resistance have to break them out of prison, then lead them on a wild escape journey. The process of moving the visitors into the experience, and even getting them into the “transports” they ride in, is deeply embedded in narrative.“It goes from being a 3-minute ride to this 20-minute long saga. They really reinvented what we would expect from a ride,” Stark said.Under pressure from Harry Potter world at Universal Studios, Stark said, Disney introduced newer ride technology in Rise of the Resistance, leaning heavily on trackless ride vehicles, which are programmed to move the visitors through space without physical rails, creating new opportunities for ride tricks and surprises.But like the best early rides, what makes Rise of the Resistance thrilling is the accumulation of tiny details, Stark said, like the moment when “the sparks from Kylo Ren’s lightsaber are showering around you, and you feel like you’re in this moment of threat”.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Thursday Colberttold his audienceat the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York that his popular late night TV show is being cancelled. “Yeah, I share your feelings,” he said in response to a chorus of boos.The CBS network insisted that it had made “a purely financial decision” to wind up The Late Show next year. But others are not so sure. Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator who was a guest on Thursday’s show,tweeted: “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”The end of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy | Jesse HassengerRead moreThere are reasonable grounds for suspicion. Earlier this month CBS’s owner, Paramount Global, reached a$16m settlement with Trumpover an interview on its current affairs strand 60 Minutes, removing a potential obstacle to the company’s $8bn sale to the Hollywood studio Skydance Media.If the mega-merger goes ahead, a friend and ally of the US president, the billionaire Larry Ellison, could wield huge influence over the CBS news division as well as programmes ranging from South Park to Star Trek. The Late Show is sure to be seen by some as an example ofobeying in advance.Among those sounding the alarm isMarvin Kalb, the last correspondent personally hired at CBS by Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism whose defiance of McCarthyism was recounted in the film and playGood Night, and Good Luck. Now 95, Kalb perceives the Skydance takeover as a threat to CBS’s journalistic independence and moral integrity – and fears that this time it will buckle.Speaking by phone from his home near Washington, Kalb said:“In my judgment it means that CBS, starting with60 Minutes, will be under a tighter editorial control than it has ever been. The idea that 60 Minutes will be able to continue to do virile, unafraid reporting on Trump may be coming to an end.”The Murrow protege, who spent 24 years atCBSNews, warns that the network could drift in the direction of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News, which often parrots Trump’s talking points. “I’m afraid that CBS News will become a little Fox, that it will begin to be timid in the way in which it approaches any possibly critical story about the president.“Just as you rarely see or hear anything on Fox that is critical of Trump, likewise it may very well end up that CBS will be essentially in the same position, and that is huge loss for those who still favour freedom of the press and who still favour a vigorous, unafraid press.”Speaking on Tuesday, before the news about The Late Show broke, Kalb expressed concern about the future of the late-night comedians whose caustic, bullshit-detector political satire has earned Trump’s wrath in the past. Jon Stewart, whose current contract expires in December, and Colberthave both mercilessly skewered Paramount for caving in to Trump.View image in fullscreenThe correspondents of CBS News’s 60 Minutes.Photograph: Jai Lennard/CBS via Getty Images“My gut feeling would be that Colbert’s contract, when it comes up, will simply not be renewed, and they will find a humourist who is pro-Trump,” Kalb said presciently.“Those are the kinds of programmes that, in a humorous way, tend to either criticise or make fun of Trump – and he doesn’t like that.”The former host of NBC’s Meet the Press who isEdward R Murrow professor of practice, emeritusat the Harvard Kennedy School continued: “He has already taken action against the press, starting from his first term with ‘fake news’ and ‘fake media’. He has already gone a long way toward diminishing the once virile press – I keep using that word because I’m thinking about people who are not afraid, people who are open minded, fair-minded journalists who are simply covering the news.“If the news happens to be unfavourable with respect to the president, so be it. But if the president doesn’t like it, he’s going to make his views known. I think if there were a serious study done even up to this point on the last five or six months, I believe you would see an initial, perhaps reluctant timidity come into the coverage of news concerning Trump.”Trump filed a $10bn lawsuit against CBS last October, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on 60 Minutes with the then vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election.In an amended complaint filed in February, Trump bumped his claim for damages to $20bn. CBS initially called the lawsuit “completely without merit”, a view shared by many legal experts, and sought to have it dismissed.But then the company entered into mediation in an attempt to placate Trump as Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, sought to close the $8bn merger with Skydance, which needs federal government approval. The CBS News head, Wendy McMahon, and 60 Minutes executive producerBill Owens quitover Paramount’s handling of the showdown.When Paramount reached the out-of-court settlement, it insisted that the $16m would go towards Trump’s future presidential library, rather than to him personally, and it would not be issuing an apology. But critics saw it as the starkest example yet of Trump’s ability to intimidate major institutions including the media.Rome Hartman, one of the producers of the Harris segment, who retired from CBS News and 60 Minutes last month for unrelated reasons, said in a phone interview: “The motive of this lawsuit was clearly harassment and intimidation and the decision by Paramount’s leaders to succumb to that harassment and intimidation was an absolute betrayal. It’s a shameful betrayal of the hardworking people at 60 Minutes and at CBS News.”View image in fullscreenShari Redstone, the chair of Paramount Global.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersDespite Trump’s pressure campaign, 60 Minutes has continued to produce unflinching reports on his administration’s immigration crackdown, assault on federal government departments and other issues. Now its staff are bracing for a change of ownership and potentially different approach.Hartman continues: “Now everyone is hoping that the new corporate parents will allow 60 Minutes to operate with the independence that it has always enjoyed. That’s not a just-because-we-want-it sort of thing; that’s because the independence and editorial voice of 60 Minutes is one of the reasons it has lasted as long as it has and it has the amazing reputation that it has for over half a century. We were betrayed by one corporate parent and they hope that will not be repeated by the new folks.“We are living in a moment of real peril for free voices and independent journalism, even independent commentary, as would be the case with Stewart and Colbert. These guys are businessmen in the end, and I hope they see that to maintain longstanding principles of independence and free speech is not just in their interest morally but in their interest economically.”Skydance was founded in 2010 by Larry Ellison’s son David.According to its website, David, who is a pilot, came up with the name as a reference to flying aerobatics known as “skydancing” and its promise of limitless possibilities. It has produced films including the Tom Cruise vehicles Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission: Impossible franchise.But although David is the public face of Skydance, his father Larry will be the power behind the throne at Paramount, according to an organisational chartobtained by the New York Timeslast year. The co-founder of software company Oracle is one of the world’s wealthiest men anda friend of Trump, who has touted Ellison as a potential buyer of TikTok.Bill Carter, the author of four books about television, says: “Both of the Ellisons seem to be close to Trump, and Trump will basically use any leverage he can. That’s what he does, and he has been given the power to do it pretty much across the board here.“The speculation is that they’ll install somebody who is at least somewhat willing to take his side in a future controversy, which means there’s very likely to be some kind of chilling effect on the news division, and especially at 60 Minutes, because they have basically defied him even after this.”Last weekthe New York Times reportedthat David Ellison had held talks about acquiring the Free Press, an online publication co-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics. Discussions include Weiss “taking on an influential role in shaping the editorial sensibilities of CBS News”, the paper added, though probably not in a managerial capacity.Journalist Mehdi Hasan responded to the report about Weissby tweeting: “RIP CBS News.”Paul Farhi, a former media reporter at the Washington Post, said: “She’s an opinion journalist and always has been, and that’s not the person you want running a news division or having a prominent role in the news division. You want someone who actually knows or upholds the tradition of straight-up reporting that CBS has stood for its entire existence.”Farhi added: “I suspect at the end of it he’ll discover that CBS News wouldn’t be too crazy about having her, but it’ll be a real test of his intentions, if he has any intentions at all, for CBS News. If he brings in someone like her, it will signal a direction and will be a sign of we’re not going to do things the way we’ve done in the past.“But I think it’s more likely that he won’t do anything that’s going to be radical in terms of CBS News. For one thing, CBS News is a very small part of the overall Paramount enterprise that she’s buying. It’s not a big profit centre. At the end of the day I suspect we won’t be talking about this topic once the merger is done, simply because CBS News is not out of control.”View image in fullscreenA still from South Park.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyBut other parts of the Paramount forest are already in revolt. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of the long-running animated sitcom South Park,have accusedthe incoming Paramount president, Jeff Shell, of meddling in contract negotiations for streaming rights to the show, allegedly to benefit Paramount+ at their expense.This has caused disruption to production schedules including a delay for South Park’s 27th season. Parker and Stonewrote on social mediaearlier this month: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”Stewart and Colbert have also been pushing back. Stewart used a Daily Show monologue to tear into Paramount’s settlement, interrupted by a spoof ad for the fast-food chain Arby’s that said: “For when you want a sandwich commensurate with your company’s shame.” Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” and even alluded to speculation about his own job security, pointing to a moustache he grew on holiday and quipping: “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert if they can’t find him?”The timing of the decision to axe him raised eyebrows in Washington. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday: “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just three days after Colbert called out CBS owner Paramount for its $16m settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”Speaking before the announcement, Carter, author of The Late Shift and executive producer of theCNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, said: “It would be pretty obvious to anybody looking at this situation if they decided to eliminate those guys that it would be for political reasons because they’re obviously outspoken and have a big audience listening to them and it gets under Trump’s skin.“But it’s scary to think that’s something that could happen in America, that a president could basically eliminate a voice of protest against him. It would be like [President Richard] Nixon getting rid of the editorial cartoonists who were criticising him overWatergate. I would not put it past Trump to try to do it.“I do think that if you’re David Ellison, it’s a terrible look.If you’re in Ellison’s shoes, you have to know this will brand you as another person who’s basically giving the knee toDonald Trump. A lot of these guys don’t care because they have other agendas. But it is a thing to live with if you’re going to be branding yourself that way.”Explore more on these topicsCultureParamount PicturesCBSSouth ParkUS televisionDonald TrumpTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Heckerling had burst on to the scene a decade earlier with Fast Times at Ridgemont High, a groundbreaking coming-of-age comedy of libidinous teens, and scored a surprise box office hit with 1989’s Look Who’s Talking. But she was struggling to fit Hollywood demands. “I was thinking: ‘Oh, I’m never going to make a film that’s what I want it to be, because you can’t have protagonists that are female, you have to do slob comedies, but there’s only a few actors that they accept in those roles, and you don’t get a chance to work with them if you’re a female,’” Heckerling told me recently.With little interest in catering to the prevailing tastes of the day, Heckerling went back to the drawing board: what didshewant to write? A true native New Yorker with the accent to match, Heckerling “gravitated towards darker stuff” – early gangster movies, David Lynch. But she was most amused by “people who are very optimistic and happy. I just think, how the hell did they get that way?” Like the main character in the 1994 movie Ed Wood, perpetually pleased with his mediocre work, or the star of Gentleman Prefer Blondes (the book), sending herself flowers to stir the jealousy of men around her. She envisioned a woman in a “big, pink bubble that can’t be burst”, convinced of her centrality but still winsome, relentlessly positive and naive. Someone like Cher Horowitz, the most impeccably dressed 16-year-old in America, hapless social matchmaker of Beverly Hills’ Bronson Alcott high school and the lead of Heckerling’s movieClueless.Clueless review – Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy are class acts in 90s Jane Austen parallelRead moreClueless, released 30 years ago on 19 July, remains a seminal teen comedy, the kind that immediately and indelibly stamps the culture. The instantly recognizable yellow plaid suit? “Whateverrrr?”As ifyou could escape its cultural legacy. A loose adaptation of Jane Austen’s 1815 novel Emma, Clueless reinvigorated the stagnantteen moviegenre that flourished for the rest of the decade.10 Things I Hate About You,Mean Girls,Easy A– the teen comedy staples of my teenage years in the late 2000s – live in the shadow of Clueless, which played almost daily on at least one cable channel after school. “There are very few movies in history that have lasted 30 years with that kind of intensity, with that kind of a broad appeal to generations,”Mona May, the film’s totally important costume designer, told me. “It’s truly beloved.”“It’s bright heartwarming and joyful – smart, funny and satirical in a way that still resonates,” said the film’s star,Alicia Silverstone, via email. “There is something about Amy’s take on youth culture and coming-of-age stories that is timeless.”There are very few movies in history that have lasted 30 years with that kind of intensity, with that kind of a broad appeal to generationsMona May, costume designerIt also barely made it out of pre-production. Finding a studio home for Heckerling’s script was, as Cher would say, “like searching for a boy in high school ... as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie”. Heckerling first developed what she thought would be a TV series at 20th Century Fox, with the support of an executive named Elizabeth Gabler. She delivered the feature script to Fox along with a VHS tape she recorded off MTV of Aerosmith’s music video for Cryin’, featuring a young, blond, radiant actor named Alicia Silverstone. They passed. Heckerling’s agent, Ken Stovitz, then doggedly shopped the idea around town, to no avail. The protagonists were female; “Clueless” sounded too much like underperforming films on young slackers; studio brass thought Heckerling’s still distinctive amalgamation of Valley speak, teenage slang and personal inspirations (the trademark “as if!” came from “my gay friends in their 30s”) wouldn’t translate to a wide audience. “The entire industry said no,” Heckerling recalled.Except for Scott Rudin, the prolific, andprolificallyvolatile, film and theater producer, whose support ignited a bidding war. “Usually I’d write something for some people and it would go where it was or we’d go to other people that might be interested,” Heckerling said. “But never, ‘we all hate it, now we all love it.’” And that’s show business – “it’s stupid,” Heckerling laughed, “but I love it.”With the backing of Paramount, Heckerling and casting director Marcia Ross began their search for actors to play the most stylish high-schoolers in the US, including some unsuccessful sessions shadowing real students at high schools in Beverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley. (“These kids walked around in these baggy clothes. They look just looked hopeless,” said Heckerling, though they perhaps inspired Cher’s disdain for high school boys “in baggy pants and oversized T-shirts looking like schlemiels – bleurgh”.) Heckerling first met with Silverstone at a cafe and was won over by, of all things, how she leaned her body over a cup to use the straw rather than pick it up, a move that reminded her of her eight-year-old daughter. “When I first saw the Cryin’ video, my initial reaction was: ‘Oh, she’s a hot chick,’” said Heckerling. But after the first meeting, it was: “‘Oh, I want to take care of her.’” She connected with her vision for Cher – a girl who “thinks she’s all that and she’s acting like a grownup who knows everything, but there’s a child in her”.Stacey Dash, a 25-year-old from New York, won the part of Dionne, Cher’s relatively moreexperiencedbest friend. Dash “was much more savvy already”, May, the costume designer, recalled. “She was sassy.” To play Josh, Cher’s intellectual, very undergrad-y stepbrother-turned-love interest, the team cast a fresh-faced actor namedPaul Rudd. And for the “clueless” Tai, a homely new kid Cher mentors – and misleads – as part of her initiative of “good deeds”, Ross found a 17-year-old newcomer namedBrittany Murphy. “Everybody loved her,” said Heckerling. Peppy, open-hearted, eager to help, Murphy was always the frontrunner for Tai, though she wasn’t confident in her chances. After a chemistry read with Silverstone, “Alicia was trying to tell me: ‘Oh my God, it has to be her,’” Heckerling recalled. “And I was already like: ‘Yeah, we know.’”View image in fullscreenAlicia Silverstone in Clueless.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarFilming commenced in November 1994, and proceeded over 40 days inLos Angeleslike “a well-oiled machine”, said Elisa Donovan, who played Cher’s haute couture-loving frenemy Amber. (Cher’s assessment: “Do you prefer fashion victim or ensemble-y challenged?”) Fresh to LA with just a few TV credits, Donovan walked on to her first film set and “thought: oh, this is how movies work. Brilliant women write them and direct them. They’re in charge. They’re the ones who hire all the right people. They tell everyone what to do in like a fun and kind, but firm way. They know what they’re doing.” (On subsequent sets, she “learned pretty quickly that this was highly unusual”.)Key to this environment was the partnership between Heckerling and May, who assembled the entire wardrobe for the film – 63 designer looks for Silverstone, 45 changes for the other principal actors, and all the extras’ outfits – for a budget of about $200,000 (about $413,000 today). “Amy is an amazing writer,” said May. “She wrote the blueprint for me – high school, Beverly Hills, rich girls, high fashion.” But in 1994, “everybody was wearing grunge,” not Alaïa – a Parisian designer May had to personally beg, via French translator, for the iconic red party dress, as they were out of money; the designer loaned it – May designed the peacocking feather jacket to complete the look – and got name-checked in the script.May took clues from runway shows, sourcing looks from department stores, old collection books and magazines. The characters “had Daddy’s credit cards, they could go shopping at the runway shows in Paris or Milan or wherever”, said May, but the clothes had to communicate “real girls that then you can emulate and love” – elevated and chic, but also youthful, fun and innocent. Such as, say, a yellow plaid Jean-Paul Gaultier blazer May pulled off the rack at a department store, the third choice behind a blue and red riff on the classic Catholic school uniform. (Yellow is “a tricky color”, Heckerling noted. “It’s sunshine, but it’s also jaundice.”) Blue didn’t work, red was too Christmas. But the yellow one on Silverstone was a goosebumps moment – “Oh my God, this is Cher,” said May. “She’s the queen bee.”It was through the clothes that Silverstone, then 18, transformed from budding environmental activist into airheaded, but well-meaning, Beverly Hills queen. “She was already saving animals and walking around in her sweatpants and flip-flops with two dogs in tow into the fitting. She was not Cher in real life,” May recalled. Silverstone confirms: “I was not one bit interested in fashion at that time personally, and my usual outfit was jeans and my favorite green T-shirt.” But, “I looked at Cher as being extremely confident and having a deep, healthy love of herself.”It’s bright heartwarming and joyful – smart, funny and satirical in a way that still resonatesAlicia SilverstoneThe set, overall, was “just really fun and vibrant”, Donovan recalled. “It was all magic,” said May. “Amy is such a great director – she opened us up, she’s very collaborative, she’s very encouraging.” Silverstone, as the star, was a bit more circumspect: “I was in almost every scene, so I was working hard and taking the role seriously. When I hear about all the fun the other actors had, I get whatever the past tense of Fomo is.”Filming wrapped at the end of 1994, and Clueless hit theaters seven months later, becoming an instant hit among the target audience – something quickly clear to Donovan, who was swarmed by a group of teens at a mall a fews weeks after release. It took longer for Heckerling to catch on. “I didn’t feel like it was like a big [hit] at the time,” she said. “I have friends that are [male] movie directors, and they have hits that are gigantic. I mean, Animal House and Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, those are big money-making movies. And Clueless did not make that much. It was a hit, but it wasn’t in every theater like that.”But it did catch on, winning fans on the then booming home video market and launching an endless tradition of Cher Halloween costumes. “You always hope your movie is a hit,” said May, who went on to design costumes for Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion, Enchanted, The House Bunny and more. “Every film-maker will say that, but you just never know. It has to just be the right moment and the right time and the right culture. And this was all right.”View image in fullscreenStacey Dash and Alicia Silverstone in Clueless.Photograph: Cinetext/Paramount/AllstarIn true Hollywood fashion, the industry took some of the wrong lessons – instead of focusing on how the movie worked, or greenlighting more female directors, it spawned countless imitators. Afterwards, “it wasn’t like: ‘Oh boy, here come all the great scripts,’” said Heckerling. It was: “Here’s the script that’s this classic for teenagers, or that classic, but with teenagers.“They only think you can do what’s been done,” she added. “It’s like they needed a big insurance policy. Movies are expensive, so they only want to make sure that if you did Emma in high school, why don’t you do Persuasion in high school?”Do we really want Clueless updated to reflect our dark, digital age? Ugh! As if! | Kate MaltbyRead moreAlso in true Hollywood fashion, Clueless has become valuable IP – the basis for a spinoff TV show with Dash and Donovan that ran from 1996 to 1997; aWest End stage show; and an upcoming, still vagueadaptationwith Peacock from The OC and Gossip Girl creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, with Silverstone set to reprise her role. Heckerling, an executive producer, declined to offer any details, citing prematurity and a well-earned development superstition.The 30th anniversary once again brings up the original film’s still remarkable singularity, as well as the stark absence of Murphy, who died at the age of 32, igniting years of intense media speculation. “I always think about Brittany and it’s really hard to do any of this and not talk about her,” said Donovan. “She was so talented and just had so much energy and so vibrant … just this hummingbird, frenetic sort of energy, but also like, ‘everything’s great. I got it. No problem.’”With the anniversary events, “It makes me emotional because I feel like she should be doing a lot of this, like she would be doing a lot of this,” she added. But the milestone – the kids of Clueless now old enough to have their own headstrong high-schoolers – offers an opportunity to remember, as Heckerling put it, “the goofy fun of it all”.“People come up to me and say: ‘Your designs changed my life,’” said May. “To hear that in your lifetime, that something that you created has had an impact on people? It’s incredible.”Explore more on these topicsCluelessComedy filmsTeen moviesJane AustenComedyBrittany MurphyPaul RuddfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The programme, conducted bySakari Oramowith the BBC Symphony Orchestra, felt oddly disparate. The main works were theSibeliusViolin Concerto with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist, and Vaughan Williams’s oratorio Sancta Civitas, a comparative rarity. There was new music, too, the world premiere of The Elements byErrollyn Wallen, Master of the King’s Music. Oramo opened, however, with Arthur Bliss’s Birthday Fanfare for Sir Henry Wood, before segueing, without pause, into Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, the latter most beautifully done, with finely focussed strings and woodwind, but something of a jolt after Bliss’s jaunty little piece for brass and timpani in honour of the Proms’ founder.Wallen’s new work, meanwhile, didn’t feel entirely successful. The Proms Guide argues that it explores the “periodic table of orchestral elements” that form the basis of composition, though Wallen writes, in her own programme note, that its prime concern is “the fundamentals of music, life and love.” It’s cast in a single-three section movement, the first dark and gritty, the second poised, elegant and sounding like Ravel, the third ringing changes on music from Purcell’s The Fairy Queen. But it never coheres, and the Purcell quotes just leave you longing for the original.The Sibelius, however, was unquestionably magnificent. Oramo conducted Batiashvili’s first ever performance of the concerto when she was 16, they’ve given it together many times together since, and you really sense the almost instinctive give and take that comes from a fine collaboration. Though technically astonishing, Batiashvili never sounded showy, and the big first movement cadenza was all about musical logic rather than display. Oramo – always wonderful in Sibelius – gave us understated drama and intensity in the first two movements, before releasing the edgy mood into the exhilaration of the finale.View image in fullscreenTenor Caspar Singh sings alongside the bust of Proms founder Sir Henry Wood.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCVaughan Williams’s choral depiction of the Holy City as described in the Book of Revelation, meanwhile, has never struck me as the masterpiece that some claim it to be, though you couldn’t fault the fervour or grandeur of Oramo’s interpretation. The choral singing – from the combined forces of the BBC Symphony Chorus, BBC Singers and members of London Youth Choirs – was all fierce exaltation and rapture. Gerald Finley was the visionary baritone, Caspar Singh the excellent tenor, making much of the precious little Vaughan Williams gives him.Watch onBBC iPlayer, orlisten again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

On one side were those who admired his indefatigable research into 18th- and 19th-century performance practice, and the ways in which he deployed the results in his work with the period instruments of the London Classical Players, often extending the idea of historically informed performance beyond its then restricted field of the classical era into the orchestral music of Schumann, Berlioz, Brahms and Wagner. On the other side were those who viewed Norrington’s “experiments” as at best eccentric and at worst as profoundly destructive, especially when he carried over those ideas, such as his hatred of string vibrato, into his work with the many traditional symphony orchestras that he conducted throughout his career.Both those aspects of his conducting life are well represented in the many recordings – well over 100 - that Norrington made. Another significant aspect of his work, as an opera conductor (especially in the 1970s and early 1980s with Britain’s first regional opera company, KentOpera, of which he was the founding music director) is less well represented however and in this selection of Norrington’s recordings, the Don Giovanni, a later product, has to stand for that important contribution.Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony – London Classical Players (1987)Norrington’s cycle of Beethoven’s symphonies, overtures and concertos, all recorded on the period instruments of the London Classical Players is perhaps the best known of all his recording ventures.Wagner Overtures - London Classical Players (1990)Even today period-instrument performances of Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler are not exactly commonplace, but when Norrington made his pioneering recordings in the 1990s they really were unexplored territory.Mozart’s Don Giovanni – London Classical Players (1993)Norrington’s two Mozart sets with the London Classical Players – this Don Giovanni and a Zauberflöte released the following year, were very much trail-blazers when they were recorded over three decades ago.Vaughan Williams’s London Symphony – London Philharmonic Orchestra (2000)British music was another of Norrington’s enthusiasms, and his cycle of the Vaughan Williams symphonies, as well as recordings of Elgar, were much admired.Mahler’s Symphony No 5 – SWR Radio Symphony Stuttgart (2006)From 1998 to 2011 Norrington was principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio orchestra, and made a whole range of recordings of mainstream repertoire with it, including a complete Mahler cycle.Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique – Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (2013)The London Classical Players were dissolved in 1997 and its dates taken over by the OAE, with which Norrington continued to appear occasionally until he retired in 2021.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The conductor Sir Roger Norrington, whose death was announced yesterday at the age of 91, remains still the maverick presence that classical music needs. His mission wasn’t only to make us hear the repertoire we thought it knew through the prism of the techniques and playing styles of its time, rather than the ossifications of later traditions. He was also an irresistible firebrand in performance, whose energy wasn’t only about inspiring his performers to get closer to the music they were playing, it was also an invitation to his audiences that their listening should be involved too. Norrington wanted everyone to feel the urgency of Beethoven’s rhetorical power and rudeness, from the radiance of one of his favourite pieces, the Missa Solemnis, to the emetic contrabassoon in the finale of the Ninth Symphony, which was always the richest of raspberries in his performances and recordings.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Haydn’s symphonies, particularly, were pieces of participative performance art in Norrington’s hands, in which his delight in sharing the radical humour and jaw-dropping discontinuities of the music was so evident. The conductor would turn round to his listeners - especially in the Prommers in the arena of the Royal Albert Hall in one of his 42 appearances at the Proms - to make sure we all realised just how weird and wonderful this music really was.The revelations of hearing Norrington’s historically informed musical mission in action defined an era, along with his fellow iconoclasts, such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Christopher Hogwood and John Eliot Gardiner, all of whom founded ensembles of period instruments, like Norrington’s London Classical Players, and took the lessons they had learnt therein to transform the sound world of modern instrument orchestras. Norrington’s work with theStuttgart Radio SymphonyOrchestra is the sound of his later legacy in action, in Brahms,Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, and Elgar, as well as Beethoven and Mozart.But Norrington’s distinctiveness was his unshakeable belief that there was a right way to play Beethoven – and a wrong one. He was also completely committed to his idea that the curse ofvibratowas an aberration in performances of all music composed before the early 20th century, whether Bach to Mahler. While his vibrato-free performances brought astonishing moments – listen to the opening of the slow movement of Bruckner’s sixth symphony, and connected music from across the centuries, it was an experiment that didn’t catch on.He wasn’t a musician trying to return to the past. Instead he was going back to find a musical future.Or at least it hasn’t yet. Norrington’s many crusades for the right tempo and textures in Beethoven’s symphonies, for the clarity and directness of drama in Bach’s Passions, for the transparency of sound world in Wagner and Debussy, have had repercussions across the whole of classical music, even with conductors and orchestras who might not think they’re working under his influence. Norrington’s decades-long mission to wean musical culture off the drug of vibrato may yet have its day.And his work remains fresh and thrilling. His Beethoven recordings with theLondon Classical Players- all the symphonies, and the piano concertos with Melvyn Tan, from the 1980s - are as impishly radical as ever. The paradox of Norrington’s performances is that what seemed like austerity and ideology was in fact a generous invitation to re-hear the incendiary meanings and power of music that had been taken for granted for too long.View image in fullscreenSir Roger Norrington conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 2008.Photograph: Jon Crwys-Williams/PANorrington was associated with what used to be called “authenticity” in the performance of 17th, 18th, and 19th century repertoires. But he was too intelligent to believe that what he was doing was a mere restoration job or a return to a sound world of Mozart’s or Beethoven’s time - something that can never truly be recaptured. He wasn’t a musician trying to return to the past. Instead he was going back to find a musical future. The sound of his recordings is the sound of the indelible imagination of all those composers he loved being released in all their rapier wit, sublimity and delirium into our time.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then Trump got back into power ... Is it time to move again?Gary ShteyngartSat 19 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTShareOh, to have been born in a small, stylish country with good food and favourable sea breezes. No empire, no holy faith, no condescension, no fatal ideologies. The fish is grilled, the extended family roll in on their scooters, the wine looks amber in its glass as the socially democratic sun begins its plunge into the sparkling waters below.This was not my fortune. I was born to one dying superpower and am now living in another. I was born to an ideology pasted all over enormous granite buildings in enormous Slavic letters and now live in one where the same happens in bold caps on what was once Twitter and what purports to be Truth (Pravda?) Social. America, Russia. Russia, America. Together they were kind enough to give me the material from which I made a decent living as a writer, but they took away any sense of normality, any faith that societies can provide lives without bold-faced slogans, bald-faced lies, leaders with steely set jaws, and crusades against phantom menaces, whether Venezuelan or Ukrainian.I have written dystopian fiction before, and my latest novel, Vera, or Faith, is a continuation of the natural outcome of my birth in Leningrad and my removal, at age seven, to Reagan’s America. I think I have predicted the future with fairly good aim in novels such asSuper Sad True Love Story, where social media helps to give rise to a fascist America, although my timeline when that book was published in 2010 was 30 years into the future, not a decade and change.I imagined that Russia would become more like America over the years – instead, the opposite happenedBut before I wrote that book, there was a period of some optimism where, I confess, I got things terribly wrong. I imagined, in my least cynical moments, that Russia would become more like America over the years, or at the least more habituated to pluralism and the rule of law. Of course, the very opposite happened. America is becoming Russia with every day. The tractors I would watch on Soviet television leading to ever more heroic harvests are nowtariffsthat will bring manufacturing back to our land. The dissidents who were the Soviet enemy within are now the vastly fictionalisedTren de Aragua gangmembers who supposedly terrorise our land, and indeed all migrants deemed insufficiently Afrikaner. Politicians in all countries lie, but the Russian and American floods of lies are not just harbingers of a malevolent ideology, theyarethe ideology.Vera, the titular character of my new novel, is a 10-year-old girl growing up in an America that is just slightly different from our own. Her best friend is an artificially intelligent chessboard named Kaspie (after the chess player), the car that drives her to school is an ingratiating AI named Stella, and the lessons of her school are preparing her for a constitutional convention that will allow certain “exceptional” Americans, ie those who can trace their heritage to the colonial era but were not brought to the country in chains, five-thirds of a vote. This is being done, Vera is continually told, not to diminish her rights (she, being half-Korean, would not qualify for the enhanced vote), but to honour the Americans who are exceptional by nature of their birth.One reason I wanted to write from the point of view of a 10-year-old character – who, as it happens, is also half-Russian by heritage – is because of the way living in an authoritarian regime changed my own life. There was daily cruelty in the courtyards, classrooms and workplaces of the Soviet Union (not to mention the daily fisticuffs over nonexistent products in the food stores), but there was something else you could never forget even as a child: ubiquity. I grew up a stone’s throw from the biggest statue of Lenin in Leningrad; Lenin looked down at me from the walls of the kindergarten classroom in which my mother taught music; and the very city in which I lived had been renamed after him.Gary Shteyngart as a child in LeningradWhen I wrote Vera, my own son was 10, andTrumpwas every bit as much a part of his life as Lenin was of mine, from talk in the playground to conversations at the dinner table to the discussions of his social studies class. It is unsurprising that Trump’s sometime ideological consigliere Steve Bannon has chosen Leninism as a model for his hero’s rule. All mode of social inquiry, even at a fifth-grade level, must lead back to the scowling man on the television and telephone screen. My parents and I may have different styles of childrearing and certainly different politics, but despite our disagreements I will always honour them for getting me out of the Soviet Union at the right time. The question for my son as well as the fictional Vera remains: is it time to do the same with our children? Or is there still room to stay and fight?Of course, there are large, some would say crucial differences between the Soviet Union of the 1970s and the Trumpistan that America has become today. Much as the comparisons of the contemporary United States with Hitler’s Germany are incomplete (though getting more complete by the day), Russia and America are hardly twins either. And yet, their increasing similarities raise the question of how the similarities that seemed nonexistent at the end of the cold war are becoming unavoidable now.To start with, these are vast lands that stretch from sea to sea. Their size alone is enough to fuel messianic complexes, manifest destinies, divine rights. And religion, which can easily morph into ideology and then violence, drives the stupidity of both nations. In both societies, religion helped normalise the bondage of other human beings: slavery in America and the institution of serfdom in Russia. Inequality is baked into the national psyche of both, despite Russia’s experiments with state socialism: the idea that human beings must be parsed into a multitude of categories. Obviously, other countries have caste systems, but none has the capacity to impose its worldview on the rest of the globe with such stubborn resilience. The Soviet Union loudly professed the brotherhood of nations, but Russian racism remained thick and outlandish on the ground (ask almost any African exchange student), and was converted with great ease into a hatred of Ukrainians, with Russian television using animated images of Ukrainians rolling in the mud with pigs and references to a racial slur that can be compared with the worst used in the States.Trumpistan dives right into this morass with the falsehood that some commonplace tattoos found on Venezuelan bodies supposedly signify gang orientation, but really emphasising that some people – brown or black or non-Christian or non-straight – can never fully claim the mantle of Americanness. There are, indeed, “exceptional” Americans, those that look like Trump and much of his coterie, and then there are those who semi-belong, or who may stay as long as they are useful, and then there are those who don’t belong at all and can be deported at will.Trump lovesPutinwith good reason. Putin takes the messianic ideals that are found at the nub of both American and Russian societies and he makes something out of them that Trump can only find beautiful and instrumental to his own power and corrupt dealings.Living under these regimes is preparing our children for the two choices they will inevitably face – to fight or to conformAs both countries enter headlong into postindustrial, likely artificially intelligent ages, Putin subverts the meaninglessness of Russian working-class lives with loud (though sometimes nonsensical and contradictory) narratives, rooted in a perceived insult to the messianic ideals of the fatherland. When, during his debate with the doomed Kamala Harris, Trump said that Haitian immigrants – those who would never be true Americans even if granted citizenship – are “eating the cats … eating the dogs”, he almost surpassed his master in terms of the clarity and shamelessness of his message, as well as an understanding of the audience for whom these comments were intended. It is most interesting to see older Russian-speaking immigrants in America, who fled the authoritarian USSR of their younger days, embrace Trump precisely because of the clarity of his message, their inability to deny a great leader shouting slogans that, if you take away their ideological direction, look much like the ones that lined the walls of our metro stations or the front pages of the newspapers we sometimes used as toilet paper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She was simply too young for that, and also, because her family was financially privileged, less likely to face such a threat. But as I write this, in June 2025, Trump is taking thefinal steps of authoritarian progressionin his attempt to label any protest against the unconstitutional nature of his rule as an insurrection that must be put down with military force. These attempts, as we can see, can be easily accepted by his followers, many of whom drink from the well of (often Russian-born) misinformation. There are parts of our population who are aching to shoot a brown “un-American” person at the border, in the same way many Russians without a purpose in life dream of profitably shooting a Ukrainian.And whereas Putin has relied on his own praetorian guard, the Rosgvardia (or Russian National Guard), so Trump is stumbling toward his own force in the fiercely racist and loyal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, orIce, which, in cities like Los Angeles and elsewhere, happily spreads the fuel with which our democracy may soon burn.View image in fullscreenGary ShteyngartPhotograph: Brigitte LacombeI want to take a step back and return to the mythical country with which I began. My favourite country in the world, Italy, is ruled by a political party with ties to Mussolini. Other countries I love are not paragons of social democracy and have little love of the “outsider”, although they may rely on exactly such people to care for their parents or raise their children. But the danger of America and Russia lies in the ferocity with which webelieve,a ferocity that in Russia is fuelled by a justifiable anger (and built-in fatalism), given how the population has been ruled throughout the entirety of Russian history, and in America is enhanced by a population that, despite its relative wealth, reads below a sixth-grade level and is easily susceptible to manipulation. Ignorance, to add a pinch of Orwell to the proceedings, is the strength of both regimes. Convincing these populations that slavery was but a feeble blip on the radar of American history or that Ukrainians are porcine savages who precipitated Russia’s invasion requires a groundwork set by centuries of hatred and exploitation.So where should my Vera live? It is hard to say, because living under these regimes is already preparing our children for the two choices they will inevitably face – to fight or to conform. And is it right to ask a child to give up her birthright, the right to live in a country that invented the grace of the blues, the easy slide of denim jeans, the sweet, almost religious voices ofWalt WhitmanandJames Baldwin? That is a lot to ask of a 10-year-old.The beauty of writing about a child is that you can see the monstrosity of the world adults have built filter through their innocence. But no child stays innocent for ever.Vera, or Faith by Gary Shteyngart is published by Atlantic (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Jess is quickly swept up in her feelings for an indie musician, dreamily referring to him as “My Mr Darcy, my Rochester, my Alan Rickman”.Produced by the team behind Bridget Jones, Notting Hill and Love Actually, the show was inspired by Dunham’s own move to London in 2021.But the wholehearted embrace of the UK by a quintessential New Yorker – “I loved Jane Austen, I loved Charlotte Brontë … I was one of those little anglophile kids” – reflects a wider cultural pivot.Three decades on from Cool Britannia, cultural commentators say we are in the throes of a “Brit-culture renaissance”: British men are once again a romantic ideal, Oasis are back together, “Britishcore” became a viral social media trend andJane Austen is getting more rebootsthan Marvel comic books. “Cool Britannia is back!” Tatler declared, as it dedicated itsnew August coverto the offspring of Britpop stars.“Youth culture today is more visually and sonically proud of its Britishness than it’s been in decades,” said Luke Hodson, the founder of Nerds Collective, a youth marketing agency. “The UK’s global output is hitting differently right now.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Rodrigo on stage at Glastonbury last month. The US singer has spoken of her love of the UK.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesThis summer, thousands watchedOlivia Rodrigo profess her lovefor all things British during her headline set at Glastonbury. “I love England so much. I love how nobody judges you for having a pint at noon. I love English sweets, all the sweets from M&S, Colin the Caterpillar specifically,” said the pop star, dressed in union flag shorts. “I have had three sticky toffee puddings since coming to Glastonbury. And as luck would have it, I love English boys,” she added, referencing her beau Louis Partridge.Over the past year, Google searches for “British men” have increased by 21%, while Americans have been writing of theirpreference for dating Britons. Even though Taylor Swift has traded Hampstead Heath for Americana (and wrote So Long, London to mark the end of years spent in the company of British people), otherhigh-profile transatlantic relationshipsare spotlighting UK-US links: Tom Holland and Zendaya are regularly spotted in New Malden’s Waitrose; Andrew Garfield took Monica Barbaro to Wimbledon.Are we Britons confirming our own bias? Maybe not. Fresh on the tail of Too Much, Netflix’s My Oxford Year is yet another series about an American student falling in love among the city’s dreaming spires.But there may be something more here than just a transatlantic love-in. The UK’s resurgent pop culture moment has coincided with a 1990s renaissance that has swept across music, film and fashion.View image in fullscreenSofia Carson in My Oxford Year, a Netflix show about an American coming to university in the UK.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyCall it Cool Britannia 25. Its potency, according to Hodson, lies in its blend of 90s national pride mixed with a celebration of a more inclusive and globally resonant British identity.“This isn’t a repeat of Cool Britannia as we knew it,” Hodson said. “This is a redefined moment, powered by a more diverse and globally connected Britain. Back then, it was Blur, Oasis, the Spice Girls – iconic, sure, but also largely monocultural. Today’s wave feels less like a marketing push and more like an organic reclamation of British identity by the communities who were historically left out of the narrative.”Hodson referencedStormzywearing a union flag bulletproof vest designed by Banksy at Glastonbury in 2019, AJ Tracey wrapped in the union flag for Dork magazine, Central Cee performing in British flag graphics and streetwear brands such as Lostboys and IDA incorporating the flag in their designs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That used to be unimaginable,” he said.Analysis shows that British slang words such as “bonkers” and “cheeky” areincreasingly being adopted in the US, thanks to music andgen Z’s liking for television showsincluding Love Island.This has been expressed by megastars including Drake collaborating with British rappers andCharli xcxstorming the world with her album Brat – a quintessentially London aesthetic that evoked turn of the century excess and rave culture.Are the original Cool Britannia generation happy to see their little bit of history repeating? Not all of them believe it is.Daniel Rachel, the bestselling author of Don’t Look Back in Anger: The Rise & Fall of Cool Britannia, said 90s culture could not be easily separated from the sociopolitical circumstances of the time – including the after-effects of Thatcherism and a renewed national pride with the election of Tony Blair, who “few people would measure Keir Starmer against”.“The decade exploded because of the desperation and repression creative people felt and engineered into their work,” Rachel added. “We may be living through a similar pattern of events, particularly with the troubling rise of rightwing rhetoric across the globe, but if Cool Britannia is to be repeated the seeds will not be found in glossy Netflix-commissioned sitcoms or attention-grabbing social media influencers.“They will be bubbling in the underfunded, underpaid, backstreets of the UK where our country’s greatest artists have always risen from.”Explore more on these topicsCultureNetflixOlivia RodrigoCharli xcxAndrew GarfieldBritpopLena DunhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Six of us were squashed on to one picnic bench in Edinburgh, nine years ago, on our lunch break at a magazine. I felt an instant click with George when he we first met. I was an intern when I first met George, nauseous with first-day nerves. “Is that a Welsh twang I can hear? Sorry, I’m George!” he’d said, before talking me through the office milk-buying etiquette. We had that frenetic compatibility that makes you assume you’ll be friends for ever.Within a couple of years I’d become part of the team. That day at lunch, as someone cracked a joke, George mistimed his bite. He cleared his throat while we slapped his back and chuckled. Then the colour drained from his lips. His coughs turned to rattly gasps, his fingers flew to his collarbone and his eyes rolled back.I realised then the stark difference between movies and reality. When someone chokes in real life, there’s no dramatic music tipping you off to impending tragedy – just your friend gasping for air. Ambulances arrive instantly in films; realistically, they can take much longer. You can die from choking waiting for one. On the picnic bench that day, I was paralysed – until I remembered a scene from a certain 2000Sandra Bullockaction romcom.An obsession began – I’d watch it, rewind the tape and watch it again. I probably still know it word for wordOne Christmas in the early 00s, my sister unwrapped a shiny new VHS of Miss Congeniality Miss Congeniality, the cover of which featured– Bullock in a fuchsia gown, black boots and a gun holster strapped to her thigh. The VHS quickly came under my custody and an obsession began – I’d watch it, rewind the tape and watch it again on my bedroom TV. I probably still know it word for word. It’s all dance routines, pastel chiffon and ticker tape – one big glittery sleepover. But it also solved my childhood dilemma over whether to be a fearless tomboy or manicured beauty queen. Kickboxing and bagel-inhaling FBI agent Gracie Hart, played by Bullock, tries both and – huge relief – isn’t perfect at either.Take, for example, one of the opening scenes, in which Hart risks her career – and life – when she defies orders during an undercover sting to save a Russian target who’s choking on a peanut. The line “That’s one really, really purple Russian, sir” used to make me laugh – but now George’s face was the exact same colour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Years later, the image of her thrusting at his abdomen, over and over until the peanut flies out, sprung into my mind as George gasped.Suddenly, I was behind him, arms around his waist. “Am I really doing first aid informed by nothing but a 00s VHS?” I thought. On one of my final thrusts, the lump of panini came flying out. I didn’t even notice – in my panic I had rushed off to a nearby cafe, bargaining with the universe to deliver an off‑duty medical professional. When I returned, George was sipping water, pallid but alive. “Kate, you’d already saved him!” my colleagues laughed. When George gathered the strength, he gave me a very shaky hug.Another Hollywood cliche that doesn’t bear out in real life is that saving a life creates a permanent bond. Reality is less sentimental. I left the magazine, moved to London, and George and I stopped speaking. But I like to think we both hold that day as a postcard from our funny friendship – and that he’s more careful nowadays when eating sandwiches.Years later, the story of Miss Congeniality and the brie and cranberry panini would play another major role in my life. When I applied for a dream role at Cosmopolitan, I had to submit a first-person piece. I wrote about panini-gate, got the job, and it changed the trajectory of my career. I eventually became an investigative journalist – and have even been undercover several times, just like FBI agent Gracie Hart.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

I’d been offered the contract at relatively short notice and was assured by the casting director not to worry, my French-Canadian co-star was “a real charmer”. I took it with a grain of salt.On the first day of rehearsals, Étienne (the charmer) arrived for a brief introduction before he rushed off to debut a very big role, playing Posa in Verdi’s Don Carlos.The following day, when I asked how the show had gone, he turned to me and declared, without a trace of irony, “I sang like a god”. He was so earnest as he went on to tell me about the audience’s rapturous response to his brilliance, I didn’t knowwhatto say. This level of self-congratulation ran so contrary to my Australian sensibilities all I could do was try not to laugh.The moment I knew: we were rehearsing a difficult dance move – and I caught her head before she hit the floorRead moreI wrote to a friend that night about Étienne’s amusingamour-propre, which even from those first impressions I found curiously endearing, if slightly unhinged. I was intrigued by his whole vibe.On a rare day off from rehearsals, he agreed to show me around town. It was a glorious spring day, and as we ambled through the city, our conversation never found an organic conclusion. We walked and chatted for about seven hours; it was veryBefore Sunrise. By the end of the day, something had shifted between us.Étienne had this whole approach to seduction that seemed almost absurdly dramatic to me. More than once, he tried to serenade me with a melodeon – which, if you’ve ever experienced such a thing, you’ll know is quite hard to take seriously. Much to his confusion, it was the time we spent sitting on the floor of his barely furnished apartment, laughing and watching Flight of the Conchords together, that stole my heart.View image in fullscreenNicole Car and Étienne performing in Eugene Onegin, Deutsche oper Berlin, 2015.Photograph: Bettina StößWe kept things as private as possible, but as we continued rehearsals, our connection deepened both on and off the stage. There was such a charge between us it sometimes felt as though we were playing out the storyline of the opera in real life, and vice versa.As the curtains fell on our first performance, standing hand in hand, the electricity was palpable. It was obvious to me that this went well beyond on stage chemistry or a summer crush. I knew then something serious was happening. I had fallen in love.As the show wrapped, we were forced apart for three months. Étienne headed to a contract atGlyndebourne, while I spent a miserable winter in Australia. We spent so much time on the phone, it was ridiculous.In September, I flew to meet him in Marseille. He was deep in rehearsals but defied his director and ignored countless phone calls demanding he return to set while he picked me up from the airport. A few weeks later, he absconded from rehearsals in Strasbourg to fly to London for 14 hours to watch me make my house debut as Micaëla in Carmen at the Royal Opera House. And by Christmas, he surprised me by cancelling three contracts for the new year and booking tickets to join me in Australia for a month.The moment I knew: we hiked into the wilderness on Friday and emerged as a couple on SundayRead moreIn the early days, many of Étienne’s romantic gestures were met with my baffled amusement, but the way he prioritised me and our budding relationship once we were reunited was not something I took lightly. He swept me off my feet once and for all.Six years ago, we bought our first home in Paris, where we are based with our eight-year-old son and our apricot miniature poodle, Lily. We continue to tour extensively and still spend hours on the phone. These days, Étienne knows his occasional melodeon performances give me a giggle.

The ultimate refreshers on a sunny day at any time of the year.Tiramisu semifreddo (pictured top)Prep5 minCook45 minFreeze6 hr+Serves106 eggs, separated350g caster sugar250g mascarpone200ml whipping or double cream200ml espresso90ml rum, or brandy or marsala60g cocoa powder, plus 1 tsp extra for dusting16-20 savoiardi biscuitsFirst, mix the egg whites with 150g of the caster sugar in a small saucepan and stir over a low heat until steaming hot (70C). Transfer to a stand mixer, whip on high speed until completely cool with stiff peaks, then transfer to a clean bowl.Whisk the egg yolks and 100g sugar in a large bowl set over a pan of simmering water, beating constantly, until voluminous and hot. Move the bowl on to a bowl of iced water and whisk again until cool. Add the mascarpone and whisk again until completely incorporated.Whip the cream on medium-low to soft peaks, then fold it into the mascarpone mix. Gently fold in the whipped egg whites.In a separate bowl, stir the espresso with the remaining 100g sugar and your chosen booze.Line a two-litre container with clingfilm and, using a tea strainer, sift a quarter of the cocoa powder over the base. Gently spread about a third of the mascarpone cream on top of the cocoa. One by one, dip half the sponge fingers in the boozy espresso syrup, soaking them thoroughly, then arrange in a neat layer on top of the mascarpone cream.Dust with another quarter of the cocoa powder, then top with another third of the mascarpone cream. Repeat with a second layer of soaked biscuits and another quarter of the cocoa powder. Top with the remaining third of the mascarpone cream and dust the top with the remaining cocoa powder. Freeze for about six hours or more, until completely set.Just before serving, turn out the semifreddo on to a cool platter, dust with the remaining teaspoon of cocoa powder, then slice and serve.Pomegranate granitaView image in fullscreenHere, I use pomegranate – a favourite fruit and emblem of Sicily – but you can use any fruit juice you fancy (or berries blended with a tiny amount of water). As with all the best recipes that call for few ingredients and minimal intervention, the quality of the granita is solely dependent on the quality of the pomegranates: look for ones with a deep, purplish garnet colour to their seeds.Prep25 minFreeze4 hr+MakesAbout 1 litre2kg whole pomegranates, or 1.2kg pomegranate seeds, or 1 litre pomegranate juice (look for one that is 100% pomegranate juice, and ideally not from concentrate)100g white sugarFirst, pick the seeds from the pomegranates, discarding any of the cream-coloured membrane, which isverybitter. Transfer the seeds to a food processor (not a blender, which would pulp the pips and release their bitterness) and whizz until the pips are still whole, but released from their crystalline flesh.Strain through a sieve, pressing to extract all the juice, then stir in the sugar until dissolved.Transfer to a wide dish and put it in the freezer. Once it starts to freeze at the edges, and every 10-15 minutes thereafter, stir with a fork or whisk, and repeat until it’s almost completely frozen and icy; this should take about four hours in all.The granita is ready to serve in this slightly wet, slushy state, but if you want to keep it longer, leave the granita to freeze solid, then take it out to thaw for 20 minutes or so before serving, then break it up with a fork.Jacob Kenedy is chef and owner ofGelupo,Bocca di LupoandPlaquemine Lock, all in LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodIce-cream and sorbetDessertNuts and seedsFruitCoffeeItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

It was crunchy and packed to the rafters with flavour, but, more importantly, it was cold. Until then, I’d been eating hot food in hot weather, but ever since I’ve been chasing that perfect cold summer meal. These coldhiyashiramen come close for me. They’re ludicrously versatile (think salad plus sauce plus noodles), and the only “cooking” to be done is boiling the noodles; the rest is chopping, blending (the sauce) and assembling. It is truly summertime where the living is easy.Sweetcorn hiyashiIf you have fresh corn cobs, boil them for five minutes, then drain, cool in cold water and slice the kernels off the cob.Prep10 minCook35 minServes48 spring onions(100g), trimmed and washed thoroughly8 tbsp good-quality neutral oil– I like rapeseed oil2½ tsp light soy sauce, plus 1 tbsp extra for the sweetcorn sauce2 tsp white-wine vinegar200g sweetcorn kernels, fresh (see introduction) or frozen1½ tbsp white miso1 garlic clove, peeled2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped300g dried ramen or soba noodles½ large cucumber(180g), cut in half widthways, then finely shredded100g cherry tomatoes, halved250g smoked tofu, cut into batons20g basil leaves, roughly tornPut the spring onions on a board and chop, chop, chop the greens and whites, running the knife over them over and over again to turn them into tiny fragments. Scrape the chopped onions into a bowl, add four tablespoons of the oil, two and a half teaspoons of soy sauce and the white-wine vinegar, then put to one side.Put three quarters (150g) of the sweetcorn kernels in a blender, add the miso, garlic, ginger, the extra tablespoon of soy sauce, the remaining four tablespoons of oil and 100ml water, and blitz: you’ll need to blend it for quite a while to break down the fibre of the sweetcorn.Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under the cold tap until cool. Drain really well, then put in a bowl, add the spring onion mix and toss very well to coat.Distribute the noodles between four plates or shallow bowls. Spoon a quarter of the sweetcorn sauce to one side of each portion, and next to it arrange a quarter of the cucumber, tomatoes, smoked tofu and the reserved whole corn kernels. Scatter over the torn basil leaves and eat.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodJapanese food and drinkVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkNoodlesSaladrecipesShareReuse this content"

A lot about young people’s sex lives – and their sales pitch – has changedByCarter ShermanSat 19 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 12.02 EDTShareBy the time the young man in red swim shorts sprinted up the beach to Chiara MacGillivray and Jon Sechuk, the two twentysomethings had yet to convince a single Jersey shore partier to join their crusade for chastity.In fairness, convincing young people to remain “chaste” until marriage is a hard sell at the best of times. And the members of Generation Life knew that Saturday in June at the Jersey shore – a stretch of sand south of Atlantic City so renowned for horniness, drunkenness and reality TV show antics that its very name has become a synonym for hedonism – was not exactly a good time for chastity. It may have even been the worst possible time.Yet for the 10 activists who accompanied MacGillivray and Sechuk to the beach, the sheer WTF-ness of their pseudo-mission trip was kind of the point. “We wouldn’t be impacting as many people if we just preached to the choir,” Tino DiMurro, 21, told me.After fortifying themselves with a morning mass service, they split into small groups and fanned out across the beach, which was sparsely populated after an hour of light rain. Beachgoers tended to be unmoved by MacGillivray and Sechuk’s opening line: “What do you think love is?”[The past two] decades have also witnessed something of a second sexual revolution in young people’s sex lives“I don’t know if I’m smart enough to answer that,” one young man said. “Is it like for a video or something?”“Is this a bit?” another asked Sechuk, a bearded 27-year-old who wore a pale pink shirt that read “my brother’s keeper”. “Or are you with the church?”MacGillivray and Sechuk had already made one circuit of their swath of the beach when the young man in red trunks bounded up to them, clutching a Gatorade bottle. He had heard that they were asking around about people’s views on relationships.“I actually just got out of a relationship and I’m here on the beach to fix that,” he told MacGillivray and Sechuk, who laughed politely. “I had my prom like two nights ago – whatever, that’s beside the point. I just got out of my relationship. I really liked her.“She’s kind of, like, doing her own shit,” he continued. “I’m kind of new to the whole dating thing. It was, like, a new whole thing. It was a lot, it was, it was very overwhelming.”The young man swayed and stretched as he held the bottle. I was starting to suspect that the clear liquid sloshing inside was not full of electrolytes.MacGillivray, a 23-year-old brunette and recent graduate of the Catholic Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, took a risk. “This is a shot in the dark, but, like, have you ever heard of the word chastity?” she asked.“That means not having sex, right?” the young man responded.“Not really,” MacGillivray said. “It can look like that in certain aspects of your life. But for the most part, what the word actually means is seeing another person for who they are, with their body, their mind, their personality …”“Yeah, like, have you guys seen Robin Hood: Men in Tights?” he interrupted.“I don’t think so,” MacGillivray said.“That movie’s fire! Watch that tonight. Whatever hotel you’re staying at, put on Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Cary Elwes is in it. The girl’s got ametal chastity beltaround her” – he gestured at his midsection – “genitalia”.“OK,” MacGillivray said, with another laugh. “That’s not what it’s about.”Their conversation soon petered out. The young man seemed unlikely to embrace chastity anytime soon (or to remember the conversation), but MacGillivray and Sechuk were undeterred.View image in fullscreenThe ‘girdle of chastity’ from L’école des maris jaloux ou les fureurs de l’amour jalou by Matthieu Fortin, 1698.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesOver the last two decades, the Pennsylvania-based Generation Life has repeatedly taken college-aged students to do a weekend of “beach outreach” on the Jersey shore. Those decades have also witnessedsomething of a second sexual revolutionin young people’s sex lives. The rise of the internet has upended how people interact. Porn of every possible proclivity has become ubiquitous online, while kink and non-monogamy have gone mainstream. #MeToo triggered a global reckoning around sexual violence, which in turn unleasheda ferocious conservative backlash. More young people than ever – around a fourth – identify as LGBTQ+, and they are increasingly secular.For advocates of sexual abstinence until marriage, who are frequently fueled by their Christian faith, all this tumult presents a critical challenge: how do they stay current with a message that urges people to resist the allure of change? What is 21st-century “chastity” supposed to be about?Gen Z are ‘comparing and despairing’Gen Z is, rather notoriously, in the middle of a “sex recession”. Only about a third of gen Z high school students have had sex, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while a study conducted in part bythe Kinsey Institutefound a whopping one in four adultmembers of gen Z have also not had sex. Even if a gen Zer has gotten laid, they are increasingly likely to go longer between partners.There is no scientific consensus on why gen Z has stopped having as much sex, but it is not the result of abstinence pledges. (Although the federal government has poured more than $2bn into funding abstinence-only sex education since 2000, research has repeatedly found that it produces lackluster results.) Instead, two twinned culprits are often singled out: smartphones and the social media platforms that they immerse us in. Social media encourages people to not only constantly compare themselves with peers and celebrities – a process often dubbed “comparing and despairing” – but also causes them to treat their own bodies as objects to be judged based on sex appeal. Some research has found that this can, in turn, lead girls and women to submit to sex they do not want; alternatively, it may lead people to avoid sex altogether, because it seems like another chance to be found wanting.These findings’ seemingly contradictory nature underscores a critical point: the science on social media’s effects is as muddied as the science on the sex recession. Yet vast swathes of young people do feel that social media hasravagedtheir lives, particularly their mental health. This belief is an example of what sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild calls “the deep story”, or “a story that feels as if it were true”. The deep story and its texture of truth can be just as powerful, if not more, than the facts. And it was this deep story about social media that Generation Life, in order to update their message for the modern age, sought to evoke on the beach and the boardwalk.As the sun set, the activists split up to tackle the Wildwood boardwalk, which had grown more populated as the rain receded. DiMurro and Eileen Sceski, also 21, stopped one young man and asked his opinion on how social media impacts relationships. “Definitely distorts it,” he said.You don’t get to actually meet and talk with the person [on social media]. You only see the bodyEileen Sceski, 21“Transactional, would you say?” Sceski asked.“Definitely transactional,” he agreed.Another young man, with a silver cross around his neck and a hovering girlfriend, told the pair that social media was nothing less than “poison”. “I have it,” he confessed, “but I try not to use it so much.” The problem, everybody thought, was comparing and despairing. Social media made everybody look too good: their relationships too perfect, their bodies too sleek, their happiness too unshakeable.“Everybody hates social media, and the fact that it kind of, like – that’s all you see is, the surface level,” said Sceski, who wore her brown hair in thin braids beneath a backwards baseball cap. Her Generation Life T-shirt read: “You’re worth waiting for.”She continued:“You don’t get to actually meet and talk with the person. You only see the body.”None of the conversations that I witnessed on the boardwalk progressed to the point where the Generation Life activists introduced the concept of “chastity”. They seemed to prefer bonding over universal problems, such as the hunt for true love and self-esteem, rather than proposing their specific and potentially off-putting solution of avoiding premarital sex. It was like a sales pitch that sputtered out halfway; I could not tell whether people even realized that they were talking to chastity advocates.This omission felt less like a lie than the result of social anxiety and an abundance of hopefulness. By simply introducing the idea that the young people at Wildwood deserve better, the activists prayed – literally – that they would on their own come to reconsider their “dignity”. I was not so convinced, especially as dusk fell and the contrast between the Generation Life activists’ message and the world that most people move in grew starker.View image in fullscreenLifeguards carry their gear and an American flag as they leave the beach at the end of their day on 6 July 2023, in Spring Lake, New Jersey.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesOne side of the boardwalk was open to the ocean and several amusement park rides, including a towering ferris wheel. The other side was lined with shops and signs advertising body piercings, “paintball: live targets”, edibles, shorts whose butts read: “IT AIN’T GONNA SPANK ITSELF” and shirts that declared: “I ♥ MILFS”. (Other shirts expressed ♥ for “DILFS”, “SLUTS”, “BLACK GUYS” and “MY HOT WIFE”.) The stores blasted Abba and reggaeton, while boardwalk speakers played the voice of a jolly man repeating the same message over and over again: “You’re gonna have a blast on the boards! Morning, noon and night!”While the Generation Life activists dressed rather plainly, in T-shirts and jean shorts and athleisure, many of the women on the boardwalk wore bikinis or backless tops paired with tiny bottoms. The men dressed in board shorts and tight tops of their own. Even if the Jerseyshore partiers planned to go to church on Sunday – and the number of crosses around people’s necks suggested some degree of devoutness – they clearly did not mind sinning on Saturday. The boardwalk chapel was practically deserted.In comparison, every Generation Life activist was attending or had graduated from a Catholic university. At lunch, I ate a few fries before awkwardly realizing the others were waiting to say grace. And after each conversation with someone new, the Generation Life activists noted their name in order to pray for them. When one activist was not sure whether the name was “Henry” or “Henrik”, another said it didn’t matter: “The Word will know who you’re talking about.”To be clear, the Jersey shore is not exactly a hotbed of secular leftism. Donald Trump won the New Jersey coastline by astonishing margins in 2024 and once packed the Wildwood boardwalk and beach withalmost 100,000 rallygoers. Yet even in Maga country, I only caught a handful of interactions where the activists managed to reach the heart of their sales pitch. On the beach, after Sechuk and MacGillivray revealed that they were advocating for chastity, one young man lounging in a beach chair – the same man who had asked if they doing a “bit” – took it in stride. “Cool, that’s really cool,” he said.He did not, however, seem interested in becoming chaste. “You’re gonna have sex in college,” he said. “Don’t you think it’s important to teach about safe sex?”If Sechuk and MacGillivray had an answer, I did not hear it. Instead, the conversation wheeled away from sex and chastity, to our favorite movies.The pitfalls of avoiding pain“Abstinence” implies a lack of something; “virginity”, a fleeting status. Many abstinence-only sex-ed advocates today avoid both terms, claiming that they support “sexual risk avoidance”.You shouldn’t just be using your body as a tool, or other people’s bodies as a tool, for your own pleasureTino DiMurro, 21Generation Life prefers “chastity”, which is, in their view, about cultivating deeper intimacy with yourself and those you love. Even if you have already had premarital sex, Generation Life dictates that you can strive for chastity by avoiding it in the future. Moreover, having the right kind of sex – that is, married sex – counts as chaste, because the bonds of matrimony make it virtuous.Nobody so much as breathed the word “abortion” while we were on the Jersey shore, but in case the group’s name didn’t give it away, that’s part of Generation Life’s mission, too. Its website reads: “We believe that by spreading the message of chastity, we can end abortion at its root cause.”“You shouldn’t just be using your body as a tool, or other people’s bodies as a tool, for your own pleasure,” said DiMurro, who is planning to save sex for marriage. “We don’t believe that sex is bad or evil or anything like that at all. In fact, we think it’s so good that it should only be saved for committed relationships.”Although such a broad definition of chastity might surprise modern ears – or fans of Robin Hood: Men in Tights – it’s far from new. Centuries of thinkers have used “chaste” to describe a whole suite of behaviors, not just sexual ones. The 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas, for example, saw avoiding sex as one facet of “spiritual chastity”, or “the refusal to enjoy things that were judged to be against God’s design”, scholar Hanne Blank wrote in her 2007 book Virgin: the Untouched History. Meanwhile, ancient Greek philosophers, equated chastity with moderation, such as maintaining a solid diet and work ethic, and with contributing to the greater good.It is also a common misconception that people who champion abstinence initiatives are anti-sex. In reality, religious conservatives have for decades embraced thinking like DiMurro’s, with white evangelicals hawking millions of sex manuals to married couples. (Their advice could be frisky: one famous evangelical sex guru of the 1970s, Marabel Morgan, said it was a “great idea” for a wife to greet her husband wearing nothing but Saran wrap.)Generation Life’s argument, then, transforms the prudish idea of waiting for sex into a self-righteous quest to set a higher standard across all areas of life. Chastity, in the group’s telling, reclaims autonomy in the face of overwhelming pressure, particularly on social media, to perform sexuality. Given that gen Z is famously risk averse, to the point that they are drinking less and even getting fewer drivers’ licenses than past generations, this argument may be especially potent: caution is no longer something to be sneered at but celebrated.View image in fullscreenSupporters react as they wait to attend a campaign rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump in Wildwood, New Jersey, on 11 May 2024.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersTo be sure, Generation Life still faces steep odds. Their activists are growing up in an age when, despite the sex recession, a record 77% of 18- to 34-year-old Americans believe that sex before marriage is “not wrong at all” – and when the average age of marriage is, at nearly 30, higher than ever. Generation Life can’t even rely on God to get their message across, since only 30% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 39identify as white Christians– less than in every other age group. (Because white Christians and Christians of color have distinct histories and traditions in the US, including in their approaches to sex, experts tend to evaluate the groups separately.)That’s why, in addition to chastity, Generation Life uses another word to define their mission: “countercultural”. The contrast between the activists and everybody else on the Jersey shore is, again, kind of the point: even if Generation Life can’t draw more people into its mission, it can create a bunker mentality among those who do believe in it. The depth of the problems faced by their cohort reinforces their conviction that they alone are on the right path.“It shows a bit of the brokenness – that they’re willing to just talk to strangers about their sex life, you know what I mean?” Sceski said of people at the shore. “Normal people don’t do that.”Sex is bonding [...] So just making sure the people that you’re doing it with – you’re doing it intentionallyChiara MacGillivray, 23I found the Generation Life activists to be fearfully fixated on the idea that the world is full of pain, much of it self-induced – even more so than your average member of gen Z. If chastity encompasses a whole range of virtuous behaviors outside of sex, then a greater number of nonsexual behaviors become suspect. Like, for example, being emotionally open with people who do not deserve it, including in platonic settings.“We don’t have the insight to never make mistakes in a relationship,” MacGillivray said. But, she continued: “There are things that are bonding. Obviously, sex is bonding. Sharing really deep stuff is bonding. You feel something. So just making sure the people that you’re doing it with – you’re doing it intentionally and not just because it came up in conversation.”They were even advised to be cautious about opening up to the people they met at the shore. “You’re putting yourself in a vulnerable position,” MacGillivray said. “And obviously, that’s kind of like chastity in general. You want to put yourself in safe situations.”On my drive home, I kept turning over my conversations with DiMurro. He would like to be in a relationship but only wants to date someone if he could see himself marrying her. Not many other 21-year-olds want to date so seriously, so DiMurro is not dating at all.“A lot of people, who maybe don’t think the same way, get in relationships when they shouldn’t or at the wrong time or with the wrong person [and] end up getting hurt unnecessarily,” DiMurro told me. “Either you’re dating for marriage or you’re dating for heartbreak.”A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreWhen I was 21, I deliberately dated for heartbreak, throwing myself into a relationship that had zero chance of ending in marriage because I thought the rush would be worth the ruin. We did not have much sex, which I mention only because I know firsthand that while relationships do not need sex to deepen, avoiding sex is no protection against pain.After that relationship ended, and after every other heartbreak, I learned about the depth of my own capacity to feel. (Who knew I could cry for 11 hours straight?) I learned about empathy, because I realized other people had also experienced this kind of chasmic pain. I learned about resilience, because I kept going through the heartbreak and eventually recovered from it. And I learned about art, because I suddenly understood what all those songs were about.I can see the appeal of chastity. Frankly, I was charmed by the Generation Life activists’ earnest desire to understand love and to make people feel cherished. But I do worry that avoiding sex is a proxy attempt to avoid connection and vulnerability. The consequences of this evasion are personal and political. As the poet Audre Lorde wrote in her seminal 1978 essay Uses of the Erotic: “The sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic or intellectual, forms a bridge between the sharers which can be the basis for understanding much of what is not shared between them, and lessens the threat of their difference.”During lunch, the Generation Life activists asked me what I thought love was. I told them it was about trying to no longer keep score. I should have clarified what I meant: it is about learning to live with risk, context and the discovery that the world – and the people you love, and your own psyche – will break your heart again and again. Living without heartbreak, however, is no life at all.Explore more on these topicsThe sex lives of gen ZNew JerseySexChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A home on wheels means you can enjoy the great outdoors without worrying about broken tent poles or deflating airbeds. With a memory foam bed, air conditioning and wifi on the long list of bells and whistles you can add, Daniel Lopez, the managing director ofSussex Campervans, jokingly describes van life as “camping with standards”.He says: “Campervan life suits people of all ages. The one thing they tend to have in common is a love of the outdoors and the desire to make the most of their leisure time.”But how much does a pop-top roof under the stars cost and what are the other financial outlays involved?Buying a vanHow much you need to budget for your vehicle depends on whether you are happy with a secondhand model or have your heart set on a brand new top-of-the-rangeVolkswagen California Ocean, complete with a two-tone white and blue paint job for an extra £3,000.You can get your hands on a used campervan for under £10,000 but new vehicles can cost anything from £40,000 for an entry-level model, such as the Peugeot Boxer, to north of £85,000 for a hybrid Ocean.Prices for used campervans are largely dictated by age, mileage, condition and desirability, says AutoTrader’s Tom Roberts. “A used 2001 Mazda Bongo campervan conversion that sleeps four people with a pop-top roof will cost £5,000-£7,000, while a similar 2001 Volkswagen Transporter would set a prospective buyer back an extra £11,000.”View image in fullscreenA 2001 Mazda Bongo conversion will typically cost £5,000-£7,000.Photograph: brinkstock/AlamyMost offer the same basic amenities such as gas connections, water tanks, a small kitchen area and sleeping areas, but some come with showers, pop-top roofs and solar panels.“A 2017 version of the Transporter would probably cost about £30,000 due to more modern used campervans being in better condition and therefore holding their resale value,” Roberts says. As a buyer you could opt for a finance deal to spread the cost.A key step is to decide whether you want to buy from a dealership or a company that specialises in bespoke conversions, or hunt down a classic such as the VW type 2. A growing number of Britons are also embarking on DIY conversions.Traditionally campervans have been based on panel vans with diesel engines because they provide the most torque and the best fuel economy when the van is loaded up. However, petrol models are becoming more common, and there are electric options such as the Nissan e-NV200 and Vauxhall Vivaro-e. These are especially good for city dwellers worried about Ulez charges.View image in fullscreenA used 2001 VW Transporter conversion might cost £16,000-£18,000.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamyFor many people the ideal is a new VW. Its bestselling California comes in three progressively expensive models: Beach Camper, Coast and Ocean. You can drive away a Beach Camper for £63,500 (£71,300 hybrid), while the Ocean starts at £77,600 (£85,400 hybrid).However, these prices are a guide as the bill can soon mount once extras ranging from a bespoke paint job to parking sensors and cameras are added. The lead times for orders vary, depending on specification, but the average is three to four months, so you won’t be taking it on holiday this summer.Lopez, whose company builds bespoke campervans, advises would-be buyers to consider the “total cost” of ownership as well as “usability”. They don’t expect to, but some buyers find they end up using the van every day, he says. One customer uses his to pick up his newspaper and then heads to the beach with his dog. Afterwards he “sits in the campervan reading the paper, drinking a coffee and the dog has a little sleep”, Lopez says.While the investment is substantial, campervans lose value more slowly than cars, he says. “We generally say that you lose the VAT in your first year, which is 20% and then 10% a year after that. So say you paid £50,000 for a campervan, after a year it is probably worth £40,000, after two years £36,000 and so on.”Insuring your wheelsYou need a dedicated policy for your campervan – you can’t just drive it under your existing car insurance. Typically, cover costs less than general van or car insurance. The usual factors affect the price, such as make and model, value, storage location, age and number of drivers, claims history and annual mileage.Depending on your circumstances, you could get a quote for as little as £250 or more than £1,000. If the campervan is your main mode of transport this could drive up the premium but on the other hand, if you use it infrequently, this should bring it down. Specialists, such as Safeguard, Caravan Guard and Adrian Flux, are seen to offer the best value.It is important to tell the insurer if it’s a self-build or professional conversion. A DIY conversion can make finding insurance more complicated, and insurers may ask for more information, including photos, before they give you a quote.View image in fullscreenPeugeot Boxers are another popular campervan option.Photograph: ZarkePix/AlamyYou must be upfront about any modifications you have made. Earlier this year Guardian Money reported on the case of an aid worker whose Transit van was stolen only forhis claimto be rejected. This was because he had been using it as a campervan and had not told his insurer about an overhaul that included a kitchen, heater and solar panels.These add-ons change the vehicle’s value and make it more attractive to thieves. Had the insurer known the full picture it might have upped the premium or pulled cover.Insurance providers base their prices on risk – so if your van seems more likely to get stolen or damaged, you will pay more.The value of the vehicle and where you live are the biggest drivers of priceThe value of the vehicle and where you live are the biggest drivers of price. “A high-risk postcode can make a huge difference to the premium,” says the Caravan Guard marketing director, Craig Thompson.For those buying a van as an additional vehicle, it may be possible to mirror a no-claims bonus from an existing car insurance policy. Experience of driving larger vehicles can also lead to a bigger introductory discount. You could also opt for a higher excess.Fitting aThatchamtracking device can result in a considerable saving (25% at Caravan Guard), while an alarm can help, too. (Thatcham provides independent ratings for car alarms and immobilisers.) Insurers are also a fan of owners being able to park it on a driveway behind locked gates.Thompson adds: “Physical security such as steering wheel locks can also qualify for insurance savings, as do safety devices such as reversing cameras – as you can imagine, reversing prangs are not uncommon.”Being able to store it in a secure location, such as a locked garage, will also help.Before you buyWrite a list of must-haves. For example, do you want to be able to stand up inside but still sail under car park barriers? Think about the sleeping arrangements as most manufacturers start with the bed design. What about a sink with running water, a Porta Potti or cab seats that swivel?Also think about how many people will be along for the ride as this will dictate storage needs. You will need a rainy day fund for servicing and repairs, not to mention membership of a roadside recovery service in case something goes wrong.Before investing thousands it is a good idea to get a sense of what sharing a small space with loved ones might be like. Rental sites such as Indie Campers or Quirky Campers allow you to try out different makes, models and conversion styles, and vans are available to pick up at locations around the country.View image in fullscreenQuirky Campers’ Ola van.Photograph: Quirky Campers‘The biggest expense was the electrical setup’Not all campervans are created equal, and with a bold interior featuring plants and animals inspired by the work of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, “Frida” has personality in spades.Five years ago Lindsay Berresford and her husband, David Ffrench, paid £19,000 at a dealership for a Citroën Relay and then spent almost the same again to turn it into the “ultimate family campervan”.The couple used the professional converters Rustic Simplicity to bring it to life with a wooden interior made of oak from reclaimed whisky barrels. The clever layout incorporates fixed triple bunks for their children Isaac, 11, and nine -year-old twins Autumn and Skylar.“For us the biggest expense was the electrical setup – everything runs off a lithium battery which is charged from solar panels,” Berresford says.View image in fullscreenLindsay Berresford and David Ffrench with their three children and their campervan, Frida.Photograph: Lindsay Berresford and David FfrenchWhile touring with a family of five sounds ambitious, that’s not the case, she says. Although you do need to pack light. “Our wardrobe is made up of five wicker baskets which can be taken out and brought into the house to pack. You can only take the clothes that fit in the basket.“We’ve been doing this since the kids were born. I think Isaac was three weeks old on his first trip, the twins were slightly older. It’s been amazing for us.”The family spend about five weeks a year in the van, which does about 10,000 miles annually, including rentals.While it is possible to fit lots of gadgetry the Bristol family’s setup is at the “simpler end” of the scale. “It’s luxurious to have a proper mattress but we don’t go for lots of fancy tech, which means there is less to go wrong,” Berresford says.View image in fullscreenLindsay Berresford and David Ffrench’s campervan is inspired by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.Photograph: Lindsay Berresford and David FfrenchTheir love of van life resulted in the couple inadvertently finding the rental websiteQuirky Campers. It was set up in 2010 to rent their previous van, Bella, when they spent some time overseas but the idea took off when friends wanted to use it to rent out their vans. Hiring Frida out through the site more than covers its annual running costs, which include £1,500 for insurance and breakdown cover.The family’s most exciting adventure to date has been a six-week road trip across Europe, making it as far as Albania. A stop off in Croatia was particularly memorable with an unspoilt beach to play on. “We found a wild camping spot by the beach,” Berresford says. “For a few days we were totally off-grid.”Explore more on these topicsCaravans and campervansMotoringTravel & leisureConsumer affairsAutomotive industryCar insuranceInsurancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographs: Gabriele GalimbertiSat 19 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareMost of us are taught to keep our sexual lives private. We’re taught to hide our desires, and all too often, to be ashamed of them. Cultural instruction about sex tends to be very prescriptive.Sexhappens in our bedrooms, behind closed doors, between a man and a woman. Sex is for procreation rather than pleasure. Sex is for marriage. Sex should only happen when you fall in love. If you’re a woman, you should only have one sexual partner for the whole of your life. If you’re a man, the sky’s the limit.Certainly, some of these mores have shifted over time, relaxed a bit. But mostly, we’re supposed to keep our sex lives to ourselves. And certainly, we aren’t supposed to partake of anything that would strain the strictures of “good taste”, like say, pornography or sex toys.My Toys, a project from Italian photographer Gabriele Galimberti, is a frank celebration of the devices and accessories we use in our erotic lives. He photographed people, from around the world, with their collections of sex toys. It is a visual ode to pleasure, one that might be easy to dismiss or titter at given our general cultural discomfort with talking openly about sex and pleasure and what we do, what we use, how we enjoy our erotic lives. Our bodies can be lush sites of pleasure all on their own, but there is no shame in wanting, craving, seeking more. Toys give us access to that more. They afford us some control over our pleasure. They allow us to be expansive in our explorations of our bodies and the bodies of lovers. They allow us to test limits, to be voracious, even greedy with our sexual appetites. And why not?The subjects look into the camera with small, sly smiles, giving the impression they know something delightful that we don’tGalimberti’s new work stands in stark contrast to a previous project,The Ameriguns,a series of photographs of Americans, from all walks of life, with their extensive gun collections. We know America has a gun problem, that there are more guns than people in the United States, that unfettered access to guns, no matter the consequence, is a core tenet of conservative ideology but still … to see the shocking abundance of weaponry laid out on a pool deck, or in a bedroom, or neatly organised in a room dedicated to firearms, is jarring. It is damning. It is terrifying.I was reminded of The Ameriguns, because there is far less cultural sanction toward such wanton displays of weaponry than toward overt displays of sexuality. My Toys is not prurient, but it is fascinating. The sheer range and quantity of toys on display is impressive and even educational. Each image in the series speaks to the diverse buffet of a healthy sex life – so much possibility in so many shapes and sizes. In the photos, the toys aren’t actively being used. Instead, they are artfully arranged in a semicircle on a wood floor or in a neat row on a coffee table or on a kitchen counter or hanging from a large wall rack. The people allowing us these intimate moments look into the camera. Many of them have small but sly smiles, giving the impression that they know something delightful that we don’t. I admire the unabashed confidence of the subjects, so willing to share with strangers a window into their sex lives, how they receive pleasure, how they give it.When you look at sex toys, it can feel kind of silly. Many look alien. You study them and wonder how, exactly, they’re supposed to be used until, through trial and error, you figure it all out and, hopefully, enjoy the reward of your efforts. There is a pact many friends make, an entreaty, should something terrible happen to us, to rush to one another’s homes, for the sole purpose of clearing out whatever cache of sex toys and other contraband we might have, before our families descend and go through our things. It’s funny but also not, a reminder of the ambient anxiety many of us have around admitting that yes, we have sex, and yes, some of us use toys. That we care about what people might think about our erotic lives after we are dead and no longer able to feel shame or have to withstand judgment speaks to the way shame is intertwined with our sex lives.I don’t really write about my own sex life. Perhaps, it is the Catholic in me. Or the fact that I teach college students. Or that I am shy. Or that I believe some things are better kept private, because they are intimate and sacred. My wife and I have toys, we enjoy them, though we aren’t particularly organised about them. It’s nice to have options. We don’t have to limit ourselves. As consenting adults, we are free to explore the pleasures of one another without restraint (metaphorically) and with restraint (literally).As I have transitioned into middle age, I have become intensely bored by puritanical attitudes toward sex. The abnegation of pleasure, the valorisation of erotic austerity, hold no sway. To what end do we deny our desires? Who does our dissatisfaction really satisfy? But being sex-positive, libertine, open to the fullness of an erotic life is not apolitical. It does not happen in a vacuum. As Amia Srinivasan notes in The Right to Sex,“the sex-positive gaze risks covering not only for misogyny, but for racism, ableism, transphobia, and every other oppressive system that makes its way into the bedroom through the seemingly innocuous mechanism of ‘personal preference’”. We want what we want, yes, but are we willing to interrogate why and what has influenced our desires?In some ways, sex toys liberate us from some of these questions. It is just us and, perhaps our partner(s) and a girthy length of silicone or strands of leather bound to a handle or metal nipple clamps dangling from a chain, and the possibilities of where our erotic imaginations lead us. In My Toys, we see some of what that looks like, a gorgeous atlas of abundant desire.It is a fantasy, though, to believe sex toys might free us from the ills of oppression. In some parts of the world, in some states within the US, the purchasing and/or owning of sex toys is verboten. In Thailand, they are considered obscene objects. Sex toys cannot be imported to the Maldives. They cannot be sold in Alabama, or Mississippi, and under Texas Penal Code 43.23 an adult can only legally own five or fewer sex toys. How the Lone Star state enforces that law, I couldn’t tell you. It all comes down to control, but pleasure is one realm where few people will allow themselves to be controlled (nonconsensually). We must deny ourselves all kinds of things, for all kinds of reasons, but pleasure, that is ours. We have every right to embrace our libidinal selves, licitly and illicitly, alone, or with strangers, or partners or others. It is how we can surrender to the whelm of desire. It is why, in the images here, we see the smirks, but we also see defiance.Put another way: for our fifth wedding anniversary this year, my wife Debbie gave me a piece of art from Joseph Beuys, a 3inx8in piece of paper with the word “SURRENDER”in bold type. My cheeks immediately warmed because I knew the art was not just art. It was an offering.​‘Our bodies have changed. We’re using gentler toys now’View image in fullscreenBustie, 49, burlesque performer, and Tony, 60, Amsterdam, NetherlandsBustie: Sex has really changed for Tony and me as our bodies have changed. For me, it’s perimenopause, and Tony has a spinal cord injury. Tony was active in the BDSM scene and I was always a really sexual person, so there has been a lot of grief. But it was nice to take the toys out for the photo. Some of them we hadn’t used for a while – it was a bit of a sad moment. You think, where have you been? Tony has started to give some away to friends because they should be enjoyed – especially the beautiful leather ones.Bodies change over time. What feels good now might not feel good 10 years later. What’s changed is which toys we play with. To wield a whip, you need to be able to stand, balance, have strength in your arm; it’s quite a workout. And for me, sometimes with perimenopause, genitals respond differently, and vibrators feel more intense. So we’re using different, gentler toys now, much more foreplay and much more lube.The root of the stigma is the patriarchy. A straight man who has a lot of sex isn’t shamed about it, but everyone else is.‘My first vibrator was horrible – it was a wake-up call’View image in fullscreenFrida, 37, sex shop owner, Milan, ItalyMy first sex toy was horrible! I got it in my early 20s from a shop in Berlin – this terrible red, huge, too hard vibrator. I think I used it once and put it in a drawer. It was a bit of a wake-up call for me. I thought, maybe I have to be the person who brings higher-quality products to people.So 10 years ago I opened a shop called Wovo (which sounds like the Italian word for “egg”). It could trivially be considered a sex shop, but I wanted it to be a point of connection for Milanese subcultures, where people don’t have to feel as if they need to hide or justify themselves for having unconventional sexual preferences. It’s a place where the topic is, first and foremost, normalised. We organise sex parties which have strict rules about consent and people as sexual subjects, not objects, and this also challenges a very rooted cultural idea about owning one’s partner.Social media has done a great job on the normalisation of sex and masturbation, but also of the non-desire for sex. It’s important to make all people feel included.I also think the influence of family in Italy means that we inherit a cultural legacy of fascism from our grandparents, which obviously limits sexual freedom and gender expression. Historically, we have not been a particularly rebellious country that fought for its rights; whereas in Spain, for example, the feminist struggle has made itself heard much more.‘Before the internet, I had to be resourceful’View image in fullscreenGriffon, 45, artist and entrepreneur, New York, US (photographed in Austin, Texas)I grew up in the Oregon countryside before the internet was around to answer my questions, give me ideas, or offer something like Amazon to deliver what I needed at a moment’s notice. I used to use all sorts of things: tampons before I even got my period, vegetables from the garden – once I sculpted a dildo out of duct tape. Looking back, I am amazed at how resourceful I was.Now I love to use the Hitachi Magic Wand with my partners, combined with a thrusting dildo if I’m playing alone. Where sex toys are winning in my life is that I actually orgasm. I’m amazed at how often men don’t even care if we enjoy it.‘Sex is resistance’View image in fullscreenCoco, 30, clinical sexologist, ThailandSex is not just pleasure – it’s resistance. Every time I claim ownership of my desires, I reject the patriarchal script that says my body exists for male consumption. Society polices women’s sexuality through slut-shaming, purity culture, and reproductive control – but my autonomy is my rebellion. Whether I embrace celibacy, casual sex, self-pleasure, or committed intimacy, the power lies in my decision.Sex toys are illegal here in Thailand; talking about them has become how I “screen” people. If someone claims they’re open-minded but then says legalising sex toys is “morally debatable”? Out. After sharing my story, I realised how many people were waiting for someone to say out loud that it’s OK to like sex. To have a body that doesn’t fit some bullshit “standard”. To unapologetically take up space in a world that tells us to be quiet, ashamed, and small. I do it because the second I did, people exhaled.‘For me, talking about sex is like talking about food’View image in fullscreenEnkiny, 29, artist, Qingdao, ChinaI don’t see any difference between the topic of sex and something like food – I can say I like spicy or sweet flavours, and I can express my love for sex toys. However, with older generations like my parents’, I would never talk about sex toys in front of them; it’s still something they would find difficult to accept.In my art, I explore themes of self-awareness, including sexuality. That is a result of the social environment we live in. My German friends and I can discuss sex, and there’s no embarrassment. On the other hand, in China, most people tend to avoid the topic.My ex-partner and I both believed that sex toys were an important part of enhancing our experiences. But when I was gifted a whip, that took me by surprise!‘Showing myself like this encourages people to live freely’View image in fullscreenSerena, 35, nurse, Florence, ItalyFor me, sex is a necessity. I crave it and think it’s essential in my relationship above all. As a homosexual woman, toys take the pleasure of penetration to a higher level. In long-term relationships, they encourage you to discover yourself and your partner. Also when you imagine how to first use them, it’s fun. At the moment, the curve dildo is my favourite, because of its shape and dimensions.There aren’t many spaces where you can share thoughts about sexuality without being judged. I don’t really care what others think of my personal life – it’s called personal for a reason. By showing myself to the public, I’d like to encourage people to live freely.‘Toys are a curiosity but I can live without them’View image in fullscreenNadia, 36, geophysicist, Kilamba, AngolaFor me, sex is a synonym of relaxation. It’s a biological manifestation of the fact we were born to complement one another. This is my favourite toy, but for me they are mere curiosity – I can live without them.‘People ask: are they all yours?’View image in fullscreenEnrica, 33, data visualisation manager, Milan, ItalySometimes with my partner I felt blocked, and so initially I used sex toys alone to try to get back in touch with myself and my body. The sensations you get when you know your body are totally different. It unlocks pathways to emotional connection with a partner, and also creates a connection with yourself and with your body that you then carry into the rest of your life.I bought my first dildo about two years ago out of curiosity, during a Black Friday sale. After using it, I wondered why I hadn’t done it sooner and why none of the people close to me had told me to do it. My favourite depends on my mood, but it’s probably the clit sucker.Talking about sex feels normal for me, like I’m showing tools that should be part of everyone’s lives. You don’t have to work in the sex toy industry for it to be normalised; you can work in analytics and still chat with people about it.I think while there’s still stigma, we are more able to create sex-positive spaces. When people see this picture of me, reactions are split between positivity and, “You’re crazy to expose yourself like this!” and “Are they all yours?”‘It’s easy fun that is available 24/7’View image in fullscreenDaniel, 30, PA to an MP, Berlin, GermanySex for me means joy, personal freedom and emancipation. Sexuality constitutes an important part of me as a human being. I have a positive idea of sex and admire the variety of sexual experiences, be it random or intimate, sensitive, rough or whatever.I prefer casual human bodily contact over the use of sex toys, which I have barely used with other people. But I still see them as a vital part of my sex life. It’s easy fun that is available 24/7. Many people use sex toys – they bring joy and pleasure. Why shouldn’t I speak publicly about them?‘When I was younger, I wasn’t doing things for my own pleasure’View image in fullscreenCarmen, 38, motion graphic designer, Barcelona, SpainSex is a way to discover yourself, a way to try new things and see what we like and don’t like – and that evolves and changes. Over the past five years, I went into a research phase around my sexuality, and sexuality in general – reading books, listening to podcasts and so on. Reading about sex toys and sex education made me want to test out new things. I realised that at times, particularly when I was young, I was doing things not for my own pleasure, but because in some way someone told me to.I bought my first sex toy in 2011 after watching a Sex and the City episode where they were talking about the Rabbit. Right now, my favourite one is ceramic; I love beautiful objects, so that’s a factor when choosing one.I’m tired of society always wanting us to shut up about sex. People have kinks, women masturbate just as men do and no, not everyone likes the same things. There are still taboos around it but I hope that talking about sex, self-pleasure and kinks is getting more normalised.‘I was 18. My mom said: here’s money for a vibrator’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gabriele GalimbertiJessica, 35, cartoonist, Amsterdam, NetherlandsMy introduction to the world of sex toys was nothing short of iconic. I grew up in Maryland in a strong matriarchal family. When I was about 18 my mom found out I was having sex, sat me down and said: “When it comes to your pleasure, you can’t always rely on men to get the job done.” Then, with a knowing smile, she handed me some cash. “Here’s some money for a vibrator.” So armed with her encouragement and the legendary Rabbit vibrator, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and took control of my own pleasure.It took me years to realise I could bring my partner into this process. Men often have a fear of sex toys because they think, “But where am I in this?” Men grew up being told the goal is to perform and women were taught to fake orgasms and centre male pleasure. I still think a big problem is that many women don’t know that their own pleasure is valid.Sex toys are a normal part of many people’s lives, yet a lot of shame still surrounds them. I moved to the Netherlands a decade ago and found myself living in this 17-person university flat, heartbroken, unemployed and embarrassed about my life. So I decided to draw about it. That led to the creation of Vanillacooldance, my cartoon on a mission to break taboos about sexuality and relationships. By sharing my stories and the thousands I get back, we all collectively realise that we’re not alone. Silence breeds shame.‘Teen girls should be given them’View image in fullscreenAlexis, 46, writer, Berlin, GermanyToys teach me to slow down and savour new pleasure paths. My ex-partner gifted me a toy for my 40th birthday. My clitoris was thrilled! Now I test them for the brand.I wish we were given toys as teenagers as part of public education, before we even had partnered sex. Because from a female perspective, I think we are overtly and subconsciously taught that we are here to give pleasure, to perform pleasure and to be receptive to this external force. And that creates a really messed-up feedback loop. If we were to give a young lady of maybe 16 a toy to start to explore her body, it would help de-stigmatise self-pleasure and agency. Can you imagine the dialogue that would open up around that?‘Men can be scared of sex toys’View image in fullscreenHugo, 31, painter, and Tania, 34, performance artist and acrobat, Berlin, GermanyTania: Sex should be playful and exploratory, a way of showing love and affection to yourself and your partner. Toys are the perfect way to experience new sensations and intensify existing ones, and also to explore outside the gender roles of sex. I came out as queer not long ago and it was life-altering to realise that if I wanted a big and beautiful pink cock, I could have one.It has been a slow journey of self-discovery with my own desires and sexuality. Growing up femme-presenting and a people-pleaser, sex was more about the other person than my own experience of pleasure. My first toy was a little bullet vibrator that my roommate in college went to buy with me when one drunken night I told her I had never had an orgasm. It wasn’t until I met Hugo that I really got into sex toys. I remember being a little overwhelmed and excited seeing his collection for the first time, and almost surprised that he had so many toys designed for female pleasure. I had never had a partner who was interested in pleasing me without reciprocal expectations.I grew up in a household that never discussed sex. I was born in Italy, where you don’t even talk about tampons; then I went to Catholic school in Georgia, US. Our sex education was basically just showing all the diseases you could get – it stunted my sexuality. Living in Berlin, and with this relationship in particular, I felt excited and safe exploring my sexuality. Our connection has only deepened through the use of sex toys; they allow us to please each other in ways we never thought possible.Hugo: I’m a surrealist painter and include sex toys in my paintings. When I was growing up, there was an idea that sex toys were only for women or old people. Men can be scared of them. First, there’s a bit of homophobia; then also the idea that if you introduce one into your relationship, you’re admitting you’re not enough for your woman. But toys bring a lot of pleasure and fun, especially in a couple situation.‘I want to fight prejudices about overweight women’View image in fullscreenGulim, 41, writer/content designer, Almaty, KazakhstanI don’t have a partner right now, so toys help me not to lose interest in sex. A close friend owns a sex shop and gave me my first one. I don’t use it any more, but keep it as a souvenir. At the moment, my favourite is the Womanizer; I call it the Porsche of vibrators.In Kazakhstan, the topic of sex is taboo. When I published photos of myself in underwear on social networks, several people said overweight women should be ashamed to show themselves. I want to fight prejudices about overweight women. We are also beautiful, sexy, love sex and orgasms.Explore more on these topicsSexRoxane GayPhotographyRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Row’s £600 sliders are an exquisite provocationThe foam footwear is selling fast at the high-end store in London but the price remains controversialLauren CochraneSat 19 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareRounded, cushioned and with a thick strap, foam sliders have been a familiar sight on feet this summer. While they are available for £30 from Adidas or £3.49 on the online marketplace Temu, a high-fashion version is now also on offer. TheAma sliders, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week. They cost £600.Laura Reilly, the writer of the influential fashion newsletter Magasin, called them“The Row’s latest rage bait”, using the name for posts online designed to provoke anger, and go viral in the process.Fashion’s version of rage bait seems to be luxurious versions of everyday things. It remains unclear whether the creators of these items are deliberately provoking a reaction, but the prices certainly drive some consumers into a fury.The Ama follows The Row’s other recent item in this tradition: the Dune sandal, otherwise known asflip-flops with a red sole, which cost £670 (they also come with a black sole, as worn by the actor Jonathan Bailey at an event to promote Jurassic World). But the brand is not alone. Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for £325 and the Italian brandGolden Goose’s “dirty trainers”, which cost £435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from £720 Crocs, to atowel “skirt” that cost £695 and a take on theIkea Frakta bagfor £1,365.View image in fullscreenThe Row’s Dune sandals cost £670.Photograph: The RowDal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. “This one in particular is brilliant because it’s so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one thatBalenciaga’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”At The Row’s store in London’s Mayfair on Thursday afternoon, the Ama are not yet on display but a sales associate says they arrived the previous day and have already sold out in the most popular sizes. If the price might raise a lot of eyebrows, it is at home among items such as a simple white T-shirt that costs £510 or a striped silk shirt at £1,530. Like this shirt, which feels memorably soft and luxurious, the quality of the Ama is noticeable: it is lighter and more streamlined than the average foam slider. Although perhaps not enough to justify a price 1,900% above the Adidas design. In this environment, however, this is not the point. “For an average shopper at The Row that is not expensive,” says Rodgers.Explore more on these topicsFashionLuxury goods sectorFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

UK airports are expecting their busiest days of 2025 so far, with more than 9,000 flights carrying up to 1.7 million people abroad.Despite the dream of sustainable travel and direct trains to the sun, most Britons heading abroad will fly.After a bumpy few years, airlines and airports have taken on more staff and promised a better experience. Meanwhile, luggage allowances, security, compensation and border rules are all under review – but the penalties for getting it wrong can sting.So what are the changes that could ease the passengers skywards this year – or spell a more turbulent trip?UK drivers warned of soaring charges to drop off passengers at airportsRead moreDo I still need to worry about liquids in carry-on bags?Yes – despite new state-of-the-art scanners now installed at great expense at many airports. Some relaxed the 100ml liquid rules in 2023 but were forced to reinstate them last year. Now, only Edinburgh and Birmingham allow passengers to take containers of up to two litres through security. But these airports are outliers – and even if you take bigger toiletries in hand luggage on an outbound flight, there’s no guarantee of bringing it back through security abroad.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said Britons should assume the liquid limit stands: “You should work on the basis that it is 100ml at the moment unless you have heard from your airport otherwise.”View image in fullscreen‘The tyranny of tiny toiletries’ shows no sign of ending soon.Photograph: PoppyPixels/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe tyranny of tiny toiletries has held sway since 2006 when the 100ml limit on liquids, pastes and gels in hand baggagewas first introduced, aftera foiled transatlantic bomb plot.The upgraded security lanes and new CT scanners also mean passengers will not need to take out their laptops or electronics – already possible in many airports.But airports are at different stages of ending restrictions – sometimes, even within their own terminals. At London Gatwick, for example, all 19 security lanes have CT scanners so passengers no longer need to remove devices or put liquids in plastic bags – but the 100ml limit still applies.What about the size of my cabin bags?Carry-on bag size has become a flashpoint at the departure gate as travellers grapple with different rules depending on the airline they are flying with.The rules on “large” cabin bags – such as the wheelie suitcase which most short-haul airlines now charge for – are unchanged. But for the small or “personal” cabin bag – usually placed under the seat in front – there is now a baseline as airlines fall in behind a new EU minimum bag size of 40cm by 30cm by 15cm.This should in theory enable frequent travellers to buy one piece of luggage that will be accepted by all airlines.Some airlines, such as easyJet, already allow a more generous free under-seat bag. Ryanair is increasing its maximum dimensions to comply, from 40 x 25 x 20cm, to 40 x 30 x 20cm, with the change “implemented over the coming weeks, as our airport bag sizers are adjusted”.But if you get it wrong and a gate check deems your bag oversized, you will still pay a fee – £60 for Ryanair, and a similar charge even on other airlines such as Jet2.View image in fullscreenIf you get it wrong and a gate check deems your bag oversized, you will still pay a fee.Photograph: image/AlamyThe airline association Airlines for Europe said its 28 members will be following the rule by the end of the 2025 summer season however “carriers will continue to permit larger personal items at their discretion”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDidn’t I hear that the EU are making all cabin bags free?Last month, thetransport committeeof the European parliament voted to give passengers the right to an extra piece of free hand luggage weighing up to 7kg. Under the proposed rule (yet to be approved) travellers would be able to bring one cabin bag measuring up to 100cm (the sum of the dimensions) as well a personal bag, at no additional cost.However, airlines argue that it cannot happen: according to easyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis, the proposal is silly – “there simply isn’t room for all the suitcases in the cabin.”Do Britons still queue for longer at the border?There will still be plenty of time to admire the deep blue of post-Brexit passports in the slow lane at most European airports. Since May, an agreement in principle has meant that EU countries can allow UK passengers to use their e-gates. In practice, most will be passing through staffed border posts to get passports stamped until the EU’s delayed entry-exit system, EES, arrives in October.View image in fullscreenThe new blue British passport doesn’t get you into the quick queue (though maybe that will happen soon).Photograph: David Burton/AlamyTravellers to the EU will then need to submit biometric information on their first visit, to cross the border using facial recognition technology. A further sting in the tail is that UK visitors will soon – likely in mid-2026 – require a European Travel Information and Authorisation Systemvisa waiver, costing €7 (£6), to enter the EU. (Better, though, than the £16 that all visitors are now required to pay to come in via the UK’s own electronic travel authorisation.)Will this be another summer of disruption?The post-Covid travel boom left many unprepared, but airlines and airports believe the troubles of summer 2022 are well behind them, with continued recruitment and more settled staff. Airlines are increasingly turning to AI to predict issues, rearrange their operations at short notice during disruption, and increase resilience.Air traffic control, however, remains a concern. Record numbers of flights are expected, and European skies in particular are ever more congested: the closure of Ukrainian and Russian airspace and parts of the Middle East has also squeezed many long-haul flights into the same corridors. Throw in air traffic control (ATC) staff shortages and strikes, and more and more airlines are finding their flights subject to rerouting or delay. EasyJet, Ryanair and BA all now say that ATC delays are their biggest headache.How will they help passengers?Airlines are obliged to provide refreshments during delays of two to four hours. BA says it will now do this automatically through QR codes and vouchers in its app for passengers delayed at Heathrow. EasyJet has added what it now brands “Aces” – or airport customer experience specialists – at Gatwick and its other big hubs to offer extra help and support.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryTravel & leisureFlightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a moment, nothing stirred. The beams of light from the sun spotlit a nearby clump of bracken so intensely it reminded me of the torches Mulder and Scully used in The X Files.Then, a rustle came from up ahead. “Quick! I found them,” he yelled before disappearing into a clearing between the pines. I walked on, to find, in front of us, the curved edges and spherical lines of a UFO, coloured so dark it nearly blended into the shadows. It was, of course, a metal sculpture representing the alien vessel said to have landed here over 40 years ago. On top of it stood my son.Even before I managed to take a decent picture, he wanted to run on again. “We’ve got to find number four now,” he declared.We were in Suffolk’s Rendlesham Forest, a 15-mile drive from Ipswich, walking a free UFO trail, based on the sighting of unexplained flying objects by US military officers based here in 1980. Loving to follow a trail of any kind over several hours – but especially one where he can tick off numbers, so he knows there is an end (handily, this one culminates in a playground) – he walked, ran and skipped the three miles, while I enjoyed spending time outside with him.Beaches are always a winner when trying to convince kids that nature is coolWhen it comes to the summer holidays, it can feel as if we are doing a countdown. Of the 13 weeks most children get off school each year, six are lumped together over the summer, making July and August feel like a stretch of endless time. Not only can it be a nightmare, due to the juggle of childcare and work, but keeping kids entertained and – crucially – active rather than sat in front of screens can be expensive. So many activities cost a fortune. But there is another way. And it is completely free. And that is the outdoors.The UFO-themed walk was onForestry Englandland, which is one of the first places to turn during the holidays. From interactive app-based trails that allow you to take videos of your child pretending to be a dragon complete with AI wings, to crafting missions where you work together to find natural items on the woodland floor to make the face of the Gruffalo, they are an inexpensive way to immerse yourself in nature.On theUFO trail, a free leaflet at the start guided us around the trees where I could tell the story of the key sites. My son was so enamoured of the map and tale that the next morning at breakfast he asked me to read it again while he followed the map with his finger and remembered our adventure.View image in fullscreenPhoebe Smith and her son with Maggie Hambling’s scallop shell on Aldeburgh beach.But an outdoor adventure doesn’t have to be deep in the forest, where maps are required. The next day, we headed to Thorpeness, home to the much-photographedHouse in the Clouds, a former water tower that was disguised as a red and black clapboard house in 1923. Our mission was to find a way to get a good photograph of it. We followed a footpath up a hill, past quirkily painted weatherboarded houses which were popular after the first world war. While I was in awe of the house we had come to see, my little one found it way more exciting to discover the windmill opposite (bought by the creator of the House in the Clouds to help pump the water).Adjacent to Thorpeness is the town of Aldeburgh, where we spent hours on the shingle beach filling buckets with “magic stones”, chasing the waves, paddling in the North Sea and taking shelter under Maggi Hambling’s giant scallop shell sculpture when rain fell. The day was rounded off with a hearty helping of fish and chips from Aldeburgh Fish and Chips, owned by the same family since 1967. Weeks on, my son still talks about this day as one of the best in his life.We swam in the sea and were treated to a spectacle of the resident bottlenose dolphins putting on an impromptu performance at duskBeaches are always a winner when trying to convince kids that nature is cool. On a previous trip, I took my boy to New Quay in Ceredigion, west Wales (one of a few places that lay claim to being the inspiration for the characters and town in Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood). We didn’t set foot indoors for an entire day. When the tide was out, we set up a beach “base camp” with some shade under a giant parasol, then proceeded to bury each other in the sand. Then we looked for jellyfish washed up on the shore (a great opportunity to teach him about them), went rock pooling in the shallows (we found crabs, limpets, anemones and periwinkles) and built an elaborate fortified river, hewn from the silt using our buckets and spades.As the temperature rose, we swam in the sea and, just before the end of the day, we were treated to a spectacle of the resident bottlenose dolphins putting on an impromptu performance at dusk. None of this cost a penny. Yet we’d shared some of the best quality time I’ve experienced – bonding over the natural world, revelling in getting sand between our toes, and shivering in the cool waters of the Irish Sea.View image in fullscreenAn e-bike adventure on the Isle of MullFor something that feels like a bigger trip to my son, I try to involve a train. A couple of summers ago, we took the fast train to Scotland, then caught the ferry to the Isle of Mull as foot passengers. There, I hired an e-bike with a child seat and trailer, and we stopped off to wild camp near a loch. He helped me put up the tent, I cooked our dinner on a stove and we bonded over a shared love of marshmallows.We stayed up watching the sunset, despite it being way past his bedtime. “I love the sun so much,” he told me as we saw the sky turn purple. “I don’t want to go to sleep.” He did, thankfully, nod off under a sky full of stars, with not a mention of Bluey, Peppa Pig or any of the other characters he usually demands entertain him. On one of the last days, we woke before dawn. I packed a chocolate croissant in my bag and we climbed the nearest hill to watch the sun rise. He still talks about it and asks when we will do it again.‘I feel as if we could be in Scandinavia’: exploring the Norfolk that time forgotRead moreOne of my most memorable trips with him was paddleboarding on the river near our house. I packed a picnic and we paddled to an island, where we sat and watched the birds, while he asked what each one was called and demanded we collect some of their lost feathers to take home, in the hope we might one day be able to make a cape that allowed us to fly back here.Memories like this are priceless. I know, given his age, he probably won’t remember everything we do, but I hope going into the wild places will instil in him a knowledge that the natural world is a wondrous place and the backdrop to some of our happiest times together. For me, it helps to remember that when it comes to the holidays, instead of counting the days, I need instead to make the days count.Phoebe Smith is theauthor ofWayfarerand the2025 recipientof theRoyal Geographical Society’s Nessawardfor promotion of accessible adventure, particularly to women and those from underprivileged communitiesExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysSuffolk holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysWales holidaysEurope holidaysDay tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then an email pings and I turn to read it. When I turn back, the dog is gone and there’s a new hole in the lawnTim DowlingSat 19 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 01.05 EDTShareShortly after its first birthday, the new dog suddenly starts digging giant holes in the lawn. I don’t know why I imagined a year would be a cut-off point for a dog developing new unwanted behaviours. Why shouldn’t an adult dog find a hobby?Anyway, these giant holes represent one of the key challenges of canine training: encouragement is easy; discouragement is hard. It’s easy to teach a dog that peeing outside is good. It takes a lot longer to teach it that peeing inside is bad.Discouragement requires, at the very least, the possibility of connecting any negative reinforcement to the bad thing in question, which in this case proves impossible. When I discover a new hole in the morning, I call the dog out to the garden. She arrives instantly, tail wagging.“Is this you?” I say, indicating the fresh, football-sized crater. The dog looks at me in perplexity.“I don’t even know why I’m asking,” I say. “Of course it’s you.” The dog stares expectantly, as if something fun might be about to happen.“I will catch you in the act one day,” I say. “And there will be consequences.”When I discover a new hole, I call the dog. She arrives tail wagging, as if something fun might be about to happenNo one who’s seen my lawn would dare to suggest I’m precious about it. I cut it infrequently and never bother with edging. At this time of year it’s mostly brown patches and spreading weeds, and I don’t care. But the holes are deep enough to represent a hazard, so I fill each new one and sprinkle grass seed over it. If I don’t have enough soil, I top them up with espresso grounds. It would be fair to say none of this is working.It’s a difficult time of year in the garden all-round. Half the crops in my pretend farm have failed, while the others present a problematic success. My wife comes out to my office shed while I’m staring at my raised beds.“I’m going to the supermarket,” she says. “Do you know if we need anything?”“Don’t buy courgettes,” I say. “We have, like, eight.”“Don’t worry, I won’t,” she says.I poisoned my family with toxic courgettes four years agoand it put all of them off courgettes, possibly for life. But I still grow them because they’re easy, resulting in an annual glut.“This year’s ones are fine,” I say. “You’ve actually eaten some already, without knowing.”“Anything else?” she says.“We have shitloads of radicchio,” I say. “And one cucumber. Otherwise, as far as I know, we’re out of everything.”Soon after my wife leaves, I discover that the everything we’re out of includes milk. Instead of texting her, I go to the nearest shop.“I’ll be back in 10 minutes,” I say to the dog. “Don’t dig.”On my return I run into the middle one, who stopped by on his way back from work and found no one home.“I ate your cucumber,” he says.“The whole thing?” I say.“It was delicious,” he says.I spend the rest of the afternoon watching from my desk as the dog lies on the grass chewing on an outdoor cushion. It’s bad behaviour, but it’s not a hole. If I am to apply negative reinforcement to the correct crime, timing is everything.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I turn to read it, and then, grudgingly, answer it. When I turn back the dog is gone and there’s a new hole alongside the gutted cushion.I examine the hole carefully – it looks to be one I have already filled and re-seeded once – before calling the dog’s name. The dog appears at the kitchen door, yawning and stretching.“Come here,” I say. The dog walks across the lawn and sits at my feet.“What’s this?” I say, pointing to the hole. The dog looks at my outstretched finger, and then at me.“Your new hobby is unacceptable,” I say. “I’d only just filled it in yesterday.” The dog tilts its head slightly, as if to say: is this about the cushion?“This is about the hole,” I say. “Whatever it is you’re looking for in life, you won’t find it a foot under the lawn.”The oldest one, home from work, walks into the kitchen. The dog runs in to greet him.“Hello,” he says. “Why is your nose covered in dirt?”“You in tonight?” I say.“I think so,” he says. “What’s for supper?”“Dunno,” I say. “Whatever mum brings back, plus courgettes.”“Ugh,” he says.“It was four years ago!” I say. “Four years of everyone rejecting my courgettes!”“And yet,” he says, “you persist.”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a gloomy December morning and the podcaster and author was headed towards a London recording studio. On the way, she passed a row of houses that were being renovated. The windows on one particular house had just been replaced and covered with a translucent blue sheet and haphazard orange tape; the scene caught her eye, so she paused to capture it with her iPhone 15 Pro.“I’m known among my loved ones as someone who takes photos of random things, but I just found this so arresting,” Day says. “I was struck by the grammar of it, the angular nature. The tape reminded me of art’s golden ratio, the geometry like a Mondrian crossed with a Rothko. I was exhausted that morning and it completely brightened my mood.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She’s a scruffy, tumble-down affair – moreofthe landscape than in it. I’ll miss her: the dark oak bones with an ochre skin of clay brick, the handsome burnt headers in bold contrast to the veins of pale lime mortar.A building can still be visited, of course, but a place in a community cannot – and it is this knowledge that strikes me hardest.

Summer arrives with a new wave of insects: bumblebees pottering beneath the eaves, wasps streaming to and from their nests in the crooked roof, and masonry bees working tunnels into the soft mortar.

It was 2015 and three of their regular customers were standing in the reception of their accident repair centre inCounty Durham. It had been a busy period and, unusually, all three had come to collect their cars at the same time.One had got a call from an accident management company trying to persuade him to make a personal injury claim. Unusually, the caller knew the make and model of the car and the date of the accident. The second man said the same had happened to him. By the time the third customer confirmed he had also got the cold call, the three of them were pulling out their phones.“One of the guys said: ‘Well, what number was it?’”, says Jan, brow furrowed at the memory. “They were just getting the mobiles out and saying this number, and then asking me if I knew it. I said: ‘No, I don’t know that number at all’. And they asked: ‘Well, where did they get it from?’”The men did not have insurance with the same company, had used different brokers and their accidents were unconnected. “And then all three of them turned around,” says Michael. “They went: ‘Well, it must be you guys.’”Cold callers are a nuisance, whether they are asking about repairs to your property or trying to persuade you to make a personal injury claim. But what happens when those calls threaten to bring down your business?Last month, after a 10-year investigation, eight men were convicted for their part in a conspiracy that ran one of the biggest nuisance call operations seen in the UK. The people who precipitated their downfall? A husband and wife from County Durham, who just wanted to protect their business.The 10-week trial at Bolton crown court, which brought to an end the largest investigation into cold calls carried out in the UK, shed light on a murky world.A jury found Craig Cornick, 40, a well-known businessman in the north-west, guilty of stealing personal data, having earlier found him and Thomas Daly, 35, not guilty of hacking into computer systems. Daly had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to steal personal data. Of the six remaining men, all admitted stealing data, and four admitted hacking into computer systems.The names, numbers and details of people involved in accidents may seem like rows on a spreadsheet, but they provide lucrative spoils. That information is sold to claims management firms hoping to generate leads for personal injury cases.The cold-calling gang targeted a million people and hundreds of accident repair garages between 2014 and 2017, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).The Reeds’ role in exposing them starts almost a decade ago, in 2015.The couple run Alan Reed Ltd, set up by Michael’s father in 1970 and joined by Michael when he left school at 15. It is a family effort: Jan is in charge of customer care, her daughter Debbie does the accounts, and Michael’s daughter Megan works in parts.View image in fullscreenA photo of Michael’s mother and father outside the family business in its early days.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianAfter the painful confrontation with their three customers, the complaints kept coming, and the couple worried about their reputation. “You get upset,” says Jan. “Then we got quite angry about it, didn’t we? Thinking, well, we’re not to blame. We used to talk about it all the time. We were just going inside out with it.”They were not naive about data. They worked with bluechip insurance companies, and underwent training in how to protect personal information. They got their centralised IT car logging system, used widely in the industry, inspected twice, but were told nothing was wrong. They trusted their 40 staff – they had known half of them since they started as apprentices – but thinking they were the only garage affected, they started to wonder if they had been betrayed.After months of complaints, they had had enough. Michael remembers the exact moment. The couple were in the car and Jan was upset. “I said: ‘I can’t do this any more, we’ve got to do something’,” she recalls. But then she had a thought. “I said: ‘How about we put our information into the computer?’ And Michael said: ‘Right. We’ll give it a go.’”They input their own numbers in spring 2016, alongside details of fictional accidents, and waited. At first, nothing happened. But then, 11 days later, Michael’s phone started ringing. “I literally walked through to say: ‘Jan, I’ve got somebody on the phone’,” at the same time Jan’s phone rang, says Michael. “I said: ‘Just go and answer it,’ and then we looked: it was the same number.”Michael spoke to the cold caller, asking if they knew the date he’d had an accident. When they confirmed the date, they put him through to a solicitor. Michael eventually made his excuses and ended the call. After a letter from the solicitors arrived, they were ready to go to the authorities.“Obviously, we thought it was going to be over in weeks,” says Michael. “We didn’t think it was going to be nearly 10 years.”Andy Curry is the head of investigations at the ICO, which investigated and prosecuted the criminal case under powers bestowed by data protection legislation. He is not an excitable man, but when he talks about the scale of Operation Pelham, as the investigation was named by the ICO, his eyes light up. “This is the biggest criminal investigation and prosecution the ICO has ever undertaken,” he says.Thanks to the information provided by the Reeds, alongside hundreds of other garages, ICO criminal investigation officers carried out nine raids in Macclesfield and Manchester in 2016. They seized 241,000 emails, 4.5m documents, 144,000 spreadsheets, 1.5m images and 83,000 multimedia files.0:52Police search office of cold-call scam operation – videoAmong the devices taken was an iPhone, which, according to the ICO’s prosecuting barrister, “opened Pandora’s Box” and provided “a clear window into the extent of the criminality” of the gang.Curry says: “We uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages acrossEngland, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. It was an enormous and complex case.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have someone interested in purchasing off you on a weekly basis bro.” The reply came 29 minutes later: “Don’t have anything for sale atm bro but just got a new kid who can get me anything I want from anywhere so soon as he up and running will let u know bro.” A few minutes later there was another reply: “Decent u data King now haha.”Another key piece of evidence came in the form of a selfie video, filmed by Mark Preece, who admitted conspiring to hack computer systems and steal personal data. “I’ve got the full garage list. I’ve got all the passwords for everything,” he says. “All the data [...] I’m going to be rich, well, I am rich.”Live'I'm going to be rich,' cold-call scammer Mark Preece boasts – videoCurry says the messages were a crucial aspect of building the case. As for the video, it was a gift. “When you watch this you think, how stupid do you have to be to film yourself basically admitting to a criminal offence on this large scale?” he says. “But great for us.”Some of the men said they were involved in legitimate businesses. Thomas Daly and Adam Crompton, the directors of a now-dissolved company called Cheshire Finance UK, listed under “call centres” on Companies House, had used their company to mask the “purchase, sale and harvesting of unlawfully obtained data”, the ICO argued in court.Cornick is listed as a director of 15 businesses on Companies House since 2013; nine have been dissolved, two liquidated and four are active. His listed address, a large mock Tudor residence with an electric gate and prominent CCTV, is in Prestbury, an affluent village in Greater Manchesterknown for its mansions owned by footballers and millionaires.In a statement after his conviction, Cornick said that during the period on which the trial focused “data trading was a common industry practice” before regulations were tightened, “reinforcing the need for businesses to closely scrutinise where their data originates”. He was “relieved” to be cleared of computer hacking, but rejected “any notion of wrongdoing” and said he would appeal against his conviction.View image in fullscreenMichael and Jan Reed: ‘We need to stand up for ourselves and not get swallowed up.’Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThere has been a clampdown on cold callers in recent years. The UK moved to bancold calls offering financial products in 2023, so anyone being contacted out of the blue can assume they are a scam. But people are still bombarded with billions of unwanted calls every year. According to data fromHiya, a spam blocker service, UK residents received an average of three spam calls a month between January and June last year, equating to about 195m spam calls in the UK every month.Despite taking almost 10 years, Operation Pelham is not over. The ICO confirmed that one man, 33-year-old Jamie Munro, who is wanted on three counts related to the case, has disappeared and is thought to be overseas. And a second phase of the investigation is looking into the role of people in insurance firms and claims management companies. Curry says the ICO will continue in its efforts to “untangle this web of illicit data trade. We will be relentless.”So what now? What consequences will this “vast, murky criminal network” face? The ICO says it will go after any proceeds of crime; it will probably also push for a red flag to be placed on each of the conspirators, preventing them from becoming directors of companies in the future.However, all of the men are likely to avoid prison when they are finally sentenced next April. Offences under the 2018 Data Protection Act, including stealing data, are punishable by fines. Those convicted of hacking under the Computer Misuse Act will probably receive suspended sentences. “We have no involvement in sentencing,” the ICO’s legal team said. “The court must sentence within the confines of the maximum sentence available in law.”Since it began, Operation Pelham has swallowed hundreds of hours of investigators’ time. Asked why it took so long, the ICO said it was a complex case, and had been affected by the pandemic and a year-long adjournment. As to how much it cost, the body said it was carried out as part of its normal regulatory functions. “We do not record costs for specific investigations,” a spokesperson said.Back in County Durham, the Reeds say they are proud of the role they played, but mostly they just want to get on with their lives. “Businesses like ourselves are the backbone of this country. We need to stand up for ourselves and not get swallowed up,” says Michael. He shows a black and white picture of his parents, smiling outside the original garage. “When you’ve been going for 55 years and you look at all the different things you’ve dealt with, well, this is just something in that timeline,” he says. “It’s been dealt with, we’ve dealt with worse. Everything we do is challenging – if it was easy, I don’t think it would suit the Reed family.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Heba al-Ghussain’s nine-year-old son, Karam, was killed by an Israeli airstrike because he went to fetch water for the family, and her 10-year-old daughter, Lulu, was killed because she went to give Karam a hand.The siblings were waiting beside a water distribution station, holding jerry cans and buckets, when it was bombed last Sunday, killing six children and four adults and injuring 19 others, mostly children.Both Lulu and Karam died instantly, torn apart by the force of the blast and so disfigured that their father prevented Heba from seeing their bodies.“They didn’t allow me to say goodbye or even look at them one last time,” she said. “One of my brothers hugged me, trying to block the scene from me as he cried and tried to comfort me. After that, I don’t remember anything. I lost touch with reality.”0:22Father grieves over bodies of children killed in airstrike - videoLulu’s real name was Lana but her parents rarely used it because her nickname, which means pearl, captured the gentle shine she brought to family life. “She had such a joyful personality, and a heart full of kindness,” Heba said.Karam was smart, always top of his class until Israeli attacks shut down Gaza’s schools, generous and mature beyond his years. His dad, Ashraf al-Ghussain, called him “abu sharik” or “my partner”, because he seemed “like a man in spirit”.But he was also enough of a child to be obsessed by a remote-controlled car that he begged his mother to buy. She regrets telling him they needed to save money for food. “I wish I had spent everything I had to buy it for him so he could have played with it before he died.”View image in fullscreenLulu al-Ghussain (left) with her elder sister.Photograph: SuppliedBoth children also dreamed of the day Israel would lift its blockade of Gaza, so they could taste chocolate, instant noodles and their mum’s best dishes. For Lulu that was the Palestinian chicken dish musakhan, for Karam, shawarma. “They had all kinds of food plans for me to prepare,” Heba said.Israel imposed a total siege for 11 weeks starting in March that brought Gaza to the brink of famine, and the very limited food, fuel and medical supplies allowed in since May have not relieved extreme hunger.Unprecedented malnutrition is killing children, and preventing injured people recovering, a British doctor working theresaid this week.Trying to get food has been a deadly gamble for months, with more than 800 people killed since late May in near daily attacks by Israeli soldiers using weapons including tank shells and navy cannon to target desperate crowds near food distribution points.Trying to get clean water is also a struggle. Nearly two years of Israeli attacks have destroyed water treatment plants and pipe networks. In June Unicef warned that Gaza faces a human-made drought and that without fuel to operate remaining stations children could start dying of thirst.But until Sunday, there had not been any mass killings of people trying to collect water. The al-Ghussains sent their children to collect supplies for the family because they thought it was less dangerous than searching for food.View image in fullscreenChildren wait to fill water bottles at a distribution point in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAid groups brought water in trucks to fill tanks at a water distribution station just a few streets away from the school where the family sought shelter after their own home was bombed. Karam would wait there in the sweltering heat for his turn at taps that often ran dry.“I had no choice but to send them,” Heba said. “Many times, my son would go and wait for his turn, sometimes for an hour, only to end up with nothing because the water would run out before it reached everyone.”When he did get water, it was only 20 litres, very little for a family of seven but a heavy weight for a young boy. “Karam was only nine years old and braver than dozens of men. He carried it without tiring or complaining.”View image in fullscreenKaram al-Ghussain.Photograph: SuppliedThe long queues meant that Heba was not too worried when she heard the water station was hit. Her son left home not long before the bombing, so she assumed he would still have been at the back of a waiting crowd, some distance from the blast.As it turned out the queue was relatively small when he arrived, a stroke of fatally bad luck that probably delighted Karam in his last few minutes. It meant that when the bomb hit, he and his sister were right beside water station.“When Lulu woke up, I told her to go help her brother carry the water containers. It was as if the missile was waiting for her to arrive to strike that place,” Heba said.Ali Abu Zaid, 36, was one of the first on the scene, rushing to help survivors. As the dust and smoke cleared they revealed a horrific tableau.“Each child was holding a water bucket, lying dead in place, covered in their own blood. The shrapnel had torn through their small bodies and disfigured their faces. The smell of gunpowder filled the area,” he said.People started loading the dead and injured on to donkey carts, as medical teams were slow to arrive, but there was nothing doctors could do for most of the victims.“Even if the ambulances had got there sooner, it wouldn’t have made a difference. There was no saving anyone, these were lifeless bodies, completely shattered.”View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the airstrike on the water distribution point in Nuseirat.Photograph: ReutersAshraf raced to look for his children as soon as he heard the blast, but arrived after their bodies had been taken away to find only blood-stained water containers scattered on the street, and a terrifying silence.So he headed to hospital to continue the search, where he found their battered bodies laid out on the floor, and collapsed over them in grief. He married in his 30s, late for Gaza, and when his children arrived they became his world. Karam and Lulu’s brutal deaths have shattered him.“When I saw them like that, I felt as if my heart was being stabbed with knives,” he said. “I’m still in shock. I’ve become constantly afraid of losing the rest of my family and being left alone. I feel as if I’m going to lose my mind.”View image in fullscreenLulu (left) and Karam (right) with their father, Ashraf al-Ghussain, and their two other siblings.Photograph: SuppliedHeba also went to look for Lulu and Karam at the water station but then headed back to the shelter, hoping to find them waiting with their dad. Perhaps she had learned a kind of grim optimism from previous brushes with death.The siblings had been rescued from the rubble of their home when an airstrike brought it down on top of them earlier in the war, and survived injuries after another bomb hit nearby. That streak would not last. “They survived twice, but not the third time,” Heba said.Word of the children’s fate had reached the school, but even in Gaza, where no family has escaped tragedy, the scale of Heba’s loss was shocking.“The news of their martyrdom was already spreading, but no one told me,” she said. “No one dared to deliver such terrible news.” Instead they encouraged her to go look for them among the injured in al-Awda hospital.There she found her husband, and the shattered bodies of their beloved son and daughter, so full of life just a couple of hours earlier.Israel’s military blamed the strike on a “malfunction” that caused a bomb targeting a militant to fall short and hit the children, and said it was examining the incident.View image in fullscreenAbandoned water bottles where Karam and Lulu were killed.Photograph: ReutersAshraf questioned this. “They have the most advanced technology and know exactly where the missile will fall and who the target is. How could this be a mistake? A ‘mistake’ that killed both of my children!”The family couldn’t afford a burial plot for the children, so they interred them beside Heba’s father. They worry they may have to reopen the grave again for the youngest of their three surviving children if aid to civilians does not increase. At 18 months, Ghina is malnourished and has skin rashes because the family cannot afford nappies and don’t have enough water to wash her.“We sleep hungry and wake up hungry, and thirsty, too, with the desalination stations barely operating,” Heba said. “The entire world sees everything, yet they close their eyes as if they don’t.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warAccess to waterMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As of 26 June, the number of malaria cases had risen to119,648, with 334 deaths, according to the Zimbabwean health ministry.The distribution of essential control methods, such as mosquito nets, was also disrupted, leaving hundreds of thousands of people exposed to mosquito bites across the country. The health ministry said in May that 1,615,000 insecticide-treated nets were being distributed but that there was a shortfall of 600,000 due to the withdrawal of US funding.Itai Rusike, director of Zimbabwe’s Community Working Group on Health, said funding shortfalls were jeopardising the country’s significant gains against malaria over the past 20 years.“Sustained domestic funding is critical to keep prevention and treatment efforts on track,” he said.“If mosquito nets and preventive medicines for pregnant women are unavailable, lives will be lost. When the supply of test kits and first-line treatments is disrupted, malaria cases and deaths will spiral.”Children under the age of five account for 14% of total malaria cases.Zimbabwe has set out to eliminate malaria by 2030, in line with the ambitiousgoal set by the African Union, using various strategies such as raising community awareness, preventing mosquito bites with insecticide-treated nets and spraying, as well as improving surveillance systems.Dr Henry Madzorera, a former health minister, said Zimbabwe should mobilise its own resources to bridge the funding gap.“We have a lot of taxes earmarked for the health sector – let us use them wisely for health promotion and disease prevention,” he said. “People must be treated early for malaria.“The country should not rely on donors to do malaria-elimination activities,” Madzorera added.In 2024,USAID disbursed $270m for health and agriculture programmesin Zimbabwe.View image in fullscreenIn 2024, USAID provided $270m for health and agriculture programmes in Zimbabwe, such as this dam.Photograph: USAIDZimbabwe’s deputy health minister, Sleiman Kwidini, admitted the funding gap left by the US cuts had disrupted the provision of mosquito nets.“We are now taking over the procurement of those nets after the US withdrew funding. We have just been disturbed, but our vision is to eliminate malaria by 2030,” he said.Prof Sungano Mharakurwa, director of Africa University’sMalariaInstitute, said it would take time to recover lost ground but added: “If we get funding, we can hit the ground running and promptly return to scoring successes again, until we beat this deadly scourge that is malaria.”How will Trump and Musk’s freeze on USAid affect millions around the world?Read moreHe said that since the Zento mosquito surveillance programme began in Manicaland province, there had been a marked reduction in malaria cases and it was about to be extended when the US cuts came.“Working with the National Malaria Control Programme, it had just been expanded,” Mharakurwa said. “It was poised to run for five years with national coverage when it was abruptly terminated.”Africa University data shows that Manicaland recorded 145,775 malaria cases in 2020 but just 28,387 after Zento was introduced in 2021. Malaria cases in the province had been further reduced to 8,035 by 2024 before more than trebling to 27,212 the following year, when US funding was cut.Mharakurwa said: “The malaria was back with a vengeance straight after, and [numbers of] cases that were waning rebounded in 2025, surpassing levels that had ever been seen since the beginning of the project.”Above-normal rains this year, which aided malaria transmission, had worsened the situation, he added.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentZimbabweMalaria (Society)Malaria (World news)AfricaGlobal healthInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this content"

Bolsonaro is expected to be convicted by the supreme court in the coming weeks and faces a jail sentence of up to 43 years.As the day of judgment nears, Trump has been increasing pressure on the court and President Lula’s administration. On 9 July, the US president announced he wouldimpose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian importsas of 1 August, partly as a result of the supposed persecution of his ally. The move triggered an outpouring of nationalist anger in the South American country, with Lula describing it as “unacceptable blackmail”.On Friday, after federal police raided Bolsonaro’s house andfitted him with an electronic tagto stop him absconding, Rubio announced further moves in support of the defendant, who he claimed was the victim of a “political witch hunt”.Writing on X, Rubio said he had ordered visa revocations for the judge leading the investigation into Bolsonaro, Alexandre de Moraes, as well as “his allies on the court” and their family members. Rubio did not name his other targets but the Brazilian newspaper O Globoidentified themas Luís Roberto Barroso, José Antonio Dias Toffoli, Cristiano Zanin, Flávio Dino, Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, Luiz Edson Fachin and Gilmar Ferreira Mendes.Two other judges who were nominated to the court during Bolsonaro’s 2019-23 presidency, André Mendonça and Kassio Nunes Marques, reportedly avoided the sanction, as did a third judge, Luiz Fux.Lula denounced what he called “another arbitrary and completely groundless measure from the US government”.“Interference in another country’s justice system is unacceptable and offends the basic principles of national sovereignty and respect between nations,” the president said on Saturday, adding: “I’m certain that no kind of intimidation or threat – from whoever it may be – will compromise the most important mission of our nation’s powers and institutions, which is to act permanently to defend and safeguard the democratic rule of law.”The Trump strategist Alex Bruesewitz welcomed Rubio’s announcement, calling Bolsonaro’s treatment “sick and wrong”.Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo, thanked Rubio for his decision. “Thank you very much for this fight in favor of free speech, we do believe in the same values,” tweeted Eduardo, who has been living in the US since February and has reportedly been lobbying officials there over his father’s plight.Trump’s interventions have appalled millions of Brazilians who hope to see their former leader held responsible for the alleged coup attempt, which culminated in the 8 January riots in Brasília.Lula’s institutional relations minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, called the visa cancellations “an aggressive and petty retaliation” and “an affront to the Brazilian judiciary and national sovereignty”.Even influential rightwing voices have criticised the US’s attempt to meddle in one of the world’s most populous democracies by imposing 50% tariffs.On Saturday, the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaperdescribedTrump’s behaviour as “unacceptable external interference in Brazil’s domestic matters”. “Trump has not only attacked our national sovereignty … [but also] stained the history of diplomatic relations between the two largest democracies in the Americas,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote.While the Bolsonaros have hailed Trump’s actions, they also appear to have grasped how theannouncement of tariffs has backfired, allowing Lula to pose as a nationalist defender of Brazilian interests and paint the Bolsonaro clan as self-serving “traitors”.Lula, who had been facing growing public disillusionment and an uphill battle to win re-election next year, has enjoyed a bounce in the polls since Trump launched his trade war, the brunt of which will be borne by coffee producers and cattle ranchers in Bolsonaro-voting regions, such as São Paulo.Celso Rocha de Barros, a political columnist, said he suspected the Bolsonaros had been blindsided by the scale of Trump’s attack.“I think [Bolsonaro] wanted some kind of penalty - something he could use to say: ‘Look, Brazil’s being punished because of Bolsonaro’s persecution. But [the tariffs] went far too far … [they] screwed Bolsonaro’s base,” said Rocha de Barros, pointing to their potential impact on agribusiness.On Friday night, Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio, post on X, calling on Trump to suspend the tariffs and replace them with individual sanctions. Soon after, however, he deleted the post.Explore more on these topicsMarco RubioMigrationBrazilJair BolsonaroTrump administrationTrump tariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They had secured 40% of the vote with two-thirds of the ballots counted.However, the Labor leader, Dean Winter, whose party experienced its worst-ever result in Tasmania with just 26% of the primary vote, didn’t concede defeat.He appeared to leave the door open to governing, if the Liberals couldn’t make it work.Tasmanians decide today if they can fix their political mess. Here’s what you need to knowRead more“The result of this election is that the Liberals will have the most seats, but it is uncertain as to how they will achieve a majority,” Winter said. “Another election is not an option, which means we need to figure this out.”The Greens retained at least five seats with 14% of the vote, while there are three independents, with counting potentially extending for weeks to determine four undecided seats.Rockliff would need to work with left-leaning independent crossbenchers to govern.Independents Kristie Johnston and Craig Garland, who both voted for the June no-confidence motion against Rockliffthat triggered the election, have been returned.Johnston urged the next premier to be more collaborative and said she wouldn’t enter into a formal deal for confidence and supply with either major party.“They need to negotiate and respect the views of parliament,” she said.Anti-salmon activist and independent Peter George has been elected aftera strong campaign in the federal election.The state Greens leader, Rosalie Woodruff, has called on Winter to “have a conversation” about forming an alliance with her party.However, Winter has repeatedly ruled out doing a deal with the Greens and on Saturday night also said he wouldn’t “be trading away any of Labor’s policies or our values”.The drawn-out post-election scenario, just 16 months after the previous poll, will further delay the parliamentary approval process fora new $945m stadium in Hobart.The venue, a condition of Tasmania’s AFL licence, is supported by the Liberals and Labor but opposed by the Greens, Garland, Johnston and Mr George.The new parliament will be very similar to the previous one, which included 14 Liberals, 10 Labor MPs, five Greens, five independents and one Jacqui Lambie Network member.Explore more on these topicsTasmanian politicsTasmaniaLiberal partyLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

More of a snarl perhaps, or a baring of the gumshield, as Dubois let his arms drop, giving Usyk time to freeze the moment, load up, take aim and unleash a fully extended left hand to the side of the jaw that made Dubois crumple, legs folding under him as his father, Stan,threw in the towel.Usyk defeats Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion once moreRead moreThis was always huge occasion for both fighters. For Dubois it was a chance to do something unprecedented, uniting the the heavyweight belts on British soil in front of 90,000 people. For Usyk it was another opportunity to assert his own greatness, to walk in with three belts and leave with four, and at the same time complete his constant secondary arc of representingUkrainein a time of war.Usyk is now the two-time undisputed heavyweight world champion. Most astonishing of all he seems to find with each of these fights new depths of will, control and finishing venom. Perhaps the best part here was Dubois got to execute his own gameplan, to look sharp, edge a couple of rounds and leave with his reputation, if not enhanced then at least preserved, and to do all this while also being violently outmatched. Facing Usyk at this level must feel like being battered off your feet while being simultaneously triple check-mated, thrashed at Cluedo and losing a game of dominos.At the end, Usyk said: “I want a rest.” He didn’t look like he wanted a rest, or needed one, or even really understands what one is. He mentioned Tyson Fury, Derek Chisora and Anthony Joshua. Do them all in one night, Oleks. In different ways. With a different walkout, and maybe just a single toilet break.This was another night when Riyadh season came to Wembley. Fight nights have a kind of festival vibe here, the pitch lassoed into a series of zones and stages, gangways thronged. The crowd was starry in the plush seats. Here is Jake Paul doing a peace sign. Here is Jason Statham in sunglasses. Closer to the ring it was the familiar royal court of influencers, oddballs, showmen faces, movers, shakers, Mr fix-its, Mr pay-for-its.View image in fullscreenDaniel Dubois looks dazed after being knocked down by Oleksandr Usyk.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesAs the main event approached Wembley had the feeling of a vast, humid, tropical shed, seized with an ever-rising field of event-glamour and title-flash. It felt like a blend of Vegas and a mass celebratory Saturday night out, Sweet Caroline, pints in the air, and all of this mixed with legacy issues, hall-of-famer ascent, the flags of war, the $200m purse, the Saudi project staging.Michael Buffer appeared, gravely tuxedoed, to do his town crier act. Nadya Dorofeeva, a kind of Ukrainian Cheryl Cole, sang a very affecting champions anthem. God Save the King got the full singalong treatment. Wembley looked magnificently alive, light show thrilling, crowd bobbing along to Chase & Status as Dubois emerged to flames and fireworks, dressed in a stark black T-shirt cut to reveal the vast expanse of his neck, swarming up from the foothills of his tiered and slabbed shoulders.Dubois waved a fist and looked focused. But there is always going to be a basic imbalance in the energy fields around these two fighters. Usyk is a one-man cause. He’s a battle standard, a living embodiment of his nation’s defiance of the Russian invasion. No boxer has ever represented his country to this degree, travelling the world draped in the flag while a bloody invasion continues in real time. It is an extraordinary state of being.View image in fullscreenThe Ukrainian flag on the big screen as the national anthem is played before Oleksandr Usyk’s fight with Daniel Dubois.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWhat does Dubois represent? How does he confront this one-man instrument of war? What is his narrative? Even Tyson Fury managed to concoct a kind of base, a following, the mental-heath activism, the deep male, Iron John, man-of-the-forest vibes. Dubois can’t be the bad guy. He’s a nice guy. He is in effect a one-man project, a sole trader. He represents hard work, clean living and paternal control. He represents the ability to do five thousand press-ups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He doesn’t actually need music and storytelling. He just needs to exist in the middle of all that noise, a cold, still centre, with a beautifully contained sense of menace just in the way he moves. At the weigh in Dubois had flared his neck muscles like a giant salamander. Usyk just stood there, 16lb lighter in his jewellery, all legacy, presence, certainty.‘Thirty-eight is a young guy’: Oleksandr Usyk mocks his critics after victoryRead moreDubois started as promised, taking the centre of the ring, working behind his jab, following it in a little more. It was an even start, and thrillingly intense from both men. Dubois was working hard, making Usyk think. This is always a high-wire act. Usyk is learning you while you come forward, decoding your moves, building his own own set of counter-patterns.Dubois brought challenger work rate and disruptive aggression. But there was also a sense of a fighter expending his energy, of Usyk absorbing it, and moving into ever-more dangerous territory. By round five Dubois had slowed. He was being encircled clockwise, picked off with combinations.Usyk is a small heavyweight by modern super-sized standards (he is the exact same dimensions, height and weight, as Muhammad Ali), but the mistake is to see this as a disadvantage, as opposed to his defining super-strength, bringing with it with it speed, agility, startling power. Here it was the viciousness of his finishing, the sense of a little genuine champion anger, that really stood out.Dubois deserves credit for being willing to fight everyone in front of him. There is a kind of freedom in this. Defeat here will still leave him in the top tier, with other pathways back towards this level. Usyk, meanwhile, remains in his own distinct space, endlessly adaptable, physically undiminished, a man fighting with a kind of light around him.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykUkraineEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

No pretext, nothing. It’s about destroying things and showing the territory belongs to you.”Prosecutors said vehicles, some with families and children, were attacked but there were no immediate reports of wounded drivers. “None of the motorists were physically assaulted. However, several are particularly shocked,” prosecutors said in a statement.Unrest had erupted nearby, in Val de l’Aurence, on the night of 14 July, France’s national day. Lombertie said this “very poor neighbourhood, with young people from immigrant backgrounds” had become a “lawless zone”.The Limoges prosecutor, Émilie Abrantes, said that although the neighbourhood was known for drug trafficking, there was no evidence linking the unrest to recent investigations into drug trafficking.France’s interior ministry said it would deploy a special security force to the city.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It has repeatedly said it is ready for a new round of talks but has not backed down from its maximalist war aims.At talks last month, Russia outlined a list of hardline demands, including calls for Ukraine to cede more territory and to reject all forms of western military support.Kyiv dismissed them as unacceptable and at the time questioned the point of further negotiations if Moscow was not willing to make concessions.The Kremlin said this month it was ready to continue talks with Ukraine after Donald Trumpgave Russia 50 days to strike a peace deal or face sanctions.The US president also pledged tosupply Kyiv with new military aid, sponsored by Nato allies, as its cities suffer ever-increasing Russian aerial attacks.Russian strikes on Ukraine claimed another three lives on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The head of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Sergey Lysak,said a factory had been damaged, a fire station destroyed and a five-storey residential building hit.“A hellish night and morning for Pavlohrad. The most intense attack on the city. Explosion after explosion. Russian terrorists targeted it with missiles and drones,” he said.Drones could be heard flying over Pavlohrad in the early hours of Saturday. There were cacophonous booms and orange explosions lighting up the night sky. The streets echoed with machine-gun fire as anti-aircraft units tried to shoot them down.In the morning, thick black smoke hung above the city. There were several fires. One exhausted resident, Oleh, said it had been the worst night he had known. “Nobody slept. We were all in shelters. There was a thunderstorm as well. We had explosions and rain together,” he said.0:28Explosions seen over city of Pavlohrad during Russian drone and missile attack – videoThe attack came soon after Gen Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, flew back to Washington after a six-day visit to Kyiv.

He also said Israeli intervention “pushed the country into a dangerous phase”.Late on Saturday, the interior ministry said clashes in Sweida city had been halted and the area cleared of Bedouin tribal fighters following the deployment.The presidency added in a statement that any breaches of the ceasefire would be a “clear violation to sovereignty”, and urged all parties to “fully commit” to it and end hostilities in all areas immediately.Syria’s internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida “with the aim of protecting civilians and putting an end to the chaos”, the interior ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba said in a statement on Telegram.A statement on Saturday by one of the three religious leaders of the Syrian Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri,saidthe ceasefire would guarantee safe exit for community members and the opening of humanitarian corridors for besieged civilians to leave.Correspondents with Agence France-Presse, however, reported clashes in the west of the provincial capital as Druze fighters battled armed Bedouin supported by tribal gunmen from other parts of Syria. The Druze fighters said those who had arrived to support the Bedouin were mostly Islamists.One armed tribesman, who identified himself only as Abu Jassem, told AFP that “we will slaughter them [the Druze] in their homes”.France’s foreign ministry urged all sides to respect the ceasefire. “France welcomes the announcement of a ceasefire in the Sweida region. It urges all parties to strictly adhere to it,” the ministry said. “Fighting and violence must cease immediately.”The US special envoy, Thomas Barrack, had announced early on Saturday morning that Israel and Syria had agreed to a ceasefire, after Israel sided with the Druze factions and joined the conflict, including by bombing a government building in Damascus.Barrack, who is the US ambassador to Ankara, said the deal had the backing of Turkey, a key supporter of Sharaa, as well as neighbouring Jordan.“We call upon Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons and together with other minorities build a new and united Syrian identity in peace and prosperity with its neighbours,” he wrote on X.Sharaa followed up on the US announcement by renewing his pledge to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities.“The Syrian state is committed to protecting all minorities and communities in the country … We condemn all crimes committed” in Sweida, he said in his televised speech.He also paid tribute to the “important role played by the United States, which again showed its support for Syria in these difficult circumstances and its concern for the country’s stability”.The EU welcomed the deal between Syria and Israel, saying it had been appalled by the deadly sectarian violence of recent days.But Israel expressed deep scepticism about Sharaa’s renewed pledge to protect minorities, pointing to deadly violence against Alawites as well as Druze since he led the overthrow of the country’s longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.In Sharaa’s Syria “it is very dangerous to be a member of a minority – Kurd, Druze, Alawite or Christian”, the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, posted on X.The UN had previously called for an end to the fighting and demanded an independent investigation of the violence, which has killed at least 940 people from both sides since Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).Map of Sweida provinceThe SOHRreported on Friday that the humanitarian situation in Sweida had “dramatically deteriorated” owing to an acute shortage of food and medical supplies. All hospitals were out of service because of the conflict and looting was widespread in the city.“The situation in the hospital is disastrous. The corpses have begun to rot, there’s a huge amount of bodies, among them women and children,” a surgeon at Sweida national hospital said over the phone.The renewed fighting raised questions about the authority of Sharaa, whose interim governmentfaces misgivings from the country’s minoritiesafter thekilling of 1,500 mostly Alawite civilianson the Syrian coast in March.‘Shot in the head, as if executed’: four days of violence end with hundreds dead in southern SyriaRead moreIt was Sharaa who ordered government forces to pull out of Sweida, saying that mediation by the US and others had helped to avert a “large-scale escalation” with Israel.A number of sources told Reuters that Sharaa had initially misread how Israel would respond to him deploying troops to the country’s south earlier this week, having been encouraged by Barrack saying Syria should be centrally governed as one country.When Israel targeted Syrian troops and Damascus on Wednesday,bombarding the Syrian defence ministry headquartersin the centre of the capital and striking near the presidential palace, it took the Syrian government by surprise, the sources said.1:10Israel launches strikes on Damascus as sectarian violence flares in southern Syria – videoDruze people are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes were a message to Syria’s president regarding the events in Sweida.But the Syrian government mistakenly believed it had a green light from the US and Israel to dispatch its forces south despite months of Israeli warnings not to do so, according to the Reuters sources, which included Syrian political and military officials, two diplomats and regional security sources.The violence erupted last Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, the SOHR said.The government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and the SOHR said the troops had sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters. The organisation reported that 19 civilians had been killed in an “horrific massacre” when Syrian defence ministry forces and general security forces entered the town of Sahwat al-Balatah.A truce was negotiated on Wednesday after the Israeli bombardment, allowing Druze factions and clerics to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out.Sharaa said in a speech on Thursday that Druze groups would be left to govern security affairs in the southern province in what he described as a choice to avoid war.“We sought to avoid dragging the country into a new, broader war that could derail it from its path to recovery from the devastating war,” he said. “We chose the interests of Syrians over chaos and destruction.”But clashes resumed on Thursday as Syrian state media reported that Druze groups had launched revenge attacks on Bedouin villages. Bedouin tribes had fought alongside government forces against Druze fighters earlier in the week.On Friday, about 200 tribal fighters clashed with armed Druze men from Sweida using machine guns and shells, an AFP correspondent said, while the SOHR reported fighting and “shelling on neighbourhoods in Sweida city”.Sweida has been heavily damaged in the fighting and its mainly Druze inhabitants have been deprived of water and electricity. Communication lines have also been cut.Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the local news outlet Suwayda 24, said the humanitarian situation was “catastrophic”. “We cannot find milk for children,” he told AFP.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, has demanded “independent, prompt and transparent investigations into all violations” adding that “those responsible must be held to account”.The International Committee for the Red Cross said “health facilities are overwhelmed, medical supplies are dwindling and power cuts are impeding the preservation of human remains in overflowing morgues”.“The humanitarian situation in Sweida is critical. People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.Syria’s minority groups have been given what many see as only token representation in the interim government since the former president fled the country, according to Bassam Alahmad, the executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a civil society organisation.“It’s a transitional period. We should have a dialogue, and they [the minorities] should feel that they’re a real part of the state,” Alahmad said. Instead, the incursion into Sweida sent a message that the new authorities would use military force to “control every part of Syria”.“Bashar Assad tried this way” and failed, he said.Government supporters, however, fear its decision to withdraw could signal to other minorities that it is acceptable to demand their own autonomous regions, which they say would fragment and weaken the country.If Damascus ceded security control of Sweida to the Druze, “of course everyone else is going to demand the same thing”, said Abdel Hakim al-Masri, a former official in the Turkish-backed regional government in north-west Syria before Assad’s fall.“This is what we are afraid of,” he told the Associated Press.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It said the reported Israeli shootings occurred far from its sites and hours before they opened. “We have repeatedly warned aid seekers not to travel to our sites overnight and early morning hours,” the group said.The Israeli military said it had fired “warning shots” near Rafah after a group of suspects approached troops and ignored calls to keep their distance. It said it was investigating reports of casualties, but noted the incident occurred overnight when the distribution centre was closed.Mahmoud Mokeimar told Associated Press reporters he was walking with masses of people – mostly young men – towards the food hub. Troops fired warning shots as the crowds advanced, before opening fire on the marching people.“It was a massacre,” he said. “The occupation opened fire at us indiscriminately.” He said he managed to escape but saw at least three motionless bodies lying on the ground, and many other wounded people fleeing.Akram Aker said troops fired machine guns mounted on tanks and drones. He said the shooting happened between 5am and 6am.“They encircled us and started firing directly at us,” he told AP. He said he saw many casualties lying on the ground.View image in fullscreenInjured Palestinian children wait for treatment in Nasser hospital after coming under fire from the IDF in southern Gaza on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSana’a al-Jaberi, a 55-year-old woman, said she saw many dead and wounded as she fled the area.“We shouted: ‘food, food’, but they didn’t talk to us. They just opened fire,” she said.Four other witnesses also accused Israeli troops of opening fire, according to the news agency AFP.“They started shooting at us and we lay down on the ground. Tanks and Jeeps came, soldiers got out of them and started shooting,” said Tamer Abu Akar, 24.Elsewhere, the civil defence agency reported that an Israeli strike on a house near Nuseirat, in central Gaza, killed 12 people, the latest in a series of deadly bombardments.More than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis andthe entire population is at risk of famine, according to food security experts, while distribution at the GHF sites has been described as“lethal chaos”.Last Wednesday, 19 people were killed in a crush near a GHF hub and one person was stabbed. GHFblamed the incident on Hamas, describing it as “a calculated provocation, part of a pattern of targeted efforts by Hamas and its allies to dismantle our life-saving operations”.Killing of young siblings at Gaza water point shows seeking life’s essentials now a deadly perilRead moreDr Mohamed Saker, the head of Nasser’s nursing department, told AP that most of the people who died on Saturday were shot in the head and chest, and that some were placed in the already overwhelmed intensive care unit.“The situation is difficult and tragic,” he said, adding that the hospital desperately needed medical supplies to treat the daily flow of casualties.Israeli and Hamas negotiators have been discussing an interim truce in the Gaza war, which would see 10 surviving hostages and the bodies of 18 others returned to Israel in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinians.On Friday, PresidentDonald Trumpsaid at a dinner that 10 hostages would “very shortly” be released from Gaza, but provided no further details.Speaking to lawmakers at the White House, Trump – who has been predicting for weeks that a US-led ceasefire and hostage-release deal was imminent – said: “We got most of the hostages back.

Here is a summary of today’s developments:At least 32 people were killed by Israeli fire while they were on their way to an aid distribution site in Gaza at dawn on Saturday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots at suspects who approached its troops after they did not heed calls to stop, about a kilometre away from an aid distribution site that was not active at the time.US president Donald Trump said on Friday that another 10 hostages will be released from Gaza shortly, without providing additional details.Trump made the comment during a dinner with lawmakers at the White House, lauding the efforts of his special envoy Steve Witkoff. Israeli and Hamas negotiators have been taking part in the latest round of ceasefire talks in Doha since 6 July, discussing a US-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire.The death toll from violence in Sweida province, heartland of Syria’s Druze minority, has risen to 940 since last weekend, a war monitor said, despite the announcement of a ceasefire, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead included 326 Druze fighters and 262 Druze civilians, 182 of whom were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”.Syria’s Islamist-led government said its internal security forces began deploying in Sweida on Saturday as the presidency called on all parties to respect a ceasefire following bloodshed in the predominantly Druze area that has left hundreds dead.In a statement, the Syrian presidency announced an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and urged all parties to commit to it and end hostilities in all areas immediately.Dr Omar Obeid, who heads the Sweida division at Syria’s Order of Physicians, said Sweida’s only government hospital has received “more than 400 bodies since Monday morning”, including women, children and elderly people.He said: “It’s not a hospital any more, it’s a mass grave,”Iraq has detained six local officials and suspended other public employees following a fire that killed 61 people at a shopping mall earlier this week, authorities said on Saturday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.The blaze, which broke out late on Wednesday in a newly opened shopping mall in the eastern city of Kut, is the latest fatal disaster in a country where safety regulations are often ignored.The number of people killed when a coach overturned in southern Iran on Saturday has risen to 21, with 34 having been injured, state media reported.The accident, the cause of which remains unclear, occurred near Kavar, a town about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the capital, Tehran.Share"

Donald Trump has called him an “attractive, tough guy”, while the EU was swift to bring Sharaa’s Syria out of international isolation.At home however, progress has been halting. Syria is still deeply divided, and negotiations to integrate the one-third of the country controlled by Kurdish forces has stalled. Talks to fully integrate the Druze-majority province of Sweida, where the current violence is unfolding, have been slow moving.Sharaa has vowed to protect the country’s minorities and has said repeatedly it is the ethnic and religious diversity of Syria which makes the country so special. In a speech on Thursday, he promised to hold accountable anyone who committed abuses against Druze, emphasising that Syria’s laws “guarantee the rights of all”.It will take more than a speech, however, to overcome the deep divides that have been carved into Syria over the more than a decade of war.This week, those divisions were thrown back into the open. The campaign on the ground, which pitted mostly Sunni government forces and allied Bedouin tribes against Druze fighters, was accompanied by brutal hate speech.In Telegram groups, men traded pictures of Syrian Druze women and joked about sexually assaulting them as tribal forces advanced into the Druze province. Fistfights broke out between Druze and Muslim students in Aleppo, hundreds of miles from the clashes, despite administrators’ protests.In Sweida, any faith in the Damascus government that had been built up over the last months evaporated as local people emerged to find their loved ones dead, many killed brutally. One local man said he would rather “die with dignity” than join the new Syrian state, after his uncle was killed.As soon as Syrian government forces withdrew on Thursday, Druze militias launched revenge attacks against Bedouin families, once again reigniting fighting between the two groups.The ability of the new Syrian state to mend the country’s social fabric is in question. The country’s new army, a patchwork of militias, seems to run wild whenever deployed. During the coastal massacres in March and this week’s violence in Sweida, government-affiliated forces filmed themselves as they abused civilians.In the face of violence, some of the Druze leadership in Sweida refused to lay down their weapons and suggested that force would not bring them into the fold of the new Syrian state.Complicating things is the involvement ofIsrael, which has styled itself as the protector of Syrian’s Druze, seemingly without asking them first. In the past, Israel relied on Russia to help maintain a buffer zone from its border with Syria, the threat then being Iranian-backed forces. It had little problem with Assad himself, affectionately referred to by Israeli analysts as “the devil we know”.Israeli airstrike hits Sweida city in Syria as Bedouin tribes clash with DruzeRead moreNow, Israel finds itself without a trusted partner in Syria. It has seized on the Syrian Druze as a pretext for renewed military intervention and its continued presence in southern Syria. Since Assad’s fall, Israel has occupied wide swathes of Syrian territory. This week, it resumed airstrikes,hitting the Syrian defence ministryin Damascus and dozens of Syrian military targets in the south.Many Druze resent Israel’s suggestion of patronage, fearful it will further isolate them in a country where Israel is despised.It also unclear how the Israeli military intervention will affect the ties between Tel Aviv and Damascus which, with US prodding, had been warming over recent months. Syria’s president had even suggested eventually normalising relations with Israel – something that now seems far off.The US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said in an interview with the New York Times in early July that progress on democratisation and inclusivity were not part of the US criteria for its relations with Damascus. He further condemned past US attempts at “nation building” and meddling in the internal affairs of countries in the Middle East.“Everyone in this neighbourhood only respects power, and President Trump has established America’s power as a precursor to peace in spades,” Barrack said.Experts, however, have stressed that it is only dialogue, not power, that will bring peace to Syria.On Friday, 57 Syrian civil society organisations signed a letter calling on Syria’s new authorities to redouble their efforts to achieve transitional justice and ensure accountability for the sectarian violence in Sweida and elsewhere.The letter noted that the government had still not released the results of an investigation meant to ensure accountability for the coastal massacres in March, which was due in early July.In Sweida, clashes continued, as Bedouin tribes mobilised to invade the Druze province, burning houses as they went. Calls for an end to the fighting were ignored, dragging Syria deeper into the cycle of violence.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The deal has not been confirmed by either Syria or Israel.A ceasefire between the warring sides on the ground was supposed to take effect on Thursday, but Sharaa’s office accused Druze fighters of violating it.Sweida has been heavily damaged in the fighting and its mainly Druze inhabitants have been deprived of water and electricity, while communication lines have been cut.Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of local news outlet Suwayda 24, said the humanitarian situation was “catastrophic”. “We cannot find milk for children,” he told AFP.The UN high commissioner for human rights Volker Türk called for an end to the bloodshed, saying “the protection of all people must be the utmost priority”.He demanded “independent, prompt and transparent investigations into all violations” adding that “those responsible must be held to account”.The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that “health facilities are overwhelmed, medical supplies are dwindling and power cuts are impeding the preservation of human remains in overflowing morgues”.“The humanitarian situation in Sweida is critical. People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.“Hospitals are increasingly struggling to treat the wounded and the sick, and families are unable to bury their loved ones in dignity.”The latest violence erupted on Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, SOHR said.The Islamist-led government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and SOHR said the troops sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters.The interim government has had strained relations with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities since it toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.This week’s fighting marks the most serious outbreak of violence since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and around Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last month, Mohammad Abdul Momen said he had asked the NCA to consider freezing the assets of several individuals, amid a flurry of post-revolutionary property market activity.To freeze or not to freezeDisclosures to the UK Land Registry show at least 20 “applications for dealing” have been submitted in the past year in relation to property owned by figures under scrutiny by Dhaka. Such documents typically indicate a sale, transfer or change to a mortgage.Three relate to £24.5m worth of property ultimately owned by members of the Sobhan family, the powerful dynasty behind the multibillion-pound Bashundhara business group, a conglomerate that spans cement to media.One, a four-storey townhouse in Knightsbridge, has been the subject of two recent transactions, the purpose of which are unclear. Until April last year, it was owned directly by Sayem Sobhan Anvir, Bashundhara’s managing director, via a company based in the United Arab Emirates.Sobhan is among several family members under investigation by the ACC for allegations including money laundering, the Guardian understands.In April, the property was transferred – apparently free of charge – to a UK business called Brookview Heights Ltd. Brookview is owned by a director of Orbis London, a real estate advisory firm with offices in Liechtenstein and Singapore that has acted for the Sobhans on property transactions in the past.The London home appears to have subsequently been sold for £7.35m to a newly formed company, whose sole director is an accountant with no online profile. The accountant is registered as the owner and director of multiple other companies that appear to be special purpose vehicles for multimillion-pound London properties.Land Registry records show that UK law firms have made two more applications for dealing on properties owned by another member of the Sobhan family, Shafiat, including an £8m mansion in Virginia Water, Surrey.A family member did not return a request for comment but has previously said that the family deny “all allegations of wrongdoing and will robustly defend ourselves against these allegations”.Members of the Sobhan family are among a clutch of UK property owners whose assets the ACC has asked the NCA to consider freezing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further three applications, understood to relate to refinancing, have taken place since.Lawyers for Anisuzzaman Chowdhury said he did not believe that there was any legitimate reason for any of his assets to be frozen and that the sale of the Regent’s Park property was agreed in 2023, before the revolution.According to reports in Bangladesh, the ACC has previously been asked by the chair of a large local bank, UCB, to investigate whether Chowdhury helped the London-based property developer obtain loans irregularly from the lender.This year, a Bangladeshi court imposed a travel ban on the developer, who denies any wrongdoing.A further three applications for dealing relate to properties owned by the son and the nephew of Salman F Rahman, who runs the Beximco business group, one of Bangladesh’s largest conglomerates.

They said “political upheaval” in Bangladesh had led to allegations being made against many people, adding that they would “engage with any investigation which takes place in the UK”.Joe Powell MP, the chair of an all-party parliamentary group examining corruption and tax, wants any such investigations to move quickly.“History tells us that assets can quickly evaporate unless swift steps are taken to freeze those assets while investigations are under way,” he said.Powell welcomed the action already taken by the NCA but urged it to “expand the net as soon as possible”.The Labour MP leads a group of parliamentarians that is targeting London’s reputation as a home for suspicious funds and those who enable the transfer of that wealth, particularly given the renewed focus on oligarchs that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

However, these mechanisms are profoundly inadequate to meet the urgent needs of children in Gaza,” said Carolin Ott from the law firm Leigh Day, who is leading the action.The families of the three children, aged two and five, have said an urgent evacuation is needed for critical medication and treatment they are unable to access in Gaza. To date, the UK has yet to offer itself as a receiving state for medical evacuations from Gaza,and campaigners have been pushing for a separate immigration route.The two-year-old, referred to as Child Y, has an arteriovenous malformation in his cheek which causes daily bleeding and has left him in critical condition.The other children, two siblings referred to as Child S, have been diagnosed with cystinosis nephropathy, a chronic condition also known as leaky kidney. They have already developed kidney failure and may need transplants. One of the siblings is no longer able to move.The action comes as Israel’s war on Gaza passed 650 days. Since 7 October, more than 17,000 of the 58,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the territory were children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that as many as 12,500 patients in Gaza require medical evacuation. As of 10 April, 7,229 patients have been evacuated to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the EU and the US. Of these patients, 4,984 have been children.However, organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, which has evacuated 22 patients, have called on more nations to help, as the limited destinations remain a challenge, said Dr Hani Isleem, MSF project coordinator for medical evacuations from Gaza.“Some countries are reluctant to take in patients, fearing they might be perceived as facilitating ‘forced migration’ or as taking on the burden of the patients’ extended stay,” he said.A government spokesperson said that since the start of the conflict the UK has provided healthcare to more than 500,000 people in thePalestinian territoriesthrough supporting field hospitals and medical supplies. In May, the UK announced a £7.5m package of support for medical care in Gaza and the region.“We have helped several children with complex paediatric conditions access privately funded medical care in the UK, supporting an initiative by Project Pure Hope, the spokesperson said.In May, two children arrived in the UK for medical care with the assistance of Project Pure Hope. It was the first time the UK let in a child from Gaza for medical care, which was privately funded, and is the only existing route for those in need of critical care. According to legal documents, the charity had requested a Gaza-UK pathway at the government’s expense and was refused.“We have been clear the situation in Gaza is intolerable and that there must be an immediate ceasefire. We urge Israel to let vital humanitarian aid in and allow Gazans to receive urgent healthcare, including allowing the sick and wounded to temporarily leave the Gaza Strip to receive treatment,” the government spokesperson said.The prime minister has also been urged to engage by Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, who wrote to Keir Starmer this month saying they “stand ready” to receive injured children from Gaza to be treated in the NHS.“We can’t do so without the support of the Labour government to get the children through the UK visa system and into Scotland,” said Swinney, who has not yet received a response from Starmer.The government has until 28 July to respond to the pre-action letter.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He is in custody waiting to be questioned.Two peoplewere arrested on Fridayin relation to the protests.Riot police wore helmets while crowds of men, some masked, surrounded a small counter-demonstration by anti-racism activists.Counter-demonstrators and police were pelted with plastic bottles, eggs and flour but the violence worsened as those in the crowd directly attacked officers and vandalised police vans.Dean Walters, 65, of Corner Meadow in Harlow, has been charged with affray and will appear at court in September after a separate protest on Sunday 13 July.A second man arrested for a breach of a dispersal order has been released on conditional bail.Thursday’s demonstration was the latest in a series of protests outside the hotel since an asylum seeker was charged with three counts of sexual assault.Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denied the offences when he appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court on Thursday, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month.Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: “The events in Epping on Thursday were shocking and have no place in our neighbourhoods. We understand the concerns of the local community and support everyone’s right to peaceful protest.“Unfortunately, across social media we are seeing inflammatory comments which suggest we were supporting and enabling certain protesters. This is categorically not true. We police without fear or favour, remaining impartial at all times and have legal responsibilities to ensure peaceful protest is facilitated.“Officers will act robustly and swiftly towards anyone intent on disrupting the local community’s right to have their voices heard.”Essex police’s assistant chief constable Stuart Hooper had urged people not to attend any future protests outside the hotel that have been discussed on social media.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some people were carried away while others were led away in handcuffs.The Metropolitan police said 55 people had been arrested in Parliament Square under section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for displaying placards in support of Palestine Action.The force added a further nine people were arrested for supporting Palestine Action within a separate large-scale march to Whitehall by the Palestine Coalition.Defend Our Juries said on X: “The UK government is complicit in Israel’s genocide against Palestinians. They are attempting to silence those who expose this complicity.”A woman who was detained in Parliament Square said: “We demand that Palestine Action is de-proscribed.“Our government is not only arming a genocide, they are using terrorism laws to silence people who speak out.“Palestine Action are campaigning for peace. They are dismantling weapons factories.”Greater Manchester police said they arrested 16 people, who remained in custody for questioning. Avon and Somerset police said 17 people were arrested during a protest in Bristol.At Truro Cathedral in Cornwall, eight people were arrested after protesters gathered to show support for Palestine Action. .Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement that about 30 protesters were involved in a “peaceful” Defend Our Juries demonstration.“A number of placards which were contrary to the law remained on display despite police advice,” the force said. “Eight people, two men and six women, were arrested on suspicion of offences under section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. They remain in police custody.”At a high court hearing on Monday, the co-founder of Palestine Action, Huda Ammori, will ask for permission to challenge the home secretary’s decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws.UN experts, civil liberties groups, cultural figures and hundreds of lawyers have condemned the ban as draconian and said it sets a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.More than 70 people were arrested last week at demonstrations across the UK where references to Palestine Action were allegedly made.Police Scotland arrested a man in Glasgow on Friday “for displaying a sign expressing support for a proscribed organisation”.The sign read “Genocide in Palestine, time to take action” with the words “Palestine” and “action” larger than the others. Another man wearing a T-shirt with the same slogan was charged with a similar offence last weekend at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans to ban Palestine Action last month, days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.The ban means Palestine Action has become the first direct action protest group to be banned under the Terrorism Act, placing it in the same category as Islamic State, al-Qaida and the far-right group National Action.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He told investigators he did not recall the incident.Dann, who was in the £120,000-a-year post for four years, faced other allegations of misogynistic name-calling and making comments to women with sexual connotations, according to Home Office sources.He denied the allegations, suggesting comments had been taken out of context and that selected evidence had been used during the investigation by the Home Office’s professional standards unit (PSU). He acknowledged during the process that some of his comments may have been careless, but said he had never intended to upset or offend.After a chaotic HR process, which one source said was littered with “procedural errors and delays”, the original grievance was eventually upheld on appeal.However, Dann was not informed about the process until the initial stage was completed. He was also subject to a parallel misconduct investigation into the claims which was not upheld.Dann decided to leave the Home Office in December last year, standing down as the COO of Border Force, a role that placed him at the centre of the organisation’s key responsibilities, including securing the UK’s borders by enforcing immigration regulations and patrolling coastlines during the small-boats crisis. He has since entered the private sector in the field of security and law enforcement operations, and public safety.The complainant first reported Dann in February 2024, after working with him for 18 months. An initial internal grievance inquiry was launched two months later, with the final PSU report quoting named Home Office officials who appeared to confirm a series of sexist and misogynistic comments, according to sources.While the complaint was not initially upheld, it was later upheld on appeal in October 2024. Dann was not involved in this process and was not given the opportunity to respond.At the same time a separate misconduct process was launched, also based on evidence in the PSU report. This was not upheld, no formal disciplinary sanction was imposed, and there was no record of it on Dann’s file, although Home Office sources said he was asked to undergo training in response.The claims being investigated included the colleague being told in a voice note that she was “very pretty”, which the PSU report concluded was “reasonable” for her to have interpreted as harassment. Other comments were described by the report as “inappropriate and offensive” and “unprofessional topics with a sexual connotation”.According to sources, the report said he messaged about one person who attended a meeting suggesting that she had a “porn star name”, which he told the inquiry was meant in a “lighthearted” way. On a separate occasion, he was said to have misnamed a female colleague “kinky”, although he later admitted this had been a “careless” thing to say.During a discussion on the diversity of his office, Dann allegedly said: “Don’t forget the sweaty woman in the corner”, referring to a colleague going through menopause. In the report, he denied making this comment.In another meeting, in December 2022, he asked junior colleagues if they knew what a “fluffer” was, and then explained it was “someone whose job was to keep a porn star’s penis erect”, sources said. He denied to investigators that he had made the remarks.On the official visit to Border Force in Paris in April 2023, he brought up the Channel 4 naked dating show Naked Attraction to two female officers working in intelligence. In remarks corroborated by witnesses, he added: “We were thinking it could be all the regional directors and, you know, people had to look at it and guess whose penis it was.”The officers were “very shocked” by the conversation and felt “incredibly uncomfortable”, a senior official told investigators, but when they were asked if they wanted to make a complaint they said they would prefer that Dann not return to the Paris office. This was reported to Border Force chiefs. Dann told them he did not recall the incident.One senior official who witnessed the exchange said they were “disappointed” by Dann’s conduct, which they felt was “inappropriate”. Several others said they considered that he was “prone to oversharing” about his private life at work, sources with knowledge of the report said.Do you have information about this story? Email: pippa.crerar@theguardian.com. For the most secure communications see theguardian.com/tipsThe appeal, which was based on the same evidence in the PSU report, was finally concluded eight months after the initial complaint. It was after the Labour government entered office, and six weeks later Dann left his role, declaring that after nine years at the Home Office it was time to “embrace new challenges”.In a letter to the complainant in October 2024, the Home Office upheld the grievance, acknowledging that Dann’s conduct had fallen below the standards expected from a senior official and was in breach of the department’s policies on appropriate behaviour, sources said.However, Dann – who was previously a “people champion” and diversity lead in the civil service, roles that focused on improving the workplace environment, as well as representing the organisation in parliament and in the media – avoided any formal consequences because the separate earlier disciplinary process had already concluded and the rules meant it could not be reopened.According to sources, Dann told the initial investigation he had worked incredibly hard in a stressful frontline environment. Much of his time running Border Force operations was when the Tory government was struggling to get control of irregular migration, including small-boat crossings.Several of the witnesses said they had not been offended by his behaviour. However others, including senior civil servants and junior frontline operational staff, found his conduct inappropriate and unprofessional, according to sources who have seen the final PSU report and with knowledge of the final outcome.During the PSU investigation, Dann denied some of his conduct and said other incidents had been taken out of context, and that selected evidence had been used. But sources said he added that “on reflection” there had been times when some of his comments had been “careless”, although they were not meant in a malicious way. When approached by the Guardian, he declined to comment.Yvette Cooper, who was home secretary throughout the latter part of the grievance process, has repeatedly and vocally called out workplace discrimination, misogyny and harassment. The case was flagged with her office although she is understood not to have been personally aware.A Home Office spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on individual HR cases, where there are allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual harassment the Home Office will investigate and take appropriate action.“The Home Office expects the highest standard from all members of staff and does not tolerate anyone displaying or taking part in unacceptable behaviour.“The new permanent secretary has already commissioned a review of complaints, conduct and disciplinary procedures, to ensure absolute confidence in the integrity of the system.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Scotland has a yellow warning for rain from 4pm on Saturday until midday on Sunday.A prolonged downpour comes as thunderstorms move in from France that could “lead to some significant surface water flooding during Saturday morning” and may cause “significant impacts” in more urban areas, the warning said.Frequent lightning and localised surface water are also possible, and motorists have been urged to take care. The weekend is expected to be busy on the roads as many schools in England and Wales break for the summer holidays.The Met Office said flooding of homes and business was likely and could happen quickly, and that some communities may be cut off should roads flood.“The situation is evolving, and warnings may be changed or added,” the Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said.London is particularly susceptible to surface water issues during thunderstorms because of the prevalence of impermeable surfaces. Under the amber warning, 20 to 40mm of rain could fall in an hour, with as much as 70 to 100mm accumulating in just a few hours where heavy downpours persist.“There will be spells of more pleasant weather in parts of the UK through the weekend, with some sunny spells in between systems as they move through,” said Page.Temperatures are expected to stay in the high teens to low 20s with persistent cloud and rain, but could reach mid to high 20s in the south during brighter spells.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Taylor, 46, was inside one of the tents and was crushed by the truck when his tent was flattened, the lawsuit says.City officials had called for the clearing of the encampment in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr holiday. The encampment was blocks away from Ebenezer Baptist church, where King had preached. An autopsy report later revealed Taylor’s pelvic bone had been broken and that he suffered damage to organs and internal bleeding.Charges dropped against Atlanta journalist detained by IceRead more“A tent that was occupied by a human being was crushed by this heavy equipment. That’s obviously wrong,” Harold Spence, an attorney, said. “Nobody looked inside the tent, and if someone who looked inside had taken 10 seconds to do so, this tragedy could have been averted. And if you don’t know what’s inside, you don’t crush it.”The lawsuit filed in Fulton county state court asks for a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages, as well as repayment for medical expenses, funeral costs and legal fees. It was filed against the city and seven unnamed city employees, including the driver of the bulldozer.A spokesperson for Andre Dickens, the mayor ofAtlanta, said in a statement “the incident involving Mr Taylor was a tragedy” but that he could not comment on pending litigation.The US supreme court ruled last year that cities across the country can enforce bans on homeless camping. But clearings are controversial.Taylor’s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment, who called the city’s policies on clearing encampments deeply inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets.“The sweep, prior to which the city failed completely to check the tents, is a stopgap measure to try to project a false, sanitized vision of Atlanta,” activists from the Housing Justice League advocate group said in a statement. “Taylor and everyone else living on the streets deserved much more than to be bulldozed out of the way for MLK weekend festivities. Everyone deserves to live in dignity.”The family’s lawyers described the lawsuit as a call for city leaders to treat homeless people as deserving of “respect and dignity” instead of rushing to clear their communities “as if they were invisible”.Typically, the city sends social workers and outreach teams to encampments over a period of months before issuing a final order to evacuate. Those teams work to place people in shelters and, ultimately, permanent housing.The city had been working with people at the encampment since April 2024 and had placed many into shelters, said Cathryn Vassell, CEO of the city’s homelessness organization, Partners for Home.City officials have said they are taking care to prioritize the safety and dignity of unhoused individuals. Right after Taylor’s death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. However, with the Fifa World Cup coming to Atlanta next year, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the controversial goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then.Last week, the city closed the camp where Taylor lived and said officials coordinated with the local non-profit to offer people living there housing with supportive services.Lawyers said they were grateful for the city’s efforts, but more work is needed. Members of the Justice for Cornelius Taylor Coalition said they are still paying for hotel rooms for eight former encampment residents. Taylor’s lawyers and family called on Dickens’ administration to cut through red tape such as issues with documents and help the others get housing.Taylor’s sister Darlene Chaney teared up during a news conference on Friday where lawyers announced the lawsuit as she re-listened to descriptions of the gruesome injuries her brother suffered.She said Taylor loved to read everything from science fiction to the Bible. He was eager to leave the encampment to rebuild his life, and stayed positive about his future even as barriers such as getting him an ID slowed that process down, she said. She misses his “annoying” weekly calls – and said now she only has one brother to annoy her. She misses having two.“We’re here, just because someone, in my own personal opinion, was lazy,” Chaney said.George Chidi contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAtlantaGeorgiaHomelessnessnewsShareReuse this content"

One union leader said the moves “will devastate public health in our country”.The agency’s office of research and development (ORD) has long provided the scientific underpinnings for the EPA’s mission to protect the environment and human health. The EPA said in May it would shift its scientific expertise and research efforts to program offices that focus on major issues such as air and water.The agency said on Friday it is creating a new office of applied science and environmental solutions that will allow it to focus on research and science “more than ever before”.Once fully implemented, the changes will save the EPA nearly $750m, officials said.Trump’s EPA aims to cut pollution rules projected to save nearly 200,000 lives: ‘People will be hurt’Read moreRepresentative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House science committee, called the elimination of the research office “a travesty”.“TheTrump administrationis firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people,” she said. “The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans’ health and safety.”EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement that the changes announced Friday would ensure the agency “is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while Powering the Great American Comeback”.The EPA also said it is beginning the process to eliminate thousands of jobs, following asupreme court ruling last week that cleared the way for Donald Trump’s plans to downsize the federal workforce, despite warnings that critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be out of their jobs.Total staffing at EPA will go down to 12,448, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels in January when Trump took office, the agency said.“This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars,” Zeldin said, using a government term for mass firings.The office of research and development “is the heart and brain of the EPA”, said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.“Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts upon human health and the environment,” Chen said. “Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists could be laid off, the documents indicated.The research office has 10 facilities across the country, stretching from Florida and North Carolina to Oregon. An EPA spokeswoman said that all laboratory functions currently conducted by the research office will continue.In addition to the reduction in force, the agency also is offering the third round of deferred resignations for eligible employees, including research office staff, spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. The application period is open until 25 July.The EPA’s announcement comes two weeks after the agency put on administrative leave 139 employees who signed a “declaration of dissent” with agency policies under theTrump administration. The agency accused the employees of “unlawfully undermining” Trump’s agenda.In a letter made public on 30June, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment.

He was shot during the struggle, the LA police department said.The department described the suspect who shot the driver as “a Hispanic male, approximately 5t, 9in tall, 180lbs, bald, wearing a blue jersey, and possibly armed with a silver revolver.” The man fled the scene on foot.Images from the scene from photographers and social media show debris, including shoes, strewn across the road, as surrounding areas were sealed off and emergency response teams arrived.“This is under police investigation,” VanGerpen added. “This will be a large investigation with the LAPD.”Partygoers in the club came out immediately to help the victims before the emergency crews arrived, he said.“They were all standing in line going into a nightclub. There was a taco cart out there, so they were … getting some food, waiting to go in. And there’s also a valet line there,” VanGerpen said. “The valet podium was taken out, the taco truck was taken out, and then a large number of people were impacted by the vehicle.”The LAPD confirmed that the investigation is ongoing.Associated Press contributed to reportingExplore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump, in denial over rising prices, targets Fed chief PowellCallum Jonesin New YorkThe White House is trying to drive out the Federal Reserve chair. Critics warn it would be a costly bid to pass the buckSat 19 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareMemo from the White House: inflation is “right on track”, it declared this week, citing the latest official data. Price growth is now “very low”, according toDonald Trump. The actual statistics paint a markedly different picture.Just six months after he regained power, in part by promising to rapidly reduce prices, Trump has presided over the chaotic rollout of tariffs on an array of overseas products that many have argued risk having the exact opposite effect.After a lull, the consumer price index (CPI) isback on the rise. In June, everything from fruit and washing machines to dresses and toys becamemore expensive.Businesses in the US and around the world have struggled to keep up with the Trump administration’s erratic rollout of its aggressive trade strategy: the daily White House soap opera of warnings, threats, confusion, deadlines, delays and drama.Can Trump fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell?Read morePutting to one side the steady stream of twists, cliffhangers and all-caps declarations, each episode has pushed US tariffs higher. The overall average effective tariff rate is now set to hit 20.6%,accordingto the non-partisan The Budget Lab at Yale, its highest level since 1910.Eventually, someone has to foot the bill.graph showing the US average effective tariff rate spiking to the highest level since 1910By Trump’s telling, the countries he targets will be forced to pay up. But in reality, tariffs are paid by the importer – US-based companies, in this case – and often passed on.Tariffs are a burden. One way or another, the impact typically is felt along each link of the supply chain, from the initial manufacturer to the customer who buys the finished product. “All through that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who pick up the cost,” noted Jerome Powell, theFederal Reservechair, at a recent press conference.“But ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid and some of it will fall on the end consumer,” added Powell. “We know that. That’s what businesses say. That’s what the data says from past evidence. So we know that’s coming.”The effect is not immediate, though. It might take Trump a matter of minutes to announce a tariff on Truth Social, but the full effects can take months to work their way through the economy.graph showing inflation has fallen, but remained stubbornly above the Fed’s targetAnd so Powell, and the Fed, has waited. For seven months now, at four consecutive meetings, the US central bank’s policymakers have sat on their hands and kept interest rates on hold. After dramatically raising rates to combat inflation, they want to see how prices respond to Trump’s tariffs before cutting them back.It’s early days. Prices are still rising, and by more than the Fed’s target of 2% each year. Officials want to know if Trump’s plan will make them rise faster.The evidence has so far been mixed. While consumer price growth accelerated slightly between May and June, the annual rate of wholesale price growth slipped. The Fed’s latest“beige book”, a semi-quarterly report of anecdotal economic insights from across the US, also released this week, described a relatively calm business landscape, despite persisting uncertainty.Assuming Trump’s announced tariffs are enforced, they will dent US economic growth by 0.1 percentage point this year and 0.3 percentage points next, according to modeling by OxfordEconomics. “The drag on the economy is predominantly tied to core inflation, which will temporarily be 0.2bps [basis points] higher than in the current baseline,” said its chief US economist Ryan Sweet. “Though the boost to consumer prices is modest, it still reduces growth in real disposable income and, by extension, consumer spending.”Inside the Fed’s headquarters in Washington DC, Powell and his officials are patiently monitoring the data while deciding their next steps. But less than a mile away, one man is not prepared to wait.In a series of increasingly bitter attacks, Trump has publicly lambasted Powell for being “too late” to cut rates, and claimed the Fed’s inaction is costing the US economy. He has called on Powell (whom he first tapped to be Fed chairin 2017) to quit, and unnerved Wall Street by raising the prospect of firing him.Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said: “If you replace Jay Powell with someone who is clearly doing whatever Donald Trump wants them to do, expectations about what inflation is going to do in the long run are going to spike and that’s going to create a real problem for the Fed in the long term.”The supreme court signaled it views the Fed chair as legally shielded from presidential removal, describing the central bank as a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” in aMay rulingabout two of Trump’s other firings.Trump is “highly unlikely” to fire Powell, he has asserted, before floating one reason he might have to go: a $2.5bn renovation of the Fed’s buildings. “I mean, it’s possible there’s fraud involved,” the president claimed. Powell hasreportedlyasked the central bank’s inspector general to review the project.Powell is due to finish his term in May, and has stressed he will remain in post until then. Advocates of the Fed’s independence insist the more important question is not whether the president can remove him before then, but if he should.“Once you no longer have the check of the central bank, which can raise interest rates as needed to curb inflation, you really start to raise the specter of runaway costs, runaway inflation, and it makes theUS economyless attractive for investors domestically and abroad,” said Ramamurti.Inflation is “right on track”, according to his administration. Economists are already concerned it is tilting off course – and Trump won’t rule out taking action that critics warn would shunt it off the rails altogether.Explore more on these topicsUS newsInflationEconomicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The president has historically respected the independence of thecentral bank, and kept out of its way – even if there was disagreement over policy.But, of course, it looks like Trump is following his own playbook. Here’s what we know is going on between Trump and theFederal Reserve.Trump calls Fed chair ‘a numbskull’ who ‘makes it difficult for people to buy a house’Read moreHere’s what we know is going on between Trump and theFederal Reserve.Why is Trump attacking the Federal Reserve?Trump’s on again/off again tariffs have rattled stock markets and business leaders and led to fears they will eventually cause inflation to rise again. Stock markets were quick to respond to – and recover from – the enormous levies. Economists at the Fed have taken a wait-and-see approach to assess the long-term impacts of Trump’s tariffs.Fed officials have had four meetings this year in January, March, May and June during which they could have changed interest rates. The Fed has two mandates – to promote maximum employment and keep inflation down. The jobs market has held up amid the tariff chaos but theFed is worriedthe levies will push up prices. At all four, they declined to touch the rates, citing economic uncertainty.The pause has made Trump furious.“‘Too Late,’ and the Fed, are choking out the housing market with their high rate,” Trump wrote on social media, using the “Too Late” nickname he has given to Powell. “I can’t tell you how dumb Too Late is – so bad for our country!”From Trump’s perspective, cutting rates could offset the impact that his tariffs are having on the US stock market. But for Fed officials, it would risk exacerbating inflation.In a rare public response, Powell directly pointed to Trump’s tariffs as the reason why the Fed has not been able to lower interest rates.“We went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,” Powellsaidearlier this month. “Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.”Recent inflationdatashowed that inflation ticked up in June. The annualized inflation rate went from 2.4% in May to 2.7% in June – the highest one-month leap since March 2024.Trump says Fed chair would resign if asked and condemns him over interest ratesRead moreThis doesn’t bode well for the possibility of any interest rate cuts at the Fed’s next board meeting at the end of July.Can Trump legally fire the Fed chair?The supreme court recently suggested that the president cannot fire the Fed chair, which would make it impossible for Trump to fire Powell, should he try to do so.While the court greenlit Trump’s firing of two officials serving on US labor boards, the court went out of its way to say the Fed has special constitutional protections.“The Federal Reserve is uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” the court wrote in the Maydecision.But the Trump administration is trying to find a legal workaround. Trump has recently startedaccusingPowell of potentially lying to Congress about the $2.5bn renovations taking place at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington.“I didn’t see him as a guy that needed a palace to live in,” Trump told reporters. “The one thing I would have never guessed is that he would be spending two and a half billion dollars to build a little extension on to the Fed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhen asked whether he saw it as a fireable offense, Trump said: “I think it sort of is.”Powell has asked an inspector general to review the costs of the renovations, which were originally slated to cost $1.9bn but rose to $2.5bn due to “unforeseen conditions”, according to the Fed’swebsite.In aletterto the White House’s budget office, Powell said that the Fed has “taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen since it was first approved by the board in 2017”.What does the Federal Reserve do?As the central bank, the Fed manages the money supply in the US, primarily by setting the interest rate. The interest rate affects how much it costs to borrow money for things like mortgages or other loans.When setting the interest rate, the Fed considers inflation and the labor market, what it calls its “dual mandate”: higher interest rates could bring down inflation, but negatively affect the labor market, while lower interest rates could do the opposite.Over the last few years, starting before Trump’s second term, the central bank has been trying to bring down inflation, which peaked at 9% in June 2022.Fed chair says Trump tariffs could make inflation worse as US stocks slide furtherRead moreTo do that, the Fed raised interest rates to a multi-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Just a few years before, at the height of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, interest rates had been close to zero.Late last year, the Fedlowered interest rates, which are now 4.25% to 4.5% – a whole point lower than where they were a year ago.US stock markets are very sensitive to Fed decisions. Stocks started to climb after September, when the Fed started cutting rates.What is the Fed’s case for independence from the White House?The Fed, which holds huge power over the economy, has to be extremely careful about each decision it makes.Moves made by the central bank can affect the stock market, the value of the US dollar and government bonds – which all, in turn, affect theUS economy.On the Fed’s independence, Powell said that officials “will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data and what is the way to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people”.“We will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJerome PowellDonald TrumpUS interest ratesInflationUnemploymentEconomic policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

At the age of 38, Usyk outclassed and outfought his British rival, who is 11 years his junior, to establish himself definitively as the best heavyweight, so far, of the 21st century.The end was as conclusive as it was crushing. A sharp combination set up an opening for Usyk’s crunching right hook. Dubois crumpled to the canvas then, bravely, he rose unsteadily to his feet. But the outcome had already been decided. Usyk moved in with shark-like speed and stealth. A shuddering overhead left detonated against the already listing head of Dubois who fell heavily to the canvas, his gumshield spitting helplessly from his mouth.Oleksandr Usyk v Daniel Dubois: undisputed heavyweight championship – live reactionRead moreThe referee began his count but even before he could reach 10 a white towel fluttered from Dubois’ corner. But the knockout was complete and the culmination of another masterclass by Usyk who, in only his eighth fight as a heavyweight, having moved up from cruiserweight, sealed his domination of boxing’s flagship division.Usyk raised his arms high as Dubois managed the slow, bleak walk back to the refuge of his shocked team. The champion then sank down on his knees on the blue canvas, covering his face with the gloves as the magnitude of his brilliant performance sank in. Usyk has now regained the IBF title which boxing politics had taken from him and gifted to Dubois last year. That largely meaningless trinket joins the WBA, WBC and WBO baubles which Usyk already owns and restores his status as the unanimous king of the heavyweight division – a position he first achieved 14 months ago when beating Tyson Fury. Dubois joins both Fury and Anthony Joshua in having suffered successive defeats by the Ukrainian wizard.View image in fullscreenDaniel Dubois on the canvas in the fifth round.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesBefore he left the dressing room to start the fight Dubois was embraced by his father, Stan, who has exerted such a controlling influence over his career while always predicting that he would one day become the dominant heavyweight on the planet. Usyk, however, awaited.Dubois walked to the ring first as the words “It’s my redemption story” were emblazoned across the screens inside Wembley. By the time he reached the entrance to the arena he was moving at a fast lick, almost breaking into a little jog at one point, looking full of menacing intent. Dennis Brown’s old-school reggae classic, Want To Be No General, boomed around him.At the first sight of the great Ukrainian, chants of “U-syk … U-syk … U-syk” reverberated around Wembley as he began his far more stately march to the ring. An eerie version of Ave Maria accompanied him. His face was etched in concentration and determination until, climbing over the ropes, he raised his right arm high. He was kissed and hugged by his cornermen just before the first bell.Usyk landed the first jabs as he showed his readiness to match Dubois in an immediate desire to control the centre of the ring.Boxingout of his usual southpaw stance, Usyk snaked out his crisp right jab, clipping Dubois cleanly. But with 30 seconds left in the round Dubois backed up Usyk in his corner. Usyk recognised the danger and managed to ghost away and then detonate a hard left against Dubois’ head.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk lands the knockout blow on Daniel Dubois.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIn the second round, sweat rolled down Dubois’ back as Usyk ducked under a scything right and snapped back his rival’s head with a beautiful straight left. Dubois’ corner urged him to impose himself and he closed the distance much more successfully in the third – only for Usyk, like a savage scientist, to nail him with punches as jolting as they were precise.Usyk was locked in, watchful yet spiteful, as he made sprays of sweat fly from the shaven head of Dubois. He only grimaced when late in the fourth round Dubois landed to the body and Usyk made a slight gesture to indicate that it had been close to the beltline.

There had been fevered speculation among Dubois’ backers that his relative youth, more imposing physical attributes and considerable power would be enough to result in the first defeat of Usyk’s decorated professional career – which also includes him becoming the undisputed cruiserweight champion of the world.Dubois appeared to be booming with an ambition and conviction which meant he had left behind the callow and deeply reserved young man who had once been so awkward outside the ring. A run of three impressive wins, culminating in a knockout of Joshua in this same stadium last September, had apparently transformed Dubois.But Usyk was simply too skilled, too smart and too seasoned for his younger rival. He remains the king of the hill, the most impressive man in boxing, and a symbol of soaring hope and searing defiance to Ukraine. The rest of us on a raucous night at Wembley are just lucky to have seen another burst of Usyk’s majesty.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsyknewsShareReuse this content"

History tells us leads can evaporate in just one. Dense rough, links bunkers, the scale of pressure attached to the oldest major. Open calamity is written in folklore. The ghost of Jean van de Velde still lingers. And yet, the bookmakers had Scheffler at only 1-8 to lift the Claret Jug. The fat lady had cleared her throat. Twenty holes. What sporting planet is this?It is possible to run out of adjectives for Scheffler. Unflappable, remarkable, relentless. Nobody will ever match the impact of Tiger Woods on golf but it really is no exaggeration to suggest Scheffler can be similarly dominant. Come Sunday evening on the Causeway Coast, Scheffler will surely be a four-time major winner and three-quarters of the way towards a career grand slam. This is only his 24th major start as a professional. In one of them, his pursuit of glory was undermined by being thrown into a police cell.The Open 2025: third round – as it happenedRead moreImmediately before the pandemic, nobody beyond golf geeks knew who Scottie Scheffler was. Confidence – or certainty – attached to what happens next is backed up by Scheffler winning on the last nine previous occasions when he has held a 54-hole lead. He is in pursuit of a 12th victory since spring of 2024.This advantage is to the tune of four shots. Li Haotong’s 69 means he is the closest to Scheffler’s 14 under par. Li will play in the final group of a major for the first time in an up-and-down career. Scheffler; 68, 64, 67. He has barely broken sweat.View image in fullscreenSecond-placed Li Haotong of China will play in the final group of a major for the first time on Sunday.Photograph: Stuart Kerr/R&A/Getty ImagesSaturday’s hope of a tussle was a brief one, as Matt Fitzpatrick chipped in for an eagle at the 3rd to tie the lead. Scheffler jabbed back by collecting two shots of his own at the 7th but Fitzpatrick’s birdie at the same hole kept matters interesting. Scheffler reached 13 under par by picking up a shot at the 8th.On the back nine there were two ridiculous par saves from Scheffler, at the 11th and 14th after finding deep foliage. The 16th is called Calamity for a reason; Scheffler made a mockery of its reputation courtesy of a birdie two. Fitzpatrick had erred at the short 13th, with his birdie two holes later offset by another mistake on the penultimate hole. The Yorkshireman closed on nine under after his level-par 71.Scheffler has promised not to overthink his position. This seems his finest attribute, a mindset that does not move dependent on leaderboards. “I like being out here competing,” Scheffler said. “This is why we work so hard, to have opportunities like this and I’m excited for the challenge of tomorrow. Winning major championships is not an easy task and I’ve put myself in a good position.“Going into tomorrow I’m going to step up there on the 1st tee and I’m going to be trying to get the ball in the fairway. When I get to the second shot I’m going to be trying to get that ball on the green. There’s not really too much else going on.” Simple, so blissfully simple. Try telling that to poor Matti Schmid, who shot 79.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was the issue with putts, Matt? “They just wouldn’t go in,” he replied with admirable candour. Fitzpatrick added: “Let’s be realistic, he’s five ahead. It’s not easy. But if you get off to a good start, then obviously put a bit of pressure on early doors and hope for the best ... You get three under through six, like some of the guys today, the 7th the par five and all of a sudden you’re kind of right back in it, you would hope. It’s clear what I have to do tomorrow.”The tournament minus Scheffler is a decent one. Rory McIlroy reached eight under par with a dramatic 66, his lowest score of the week, before wonderful crowds. McIlroy’s homecoming has been already been everything he could have imagined. The Belfast boy has Chris Gotterup, Harris English and Tyrrell Hatton for scoring company.On a day when chances were aplenty, the defending champion, Xander Schauffele, posted five under par to move to minus seven. Lee Westwood is out of winning contention at minus five but a back nine of 29 in glorious sunshine proved hugely enjoyable for the veteran. Westwood credited his wife and caddie, Helen, with triggering the run by providing the former world No 1 with a tuna sandwich on the 10th tee.Bob MacIntyre, who is now eight shots adrift, summed up the hopelessness of it all for mere mortals. At the start of 2025, MacIntyre asked his caddie to assess how far behind the world’s top-ranked player he was in various statistics. Said bag man gave up the process after swiftly realising MacIntyre, then 16th in the rankings, was closer in all departments to No 2 than No 2 was to No 1. It is not the sea air dominating in Portrush. Instead, an air of inevitability.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The team car was in the middle of the road, about 200 metres from the top of the ascent, when it struck the spectator, who was cheering the riders on.Tour de France 2025: Arensman wins blockbuster stage 14 in Pyrenees – as it happenedRead moreThe driver, the sports director, Oliver Cookson, was handed a 5,000 Swiss franc (£4,650) fine and a yellow card for “dangerous behaviour that endangered spectators”. A second yellow card triggers exclusion from the race. Local police have been investigating the accident.In a statement, Ineos Grenadiers said: “Our thoughts and sincere apologies go out to the fan who was accidentally and regretfully hit by one of our race cars while supporting the riders during today’s stage. Like all teams we take great care to maintain a safe race environment for everyone – including the passionate fans who make our sport so special.”On a murky day in the Pyrenees,Tadej Pogacarfinally allowed others their chance. Already the winner of four stages, the Slovenian controlled some tentative moves by Jonas Vingegaard in the closing kilometres, before outsprinting the Dane in the final 150 metres to increase his overall lead to 4min 13sec.Pogacar said the wet and misty conditions had affected his enthusiasm for the stage. “We were riding strongly, but also thinking to be safe. I was quite scared descending in white fog, you don’t even see the road,” the Slovenian said. “When you are riding super-hard for two and a half hours already and you come to top of the Tourmalet and you think: ‘Ah, it’s a descent, it’s easy,’ but then [there is] this really thick fog on the top – mist, bit of rain, slippery road – you still need to focus so much on the downhill.“It’s so different to when it’s dry and sunny. In this fog today, you could see maybe 20 metres ahead of you. We went really conservatively on the downhill and we managed in the end without any stupid mistakes.”View image in fullscreenIneos Grenadiers’ Thymen Arensman crosses the finish line to win stage 14.Photograph: Jasper Jacobs/Belga Mag/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Oscar Onley, who finished sixth on the stage, has moved into the top four as the Tour ends its second week. The Scot benefited from the withdrawal of Remco Evenepoel, who started the day third but quit the Tour at the base of the Col du Tourmalet.Evenepoel, clearly at the end of his rope afterFriday’s time trialto Peyragudes, was drifting behind well before the peloton arrived at the foot of the Tourmalet, but as the 19km climb began, it became apparent the Belgian’s race was run.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He didn’t have the legs to suffer. I think it’s wise not to continue. He still has some goals this year, and maybe if he’d continued in the condition he had, maybe the rest of the season would be lost.“Remco was very disappointed he had to leave the Tour. He is not himself. Already, this was the third day in a row that he didn’t feel great. You have to be very careful not to go over the limit and lose months instead of days.”With almost 5,000m of climbing packed into 125km of racing, it was one of the most brutal stages in recent Tours, but Pogacar was happy to let an earlier breakaway, which included Arensman, move clear, with Lenny Martinez, chasing yet more points in the King of the Mountains classification, also in the move. Crucially, the French rider was first over the mammoth and mist-shrouded Tourmalet and harvested enough points to move into the polka dot jersey lead, as the Tour exited the Pyrenees.Sunday’s stage to Carcassonne offers the sprinters a further opportunity for success, before the second rest day and the final week’s assault on the Alps.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingTeam IneosnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a blatant, cynical foul and frankly bizarre behaviour from the 33-year-old Hendrich, one of the most experienced players on the pitch. Grace Geyoro duly stepped up and did what just under half the takers have been able to do in this tournament and converted her penalty. Berger got a hand to Geyoro’s spot-kick but could not keep it out and the midfielder became France’s all-time top scorer at Women’s European Championships.For the remainder of the first half, Germany defied their numerical disadvantage with a brave performance of counterattacking football and they equalised when Sjoeke Nüsken darted to the near post unmarked to meet Klara Bühl’s corner and loop an excellent header into the far corner. The game ended 1-1 after extra time and the Germany coach, Christian Wück, was immensely proud of his side’s resilience with 10 players, saying: “I can say for certain that tonight was the best and hardest-fought performance I’ve seen from the team since I’ve known them – against an opponent who demanded everything from us. That was incredible.”View image in fullscreenSjoeke Nüsken of Germany celebrates her equaliser after her side had already been reduced to 10 players.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesFrance thought they had scored an outstanding team goal before half-time, when Delphine Cascarino’s instinctive back-heel into the net rounded off a flowing move, but she had been in an offside position. Another offside decision, confirmed by the VAR, also ruled out a French “goal” early in the second half, when Geyoro tucked in on the rebound from Berger’s close-range save from Marie-Antoinette Katoto; Maëlle Lakrar was offside and deemed to have interfered with play, much to the frustration of France and Geyoro, who had run to celebrate with her teammates next to the substitutes’ bench.Sjoeke NüskenGermany were doing an excellent job of stifling their opponents with a valiant defensive display and then – suddenly – at the other end, they were awarded a penalty when Selma Bacha clumsily fouled the superb Jule Brand. Cue German joy in the stands, but it was short-lived as Pauline Peyraud-Magnin saved Nüsken’s penalty, which had been fired slightly to the left of centre, and a relatively kind height for the keeper.Berger produced the save of the tournament so far in the first 15 extra minutes, wowing everybody in the stadium asshe somehow leaped backwardsto make a one-handed save to prevent an own goal from her teammate Janina Minge, with the keeper magnificently managing to claw the ball off the line when it had been behind her body. She was superb again in the shootout, making two saves – including the decisive one from Alice Sombath’s sudden-death strike – to complete a stunning result. On the way she also scored a spot-kick of her own. Modestly, she said afterwards: “All the credit should go to the team, not me. Everybody here should talk about the performance of the team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The France head coach, Laurent Bonadei, denied that his team had a psychological problem, saying: “My team has progressed very much and gave us a lot of hope. Rome was not built in one day. We will continue to work really hard so that one day this team will get a trophy.“Germany deserves their qualification because they defended very well. Usually we manage to create more chances.

What if Dr Frankenstein had turned up at Pemberley and conducted a waspish romance with Elizabeth Bennet? What if Akela was not just a wolf but a werewolf? What if famous and attractive Tennis Player X were having a fling with famous and attractive Tennis Player Y? And what ifArsenalactually signed a centre-forward?There hasn’t yet been time for reality to intervene. It’s like the day after the World Cup draw when everything exists in a realm of pure perfection and you can imagine theplatonic idealof each country facing off, unsullied by form, injury or disputes over bonuses.Club A needs a left-winger who can cut in on to his right foot, contributing six-to-eight goals a season and opening space for the overlapping full-back. Player B is a left-winger who can cut infield, and therefore this must work, earning Club A imaginary points to contribute towards that absurd modern notion: winning the window.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreThe truth is that football teams are almost infinitely complex organisms, minute imbalances or frictions potentially having enormous consequences elsewhere. And players are human. Sometimes they struggle to deal with change: new teammates, a new manager, a new environment. No transfer is ever without at least some risk; nothing is ever guaranteed.Still, the early moves in the market are revealing, if not necessarily for what they may mean for how the title contenders may play next season, then at least for what they say about the state of those clubs and their perceived priorities.Getting your transfer business done early is one of the supposed markers of a decisive side that knows its own mind, which is good news for the four teams likely to be Premier League contenders – and rather less good news for Manchester United, who have moved to signMatheus CunhaandBryan Mbeumo, while struggling to offload any of the half dozen players who are surplus to requirements.The best time to build, the ancient wisdom has it, is from a position of strength, and Liverpool have done that, bringing in a pair of full-backsand Florian Wirtzat a total cost of around £165m. With Trent Alexander-Arnold gone and Andy Robertson now 31, the acquisitions of Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez are straightforward enough replacements and suggest the policy of attacking full-backs will remain.View image in fullscreenCould the arrival of Florian Wirtz (left) mean a change in position for Dominik Szoboszlai (centre) at Liverpool?Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesWirtz is a more complicated case, in part because of his versatility. He could operate as a false 9, or on either flank, but the likelihood is he will be used as a central attacking midfielder as part of a shift to more of a 4-2-3-1 shape than the hybrid 4-3-3/4-2-3-1Liverpooltended to use last season. That would mean either Dominik Szoboszlai plays less or that he is used deeper at times to add creativity against opponents who sit in a low block.Given Arne Slot’s lack of faith in Darwin Núñez, a move for a centre-forward was always likely. Exactly what game of bluff and counter-bluff – if any – wasbeing played around Alexander Isakremains unclear butHugo Ekitike is now the prime target, a mobile goalscorer who should improve Liverpool’s options playing in transition even if concerns remain about his effectiveness when he doesn’t have space to run into.While there has beeninterest in Luis Díaz from Bayern, Liverpool’s position on profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) is healthy enough that there is no need to sell the Colombian. Perming three or four from Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Harvey Elliott, Wirtz, Díaz and Isak or Ekitike marks a significant upgrade on last season.For Arsenal, after becoming the fifth club to finish as runners-up three years running, there is a sense of urgency. If not now, then when? How many more chances will this side have before the rump needs refreshing? That perhaps explains their targets.Christian Nørgaardis not especially eye-catching but adds useful defensive depth.Martín Zubimendishould have the tactical intelligence to protect the back four and so release Declan Rice. There will be those who doubt whetherNoni Madueke is worth £48.5m, but a winger who can play on either flank makes sense to ease the burden on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Benjamin Sesko had been the long-term target before Arsenal turned their attention to the older andslightly cheaper Viktor Gyökeres. Given Arsenal almost certainly do need a high-class centre-forward, saving £10m-£15m for a player five years older about whom doubts remain about his capacity to get shots away in tight spaces seems a questionable economy.Manchester City’s transition continues apace, with the arrival ofRayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders andRayan Aït-Nourito go with the four players they signed in January. All played some role in the Club World Cup. City’s4-3 defeat by Al-Hilalin the last 16 does not augur well, but it’s far from clear yet how reliable a guide the tournament will prove.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi is Arsenal’s marquee arrival in midfield.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesAfter all, Chelsea, fourth in the Premier League, won the thing by hammering Paris Saint-Germain, who beat three English sides on their way to the Champions League last season. Have Enzo Maresca’s side really improved so much?João Pedrolooks an immediate upgrade on Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward whileJamie Gittensshould be a useful addition on the left.Although a functioning team does seem belatedly to have emerged from the churn, it’s the sheer traffic through Stamford Bridge that is most eye-catching, less the careful accumulation of ingredients than a crazed trolley dash, with a lot of wastage as Maresca assembled his dish.And that perhaps is the underlying sadness in any discussion of transfers, the way that the game is instinctively viewed through a mercantile lens. It’s never about developing a player or tweaking a system, always about buying the next glossy off-the-shelf solution.Will any of it work? Who knows? But the feeling is all a little like 2016 after Leicester won the league and Southampton and West Ham finished in the top seven, when the elite went on a spree to reaffirm their status.

The Newcastle manager claimed the decision was taken to manage the striker’s minutes in pre-season, but also as a consequence of recent transfer speculation.Liverpool’s long-held interest in the Sweden international was confirmed this week with the Premier League champions being prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make him their new No 9.Marcus Rashford in talks with Barcelona after Manchester United agree loanRead moreLiverpool have since turned their attentions to Eintracht Frankfurt forward andNewcastle target Hugo Ekitikeafter being informed Isak is not for sale. The champions remain in talks over a fee for Ekitike, who is understood to have a €100m (£87m) release clause in his Eintracht contract, with a deal expected to be completed next week. Germany’s Sky Sport reported on Saturday night that a second written bid had been submitted.Howe admitted Newcastle are “desperate” to keep Isak, who has three years remaining on his contract, but added he could not give “100% clarity” on any player’s future.The Newcastle manager said of the striker’s absence in Glasgow: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”Howe, who also omitted Joelinton against the Scottish champions, added: “It’s difficult for me to give 100% clarity on any player. Alex is happy at Newcastle, he loves the players, the staff, the team. I’m confident he’ll be here at the start of the season. Yes, I’ve had discussions with him but that’s not abnormal. I respect a player’s career and how short it is. Alex has been really good, he’s trained really well and I realise there’ll be noise around him.”Liverpool’s decision to go for Ekitike, who made it clear he favoured a move to Anfield over St James’ Park before Newcastle pulled out of the race for the striker, represents another frustration in what has been a problematic transfer window for Howe.Newcastle have also missed out on João Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo and Liam Delap while their long-running pursuit of Burnley’s £40m-rated goalkeeper James Trafford is now in doubt with Manchester City linked with their former player.Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing much of Newcastle’s recruitment this summer, with Paul Mitchell having left as sporting director and Darren Eales due to depart on health grounds. They have completed only one signing so far, the £55m purchase of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford has held talks with Flick while his brother and representative, Dwaine Maynard, metBarcelonaofficials in Catalonia last month.Are Arsenal finally signing Viktor Gyökeres? It’s already real in the digital hive mind | Barney RonayRead moreThe England international is one of five United players who have been told they have no future at the club and made to train away from Ruben Amorim’s squad this summer. Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has been training at a gym in Salford and at United’s Carrington base, although only after first-team players have left.United value Rashford at £40m but, with no permanent offers arriving for a player who has three years remaining on a £325,000-a-week contract, Barcelona’s offer could suit all parties.The striker has ruled out a wage cut and wants to join a club in the Champions League rather than move to the Saudi Pro League. Talks between United and Barcelona are understood to be continuing but the outline of an agreement is in place.Flick wants to add versatile forwards to his squad this summer despite having Lamine Yamal and Raphinha at his disposal. Barcelona were interested in the Liverpool winger Luis Díaz but were informed the Colombia international is not for sale.Liverpool have rejected a €67.5m offer from Bayern Munich for Díaz. The Spanish champions also attempted to buy Nico Williams before the forward signed an eight-year contract extension with Athletic, his boyhood club in Bilbao.Rashford has spent 20 years at United, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for his boyhood team, but has not featured since beingdropped by Amorim for the Manchester derbylast December.

We watched that during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. Of course, you can see that the connection between him and Bruno [Fernandes] is still not there, but it’s going to be a good connection.”United head to the United States next week for the Premier League Summer Series against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton and hope to include Bryan Mbeumo in their travelling party. Old Trafford officials agreed a deal that could rise to £71m on Friday for the Brentford forward, who underwent his United medical on Saturday.After the game in Stockholm, Daniel Farke confirmed that he had told Patrick Bamford that the striker was not going to be involved in Leeds’ Premier League campaign, because of his fitness problems over the past couple of years. The Leeds manager said: “Patrick knows how much I value him as a player, I have spoken several times about this, and that I would have preferred a completely fit Patrick Bamford, in the last two seasons. He also knows how much I rate him as a person, but I thought it was my duty to have a very open and honest conversation with him right now, straight away with him.“The second day of pre-season I got him into my office and told him that he was not in my plans for the upcoming Premier League season, just in the fact that he had really difficult years in the last years.”Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordManchester UnitedBarcelonaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Especially the opening one. Yet when it is the first game for a manager at a club, the temptation is there. How can it not be? The initial glimpses offer the outline of the plan.Thomas Frank got his Tottenham tenure under way with a 2-0 win over Reading at the Select Car Leasing Stadium on Saturday afternoon. He played different XIs in each half and the goals came early in the second period from Will Lankshear and Luka Vuskovic. For the latter, it represented the gloss on an eye-catching first appearance.Howe confident Isak will stay at Newcastle after striker left out of thrashing by CelticRead moreWith the chair, Daniel Levy, looking down from the directors’ box, flanked by the technical director, Johan Lange, whose profile is fast on the rise, Spurs had too much for their League One opponents, who are also at the start of a new era,Rob Couhig having taken over as the ownerafter the turbulent tenure of Dai Yongge.The stadium was sold out, with the 3,000 or so visiting Spurs fans keen to proclaim themselves as “champions of Europe” after May’sEuropa League triumph. Expect to hear that on repeat in the coming months. There was plenty to pick over.How did Frank set up?The short answer was in a 4-2-3-1 formation, but Frank is all about flexibility and there were a number of takeaways, particularly in possession. He started with Mikey Moore on the left wing but the teenager was given the licence to drift inside to connect with the No 10, which at the outset was another youngster, Alfie Devine. This created the space for Destiny Udogie to push high up from left-back, with Spurs building in a back three. On the other wing, Brennan Johnson played high and wide. Of the central midfield pair, Rodrigo Bentancur sat and Pape Sarr pushed up at times. The approach with the ball was similar after the interval, although this time it was the right-winger, Mohammed Kudus – on his first appearance after signing from West Ham – who roamed inside, allowing the right-back, Djed Spence, to overlap. Out of possession, Spurs broadly pressed in a 4-4-2, with the No 10 squeezing high.View image in fullscreenDjed Spence (left) congratulates Will Lankshear for opening the scoring.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesWhat was notable in terms of personnel?Frank brought a 26-man squad and there were notable absentees – above and beyond the injured Dejan Kulusevski and Radu Dragusin plus James Maddison, who is only part-training with the squad after an injury of his own. Archie Gray, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel were given additional leave after their involvement in the European Under-21 Championship and did not travel, Frank preferring that they stayed at Hotspur Way to train in the morning. Richarlison did likewise. The striker was involved with Brazil up to the second week of June and he is taking care with his return in light of previous injury problems. As an aside, Richarlison is understood to be keen on staying at Spurs; only if something exceptional showed up would he consider leaving. Kota Takai, the new Japanese signing, was not inReading. He has a minor contact injury.Any sign of the Frank set-piece effect?It was certainly striking to see Spurs practise corners and free-kicks on the pitch about 20 minutes before kick-off, with all the outfield starters defending the deliveries from the youngster George Abbott, who would be an unused substitute. Attacking them were members of Frank’s coaching staff. He enjoyed great rewards on set pieces at Brentford and the early signs here were positive, both goals coming after corners from Kudus. The taker in the first half had been Pedro Porro. The opener followed a header by Vuskovic for Lankshear to nod home from close range and the second came after Kudus crossed low for Vuskovic, Reading having withstood the first phase of the move. There were no long throws, albeit there were minimal opportunities for Spurs to try one.View image in fullscreenLuka Vuskovic scores Spurs’ second goal.Photograph: John Walton/PAVuskovic makes his markThe towering 18-year-old Vuskovic, who played the second half at right centre-back, with Micky van de Ven to his left, agreed to move to Spurs from Hajduk Split in September 2023. There has been a lot of noise about his potential, a lot of expectation as he starred on loan at Westerlo in the Belgian top flight last season where he weighed in with seven goals. What an impact he had. The Croat had already clattered into one challenge and just about got away with a play-out-from-the-back move when he teed up Lankshear’s goal. His finish for the second was a beauty, a first-time left-foot drive, low into the far corner after Kudus’s pass. The Danish manager is blessed with centre-halves. Behind Cristian Romero and Van de Ven, he has Kevin Danso, Dragusin and Takai. Vuskovic would not be short of loan options if he were to sense he will not get the minutes he needs; Hamburg would be one in the Bundesliga. He wants to play at Spurs.Kudus is the real starIf it was easy to be drawn in by Vuskovic, it was impossible to ignore Kudus. Yes, it was only League One opposition, but the £54.5m new boy wowed with his sharpness and balance, his work in tight spaces, the impression he gave of always being in control of the ball and the situation. There was an explosion up the wing that led to a big chance for Jamie Donley, some lovely spins and time-buying feints, and the overall feeling that he seriously enjoyed himself.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurReadingThomas FrankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I always had faith.”Besides Morgan, Sarina Wiegman was able to bring on Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead, Grace Clinton, Niamh Charles and Michelle Agyemang, who scored England’s equaliser. Their efforts helped book a last-four spot against Italy on Tuesday, after a penalty shootout.Morgan added: “The depth we have in the squad is such an incredible thing for us to be able to fall back on through this tournament. That’s something we’re going to continue to rely on. When all of us sat down on the bench for the second half it was just: ‘Be ready to come on and change the game’ – and all of us were. We’ve just got such amazing character, grit and determination within the group that we’re never beaten.”Morgan’s own substitute appearance was her major tournament debut, and she was thrilled that her mother was there to witness it. “It was really, really special,” the 24-year-old said. “Apparently my mum was sobbing when I came on, bless her. It was just really nice to get that opportunity. I have been working hard throughout the tournament to stay prepared if I was called on.”Of the 19-year-old Agyemang, who scored her second international goal on only her third cap, Morgan said: “I’m so proud of the impact she’s been able to make. That’s twice now she’s stepped up in pressure situations. She’s someone that we know we can turn to in stressful moments to be a presence, holding the ball up and linking play, making runs in behind.“She’s just so chilled and positive all the time, and ready to take her opportunity. She’s such a hard worker in training and so you know that in those moments she’s absolutely ready to come on and make an impact, which is exactly what she did, just getting in great positions around the box. She’s proven all the times that she’s come on that she’s ready to go and make an impact when we need it.”View image in fullscreenEsme Morgan and fellow substitute Chloe Kelly (right) take off after England’s shootout win.Photograph: Ennio Leanza/APEngland were also grateful to two decisive crosses from the winger Kelly. “She’s an incredible player,” said Morgan. “She’s been training amazingly in the last few days, scoring a lot of goals, so she was high on confidence coming into that game. She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her to pull a performance out of the bag.

It’s already real in the digital hive mindBarney RonayThe Swedish striker has become more meme than man but he is the very good thing fans asked for, on a tray, ready to goSat 19 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareThe current edition of France Football magazine has a photo of Viktor Gyökeres on the cover. Not that I’ve looked at it much, or pored over its details searching for meaning, but the photo shows Gyökeres half in shade, half in sun, displaying his famously shredded physique, not so much the standard male musculature, more a selection of lines and bulges, like he’s made entirely from giant walnuts, like a perfect human challah loaf designed by a robot.In the photo Gyökeres is smiling with a kind of fervour, as though he’s about to sell you a miracle muscle powder. And I for one would buy this powder. Make me into a cyborg, Viktor. Maximise my hidden hyper-potential. Basically, I want Viktor Gyökeres to hold me brusquely in his arms while he talks about good proteins and explains the blockchain, in a way that isn’t sexual. Not for me anyway, but that definitely is for him.Noni Madueke will be unfazed by new Arsenal challenge and fans’ scepticismRead moreThere is also, and you’ve probably seen this – I for one have barely noticed it – a breathlessly excited Viktor Gyökeres profile in the June/July issue of Vogue Scandinavia, which has him posing by his pool in biscuit-coloured linens looking like an incredibly handsome psychopath. And yes, the profile talks about “piercing eyes” and “muscles stretching away at his white T-shirt”, but it’s not salacious or cheap because Gyökeres is also “a complex and multifaceted individual”, whose PlayStation-pad football house is in fact alluring, soulful and “a byproduct of transience”. Yes Viktor Gyökeres. Let me rescue you. I will make you a home. I will bake for you.To what extent does a thing still have to happen for it to be classed as real? This feels like a key question right now, not just in football, where everything is simultaneously happening and has already happened, but in life generally, the final battle between the fake and the real, a question that must be broken down into ever more granular questions. What is “real”? What is “happening”? What is “Viktor Gyökeres”?Despite the evidence above of rigorous journalistic research, I don’t really know much about Gyökeres beyond the stuff everyone knows. I have no great interest in whether he signs forArsenalor not until he actually does, at which point he will become just another guy in an ever-shifting cast of guys, something real that now has to actually happen. Reality can wait, though. We aren’t there yet. We are instead still drifting along in the endless summer of Gyökeres, witnesses to a yearning that feels like art, and that is in many ways better than actual football.We know this process now. It is necessary to fight it every summer. Don’t get sucked in. Look away from the churn. This one, however, feels like a step up. It has been two months of hive-mind longing over on GyökeresHereWeGoX, a place where details, comments, images bubble up and surge, overwhelm the senses, then disappear like summer storms.This seemed to have peaked on Thursday with EXCLUSIVE news that there would that same day be an EXCLUSIVE prefiguring the actual EXCLUSIVE, a here we go for the here we go for the here we actually go. Footage appeared of a house (is it a house?) that allegedly shows Gyökeres (is it him?) moving out his furniture (is it furniture?). Later, there was talk of a plane leaving Stockholm bound for Biggin Hill airport, complete with detailed flightpath screenshots, which was then rubbished by a secondary cohort of Biggin Hill truthers. Wait! His brother has followed Arsenal on Instagram! A medical is booked for Friday, even if there is no evidence of this, just talk about talk of a presumed medical on a hypothetical Friday.This has become a little over-ripe by now, a descent into 450-word long posts about the stock exchange, financial gaming and announcement-delay. Gyökeres himself has long since become more meme than man. Is it a joke? Is this all post-irony? If a plane takes off and nobody knows if Victor Gyökeres is on it, but excitement at the idea Victor Gyökeres may be on it feels real, is Victor Gyökeres actually inside the plane?.It would be easy here to dismiss this phenomenon, to see evidence of the idiot-trajectory of the human race, of content addiction, of the fact big Euro-football must never not be happening. But this is also a supremely well‑curated media industry now, fed by the great transfluencers of our time, Fab, Orny, the other ones.It is also a kind of mass social experiment. Psychologists like to talk about the Anticipation Effect, the principle that anticipation of an event can release more dopamine to the brain than the actual experience. Having Gyökeres in your team is good. Talking about Gyökeres, visualising this, war-gaming it, making it real in the digital mind: this is a life choice, something to make your blood move, like jabbing a fork into your kneecap just so you get to feel something.The emotions here are nuanced. Studies show anticipation also generates anxiety, to the extent it can overshadow the event itself, or make it feel like it has already happened. There are people out there who seem genuinely convinced Gyökeres is already not just a failure but a proven fraud.I can recite by heart the ratio of Portuguese league goals against teams in the bottom four (43.6%). Never mind the fact this always happens because those teams are worse, or that Erling Haaland, for example, has built a career around stamping on ants. Or that I am being sucked in here in real time, arguing over things that haven’t happened but still kind of have, like the whole thing is a super-smart Andy Warhol installation called Goal Abs or Nothing Is True.There are reasons why this one feels more significant. There are good human subplots. Can you make the leap up? Can a career that turned on a 17-goal season in the Championship become elite at this late stage? Gyökeres has been wrapped in a convincing origins story. There are Proustian elements, some talk in France Football of a sensory reconnection with the childhood lust for goals, the clank of the stanchion, the need to “start playing again like I did when I was a child”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s into the body. We know about his magic super-breakfast, the ginger shot, the strawberries, blueberries and pomegranates, plus three – not two, not four – eggs. He seems to be pitching himself as real, analogue, anti-academy. Gyökeres says he stayed at IFK Aspudden-Tellus so long because “it built me differently from others”, and I for one can already hear him saying this on a seven-hour Joe Rogan podcast.The spell at Brighton is dismissed as not “a good environment”. A return to the Premier League would be a chance for “revenge”. Arsenal host Graham Potter’s West Ham in October. We’re talking about revenge. We’re self third-personing (“You haven’t seen the best of Gyökeres yet”). Is he as good as Kane, Lewandowski, Haaland? “It’s difficult to rank me, but yes, I’m at the same table as them.” How could you not want to see this?View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres puts away a penalty to complete his hat-trick for Sporting against Manchester City last November. After failing to shine at Brighton his career took off at Coventry.Photograph: Pedro Nunes/ReutersThere are also two football things that make it interesting. First, this is the perfect what-if transfer. It’s beautifully linear. It’s 2+2. Saying Arsenal need a striker has gone on for so long it has become a kind of mass lament, a bardic cycle. The current candidates are Gabriel Jesus, an almost guy, and Kai Havertz who is good but also looks like the foppish minor cousin a Jane Austen heroine is required to fall in love with before the arrival of handsome, brooding Mr Lordly of Lord Hall.Well, now you get to sign a 27-year-old goal-maniac whose nicknames are The Machine, The Cyborg, The Viking, The Cannibal and The Tractor. This is simply the thing you asked for, on a tray, ready to go. Here is a very good No 9 with zero reasons not to succeed, who will probably do so because a stage has been built, and because of the evidence of hard numbers, which are all that really matter in this dynamic. The other thing here is closure. If Gyökeres does sign for Arsenal this will inevitably become a referendum on the Mikel Arteta era, which has become mired in a very annoying discussion about actual success. Is second good? Is this progress?Whatever you think of Arteta’s cinematic passion, the Lego figure on the heath pointing at the skies dynamic, it is undeniably real, undeniably a quest for victory. There will be a crunch point here. There have already been rumblings. The Thomas Partey saga was weird, unsavoury and remains a potential timebomb. Now youhave your Martín Zubimendi. You have the muscle-goal athlete, the finisher. Addition and success. Or limitations pinned and wriggling on the wall.For now we have the longest day, a here-we-go waiting to happen. Do I dare to scroll? Or can we linger a little longer, remain in that dream state, half in sun, half in shade, muscles perfectly sculpted, all promise, all what-next, before being dragged out into the light?Explore more on these topicsArsenalTransfer windowcommentShareReuse this content"

Now they’re finally being recognisedRead moreBut on another promising afternoon for Australia’s athletes, as they started building their preparations for the Tokyo World Championships, there was a setback for young miling sensation Cam Myers, whose promising bid in the meeting-concluding 1500m ended with an on-track bump.Olympic metric mile silver medallist Hull’s eyes must have lit up when Gudaf Tsegay seemed to be setting a suicidal pace in the mile, but as the Wollongong ace moved up to her shoulder, Ethiopia’s former double world champ found an extra gear to win comfortably in a new national record 4min 11.88sec.Hull’s substantial consolation was to lower her own Oceanian mark to 4:13.68. “I had a lot of distractions, but was just trying to zone into the leader in the second half, but it was a solid run,” said Hull.“Coming in, we were thinking I could run a national record, and I did. I would have liked to have been a little closer to 4:10, but I felt very strong for 4:13.“A lot of records fell today, so it was a pretty special to be a part of that race.”Earlier on Saturday, Davies clocked 14:31.45 for third behind the Ethiopian duo of Medina Eisa (14:30.57) and Fantaye Belayneh (14:30.90), her run eclipsing her previous national mark of 14:40.83, set in China in April, by more than nine seconds.Georgia Griffith finished fifth in a huge new personal best 14:32.82 to also smash the former record.“I was ready for a big race and felt like I responded to the challenge today,” said Davies.“My expectations were a PB (personal best) and I have achieved that so I am really pleased.”Former world champ Patterson was surprised her 1.93 metre clearance was enough to earn her the silver as even Olympic champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh had an off-day, allowing British home hope Morgan Lake to win with a 1.96m leap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, heproduced a blistering masterclasswhich resulted in a fifth-round demolition of Dubois. “Thirty-eight is a young guy, remember!” Usyk quipped. “Thirty-eight, it’s only the start!”Talking in the ring a few minutes after he sealed his dominant victory, the undisputed heavyweight champion said he had not decided who he might fight next. “I don’t know,” he said. “I want a rest. I want to be at home with my family, my wife, my children. I want to rest maybe two, three months. Just rest.”Usyk defeats Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion once moreRead morePressed to consider his options he said: “Maybe it’s Tyson Fury. Maybe we have three options. Derek Chisora. Anthony Joshua. Maybe Joseph Parker? I cannot say now, because I want to go back home.”Dubois was magnanimous in defeat, saying: “I have to commend him on his performance. I gave everything I had. There were probably a few things I could have sharpened up on. But take no credit away from the man, I’ll be back.”His trainer, Don Charles, praised Usyk but also promised that Dubois would return from his shattering defeat. “That’s a great champion, a generational great. If you’re going to lose, lose to someone like that, you understand? But he’s a young champion, Daniel Dubois. Twenty-seven years old, remarkable what he’s achieved to date. He’ll be back from this, stronger.”Frank Warren, who promotes Dubois, was equally floored by the imperious champion. “Oleksandr Usyk is a modern-day legend. He’s an unbelievable fighter. In any generation, he’d be a great fighter. And I take my hat off to him tonight. You know, Daniel was ready for it. He was up and trained hard. No complaints, no excuses. The better man won on the night. He is a fabulous, fabulous champion.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsyknewsShareReuse this content"

France had been utterly dominant in the group stage and Germany headed into the game off of the back of their biggest-ever women’s Euros loss, so France were the slight favourites. After 13 minutes, it felt as though it wasn’t Germany’s day with Kathrin Hendrich given a red card for a hair pull. A resulting Grace Geyoro penalty seemed to urge Germany on though and Sjoeke Nusken equalised from a corner. Germany’s defence worked tirelessly for the rest of the match and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger kept them in it with a save. Then Berger was a shootout hero to send them to the semi-finals.

It’s a slightly odd piece of theatre involving Heather Knight, Lauren Filer and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, which culminates in Wyatt-Hodge attempting to run out Filer with a samosa.England v India: second women’s cricket one-day international – as it happenedRead moreNone of the above were actually on show at Lord’s on Saturday – Knight is injured, Wyatt-Hodge is not in the ODI squad, and Filer was dropped for this fixture in favour of Em Arlott – but the key players on this stage were actually a different pair. Because, of course, the “Whack It Like Wyatt-Hodge” trailer was gently poking fun at the storm which erupted in September 2022, when Deepti Sharmacontroversially ran outCharlie Dean at the non-striker’s end.On Saturday, therefore, there was inevitably a certain frisson when Deepti came to the crease with India 72 for five, and quickly found herself facing Dean. A crowd that had patiently sat through the four-hour rain delay, which meant the match was reduced to 29 overs a side, were suddenly on the edge of their seats.Deepti narrowly survived the first ball of Dean’s second spell, which turned sharply and beat her bat. But she then saw off her remaining 11 balls without theatrics – eventually progressing to an unbeaten 30 as she tried to wrestle back some advantage for India, who struggled to 143 for eight on a pitch made stodgy by the rain.View image in fullscreenCharlie Dean boots the ball away after taking a catch off Smriti Mandhana.Photograph: Steven Paston/PADean had to be content with holding on to a catch at extra cover to see off Smriti Mandhana for 42, after earlier taking the return catch proffered up by Jemimah Rodrigues. Sophie Ecclestone, meanwhile, took three for 27, including rattling the stumps of Harmanpreet Kaur after Sophia Dunkley had twice let off the India captain at cover.Perhaps this match might pass without controversy, despite the recent tensions between these sides (Pratika Rawal was fined 10% of her match fee this week after barging Ecclestone and Filer duringthe first ODIat Southampton)? No: it was simply biding its time. The real drama came in the second act, in the fifth over of England’s run chase, when Tammy Beaumont appeared to deliberately kick the ball out of the way of the wicketkeeper, Richa Ghosh. Ghosh appealed for Beaumont to be given out obstructing the field, the umpires referred it upstairs, but Jacqueline Williams adjudged that Beaumont had merely been making her way back to her crease after deciding against taking a single.“Richa [Ghosh] and Jemi [Rodrigues] definitely felt that maybe she kicked it, but the umpires referred it and it was not out,” Mandhana said. As for the fact that the bowler who sent down the ball in question happened to be Deepti Sharma? “We cracked a joke about Lord’s and Deepti.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was despite an attempt at time-wasting by India, who referred a not-out caught-behind decision against Dunkley, despite Ghosh being overheard on the stump microphone telling Harmanpreet that Dunkley had not made contact with the ball. “We tried not to get drawn into it,” Jones said.The series decider takes place at Durham on Tuesday: don’t be surprised if there is more drama still to come.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamIndia women's cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Call the expert, of course. When she concluded a remarkable first full season as a runner withOlympic 1500m bronze in Parislast summer, Georgia Hunter Bell’s path appeared to be set. Why change a successful formula?But change she has, and victory over 800m in London on Saturday provided a second win in her past two Diamond League races over the distance, having won in Stockholm last month.This is where the problem has arisen for September’s world championships in Tokyo. Should she stick with the event in which she won her Olympic medal, should she target the shorter race over two laps or should she attempt an audacious double that has increasingly fallen out of fashion over recent years?View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell celebrates after winning the women’s 800m in her second-fastest time ever.Photograph: S Bardens/British Athletics/Getty ImagesHelpfully, she has the perfect sounding board in her contacts book: “I might actually reach out to Kelly Holmes and see what she thinks.”Holmes, who memorablywon Olympic 800m and 1500m goldin 2004, initially contacted Hunter Bell after the Paris Games last summer. The relationship has since developed into something akin to a mentor and a mentee. So, after triumphing over a strong field at the London Stadium in 1min 56.74sec – the second-fastest time of her life – Hunter Bell is keen to hear what Holmes thinks of it all.World Athletics Championships: London’s 2029 bid gets Starmer backingRead more“Doing the double [at the world championships] is an option because the schedule’s actually quite generous for it,” she said. “There’s proper days off; one event completes before the second starts. But I just think it’s really hard and you might stuff your chances at both. So I don’t know. A lot of people can have their opinion but there’s very few that have actually done it. I’d like to see what Kelly has to say about it.”There is an additional factor. Shorn of her training partner, and Olympic champion, Keely Hodgkinson – who is expected to return from a hamstring injury in the coming weeks – 800m times have somewhat stagnated. By contrast, increasing numbers of 1500m women continue to break new ground.“You’ve got to look strategically at the events,” said Hunter Bell. “The 1500m has got even faster than last year. I didn’t think that was possible, but it has again. Whereas the 800m, at the moment, is not as fast as it was last year. So if you’re trying to get a medal, what is actually the best thing to do?”Elsewhere, the anticipated battle of the British runners failed to materialise in the men’s 1500m as the young Kenyan upstart Phanuel Koech upset the 60,000-strong sellout crowd by outkicking reigning world champion Josh Kerr in the home straight to claim victory.View image in fullscreenPhanuel Koech runs away from Josh Kerr in the final straight to win the men’s 1500m.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockKoech, 18, had never run a 1500m race before last month, but now owns three of the six fastest times in the world this year after triumphing in a meeting record of 3:28.82. Despite tracking him for most of the race, Kerr was unable to keep pace in the home straight, finishing second in 3:29.37. Former world champion Jake Wightman came fourth, while George Mills fell with 200m remaining.Ever bullish, Kerr remains confident that the world title he claimed from Wightman will remain in Britain. “Yeah, 100%,” he said. “The title lives here and it will continue to live here for the next year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Britain initially finished second, only for the American winners to later be stripped of their title after Antonio Pettigrew, who died in 2010, confessed in 2008 to doping between 1997 and 2003.“On the one hand it’s a real shame it’s taken this long,” said Thomas. “But on a personal level, it’s really beautiful today.

He has jumped to six under, at this point only four shots off the lead, with each birdie sounding like a sonic boom over Portrush. It is manic, messianic and a lot of fun. And then it gets weird. Twilight Zone weird.McIlroy has just twirled a drive into the rough at the 11th. For a moment he fears that his ball is lost, only to get the all clear from the marshal. Better still, he will be playing from trampled-down ground. He pauses. Takes aim. And then as his ball flops wearily into air, a member’s Titleist ball, which has been deeply buried under ground, suddenly jumps up beside him.McIlroy smiles in disbelief before telling his caddy: “I was on a golf ball!”View image in fullscreenAn old golf ball (in the centre of frame) is unearthed by Rory McIlroy during his shot.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenWhat are the chances?!Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images“It’s never happened to me before,” he says later. “Just a really weird – I had obviously no idea there was a ball anywhere close to my ball.“It was so, so strange. I thought I was going to get a flier, and I looked up at my ball, and I could see it spinning up against the wind.”It costs McIlroy a bogey five, and to add further insult he hears the roars signifying that Scottie Scheffler has just moved to 12 under par, seven shots clear of his score. But after the cruel comes the divine.McIlroy is now on the 12th, about to caress a 56-foot eagle putt down the slope, right to left. It trundles steadily along before appearing to lose pace 10 feet from the hole. “It’s gotta go,” says the man fromGolfDigest, crouching just off the green. And it does. Only to slow down again. “It’s gotta go,” he says again.The roars tell you what happens next. The ball disappears down the hole. And suddenly fans are jumping. Many throw their hands in the air. There are cries of “Rory! Rory!”. He is now seven under and beaming.“The eagle on 12 was one of the coolest moments of my career – it’s one of the largest roars I’ve ever heard on a golf course,” he says later. “To get those shots back straight away was nice.”The crowds surrounding McIlroy were so deep throughout the third round that many supporters were forced to rely on secondary senses to work out what was going on. The frequent eruptions from the galleries. The urgent cries of encouragement. And, especially in the first few holes, the smell that something mystical might be in the air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But then chances went begging. The 375-yard par-four 5th has been one of the easiest holes all week. But after a booming drive into the light rough, McIlroy was unable to get up and down for birdie. While on the par-five 7th, which had a scoring average of 4.53 on the day, another chance slipped by.Still, another birdie at the 15th left the Northern Irishman signing for a 66 and tied for fourth on eight under. He is six shots behind Scheffler. But he is still hoping for a miracle.“It was incredible,” he said of the atmosphere. “It was so much fun. I got off to the perfect start, three under [on the day] through 4. Felt like at the end of the front nine there, at least through 11, the par on 7 felt like a bogey, and then the bogey on 11.“Then to play those last seven holes at three under I thought was a good effort. Yeah, I played well. I rode my luck at times, but it was an incredible atmosphere out there. I feel like I’ve at least given myself half a chance tomorrow.”The same could not be said for the champion here six years ago, Shane Lowry, who shot a three-over-par 74 and then revealed he had been up most of the night with a stomach bug. “I’m not great,” he says. “I haven’t eaten today yet. I tried to get a protein drink down me after eight holes, and I felt like throwing up all over the place. Yeah, it’s been a tough day, but I’m not going to make excuses. I played poorly today and obviously had a bad finish.”Lowry, who is now three over for the tournament, adds: “You get home late and have to dust yourself off and wake up at 2.30am with cramps in my stomach. “McIlroy will hope for a smoother night before the mayhem begins again. “I started Oppenheimer last night,” he says. “Try to get through another hour of it tonight and maybe finish it tomorrow morning.”He knows, though, that the way Scheffler is playing, it would take something out of a Hollywood movie to defeat him.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenRory McIlroyEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Groups involving Stenson and DeChambeau, though, were still warned over timing. Stenson admitted he “vented” to referees after signing for a 69.The Open 2025: third round updates on Moving Day at Portrush – liveRead more“We got a warning on the 10th green that we were three minutes out, so five minutes over the allotted time frame,” said the 2016 Open winner. “I had joked yesterday with the other guys about the first two days, first round took about an hour over the allotted time. Second round was four to five minutes over. I said: ‘We just have to wait until halfway through Saturday or Sunday and someone is going to come up to you and say that you’re two minutes over and they’re going to start pushing you on.’ That’s exactly what happened.“I think if you can play an hour over time scheduled in one day, then all of a sudden two minutes is of huge importance the next day, it feels a bit inconsistent to me.”View image in fullscreenHenrik Stenson said the approach to timing on the third day was inconsistent with what happened on the opening day.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesDeChambeau was similarly baffled. After a 68, the two-time major winner confirmed his pairing had been put on the clock on the 17th. “I was moving my butt as fast as I could,” he said. “Greens were really tricky. I was trying to read them right.“It’s very simple. It’s not difficult at all. You eventually time everybody for their whole entire round. Very simple. Nobody wants to do it because people are too scared to get exposed, which I am an advocate for. I’d love to be timed, and I have no problem with that. My putting, I’m more deliberate, take more time on that, but when it comes to iron shots, off the tee, I’m pretty fast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wish it was just a new system. I think it would be more fair towards everybody. If somebody is playing slower, the guy can go up to him and say: ‘Hey, man, you’re over par with your time.’ All you do is you just time them for every single shot. He gets there and puts the bag down, and how long it takes him to hit that shot and how long it takes him to walk to the green. It’s not rocket science.”Lowry was unwilling to delve back in to the controversy that saw himhit with a two-shot sanctionlate on Friday. The Irishman did say fellow players have been supportive. “Something needs to be changed for sure,” said Jon Rahm of the rule which Lowry fell foul of. Lowry was adamant on Friday he did not see his ball roll backwards in rough at the 12th hole during a practice swing, with officials determining he was in breach. “I just don’t know exactly how they could change it.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenBryson DeChambeauHenrik StensonPGA TourEuropean TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Robert F Kennedy doesn’t seem too botheredSat 19 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTSharePregnant women are increasingly shunning vaccinesDo you enjoy getting sick from preventable diseases? Do you have a hankering to make once-declining viruses great again? If so, why not pop over to the US where the health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr, and his anti-vaccine cronies are making a valiant effort to overturn decades of progress in modern medicine?Let’s start with measles cases, which are at their highest ratein 33 yearsin the US. The blame for this doesn’t rest entirely with the Trump administration, of course, but officials certainly don’t seem too bothered by it all. RFK Jr hasdownplayedthe number of deaths that have occurred from measles and complained about all the headlines they’re generating.Like the rest of his peers in the Trump administration, RFK Jr seems to have absolutely no idea what he is doing, and appears to be just making things up as he goes along. Indeed, the health secretary memorably told Congress in mid-May that he doesn’t really think people should be takingmedical advice from him. He seems to have forgotten that statement the moment the words left his mouth, however. Not even a couple of weeks later Kennedy announced that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wouldstop recommending Covid-19 booster shotsfor healthy children and pregnant women. This was a highly unusual move, as the health secretary doesn’tnormally make unilateral changesto vaccine recommendations like this.While Kennedy seems to govern by vibes, actual medical experts, who rely on things like evidence and data, are deeply alarmed by the removal of the shots from officials’ recommended immunization schedule.“[D]espite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said in astatement. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”Kennedy’s decision is now facing legal opposition. In the same week that the US reached its dark measles milestone, a number of leading medical associationssued the Trump administration. “This administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,” said thelead counsel for the plaintiffsin a statement.Restoringtrustin public health agencies and vaccines, especially among pregnant women, will take far more than a lawsuit. Two new surveys, published as a research letter in Jama Network Open, have foundthat only 35% to 40% of US pregnant womenand parents of young children say they intend to fully vaccinate their child. To reiterate: we are now at a place where a majority of pregnant women and parents don’t plan to accept all recommended kids’ vaccines.“Given the high decisional uncertainty during pregnancy about vaccinating children after birth, there may be value in intervening during pregnancy to proactively support families with childhood vaccination decisions,”the researchers wrote. Unfortunately, under this administration, that’s a lot easier said than done.Epstein is dead but Trump can’t bury himThe president is throwing a fit over backlash to his administration’ssudden U-turn on the “Epstein Files”. On Wednesday he accused his voters of being gullible “weaklings” who had fallen for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax” which, according to him, is a “SCAM” cooked up by the “Lunatic Left” to discredit him. (If it’s all a hoax, why is Ghislaine Maxwell in prison, eh?) Then, on Thursday,Status News reported that Trumphad called the editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal to try to block its storyon Trump’s relationshipwith the disgraced financier. No matter how many insults he flings around or threats he makes, Trump can’t bury the bigger Epstein story. Instead people are more invested in finding out who Epstein’s associates were than ever before and polls show most Americans believe the government isconcealing information.

Black women are three times more likely to develop fibroids than white women. July is Fibroid Awareness Month and, on Tuesday, the actor helped introduce a USuterine health legislative packageaimed at introducing better prevention and screening protocols and less invasive treatments. “I hope to seek answers for the far too many women dealing with uterine fibroids,” Nyong’o said. “We must reject the normalization of female pain.”Democratic Women’s Caucus demands investigation into treatment of women in Ice detention“We are deeply concerned about women’s access to health care, especially maternal health care, in ICE detention,” the caucus wrote in a letter.

Change their tuneJoan C WilliamsCampaigning on ‘protecting democracy’ isn’t appealing for non-college-educated voters. So why haven’t Democrats changed their message?Sat 19 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareDoing the same thing and expecting a different result – that’s the definition of insanity. So I fall into despair when I hear yet another news story, and yet another politician, talking incessantly about assaults on democracy. It’s as if folks have read no post-2024 election polling. Defense of democracy was atop issue for Democratsbut way, way down for those who voted forDonald Trump: their top concerns were inflation and the economy.Democratslost the popular vote. They need to attract voters they lost in the last election. What’s complicated about this?Assaults on democracy are driven by narcissistic authoritarianism, for sure – but they’re also a strategy to control the narrative in ways that aid and abet the far right.Democratsneed to stop walking into the same old trap, and supplement defense of democracy with a viable strategy to lure back enough non-college-educated voters to win elections.The first step is to understand why defense of democracy doesn’t work with non-college voters. Bothwhite voters and voters of colorwithout degrees typically care more about the economy than democratic norms. Inequalitypredicts low trustin political institutions, and the US has a serious inequality problem. Many feel democratic institutions have failed them: while over 90% of Americans did better than their parents in the decades after the second world war,only about halfof those born in the 1980s will, with particularly sharp declines in “blue wall” states Democrats need to win.You may not know it, but the Democratic primaries for 2028 are already under way | Osita NwanevuRead moreDemocrats’ failure to connect with non-college voters has been analyzed as an institutional problem of “the groups” inside the beltway – the web of non-profits that reflect the values of the8% of Americanswho are progressive activists. But Democrats’ problem is less an institutional than a cultural problem.Many Democratic candidates feel compelled to keep talking about the issues their core college-educated constituencies care most about – defense of democracy, the climate crisis, abortion rights – in language that appeals to college graduates.What a gift for Maga: in 2024,84%of voters cared more about the cost of living than the climate crisis and79%cared more about the cost of living than abortion rights. Only18%of voters said “preserving American’s institutions” was more important than “delivering change that improves Americans’ lives” (chosen by 78%).Remember thefamous ad: “Kamala Harris cares about they/them. Trump cares aboutyou.” That definitely attracted the transphobic – but it also attracted working-class people angry that Democrats weren’t campaigning on the kitchen table issues that mattered most to them. The path forward for Democrats is to learn how to connect with non-college voters, using three arguments.First, Trump is not focused on the kitchen table issues he ran on. Second, he has cut government programs that provide security for ordinary Americans in order to finance huge tax cuts for big business. Third, he’s playing checkers in a world where the big boys play chess, making American weak again in the process.For college grads, the key point about Trump’s tariffs is that they’re chaotic and “dumb”. But the key point for voters without degrees is that Trump isn’t delivering on his core election promise to make middle-class life work for hardworking Americans.Themost effective ads of 2024focused on economics: one called out the cost of rent, groceries and utilities; another decried Trump for fighting “for himself and his billionaire friends” to finance a national sales tax that would raise prices on middle-class families (which is precisely what tariffs do). Democrats should provide a clear contrast, insisting on a society “where hard work is repaid with a stable life” (to quote Zohran Mamdani’sacceptance speech).Tariffs take us in the opposite direction. Not only do theyraise prices for American consumersbut they also hurt two constituencies non-college voters care about: farmers and small business. America’s most farming-dependent countieswent forTrumpby 77%; tariffs cut American farmers off from key markets abroad forsoybeans,almondsand other agricultural products. Trump’s tariffs also threatened to destroysmall businesssupply chains– the small flower shop that imports flowers from Mexico and the small manufacturer whose supply chains includes Canada – which is whymore than half of 600small business owners surveyed expressed concern about tariffs. That’s important because they representtwice the proportion of voters as compared to Europe. Non-college grads hold small business inhigh esteem; it’s themost trusted institutionin the US. Many non-college Americans’ fondest hope is to own a small business so they can stop being order-takers and become order-givers instead.College grads are upset that the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) hasterminatedNational Science Foundation grants (including mine), andfiredclimate scientistsat the Environmental Protection Agency. But for non-college voters the key message is that Doge is robbing the settled middle class of the security they yearn for and deserve.Ethnographiesshowagainandagainthat stability and order are highly valued by theblue-, pink- and routine white-collar voterswho are flocking to the far right.Will the Democrats learn from Zohran Mamdani’s victory? | Bernie SandersRead moreTrump’s budget cuts include blue-collar jobs, such asfederal firefighters. Alsotargetedis the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which helps ensure that ordinary Americans don’t fall out of the middle class when their house floods or burns down in a wildfire. Doge also hasfiredso manySocial Security employees that people now face long waits at Social Security and Medicare – benefits Trumppromised to protect. Doge also eliminatedUSAIDprograms that bought grain from hard-pressedKansas farmers.Why are all these assaults on the middle class necessary? To enable huge tax cuts for big business and Trump’s billionaire friends.Three-fourths of Americansare dissatisfied with the size and influence of major corporations, and58%believe upper-income Americans’ taxes are too low.As a central theme, Democrats should insist that government defend small business and stop catering to big business. Anti-elitist rhetoric is important, as evidenced by bothresearchand the big crowds at the Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-CortezFighting Oligarchyrallies.The third crucial theme is that Trump’s foreign policy is not Maga but “Mawa” (Make America Weak Again). HisTaco(Trump Always Chickens Out) tariffs are making the US look foolish and ineffectual. He plays into our enemies’ hand byinsultingallieswhile sucking up to dictators who stroke his ego:Russia and North Koreawere among the only countries not included in his initial tariff plan.His administration is trying to firenearly 1,000 FBI agentswhose only fault is that they followed orders, threatening our chief anti-terrorism agency’s ability to do its job in a dangerous world. Fired, too, is thehead of cybersecurity, a four-star general summarily dismissed on the advice of a known dingbat after a distinguished 33-year military career.The “Mawa” theme taps into working-class patriotism, security-mindedness, and masculinities. As compared to elites, non-elites aremore patriotic, because everyone stresses the highest-status categories they belong to and being American is one of the few high-status categories non-elites can claim. For similar reasons, non-elites endorsetraditional masculinitiesat higher rates: unlike class ideals, gender ideals are social ideals they can fulfill. Blue-collar families aremore security-mindedfor a different reason: they often feel the world is a scary and uncertain place – which, for them, it often is.America’s famed ‘checks-and-balances’ governance system is failing | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreThe left needs to get as conversant in working-class values as the far right is. Masculinity is a good example. We need a lot more jibes like Taco tariffs and political cartoons (Instagram, TikTok, anyone?) that contest Trump’s macho self-image. He’s not a Real Man; he’s a little rich boy so vain and frantic for attention he’s readily manipulable. His fragility is his Achilles’ heel, which is fast becoming America’s Achilles heel.None of these themes resonate as much with college grads as does defense of democracy. But if you care about democracy or immigrants or LGBTQ+ issues or the climate – and I care about them all – we need to build a coalition with working-class people whose values center kitchen table economics, security and patriotism. We haven’t done so yet, and who’s paying the price? The climate and marginalized groups. Not to mention our democracy.Joan C Williams is distinguished professor of law and Hastings Foundation chair (emerita) at University of California College of the Law San Francisco.

Now he is bedeviled by a conspiracy theory gapSat 19 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 15.41 EDTShareSome enchanted evening,Donald Trumpsaw a stranger across a crowded room.It is likely that there is hardly anyone living who knows exactly under what glowing lights Donald Trump met Jeffrey Epstein, except perhaps Trump himself and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping to procure minors for sexual abuse. Trump said in aninterviewin 2002, when his Epstein relationship was still tight, that it had been a 15-year mutual admiration society. Epstein was “a terrific guy” and “a lot of fun to be with,” and “likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side”. Epsteindescribedhimself as “Donald’s closest friend for 10 years”.The 1990s and early 2000s were the heyday of the Trump-Epstein romp. Roger Stone, Trump’sdirty tricksterwho was dumped from the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign when he and his wife were exposed apparently advertising for threesomes, was a hanger-on in the Palm Beach demimonde. “There’s 100 beautiful women and 10 guys. Look, how cool are we?” he told theWashington Postin 2016. “I was happy to be invited. I mean, it was great.”The Trump biographer Michael Wolff told me on my podcastThe Court of Historyhow Epstein opened his safe in his New York townhouse for him to retrieve a pile of about a dozen photographs of Trump at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. “They were kind of spread out like playing cards,” Wolff said. “And it was Trump – with girls of uncertain age. In two of them, topless girls are sitting on Trump’s lap. In another, he has a visible stain on his pants while several girls are laughing and pointing at it.” Wolff said: “I think it’s certainly not unlikely that they were in the safe when the FBI came in after his arrest and took everything.”Wolff initially mentioned his taped conversations with Epstein about his relationship with Trump in theDaily Beast, in which Wolff made a glancing reference to this incident, and in theYale Reviewin November 2024. In response to Wolff’s latest book on Trump, All or Nothing, on the 2024 campaign, the White HousestatedWolff had a “peanut-sized brain”. In June of this year, after Wolff claimed Trump held a “grudge” against Harvard because he had applied to be a student and was rejected, Trumppostedit was “False”, and that Wolff is “a Third Rate Reporter, who is laughed at even by the scoundrels of the Fake News”.Epstein has become the Ark of the Covenant in the cosmology of rightwing conspiraciesThe White House issued a statement that Trump “didn’t need to apply to an overrated, corrupt institution like Harvard”.Since 10 August 2019, when Epstein’s body was found in his cell with an orange sheet wrapped around his neck at the New York Metropolitan correction center under suspicious circumstances,declared a suicideby Attorney General William Barr, he has been raised into a phantasmagorical presence that will not vanish. Epstein has become the Ark of the Covenant in the cosmology of rightwing conspiracies. When its doors are opened it will supposedly reveal the ultimate secrets of deep state pedophiles. Apollin 2021 found that about a quarter of Republicans believed that “the government, media, and financial worlds in the US are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation”.The road from Pizzagate, the QAnon predecessor conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats held child sex slaves in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong Washington pizza parlor, to January 6 was a straight line. Half of Republicans believed that “leaked email from some of Hillary Clinton’s campaign staffers contained code words for pedophilia, human trafficking and satanic ritual abuse – what some people refer to as ‘Pizzagate’” was true or probably true, according to a December 2016 Economist/YouGovpoll.Trump gave credence to the QAnon pedophile theory in October 2020, when he was asked about it at anNBC News town hall. “Let me ask you about QAnon,” said Savannah Guthrie. “It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that.” After replying seven times that he didn’t know about it, Trump said: “Let me just tell you, what I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that. And I agree with it very strongly.”A few months later, many in the mob assaulting the Capitol were QAnon believers, though the percentage could not be tabulated. A group of social scientistsfoundthat belief in QAnon theories correlated directly with “support for the January 6 insurrection”. More than a third of Republicans believed that the FBI (ie the Deep State) “instigated” the January 6 assault, according to a Washington Post/University of Marylandpoll.For decades Trump has cultivated paranoid conspiracy theories to foster a cult around himself. His method existed long before Rush Limbaugh loudly burst into talk radio, but Trump inflames paranoia hour by hour to make himself unavoidable. When Trump makes an accusation it’s news – Joe McCarthy’s technique. The ever-shifting series of conspiracy claims from birtherism onward have been monetized into a reliable cash cow by rightwing media. Bottom-feeding serves the bottom line. Every newly invented plot keeps the machine whirring. Maga is constantly tantalized, addicted and perpetuated.The uses of Trump’s conspiracism are complex, from the profane to the holy. The demonology has elevated Trump into a savior of the Magatariat from the globalist elites and fiendish pedophiles. No greater evil can be projected. It’s more than a theory; it’s a theology. Epstein wraps it all up, explains all, proves all – Pizzagate meets the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Lyndon Johnson had his credibility gap with the Vietnam war. Richard Nixon had his 18-minute gap in his White House tapes. Trump now is bedeviled by his conspiracy theory gap.All the president’s men – and women – have stoked theEpstein plot. Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, demanded in 2023: “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” He urged listeners to his talk show “not let that story go” and blamed “people in the Washington swamp who are not telling you the truth”. Kash Patel, the FBI director, repeatedly claimed in 2023 that the Biden administration and Democrats in the Congress were withholding documents about Epstein “because of who’s on that list”.View image in fullscreen‘Since Bondi issued her statement that the Epstein “client list” did not exist, Trump’s attempts to stamp out the flames have become more frenetic.’Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersOn 27 February, Attorney General Pam Bondi welcomed 15 Maga influencers to a press event where she handed out binders labeled “Epstein Files: Phase 1”, which containedno new information. Anger simmered. On 14 March, Bondi stated on Fox News that the Epstein “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, raising the expectation among the Maga believers that such a “client list” existed and that powerful Democrats would be revealed. The “client list” allegedly contained the names of Democrats for whom Epstein trafficked girls and then blackmailed.On 5 June, Elon Musk, accelerating his orbit away from Trump’s gravitation,posted: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk then deleted his post.But, on 6 July, the Department of Justice issued an unsignedstatementthat there was “no incriminating ‘client list’”, “no credible evidence … that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals”, and that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted”.Bondi’s insistence that Epstein kept no “client list” of people he supposedly blackmailed may well be true. . But Bondi debunked a falsehood that had become an article of faith for Maga believers. It was bait for the base.Trump worked to kill a story about his friendship with Epstein. Now we know why | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe Maga world erupted. “Please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away,”Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,posted. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment.” Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, for example,posted: “GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” Tucker Carlsoncalledit a “cover-up” of Epstein as a secret agent for Israeli intelligence. “Why was he doing this, on whose behalf, and where was the money coming from?”Steve Bannon roused the rightwing cadres at the Turning Point USA convention on 13 July. “Epstein,” hesaid, “is a key that picks the lock on so many things, not just individuals, but also institutions, intelligence institutions, foreign governments and who was working with him on our intelligence apparatus and in our government.”Trump’s grooming of his followers cannot be undone. Decades of propaganda have become gospel truth. The Maga base and Republicans generally have not cared about Trump’s sexual abuse of women. After the two E Jean Carroll trials in which Trump was found liable for defaming her by claiming she was lying about his sexual assault, the hush-money payments to silence Stormy Daniels for her sexual relationship with him, and numerous credible reports of dozens of women who have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse by Trump, apollin the fall of 2024 conducted by a conservative thinktank, the American Enterprise Institute, showed that only 5% of Trump voters “believe he did commit sexual assault”.E Jean Carrolltold methat a number of women have come to her to relate similar assaults, but do not want to become public figures out of fear of retribution. For Maga, and Republicans, if there is any distinction, these stories are unworthy of attention. They sanitize and dismiss such predations, while claims of child molestation incite them. Justifying a sexual libertine like Trump, they have held him up as a white knight avenger against pedophiles, remade him into a purifying figure, the defender of the innocent.Since Bondi issued her statement that the Epstein “client list” did not exist, Trump’s attempts to stamp out the flames have become more frenetic. He went from urging his supporters to move on to telling them to get lost.Until evidence of Trump’s participation in Epstein’s transgressions is either established or discredited, Epstein will never dieHis firstremarkwas to chide a reporter who asked about it: “I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, where we’re having some of the greatest success, and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. It just seems like a desecration.”Trump got more frustrated. “For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump posted on Truth Social, blaming the files on Democrats. “Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden administration.” It was “all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein”.Trump tried to rally his base. “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals’?” Trump posted. “They are all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!”Trump reportedlyphonedCharlie Kirk, the head of Turning Point USA, which had served as a forum for criticism of his handling of the Epstein affair, to quiet him. The glib talkshow host announced: “I’m done talking about Epstein for the time being.” As promised, Kirk shut up, but the Maga chorus kept chirping.Enraged,Trump posted on 16 Julythat the “new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker … Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats’ work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!” At a bilateral meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, Trumplashed outat “stupid Republicans”.Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson, invariably a loyal soldier, but who felt forced to respond to the disturbance of the base, called for an investigation. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, asked that Ghislaine Maxwell appear as a witness. Do they think an inquiry would not come to focus on the evidence perhaps in the FBI’s possession of Trump’s gamey relationship with Epstein, rather than the mythical “client list”?Under the stress of the Epstein controversy that will not disappear at Trump’s command, the unpopularity of his One Big Beautiful Bill, the public’s rejection of his brutal deportation methods, and the weakening of the economy as a result of his mad tariffs, Trump is becoming more unhinged, speaking openly offiring the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who, unlike Epstein, is a live target. Crashing the economy might serve as a temporary distraction. Then, in a fit of retributive pique, his administration fired James Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, a prosecutor in the office of the southern district of New York, who had handled the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases.Trump lost more control. Facing backlash,he asked Bondi to seek to releaseEpstein grand jury material, which almost certainly contained no reference to him and was a substitute for the full files, throwing oil on the fire. Trump pressured the Wall Street Journal and its owner Rupert Murdoch not to publish a letter he wrote in honor of Epstein’s 50th birthday. The Journalreported: “It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair. The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.’” On Friday, Trumpsued the Journal and Murdoch.The ghost of Epstein haunts Trump. He cannot dispel his spirit. “Not a fan, not a fan,” hemutteredin the past, trying to distance himself. But Epstein continues to swoop in – “a guy who never dies”. Until evidence of Trump’s participation in Epstein’s transgressions is either established or discredited, including the photographs that Michael Wolff claimed Epstein showed him, Epstein will never die.If Epstein were to appear to Trump at night as an apparition, his Marley’s ghost, he might warn him that there is no happy ending.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

And now Wesley Enoch as chair of Creative Australia has to fix adamaged sector.Archie Moore, Tracey Moffatt, Warwick Thornton, Deborah Mailman, William Barton,Tony Albert, Judy Watson, David Gulpilil, Christian Thompson, Ivan Sen,Emily Kam Kngwarray, to name just some of the many who have won accolades for their stunning, original work and taken their place at the peaks of cultural power and influence. Winning hearts and changing minds as they went.Not so long ago, this suggested a long overdue reckoning with the First Peoples; a reckoning that the rest of the world was watching in the detached way that those who can be bothered note what is happening elsewhere.‘Manifestation of creative genius’: Murujuga rock art in Western Australia placed on Unesco world heritage listRead moreAustralia is diffident about cultural diplomacy, reluctant to exercise its soft power (in anything other than sport), as the abandonment ofABC Asia Pacific TVdemonstrated – although the ABC has since revamped its international service.The global celebration of First Nations artists was a powerful way of showing that modern Australia had thrown off its colonial legacy, had grown into a truly mature and reconciled nation and come to terms with the ancient human heritage that makes it truly unique.Creative Australia put First Nations stories first in itsstrategic priorities, Dfat’s culturalgrantsemphasised the persuasive power of 65,000 years of unique civilisation, and Australia lobbied hard for Unesco recognition of cultural heritage at Gunditjmara and nowMurujuga.Yet as we approach the second anniversary of the decision by most Australians to reject meaningful recognition of First Peoples, the tension at the heart of this international celebration of the talent, stories and unique ways of seeing, being and doing comes clearly into focus.Is it simple hypocrisy or the old Australian way – one glide forward, two quick steps back?There are markers. The silence about discussing the referendum or to even consider national truth-telling. The ratty politics rejecting welcomes to country andAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. The patchy reporting of thecoronial findingsof institutional racism in the NT Police and theYoorrook inquiry’s findingsof historic genocide. The federal court’s hand-wringing decision that accepted government policies caused wilful destruction of culture and environment in theTorres Strait Islandsbut that it was unable to do anything about it.These recent events suggest that coming to terms with the enduring impact of the past is at best the latter, two quick steps back. At worst, to me, it suggests further signs of what Jeremy Bentham once called an “incurable flaw”.Culture is complicated, cultural diplomacy can take time, but culture might still lead politicsAll this came to mind as I stood outside Tate Modern waiting in line under an unusually hot summer sun for my bag to be checked. My English friend and I were on our way to the third floor of the vast former turbine to see the Emily Kam Kngwarray exhibition.“Why is it on now?” he asked. He knows Australia, has spent time in central Australia and understood how the voice referendum hung heavily there.It’s a reasonable question. And there are many answers. Some practical, others freighted with meaning. The director of the Tatetold the pressit was part of her plan to celebrate older female artists who should be considered great masters (mistresses?). Theart press buzzedthat this was one of three major exhibitions of Indigenous artists in London this summer – the others from Canada and Peru. Indigeneity is “a thing”.The collaboration to celebrate the“old lady’s”work between the Tate, National Gallery of Australia and the women of Alhalker country began not long after the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, declared there would be a referendum to secure meaningful recognition of First Peoples in the Australian constitution. These big retrospectiveshowsare years in the making, especially ones that require the active involvement of local communities as well as major galleries and high-profile owners around the world.When the extraordinary showfirst opened in Canberrajust months after the vote, there was sadness about what might have been, about how the exhibition might have celebrated a new beginning.In London two years later, this is a barely acknowledged backdrop.Those seeing her work for the first time grapple with what it represents, how someone who only started painting in her 70s produced work as fresh and innovative as any major 20th-century artist – but how it grew out of her knowledge, skill and dreaming.Like all great artists, the work is truly hers, grounded in her unique perspective. What comes as a surprise, to those who have only seen her images in books and posters, is their three-dimensional quality. Kngwarray layered paint to evoke stories of such extraordinary depth that they carrya fourth dimensionof infinite time, “everywhen”.It invites the viewer into a unique way of seeing and being.Another Australian artist is also celebrated on level 3 of the Tate.Leigh Bowery, who in his short life became a London gay style icon. Both Emily and Leigh speak to a distinctive Australian sensibility and energy. They prove that from an unlikely starting point anything is possible.Answering my friend’s question, I said I wished the curators had projectedThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, where flamboyant gay culture meets the outback, on the wall between the two iconoclastic Australians, to help viewers literally join the dots between the two exhibitions.Culture is complicated, cultural diplomacycan take time, but culture might still lead politics.Julianne Schultz an emeritus professor at Griffith University and the author of The Idea of Australia​Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansOpinionIndigenous artcommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve done both and know which one I preferGillian HarveyWith vacations of up to 14 weeks on the continent, education can suffer – although on the plus side childcare and holidays are much more affordableSat 19 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareRemember the summer holidays of your childhood – the seemingly endless, sunny days many of us look back on fondly? Those six “precious” weeks look very different when you’re a parent. Having to feed, entertain, look after and fund your offspring during the extended break can sometimes make the summer seem endless for all the wrong reasons.Parents in England where, as in Scotland and Wales, the school summer break is six weeks, have complained that this is too long, and are backing areduction to four weeks. Pity then the parents in mainland Europe: French school holidays last for eight weeks. In some regions of Italy, summer is awhopping 14-weeks long. Having birthed and brought up my five children in France, only moving back to England in April last year when my eldest was 14 and my youngest nine, I’ve experienced summers on both sides of the Channel. And it will be no surprise that I prefer the six-week version.But not for the reasons you might think.I’m lucky. I may have five children to entertain, but I work from home and have a husband who’s retired. I have to combat additional noise and break up the odd skirmish, but at least I don’t have to worry about childcare during the summer months.Then again, inFrance, nor did most of my friends. France is set up differently for the summer break. For starters, there are affordable play schemes in most areas. In my small town in Limousin, children could have a day of fun, sport and supervision from 7.30am to 6.30pm, plus a cooked meal, for as little as €9 (about £7.80).Rather than the odd snatched moment or week off, many children in France benefit from a healthy dose of family time over the summer as their parents are also on holiday. August is sacrosanct in France. Many businesses close or pare down, and people often take a fortnight – or even the month – off. (Need a routine scan in August? Good luck: even hospital services seem lighter on staff during the summer.)And while it’s traditionally expensive to take holidays during peak times, in France help is available to those on modest incomes. TheVacaf voucheris a means-tested benefit that families can offset against a holiday at more than 7,000 hotels or holiday parks, saving up to 70%.Money won’t be made tighter by “back to school” shopping, either. France gives parents a “rentrée” payment ofmore than €400 a childin August to cope with these costs. It’s means tested, but generously so, taking into account income and family size.If additional childcare is needed, help will probably be available from grandparents. Of course, many UK-based grandparents also help with childcare, but in France it seemed the expected norm rather than the generous exception. Kids are shipped off to Mamie and Papy for two weeks at a time, leaving parents free to enjoy the sunshine.Eight weeks seemed long, but in France they were manageable. Even – whisper it – fun. So why do I prefer the six-week option?Well, first, it’s better educationally. The “summer slippage” children experience from the six-week break is well documented;pupils are thought to loseup to 40% of the gains they have made over the school year during this time. Another two weeks to forget everything could be catastrophic. And, however well supported children are, eight weeks is a long time to be away from the structure and routine of school. By the end the kids seemed feral, and were so accustomed to getting up later they found it hard to adjust to the 6am start.Despite moaning that their French friends are already sunning themselves, my children have had fun during those “extra” two weeks at school. Lessons have been wound down and learning tied up. School plays have been performed, awards dished out, sports days (something they didn’t experience in France) enjoyed. Classes have met their new teachers for September, and new schools have been visited. There’s a sense of growing anticipation of the break ahead when teachers and pupils relax and (dare I say) enjoy each other’s company. It’s true that, in my experience, not a huge amount of learning occurs during this time. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t value in spending another fortnight in the classroom.Some might argue that even six weeks is too long for a summer break. But despite the summer slippage, I’d be loath to have holidays reduced further. This six-week break is a childhood rite of passage and I’d hate to see kids lose it. (Plus, as an ex-teacher, I know it’s one of the few times staff get a proper break not filled entirely with marking and planning – mess with it at your peril.)Instead, imagine if the UK government took a lesson from France and provided better, affordable care for families, and helped those who need support take their holiday during these expensive months (not necessarily by subsidising, but by staggering school holidays across the country or working with providers to ensure fairer pricing). Then, perhaps more parents would actually look forward to the summer.Gillian Harvey is an author and mother of five living in Norfolk.

The husband and wife are arguably the internet’s favourite heterosexual couple at the moment, and if they are anything to go by, the standards for modern romance are high.Jettrecentlygave Pookie a single instruction on one of their European getaways: “Do not leave Paris without a Birkin.” Luxury unboxings area stapleon their page.These #relationshipgoals have increasinglyinfluencedviewers’ standards and expectations in their own relationships. The spectacle of lavish gifts and experiences can shift expectations and expressions of love towards the more demonstrable aspects of romance.“If my husband doesn’t get me a Hermès Kelly as my push present, he will be fired,” reads one TikTok comment.Sometimes, the deepest connections you feel toward a partner come not from the giving of gifts, but the smaller moments of kindness: preparing a favourite snack or a foot rub on the sofa. Growth and connection can come after the reconciling of a fight. Sometimes, love is just spending time together in silence.To their credit, Pookie and Jett also share more candid moments of love. “In case any of you are wondering what Pookie’s favourite thing to do is, it’s cuddle,”says Jett, with a sleeping Campbell lying on his bare chest. Althoughoneof their shared moments of breakfast in bed, sipping pink champagne and dancing together in PJs, was professionally filmed to launch their new merchandise line.These exceptionally high relationship goals are also found on the other side of the spectrum in the content of serial daters. “Dating influencers” are predominantly young women who reveal all about their love lives to eager followers.

In a later viralTikTok, she tearfully relays her disappointment at her date’s request to split the bill. “I just want a gentleman,” she says through tears. In this world of dating, if idealised standards aren’t met, it doesn’t matter that the date was “good”.There is a personal cost to this style of dating.Hannah Zaslawskibegan a TikTok series where she tried to go on 50 first dates in pursuit of love. Afterexperiencing major fatigue and burnout, she would suddenly call it quits at date number 38, and in doing so ended her virality. Influencers are almost obliged to keep drearily dating because the TikTok algorithm demands it.More uncomfortably, there is the question of our relationship to their relationships. Many of their viewers appear to live vicariously through them; something that becomes especially apparent when the relationship ends. Recently, when popular influencerThe Wizard Lizcalled off her engagement to fellow YouTuber Landon Nickerson over hismessaging of another woman, swathes of her fans had their own lives altered. “If [Liz] had to go through this, us mortals, us little peasants … how are we going to survive?”declaredanother of her fans.‘I threw it in the bin with everything else he gave me’: the mix tapes that defined our livesRead moreIn all of this content, it’s apparent that influencer couples and daters make a deal – in exchange for sharing their lives with an audience, they are able to make an income through advertising and commerce. A couple becomes in effect a throuple – creator, partner/love interest and audience. Their audience buy what they sell because, in buying into their brand, they’re buying into the ideal of romance being sold.Pookie wanted to be an influencer since 2017 and hit whatthe Cutcalled “algorithm gold” when she introduced her husband into her content, after years of consistently posting with modest success. Items from their clothing line,Quintessential Love, are often sold out. Jett givesTED talkson how to “authentically love out loud” like he does.Although, the business of likes has, at times, come between couples. Former Instagram it coupleJay Alvarrez and Alexis Ren’s wanderlust relationship ended abruptly in 2016, when in spectacular public fashion ( destroying the facade entirely), Alexistold a fanthat “the relationship wasn’t good for [Jay’s] business any more”.Love in the age of the algorithm is complex – but creators and audiences would do well to remember that so is love in the real world.Zandile Powell is a video essayist and writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The only rational long-term strategy is to rejoin the EU, but our politics is far removed from thatSat 19 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 19 Jul 2025 06.46 EDTShareLike a chronic ailment, strategic incoherence gnaws at everything Britain does in the world. Keir Starmer’s real achievement in resetting relations with mainlandEurope– witness the recent visits of the French president Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor Friedrich Merz – does not obscure, and in a way even highlights, this deeper confusion.After 1945, Winston Churchill envisioned Britain’s global role at the intersection of three circles: the British Commonwealth and (then still) empire; the Europe whose postwar recovery and unification he strongly supported; and the United States. As Commonwealth countries have formed stronger ties elsewhere, the first circle is no longer of strategic significance. Having committed itself in the 1970s to the most developed political and economic form of the second circle, now theEuropean Union, Britain has withdrawn from it. With the revolutionary nationalism of President Donald Trump, the third circle is also fading fast. So here’s an 80-year countdown of Britain’s strategic circles: three … two … one, going on none.Instead of being at the intersection of three circles, Britain finds itself caught between three elephants. “There are three elephants in the room and we just have to be careful we don’t get trampled” is howone British official describedto the Financial Times Starmer’s attempt to navigate between the global economic powers of the US, EU and China.Just like Tony Blair a quarter-century ago, this government has talked of Britain being a “bridge” between Europe and the US. But what kind of a bridge can it be today, when the UK is outside the EU and Trump is putting in question the whole transatlantic relationship, with a special animus towards the EU?There was only ever one way to take Brexit to its logical conclusion, and that was to become an offshore Greater Switzerland, a north European Singapore. To seek profit wherever you could find it, whatever those states were doing to their neighbours or their own citizens; to be a nation with the morals of a hedge fund. Ironically enough, the European country that comes closest to this cynical “multialigning” is Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, a full member state of the EU. But this was never a serious option even for the majority of Brexiters, who had five or six different (and generally vague) visions of what a post-Brexit Britain should be. For most Britons, it would be completely incompatible with our sense of what Britain should do and be in the world.With Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Britain’s Churchillian instincts kicked in again and have brought us to a place where we are working shoulder to shoulder with countries such as France, Germany and Poland for the defence of Ukraine and Europe as a whole.Merz and Starmer have just signed a German-British treatythat gives a framework for enhanced cooperation in many areas. Faced with uncertainty about Trump’s commitment to nuclear deterrence on Nato’s eastern flank, Macron’s state visit to the UK produced the unprecedented announcement that Europe’s only two nuclear-weapon powers will “coordinate” their nuclear deterrents and “there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by both nations”.This takes us back to the strategic question. If we are prepared to risk even our very national existence for the defence of Europe, wouldn’t it make sense to have some say in how that Europe develops? And if you’re a government that has staked everything domestically on economic growth, as Starmer’s has, wouldn’t it help to get closer to your largest single market?The situation now is that Britain is fully committed to the defence of Europe but has none of the economic advantages of belonging to the EU. Indeed, it even has to pay a price – for example, in concessions to the French on fishing – for the privilege of contributing to the rest of Europe’s security. Addressing British parliamentarians, Macron said: “The European Union was stronger with you, and you were stronger with the European Union.” True on both counts. But of the two sides, Britain is definitely the more weakened. In the language of diplomacy, Britain is now thedemandeurwherever it turns,wanting something from the other party. Indeed its diplomatic triumphs, be they in the “reset” with the EU or the trade deal with Trump, largely consist in the removal of obstacles that didn’t even exist before.The only strategically coherent long-term answer to this conundrum would be for Britain to rejoin the EU, painfully swallowing its pride and accepting that the new membership terms would be less favourable than those it had before. Halfway houses, such as theUK-EU customs unionproposed by Britain’s Liberal Democrats, would bring some modest economic advantage. Only full EU membership would give the large-scale economic benefits and the political influence in shaping the future of Europe – and, through Europe, the world. In a jungle full of elephants, you’d better be – or at least ride on – one yourself.Any British government seriously committed to advancing the national interest should keep in mind that long-term strategic logic. But British politics is nowhere near this point. Not even the Liberal Democrats advocate Breturn and the political running is being made by the country’s most successful anti-European politician, Nigel Farage. People in the EU see this and are themselves in no mood to start thinking about remarriage. The wounds of Brexit are still sore and the disjuncture between security and economics works better for them than it does for Britain. Anyway, the EU has more than enough on its plate already.So what’s left? Muddling through. Fortunately, muddling through is something of a British speciality. Some years ago I read an article about Britain in a German magazine which talked ofdie Philosophie des Durchmuddelns.(Only Germany could turn muddling-through into a philosophy.) Strangely maladroit in domestic politics, Starmer has been remarkably adept at forging good relationships with leaders such as Macron, Merz and Ursula von der Leyen, as well as Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has shown real leadership on Ukraine and certainly delivered on his promise toMake Britain Serious Again.His cabinet is full of individuals who, like him, seem well-intentioned, competent and decent. A little boring perhaps – but a glance at the Trump administration shows you there are worse things than that. The UK has a heap of problems, but so does every European country I know. British democracy has survived the stress test of Brexit better than US democracy is surviving that of Trump. Socially and culturally, there is still much to be said for Britain’s everyday tolerance, creativity and humour.So if anyone can make a success of muddling-through, Britain can. But Britain would muddle through better if it had a clearer idea of where in the world it wants to be in 10 years’ time. As I believe it says in the Talmud: if you don’t know where you want to go, any road is good.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsForeign policyOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDefence policyFranceGermanycommentShareReuse this content"

Germans haveFaust, Goethe’s play about the successful but dissatisfied scientist Dr Heinrich Faust, who makes a deal with the devil. Faust has been performed, referenced and read in schools for more than two centuries now. Interestingly, the most tragic character in this tragedy is not the protagonist, but his “love interest”, Gretchen – a teenage girl groomed by the old man, impregnated and socially ostracised. Her solution? She drowns her “illegitimate” newborn child, accepts her death penalty and rejects Faust’s offer to save her from prison. In God’s mercy, the Christian girl seeks salvation and off goes Faust with the devil to new adventures inFaust, Part Two.What would Gretchen do today, I wonder. Her fate is not only a result of sexual abuse and an inherently misogynistic morality, but also nonexistent reproductive rights. In today’s Germany, abortion isstill illegal under the criminal code. It is nonpunishable under certain conditions, particularly during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but nonetheless, in practice a modern-day Gretchen might have difficulty finding a doctor willing to perform a termination, depending on where she lives. Moreover, Gretchen might be intimidated by the stigma, which is not just societal but enshrined in German law.For decades now, theso-called paragraph 218that criminalises abortion has been subject to political debate. Poland and the US are living proof that, even if not prosecuting anyone for carrying out or procuring an abortion is the accepted practice, that can be toppled quickly when ultraconservatives are in power.The last German government, under the Social Democratic party’s (SPD) Olaf Scholz, made an attempt to reform paragraph 218 before losing power, but failed. Obviously, nobody expects the current German government, led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to take any progressive decisions on the right to physical self-determination. But what is now happening at the Bundestag goes further than preserving this outdated law – which must surely fall foul of international human rights standards.After weeks of an orchestrated rightwingsocial media campaign, the election by the Bundestag of three new judges to the constitutional court (Germany’s highest court) wasunexpectedly cancelledlast week. The reason: one of candidates, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a 54-year-old jurist and professor, stands accused of holdingextremist leftwingpositions, because shesupports the decriminalisation of abortion.View image in fullscreenAfD co-leader Alice Weidel at the Bundestag, Berlin, 11 July 2025.Photograph: Nadja Wohlleben/ReutersAnyone who has listened to or readBrosius-Gersdorf’s judicial reasoningknows that she fully relies on the German constitution in her arguments and carefully evaluates the rights of the mother and the embryo depending on the phase of pregnancy. In the early phase, according to Brosius-Gersdorf, the mother’s rights predominate. In the later phase, as soon as the embryo is viable, the embryo’s right to life has to be protected.Claims that Brosius-Gersdorf is in favour of abortions until the ninth month of pregnancy areblatant lies, spread by rightwing media as well as far-right Alternative for Germany(AfD) politicians.The fact that Brosius-Gersdorf, who was nominated by the SPD, also argues for a ban on the AfD due to the classification of it by German intelligence asrightwing extremistmight have been the real trigger for the propaganda campaign against her.Other accusations have circulated around the jurist’s recommendation for compulsory vaccination during the pandemic, and allegations that her PhD thesis was plagiarised (which wereproven to be false). But not until the focus fell on her allegedly radical views on abortion did the mobilisation succeed. Parts of the governing coalition – 50 to 60 Christian Democrat MPs – raised doubts about her nomination, which led to postponement of the vote, which will probably now be delayed until after the summer recess. Appointments to the constitutional court require a two-thirds parliamentary majority in a secret ballot.Her critics now expect Brosius-Gersdorf to withdraw, although the SPD, Greens and the leftwing party Die Linke continue to uphold her nomination.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some commentators speak of the “Trumpification of German politics”, since the whole debacle is founded on fake news and defamation. But the stigma of abortion itself is not an imported phenomenon. It is part of German cultural identity, perpetuated by the Gretchen tragedy, which has never really gone out of date.Paragraph 218, by the way, is a relic from the 1871 criminal code and almost as old as Faust. Gretchen would certainly be surprised that so little has changed when it comes to bodily autonomy.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And what’s worse, we waste about 35% of the food we bring home. If we keep this up, it has been estimated the already unsustainable environmental cost of the food systemwill nearly double by 2050.Calculating the precise impact your individual food choices have on the environment isn’t simple, but research suggests the actions we can take to bring that impact down are – and they aren’t just better for the environment, they’re better for our health too.Limit or switch these itemsA 2021CSIRO studyfound that sticking to itshealthy eating guidelineswhile choosing lower-carbon options could reduce the climate impact of our diets by as much as 42%.Anotherreleased last year, which conducted life-cycle assessments on more than 60 thousand products available on Australian shelves, found that switching to lower-emission options withinsimilarcategories could bring our food footprints down by an impressive 71%.Anything that is plant based is going to be much less environmentally costly than anything animal basedSimone Pettigrew,Prof Simone Pettigrew, program director of food policy at the George Institute for GlobalHealthand an author of the latter study, says: “There’s four biggies that sit at the top of the list for being the least sustainable: traditional red meats, dairy products, and then to a lesser extent – but perhaps more upsettingly – coffee and chocolate.” Consumers, she says, can make a “massive, massive difference” to the sustainability of their entire food basket simply by limiting or switching out those items.In practical terms this might look like choosing poultry, seafood or kangaroo instead of lamb or pork, switching dairy milk for plant-based options, drinking just one less coffee a day or choosing sweet treats with low or no cocoa content. Even if we can do that some of the time, the difference can be significant, according to Pettigrew.A boost for your health – and the planetWhen it comes to carbohydrates and fresh produce, Pettigrew says a solid rule of thumb is the better it is for you, the better it probably is for the planet. Choosing fresh fruits and vegetables to snack on rather than processed biscuits or bars, for example, will dramatically reduce your diet’s carbon footprint. And while there are production and processing differences between more nutritionally similar items such as pasta and rice, Pettigrew says overall they are largely comparable in terms of sustainability. “Anything that is plant-based is going to be much less environmentally costly than anything animal-based.“We understand it’s hard for consumers to make really big changes in one hit, but it is relatively easy to make small incremental ones.”If you already eat a healthy, plant-rich diet, limit your ultra-processed food intake and are keeping your coffee and chocolate habits in check, you’ve made a great start.Shop with intentBeyond that, Dr Lilly Lim-Camacho, principal research scientist with CSIROAgricultureand Food, says one of the most helpful things consumers can do to maximise these gains is to “shop with intent”. Food waste accounts for more than a third of all household waste, so only purchasing what you need combined with small efforts such as “learning how to use up leftover veggies in the crisper” and resisting impulse buying will not only make your diet significantly more sustainable, but healthier and more economical too.How to stay warm this winter without breaking the bank – or the planetRead moreShe urges people to also keep in mind that wasting unhealthy food is doubly bad. “Not only do discretionary foods create more emissions, our bodies don’t actually need them.” Those emissions are essentially being wasted regardless of whether you consume the food or not, she suggests.If you’d like to take things a step further, apps such as ecoSwitch, developed by the George Institute, get into the nitty gritty of comparing the carbon ratings associated with more specific items. This can help if you want to know, for example, which brand of tinned tomatoes or tofu is best. The George Institute study found that opting for near identical but lower-impact options alone could bring your food footprint down by 26%.Neither Pettigrew nor Lim-Camacho want to take the fun out of food or expect consumers to forgo the odd burger or chocolate ice cream, but agree that by prioritising our health we will naturally make better choices for the planet, and vice versa. “It’s a win-win,” says Pettigrew.“There is always going to be an environmental cost to our food. But it’s important for people to know that you actually can make an enormous difference if you want to.”Explore more on these topicsSustainable food supplyChange by degreesFood wasteFoodGreenhouse gas emissionsFood & drink industryAgricultureHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We admire their prowess, method, patience and improvisation. We may be jealous of their efficiency, or their extraordinarily brief phone conversations, some of which merely involve listening to the words “Is it done?” or “Call me when it’s done.” The Assassin (Friday 25 July, Prime Video) features a supremely confident title and many of these aspects. It is also funny.The set-up is low-key. Journalist Edward Green visits his estranged mother Julie on a Greek island. Following an attempt on her life, which she settles with brutal efficiency, he discovers she is actually a deactivated hitwoman. Fleeing across Europe, he attempts to learn about her past as they untangle a giant conspiracy threatening their lives. There’s also a mystery around who his father is, so it’s a bit Mamma Mia, too.“Are you really not going to tell me why you’re some kind of perimenopausal James Bond?” Edward boggles, after she dispatches another assailant. ActorFreddie Highmorespends a lot of time in this mode, trailing his mother with anxiety and admiration, like a live-action Rick and Morty.Keeley Haweshas more fun as the reluctantly maternal asset, whether kicking a child’s football into the sea or stabbing someone in the neck. David Dencik, as a shrewd IT specialist, has a Peter Lorre skittishness, whileAlan Dalemakes a villainous boss, though I still think of him as Jim from Neighbours.Acting schmacting. The Assassin opens with an intense, one-shot sequence of a younger Julie carrying out a mission, like something out ofThe Raid. Later fight scenes are more cartoonish, which isn’t to say sanitised: fingers are as disposable as Ikea pencils. There’s a blood specialist credited, so corners are the one thing not being cut. While the physicality of the performers isn’t on a par with the best of this type of action, it is able to wield humour with violence – and that is a very specific set of skills.I don’t usually like killing capped with a zinger. My taste is for the clean lines of Chad Stahelski-choreography, or the scrappy but character-revealing grit of a film like Nobody. Snappy dialogue undermines reality, in the same way as physics-defying choreography. That’s why it’s better to choose one.The Assassin, though, understands visual wit. That intense opening sequence is capped by Julie, still at the kill site, checking a pregnancy test and swearing. In another scene, she uses a cheese fork as a lethal weapon, elsewhere a sauna as an interrogation device. There are shades of last year’s Mr & Mrs Smith, which similarly explored domesticity through extreme conflict. Still, I’d be happy with a little less conversation, a little more action.View image in fullscreenThe getaway … Hawes with Freddie Highmore in The Assassin.Photograph: Amazon Prime VideoThe scenes between the Greens play best. Julie has lied about her job his whole life – although as half-truths go, calling herself a “headhunter” is pretty good. Edward repeatedly calls out her casual deception, violence and ease with backstabbing. Accurate but painful, she concedes. “That should be on your business card,” he responds. For her part, she thinks her son is boring and pale. On the run across Athens, France and Libya, he’s unlikely to remain either. But can motherhood be exciting enough for Julie? It’s a provocative question.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four episodes in, we don’t know what Chantaine is. It might be an AI, assassin training program, a password or a white wine. Moreover, many of the actors pronounce the word so it sounds like “Sean Penn”. There are frequent scenes of characters demanding “What is Sean Penn?” which is distracting.These types of shows generally feature a monastic, taciturn, near sociopathic lone wolf, almost invariably male. By centring on a retired, middle-aged mother’s relationship with her son, the show kicks away most of the genre’s crutches, forcing itself to do something new. All in all, its confidence is earned.

Heckerling had burst on to the scene a decade earlier with Fast Times at Ridgemont High, a groundbreaking coming-of-age comedy of libidinous teens, and scored a surprise box office hit with 1989’s Look Who’s Talking. But she was struggling to fit Hollywood demands. “I was thinking: ‘Oh, I’m never going to make a film that’s what I want it to be, because you can’t have protagonists that are female, you have to do slob comedies, but there’s only a few actors that they accept in those roles, and you don’t get a chance to work with them if you’re a female,’” Heckerling told me recently.With little interest in catering to the prevailing tastes of the day, Heckerling went back to the drawing board: what didshewant to write? A true native New Yorker with the accent to match, Heckerling “gravitated towards darker stuff” – early gangster movies, David Lynch. But she was most amused by “people who are very optimistic and happy. I just think, how the hell did they get that way?” Like the main character in the 1994 movie Ed Wood, perpetually pleased with his mediocre work, or the star of Gentleman Prefer Blondes (the book), sending herself flowers to stir the jealousy of men around her. She envisioned a woman in a “big, pink bubble that can’t be burst”, convinced of her centrality but still winsome, relentlessly positive and naive. Someone like Cher Horowitz, the most impeccably dressed 16-year-old in America, hapless social matchmaker of Beverly Hills’ Bronson Alcott high school and the lead of Heckerling’s movieClueless.Clueless review – Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy are class acts in 90s Jane Austen parallelRead moreClueless, released 30 years ago on 19 July, remains a seminal teen comedy, the kind that immediately and indelibly stamps the culture. The instantly recognizable yellow plaid suit? “Whateverrrr?”As ifyou could escape its cultural legacy. A loose adaptation of Jane Austen’s 1815 novel Emma, Clueless reinvigorated the stagnantteen moviegenre that flourished for the rest of the decade.10 Things I Hate About You,Mean Girls,Easy A– the teen comedy staples of my teenage years in the late 2000s – live in the shadow of Clueless, which played almost daily on at least one cable channel after school. “There are very few movies in history that have lasted 30 years with that kind of intensity, with that kind of a broad appeal to generations,”Mona May, the film’s totally important costume designer, told me. “It’s truly beloved.”“It’s bright heartwarming and joyful – smart, funny and satirical in a way that still resonates,” said the film’s star,Alicia Silverstone, via email. “There is something about Amy’s take on youth culture and coming-of-age stories that is timeless.”There are very few movies in history that have lasted 30 years with that kind of intensity, with that kind of a broad appeal to generationsMona May, costume designerIt also barely made it out of pre-production. Finding a studio home for Heckerling’s script was, as Cher would say, “like searching for a boy in high school ... as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie”. Heckerling first developed what she thought would be a TV series at 20th Century Fox, with the support of an executive named Elizabeth Gabler. She delivered the feature script to Fox along with a VHS tape she recorded off MTV of Aerosmith’s music video for Cryin’, featuring a young, blond, radiant actor named Alicia Silverstone. They passed. Heckerling’s agent, Ken Stovitz, then doggedly shopped the idea around town, to no avail. The protagonists were female; “Clueless” sounded too much like underperforming films on young slackers; studio brass thought Heckerling’s still distinctive amalgamation of Valley speak, teenage slang and personal inspirations (the trademark “as if!” came from “my gay friends in their 30s”) wouldn’t translate to a wide audience. “The entire industry said no,” Heckerling recalled.Except for Scott Rudin, the prolific, andprolificallyvolatile, film and theater producer, whose support ignited a bidding war. “Usually I’d write something for some people and it would go where it was or we’d go to other people that might be interested,” Heckerling said. “But never, ‘we all hate it, now we all love it.’” And that’s show business – “it’s stupid,” Heckerling laughed, “but I love it.”With the backing of Paramount, Heckerling and casting director Marcia Ross began their search for actors to play the most stylish high-schoolers in the US, including some unsuccessful sessions shadowing real students at high schools in Beverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley. (“These kids walked around in these baggy clothes. They look just looked hopeless,” said Heckerling, though they perhaps inspired Cher’s disdain for high school boys “in baggy pants and oversized T-shirts looking like schlemiels – bleurgh”.) Heckerling first met with Silverstone at a cafe and was won over by, of all things, how she leaned her body over a cup to use the straw rather than pick it up, a move that reminded her of her eight-year-old daughter. “When I first saw the Cryin’ video, my initial reaction was: ‘Oh, she’s a hot chick,’” said Heckerling. But after the first meeting, it was: “‘Oh, I want to take care of her.’” She connected with her vision for Cher – a girl who “thinks she’s all that and she’s acting like a grownup who knows everything, but there’s a child in her”.Stacey Dash, a 25-year-old from New York, won the part of Dionne, Cher’s relatively moreexperiencedbest friend. Dash “was much more savvy already”, May, the costume designer, recalled. “She was sassy.” To play Josh, Cher’s intellectual, very undergrad-y stepbrother-turned-love interest, the team cast a fresh-faced actor namedPaul Rudd. And for the “clueless” Tai, a homely new kid Cher mentors – and misleads – as part of her initiative of “good deeds”, Ross found a 17-year-old newcomer namedBrittany Murphy. “Everybody loved her,” said Heckerling. Peppy, open-hearted, eager to help, Murphy was always the frontrunner for Tai, though she wasn’t confident in her chances. After a chemistry read with Silverstone, “Alicia was trying to tell me: ‘Oh my God, it has to be her,’” Heckerling recalled. “And I was already like: ‘Yeah, we know.’”View image in fullscreenAlicia Silverstone in Clueless.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarFilming commenced in November 1994, and proceeded over 40 days inLos Angeleslike “a well-oiled machine”, said Elisa Donovan, who played Cher’s haute couture-loving frenemy Amber. (Cher’s assessment: “Do you prefer fashion victim or ensemble-y challenged?”) Fresh to LA with just a few TV credits, Donovan walked on to her first film set and “thought: oh, this is how movies work. Brilliant women write them and direct them. They’re in charge. They’re the ones who hire all the right people. They tell everyone what to do in like a fun and kind, but firm way. They know what they’re doing.” (On subsequent sets, she “learned pretty quickly that this was highly unusual”.)Key to this environment was the partnership between Heckerling and May, who assembled the entire wardrobe for the film – 63 designer looks for Silverstone, 45 changes for the other principal actors, and all the extras’ outfits – for a budget of about $200,000 (about $413,000 today). “Amy is an amazing writer,” said May. “She wrote the blueprint for me – high school, Beverly Hills, rich girls, high fashion.” But in 1994, “everybody was wearing grunge,” not Alaïa – a Parisian designer May had to personally beg, via French translator, for the iconic red party dress, as they were out of money; the designer loaned it – May designed the peacocking feather jacket to complete the look – and got name-checked in the script.May took clues from runway shows, sourcing looks from department stores, old collection books and magazines. The characters “had Daddy’s credit cards, they could go shopping at the runway shows in Paris or Milan or wherever”, said May, but the clothes had to communicate “real girls that then you can emulate and love” – elevated and chic, but also youthful, fun and innocent. Such as, say, a yellow plaid Jean-Paul Gaultier blazer May pulled off the rack at a department store, the third choice behind a blue and red riff on the classic Catholic school uniform. (Yellow is “a tricky color”, Heckerling noted. “It’s sunshine, but it’s also jaundice.”) Blue didn’t work, red was too Christmas. But the yellow one on Silverstone was a goosebumps moment – “Oh my God, this is Cher,” said May. “She’s the queen bee.”It was through the clothes that Silverstone, then 18, transformed from budding environmental activist into airheaded, but well-meaning, Beverly Hills queen. “She was already saving animals and walking around in her sweatpants and flip-flops with two dogs in tow into the fitting. She was not Cher in real life,” May recalled. Silverstone confirms: “I was not one bit interested in fashion at that time personally, and my usual outfit was jeans and my favorite green T-shirt.” But, “I looked at Cher as being extremely confident and having a deep, healthy love of herself.”It’s bright heartwarming and joyful – smart, funny and satirical in a way that still resonatesAlicia SilverstoneThe set, overall, was “just really fun and vibrant”, Donovan recalled. “It was all magic,” said May. “Amy is such a great director – she opened us up, she’s very collaborative, she’s very encouraging.” Silverstone, as the star, was a bit more circumspect: “I was in almost every scene, so I was working hard and taking the role seriously. When I hear about all the fun the other actors had, I get whatever the past tense of Fomo is.”Filming wrapped at the end of 1994, and Clueless hit theaters seven months later, becoming an instant hit among the target audience – something quickly clear to Donovan, who was swarmed by a group of teens at a mall a fews weeks after release. It took longer for Heckerling to catch on. “I didn’t feel like it was like a big [hit] at the time,” she said. “I have friends that are [male] movie directors, and they have hits that are gigantic. I mean, Animal House and Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, those are big money-making movies. And Clueless did not make that much. It was a hit, but it wasn’t in every theater like that.”But it did catch on, winning fans on the then booming home video market and launching an endless tradition of Cher Halloween costumes. “You always hope your movie is a hit,” said May, who went on to design costumes for Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion, Enchanted, The House Bunny and more. “Every film-maker will say that, but you just never know. It has to just be the right moment and the right time and the right culture. And this was all right.”View image in fullscreenStacey Dash and Alicia Silverstone in Clueless.Photograph: Cinetext/Paramount/AllstarIn true Hollywood fashion, the industry took some of the wrong lessons – instead of focusing on how the movie worked, or greenlighting more female directors, it spawned countless imitators. Afterwards, “it wasn’t like: ‘Oh boy, here come all the great scripts,’” said Heckerling. It was: “Here’s the script that’s this classic for teenagers, or that classic, but with teenagers.“They only think you can do what’s been done,” she added. “It’s like they needed a big insurance policy. Movies are expensive, so they only want to make sure that if you did Emma in high school, why don’t you do Persuasion in high school?”Do we really want Clueless updated to reflect our dark, digital age? Ugh! As if! | Kate MaltbyRead moreAlso in true Hollywood fashion, Clueless has become valuable IP – the basis for a spinoff TV show with Dash and Donovan that ran from 1996 to 1997; aWest End stage show; and an upcoming, still vagueadaptationwith Peacock from The OC and Gossip Girl creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, with Silverstone set to reprise her role. Heckerling, an executive producer, declined to offer any details, citing prematurity and a well-earned development superstition.The 30th anniversary once again brings up the original film’s still remarkable singularity, as well as the stark absence of Murphy, who died at the age of 32, igniting years of intense media speculation. “I always think about Brittany and it’s really hard to do any of this and not talk about her,” said Donovan. “She was so talented and just had so much energy and so vibrant … just this hummingbird, frenetic sort of energy, but also like, ‘everything’s great. I got it. No problem.’”With the anniversary events, “It makes me emotional because I feel like she should be doing a lot of this, like she would be doing a lot of this,” she added. But the milestone – the kids of Clueless now old enough to have their own headstrong high-schoolers – offers an opportunity to remember, as Heckerling put it, “the goofy fun of it all”.“People come up to me and say: ‘Your designs changed my life,’” said May. “To hear that in your lifetime, that something that you created has had an impact on people? It’s incredible.”Explore more on these topicsCluelessComedy filmsTeen moviesJane AustenComedyBrittany MurphyPaul RuddfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jess is quickly swept up in her feelings for an indie musician, dreamily referring to him as “My Mr Darcy, my Rochester, my Alan Rickman”.Produced by the team behind Bridget Jones, Notting Hill and Love Actually, the show was inspired by Dunham’s own move to London in 2021.But the wholehearted embrace of the UK by a quintessential New Yorker – “I loved Jane Austen, I loved Charlotte Brontë … I was one of those little anglophile kids” – reflects a wider cultural pivot.Three decades on from Cool Britannia, cultural commentators say we are in the throes of a “Brit-culture renaissance”: British men are once again a romantic ideal, Oasis are back together, “Britishcore” became a viral social media trend andJane Austen is getting more rebootsthan Marvel comic books. “Cool Britannia is back!” Tatler declared, as it dedicated itsnew August coverto the offspring of Britpop stars.“Youth culture today is more visually and sonically proud of its Britishness than it’s been in decades,” said Luke Hodson, the founder of Nerds Collective, a youth marketing agency. “The UK’s global output is hitting differently right now.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Rodrigo on stage at Glastonbury last month. The US singer has spoken of her love of the UK.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesThis summer, thousands watchedOlivia Rodrigo profess her lovefor all things British during her headline set at Glastonbury. “I love England so much. I love how nobody judges you for having a pint at noon. I love English sweets, all the sweets from M&S, Colin the Caterpillar specifically,” said the pop star, dressed in union flag shorts. “I have had three sticky toffee puddings since coming to Glastonbury. And as luck would have it, I love English boys,” she added, referencing her beau Louis Partridge.Over the past year, Google searches for “British men” have increased by 21%, while Americans have been writing of theirpreference for dating Britons.

Maybe not. Fresh on the tail of Too Much, Netflix’s My Oxford Year is yet another series about an American student falling in love among the city’s dreaming spires.But there may be something more here than just a transatlantic love-in.

Its potency, according to Hodson, lies in its blend of 90s national pride mixed with a celebration of a more inclusive and globally resonant British identity.“This isn’t a repeat of Cool Britannia as we knew it,” Hodson said. “This is a redefined moment, powered by a more diverse and globally connected Britain. Back then, it was Blur, Oasis, the Spice Girls – iconic, sure, but also largely monocultural. Today’s wave feels less like a marketing push and more like an organic reclamation of British identity by the communities who were historically left out of the narrative.”Hodson referencedStormzywearing a union flag bulletproof vest designed by Banksy at Glastonbury in 2019, AJ Tracey wrapped in the union flag for Dork magazine, Central Cee performing in British flag graphics and streetwear brands such as Lostboys and IDA incorporating the flag in their designs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not all of them believe it is.Daniel Rachel, the bestselling author of Don’t Look Back in Anger: The Rise & Fall of Cool Britannia, said 90s culture could not be easily separated from the sociopolitical circumstances of the time – including the after-effects of Thatcherism and a renewed national pride with the election of Tony Blair, who “few people would measure Keir Starmer against”.“The decade exploded because of the desperation and repression creative people felt and engineered into their work,” Rachel added. “We may be living through a similar pattern of events, particularly with the troubling rise of rightwing rhetoric across the globe, but if Cool Britannia is to be repeated the seeds will not be found in glossy Netflix-commissioned sitcoms or attention-grabbing social media influencers.“They will be bubbling in the underfunded, underpaid, backstreets of the UK where our country’s greatest artists have always risen from.”Explore more on these topicsCultureNetflixOlivia RodrigoCharli xcxAndrew GarfieldBritpopLena DunhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The programme, conducted bySakari Oramowith the BBC Symphony Orchestra, felt oddly disparate. The main works were theSibeliusViolin Concerto with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist, and Vaughan Williams’s oratorio Sancta Civitas, a comparative rarity. There was new music, too, the world premiere of The Elements byErrollyn Wallen, Master of the King’s Music. Oramo opened, however, with Arthur Bliss’s Birthday Fanfare for Sir Henry Wood, before segueing, without pause, into Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, the latter most beautifully done, with finely focussed strings and woodwind, but something of a jolt after Bliss’s jaunty little piece for brass and timpani in honour of the Proms’ founder.Wallen’s new work, meanwhile, didn’t feel entirely successful. The Proms Guide argues that it explores the “periodic table of orchestral elements” that form the basis of composition, though Wallen writes, in her own programme note, that its prime concern is “the fundamentals of music, life and love.” It’s cast in a single-three section movement, the first dark and gritty, the second poised, elegant and sounding like Ravel, the third ringing changes on music from Purcell’s The Fairy Queen. But it never coheres, and the Purcell quotes just leave you longing for the original.The Sibelius, however, was unquestionably magnificent. Oramo conducted Batiashvili’s first ever performance of the concerto when she was 16, they’ve given it together many times together since, and you really sense the almost instinctive give and take that comes from a fine collaboration. Though technically astonishing, Batiashvili never sounded showy, and the big first movement cadenza was all about musical logic rather than display. Oramo – always wonderful in Sibelius – gave us understated drama and intensity in the first two movements, before releasing the edgy mood into the exhilaration of the finale.View image in fullscreenTenor Caspar Singh sings alongside the bust of Proms founder Sir Henry Wood.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCVaughan Williams’s choral depiction of the Holy City as described in the Book of Revelation, meanwhile, has never struck me as the masterpiece that some claim it to be, though you couldn’t fault the fervour or grandeur of Oramo’s interpretation. The choral singing – from the combined forces of the BBC Symphony Chorus, BBC Singers and members of London Youth Choirs – was all fierce exaltation and rapture. Gerald Finley was the visionary baritone, Caspar Singh the excellent tenor, making much of the precious little Vaughan Williams gives him.Watch onBBC iPlayer, orlisten again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Six of us were squashed on to one picnic bench in Edinburgh, nine years ago, on our lunch break at a magazine. I felt an instant click with George when he we first met. I was an intern when I first met George, nauseous with first-day nerves. “Is that a Welsh twang I can hear? Sorry, I’m George!” he’d said, before talking me through the office milk-buying etiquette. We had that frenetic compatibility that makes you assume you’ll be friends for ever.Within a couple of years I’d become part of the team. That day at lunch, as someone cracked a joke, George mistimed his bite. He cleared his throat while we slapped his back and chuckled. Then the colour drained from his lips. His coughs turned to rattly gasps, his fingers flew to his collarbone and his eyes rolled back.I realised then the stark difference between movies and reality. When someone chokes in real life, there’s no dramatic music tipping you off to impending tragedy – just your friend gasping for air. Ambulances arrive instantly in films; realistically, they can take much longer. You can die from choking waiting for one. On the picnic bench that day, I was paralysed – until I remembered a scene from a certain 2000Sandra Bullockaction romcom.An obsession began – I’d watch it, rewind the tape and watch it again. I probably still know it word for wordOne Christmas in the early 00s, my sister unwrapped a shiny new VHS of Miss Congeniality Miss Congeniality, the cover of which featured– Bullock in a fuchsia gown, black boots and a gun holster strapped to her thigh. The VHS quickly came under my custody and an obsession began – I’d watch it, rewind the tape and watch it again on my bedroom TV. I probably still know it word for word. It’s all dance routines, pastel chiffon and ticker tape – one big glittery sleepover. But it also solved my childhood dilemma over whether to be a fearless tomboy or manicured beauty queen. Kickboxing and bagel-inhaling FBI agent Gracie Hart, played by Bullock, tries both and – huge relief – isn’t perfect at either.Take, for example, one of the opening scenes, in which Hart risks her career – and life – when she defies orders during an undercover sting to save a Russian target who’s choking on a peanut. The line “That’s one really, really purple Russian, sir” used to make me laugh – but now George’s face was the exact same colour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Years later, the image of her thrusting at his abdomen, over and over until the peanut flies out, sprung into my mind as George gasped.Suddenly, I was behind him, arms around his waist. “Am I really doing first aid informed by nothing but a 00s VHS?” I thought. On one of my final thrusts, the lump of panini came flying out. I didn’t even notice – in my panic I had rushed off to a nearby cafe, bargaining with the universe to deliver an off‑duty medical professional. When I returned, George was sipping water, pallid but alive. “Kate, you’d already saved him!” my colleagues laughed. When George gathered the strength, he gave me a very shaky hug.Another Hollywood cliche that doesn’t bear out in real life is that saving a life creates a permanent bond. Reality is less sentimental. I left the magazine, moved to London, and George and I stopped speaking. But I like to think we both hold that day as a postcard from our funny friendship – and that he’s more careful nowadays when eating sandwiches.Years later, the story of Miss Congeniality and the brie and cranberry panini would play another major role in my life. When I applied for a dream role at Cosmopolitan, I had to submit a first-person piece. I wrote about panini-gate, got the job, and it changed the trajectory of my career. I eventually became an investigative journalist – and have even been undercover several times, just like FBI agent Gracie Hart.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The conductor Sir Roger Norrington, whose death was announced yesterday at the age of 91, remains still the maverick presence that classical music needs. His mission wasn’t only to make us hear the repertoire we thought it knew through the prism of the techniques and playing styles of its time, rather than the ossifications of later traditions. He was also an irresistible firebrand in performance, whose energy wasn’t only about inspiring his performers to get closer to the music they were playing, it was also an invitation to his audiences that their listening should be involved too. Norrington wanted everyone to feel the urgency of Beethoven’s rhetorical power and rudeness, from the radiance of one of his favourite pieces, the Missa Solemnis, to the emetic contrabassoon in the finale of the Ninth Symphony, which was always the richest of raspberries in his performances and recordings.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Haydn’s symphonies, particularly, were pieces of participative performance art in Norrington’s hands, in which his delight in sharing the radical humour and jaw-dropping discontinuities of the music was so evident. The conductor would turn round to his listeners - especially in the Prommers in the arena of the Royal Albert Hall in one of his 42 appearances at the Proms - to make sure we all realised just how weird and wonderful this music really was.The revelations of hearing Norrington’s historically informed musical mission in action defined an era, along with his fellow iconoclasts, such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Christopher Hogwood and John Eliot Gardiner, all of whom founded ensembles of period instruments, like Norrington’s London Classical Players, and took the lessons they had learnt therein to transform the sound world of modern instrument orchestras. Norrington’s work with theStuttgart Radio SymphonyOrchestra is the sound of his later legacy in action, in Brahms,Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, and Elgar, as well as Beethoven and Mozart.But Norrington’s distinctiveness was his unshakeable belief that there was a right way to play Beethoven – and a wrong one. He was also completely committed to his idea that the curse ofvibratowas an aberration in performances of all music composed before the early 20th century, whether Bach to Mahler. While his vibrato-free performances brought astonishing moments – listen to the opening of the slow movement of Bruckner’s sixth symphony, and connected music from across the centuries, it was an experiment that didn’t catch on.He wasn’t a musician trying to return to the past. Instead he was going back to find a musical future.Or at least it hasn’t yet. Norrington’s many crusades for the right tempo and textures in Beethoven’s symphonies, for the clarity and directness of drama in Bach’s Passions, for the transparency of sound world in Wagner and Debussy, have had repercussions across the whole of classical music, even with conductors and orchestras who might not think they’re working under his influence. Norrington’s decades-long mission to wean musical culture off the drug of vibrato may yet have its day.And his work remains fresh and thrilling. His Beethoven recordings with theLondon Classical Players- all the symphonies, and the piano concertos with Melvyn Tan, from the 1980s - are as impishly radical as ever. The paradox of Norrington’s performances is that what seemed like austerity and ideology was in fact a generous invitation to re-hear the incendiary meanings and power of music that had been taken for granted for too long.View image in fullscreenSir Roger Norrington conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 2008.Photograph: Jon Crwys-Williams/PANorrington was associated with what used to be called “authenticity” in the performance of 17th, 18th, and 19th century repertoires. But he was too intelligent to believe that what he was doing was a mere restoration job or a return to a sound world of Mozart’s or Beethoven’s time - something that can never truly be recaptured. He wasn’t a musician trying to return to the past. Instead he was going back to find a musical future. The sound of his recordings is the sound of the indelible imagination of all those composers he loved being released in all their rapier wit, sublimity and delirium into our time.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Thursday Colberttold his audienceat the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York that his popular late night TV show is being cancelled. “Yeah, I share your feelings,” he said in response to a chorus of boos.The CBS network insisted that it had made “a purely financial decision” to wind up The Late Show next year. But others are not so sure. Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator who was a guest on Thursday’s show,tweeted: “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”The end of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy | Jesse HassengerRead moreThere are reasonable grounds for suspicion. Earlier this month CBS’s owner, Paramount Global, reached a$16m settlement with Trumpover an interview on its current affairs strand 60 Minutes, removing a potential obstacle to the company’s $8bn sale to the Hollywood studio Skydance Media.If the mega-merger goes ahead, a friend and ally of the US president, the billionaire Larry Ellison, could wield huge influence over the CBS news division as well as programmes ranging from South Park to Star Trek. The Late Show is sure to be seen by some as an example ofobeying in advance.Among those sounding the alarm isMarvin Kalb, the last correspondent personally hired at CBS by Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism whose defiance of McCarthyism was recounted in the film and playGood Night, and Good Luck. Now 95, Kalb perceives the Skydance takeover as a threat to CBS’s journalistic independence and moral integrity – and fears that this time it will buckle.Speaking by phone from his home near Washington, Kalb said:“In my judgment it means that CBS, starting with60 Minutes, will be under a tighter editorial control than it has ever been. The idea that 60 Minutes will be able to continue to do virile, unafraid reporting on Trump may be coming to an end.”The Murrow protege, who spent 24 years atCBSNews, warns that the network could drift in the direction of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News, which often parrots Trump’s talking points. “I’m afraid that CBS News will become a little Fox, that it will begin to be timid in the way in which it approaches any possibly critical story about the president.“Just as you rarely see or hear anything on Fox that is critical of Trump, likewise it may very well end up that CBS will be essentially in the same position, and that is huge loss for those who still favour freedom of the press and who still favour a vigorous, unafraid press.”Speaking on Tuesday, before the news about The Late Show broke, Kalb expressed concern about the future of the late-night comedians whose caustic, bullshit-detector political satire has earned Trump’s wrath in the past. Jon Stewart, whose current contract expires in December, and Colberthave both mercilessly skewered Paramount for caving in to Trump.View image in fullscreenThe correspondents of CBS News’s 60 Minutes.Photograph: Jai Lennard/CBS via Getty Images“My gut feeling would be that Colbert’s contract, when it comes up, will simply not be renewed, and they will find a humourist who is pro-Trump,” Kalb said presciently.“Those are the kinds of programmes that, in a humorous way, tend to either criticise or make fun of Trump – and he doesn’t like that.”The former host of NBC’s Meet the Press who isEdward R Murrow professor of practice, emeritusat the Harvard Kennedy School continued: “He has already taken action against the press, starting from his first term with ‘fake news’ and ‘fake media’. He has already gone a long way toward diminishing the once virile press – I keep using that word because I’m thinking about people who are not afraid, people who are open minded, fair-minded journalists who are simply covering the news.“If the news happens to be unfavourable with respect to the president, so be it. But if the president doesn’t like it, he’s going to make his views known. I think if there were a serious study done even up to this point on the last five or six months, I believe you would see an initial, perhaps reluctant timidity come into the coverage of news concerning Trump.”Trump filed a $10bn lawsuit against CBS last October, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on 60 Minutes with the then vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election.In an amended complaint filed in February, Trump bumped his claim for damages to $20bn. CBS initially called the lawsuit “completely without merit”, a view shared by many legal experts, and sought to have it dismissed.But then the company entered into mediation in an attempt to placate Trump as Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, sought to close the $8bn merger with Skydance, which needs federal government approval. The CBS News head, Wendy McMahon, and 60 Minutes executive producerBill Owens quitover Paramount’s handling of the showdown.When Paramount reached the out-of-court settlement, it insisted that the $16m would go towards Trump’s future presidential library, rather than to him personally, and it would not be issuing an apology. But critics saw it as the starkest example yet of Trump’s ability to intimidate major institutions including the media.Rome Hartman, one of the producers of the Harris segment, who retired from CBS News and 60 Minutes last month for unrelated reasons, said in a phone interview: “The motive of this lawsuit was clearly harassment and intimidation and the decision by Paramount’s leaders to succumb to that harassment and intimidation was an absolute betrayal. It’s a shameful betrayal of the hardworking people at 60 Minutes and at CBS News.”View image in fullscreenShari Redstone, the chair of Paramount Global.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersDespite Trump’s pressure campaign, 60 Minutes has continued to produce unflinching reports on his administration’s immigration crackdown, assault on federal government departments and other issues. Now its staff are bracing for a change of ownership and potentially different approach.Hartman continues: “Now everyone is hoping that the new corporate parents will allow 60 Minutes to operate with the independence that it has always enjoyed. That’s not a just-because-we-want-it sort of thing; that’s because the independence and editorial voice of 60 Minutes is one of the reasons it has lasted as long as it has and it has the amazing reputation that it has for over half a century. We were betrayed by one corporate parent and they hope that will not be repeated by the new folks.“We are living in a moment of real peril for free voices and independent journalism, even independent commentary, as would be the case with Stewart and Colbert. These guys are businessmen in the end, and I hope they see that to maintain longstanding principles of independence and free speech is not just in their interest morally but in their interest economically.”Skydance was founded in 2010 by Larry Ellison’s son David.According to its website, David, who is a pilot, came up with the name as a reference to flying aerobatics known as “skydancing” and its promise of limitless possibilities. It has produced films including the Tom Cruise vehicles Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission: Impossible franchise.But although David is the public face of Skydance, his father Larry will be the power behind the throne at Paramount, according to an organisational chartobtained by the New York Timeslast year. The co-founder of software company Oracle is one of the world’s wealthiest men anda friend of Trump, who has touted Ellison as a potential buyer of TikTok.Bill Carter, the author of four books about television, says: “Both of the Ellisons seem to be close to Trump, and Trump will basically use any leverage he can. That’s what he does, and he has been given the power to do it pretty much across the board here.“The speculation is that they’ll install somebody who is at least somewhat willing to take his side in a future controversy, which means there’s very likely to be some kind of chilling effect on the news division, and especially at 60 Minutes, because they have basically defied him even after this.”Last weekthe New York Times reportedthat David Ellison had held talks about acquiring the Free Press, an online publication co-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics. Discussions include Weiss “taking on an influential role in shaping the editorial sensibilities of CBS News”, the paper added, though probably not in a managerial capacity.Journalist Mehdi Hasan responded to the report about Weissby tweeting: “RIP CBS News.”Paul Farhi, a former media reporter at the Washington Post, said: “She’s an opinion journalist and always has been, and that’s not the person you want running a news division or having a prominent role in the news division. You want someone who actually knows or upholds the tradition of straight-up reporting that CBS has stood for its entire existence.”Farhi added: “I suspect at the end of it he’ll discover that CBS News wouldn’t be too crazy about having her, but it’ll be a real test of his intentions, if he has any intentions at all, for CBS News. If he brings in someone like her, it will signal a direction and will be a sign of we’re not going to do things the way we’ve done in the past.“But I think it’s more likely that he won’t do anything that’s going to be radical in terms of CBS News. For one thing, CBS News is a very small part of the overall Paramount enterprise that she’s buying. It’s not a big profit centre. At the end of the day I suspect we won’t be talking about this topic once the merger is done, simply because CBS News is not out of control.”View image in fullscreenA still from South Park.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyBut other parts of the Paramount forest are already in revolt. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of the long-running animated sitcom South Park,have accusedthe incoming Paramount president, Jeff Shell, of meddling in contract negotiations for streaming rights to the show, allegedly to benefit Paramount+ at their expense.This has caused disruption to production schedules including a delay for South Park’s 27th season. Parker and Stonewrote on social mediaearlier this month: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”Stewart and Colbert have also been pushing back. Stewart used a Daily Show monologue to tear into Paramount’s settlement, interrupted by a spoof ad for the fast-food chain Arby’s that said: “For when you want a sandwich commensurate with your company’s shame.” Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” and even alluded to speculation about his own job security, pointing to a moustache he grew on holiday and quipping: “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert if they can’t find him?”The timing of the decision to axe him raised eyebrows in Washington. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday: “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just three days after Colbert called out CBS owner Paramount for its $16m settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”Speaking before the announcement, Carter, author of The Late Shift and executive producer of theCNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, said: “It would be pretty obvious to anybody looking at this situation if they decided to eliminate those guys that it would be for political reasons because they’re obviously outspoken and have a big audience listening to them and it gets under Trump’s skin.“But it’s scary to think that’s something that could happen in America, that a president could basically eliminate a voice of protest against him. It would be like [President Richard] Nixon getting rid of the editorial cartoonists who were criticising him overWatergate. I would not put it past Trump to try to do it.“I do think that if you’re David Ellison, it’s a terrible look.If you’re in Ellison’s shoes, you have to know this will brand you as another person who’s basically giving the knee toDonald Trump. A lot of these guys don’t care because they have other agendas. But it is a thing to live with if you’re going to be branding yourself that way.”Explore more on these topicsCultureParamount PicturesCBSSouth ParkUS televisionDonald TrumpTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than pictures from a recent jaunt to Ibiza clubs such asUshuaiaorquestionable birthday parties, his Instagram is dominated by books.Images of paperbacks he’s read are all over his feed, a mix of classics and contemporary novels, with a majority fromSpainand South America.Alana Portero’s celebrated (andPedro Almodóvar-approved) novels about queer life in 80s Madrid feature on his read pile, alongside the Mexican Juan Rulfo’s classic surrealist novel Pedro Páramo, whichinspired a young Gabriel García Márquezto write One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Federico García Lorca’s Gypsy Ballads.Bellerín, who played forArsenalfor nine years before moving back to his native Spain with Real Betis, talks about literature’s transformative power.View image in fullscreenHéctor BellerínPhotograph: H&M“Literature has become something that has – and I know it’s a cliche – but to me, it has completely changed my life,” he said from a Betis training camp in Portugal.Bellerín’s love of literature was sparked during the Covid-19 lockdowns, when the young full-back was isolating in his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He began reading the novels ofCharles Bukowskiwhile he was still playing for Arsenal.He made his way throughHollywoodandPost Office, the American writer’s autobiographical debut, which follows the life of the sardonic anti-hero Henry Chinaski. “I was miserable in quarantine,” said Bellerín. “I didn’t know when football was going to come back. I was even drinking a lot … I had a bit of a tough time. Literature, I’m not gonna say made me survive, but it made my life way easier.”Some footballers might shy away from sharing their love of reading, especially in a climate when anything outside the football bubble is deemed a “distraction”, but Bellerín has made no secret ofhis interestsbeyond sport.He’s flirted with fashion, and even started his own label. Heloves photography, and believes passionately in the power of art to help with mental health. He has been a vocal advocate for sustainability in football, and in 2022 he criticised the lack of media coverage of conflicts inPalestine, Iraq and Yemencompared with Ukraine.Bellerín grew up in a house of books. His father had a passion for ancient Greece, which inspired Bellerín’s first name. But between the ages of 19 and 26 he read mostly nonfiction (mirroring thehabits of many young men).View image in fullscreenBellerín spent 11 years at Arsenal.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/ReutersReading was something he did to learn something, rather than for pleasure. “When I read something, it had to have a purpose and then I realised it was the other way around,” he said.The work of the German-Swiss novelistHermann Hessefollowed Bukowski, but after making his way through 10 books, the Spaniard realised that he’d only read male writers and made a conscious decision to read more women.He moved on toThe Vegetarianby the Nobel prize winner Han Kang, andNaomi Klein’s Doppelganger, while cool, contemporary Spanish writers such as José Luis Sastre, Adrian Daine, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Carolina Yuste and the Granta young writerCristina Moralesdominate his book piles.View image in fullscreenBellerín during an H&M shoot.Photograph: H&MSergio C Fanjul, a culture writer at the Spanish daily El País, said the list showed Bellerín was “closely attuned to the pulse of the publishing world”, with writers such as Portero, Leila Guerriero, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Juan Tallon and Alejandro Zambra being some of the “most critically acclaimed writers” of recent years. “I think Bellerín is a reader who doesn’t simply follow mainstream trends,” Fanjul added.On his Portuguese training trip he’s brought a book of Leslie Jamison essays, Mary Karr’s Art of Memoir, Sara Mesa’s Cara de Pan, Simon Critchley’s What We Think About When We Think About Football and Samanta Schweblin’s Little Eyes, which the Guardian called “ingenious”.View image in fullscreenBellerín playing for Sporting.Photograph: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty ImagesThe footballer gets recommendations from a writing group he attends every Tuesday night in Seville. Made up of students, doctors and engineers, the group has introduced him to the contemporary Spanish literary scene.“We feed off each other, recommending books and movies. My taste has also changed, because the people I’ve got around me have great taste and give great recommendations, new names and new faces and new ways of writing.”There’s only one book that’s defeated him.He tried Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights in the original English before reverting to the Spanish translation, titled Cumbres Borrascosas. “I couldn’t get through that in English,” Bellerín confessed. “I tried it, but couldn’t.”Explore more on these topicsBooksSpainEuropeArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a moment, nothing stirred. The beams of light from the sun spotlit a nearby clump of bracken so intensely it reminded me of the torches Mulder and Scully used in The X Files.Then, a rustle came from up ahead. “Quick! I found them,” he yelled before disappearing into a clearing between the pines. I walked on, to find, in front of us, the curved edges and spherical lines of a UFO, coloured so dark it nearly blended into the shadows. It was, of course, a metal sculpture representing the alien vessel said to have landed here over 40 years ago. On top of it stood my son.Even before I managed to take a decent picture, he wanted to run on again. “We’ve got to find number four now,” he declared.We were in Suffolk’s Rendlesham Forest, a 15-mile drive from Ipswich, walking a free UFO trail, based on the sighting of unexplained flying objects by US military officers based here in 1980. Loving to follow a trail of any kind over several hours – but especially one where he can tick off numbers, so he knows there is an end (handily, this one culminates in a playground) – he walked, ran and skipped the three miles, while I enjoyed spending time outside with him.Beaches are always a winner when trying to convince kids that nature is coolWhen it comes to the summer holidays, it can feel as if we are doing a countdown. Of the 13 weeks most children get off school each year, six are lumped together over the summer, making July and August feel like a stretch of endless time. Not only can it be a nightmare, due to the juggle of childcare and work, but keeping kids entertained and – crucially – active rather than sat in front of screens can be expensive. So many activities cost a fortune. But there is another way. And it is completely free. And that is the outdoors.The UFO-themed walk was onForestry Englandland, which is one of the first places to turn during the holidays. From interactive app-based trails that allow you to take videos of your child pretending to be a dragon complete with AI wings, to crafting missions where you work together to find natural items on the woodland floor to make the face of the Gruffalo, they are an inexpensive way to immerse yourself in nature.On theUFO trail, a free leaflet at the start guided us around the trees where I could tell the story of the key sites. My son was so enamoured of the map and tale that the next morning at breakfast he asked me to read it again while he followed the map with his finger and remembered our adventure.View image in fullscreenPhoebe Smith and her son with Maggie Hambling’s scallop shell on Aldeburgh beach.But an outdoor adventure doesn’t have to be deep in the forest, where maps are required. The next day, we headed to Thorpeness, home to the much-photographedHouse in the Clouds, a former water tower that was disguised as a red and black clapboard house in 1923. Our mission was to find a way to get a good photograph of it. We followed a footpath up a hill, past quirkily painted weatherboarded houses which were popular after the first world war. While I was in awe of the house we had come to see, my little one found it way more exciting to discover the windmill opposite (bought by the creator of the House in the Clouds to help pump the water).Adjacent to Thorpeness is the town of Aldeburgh, where we spent hours on the shingle beach filling buckets with “magic stones”, chasing the waves, paddling in the North Sea and taking shelter under Maggi Hambling’s giant scallop shell sculpture when rain fell. The day was rounded off with a hearty helping of fish and chips from Aldeburgh Fish and Chips, owned by the same family since 1967. Weeks on, my son still talks about this day as one of the best in his life.We swam in the sea and were treated to a spectacle of the resident bottlenose dolphins putting on an impromptu performance at duskBeaches are always a winner when trying to convince kids that nature is cool. On a previous trip, I took my boy to New Quay in Ceredigion, west Wales (one of a few places that lay claim to being the inspiration for the characters and town in Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood). We didn’t set foot indoors for an entire day. When the tide was out, we set up a beach “base camp” with some shade under a giant parasol, then proceeded to bury each other in the sand. Then we looked for jellyfish washed up on the shore (a great opportunity to teach him about them), went rock pooling in the shallows (we found crabs, limpets, anemones and periwinkles) and built an elaborate fortified river, hewn from the silt using our buckets and spades.As the temperature rose, we swam in the sea and, just before the end of the day, we were treated to a spectacle of the resident bottlenose dolphins putting on an impromptu performance at dusk. None of this cost a penny. Yet we’d shared some of the best quality time I’ve experienced – bonding over the natural world, revelling in getting sand between our toes, and shivering in the cool waters of the Irish Sea.View image in fullscreenAn e-bike adventure on the Isle of MullFor something that feels like a bigger trip to my son, I try to involve a train. A couple of summers ago, we took the fast train to Scotland, then caught the ferry to the Isle of Mull as foot passengers. There, I hired an e-bike with a child seat and trailer, and we stopped off to wild camp near a loch. He helped me put up the tent, I cooked our dinner on a stove and we bonded over a shared love of marshmallows.We stayed up watching the sunset, despite it being way past his bedtime. “I love the sun so much,” he told me as we saw the sky turn purple. “I don’t want to go to sleep.” He did, thankfully, nod off under a sky full of stars, with not a mention of Bluey, Peppa Pig or any of the other characters he usually demands entertain him. On one of the last days, we woke before dawn. I packed a chocolate croissant in my bag and we climbed the nearest hill to watch the sun rise. He still talks about it and asks when we will do it again.‘I feel as if we could be in Scandinavia’: exploring the Norfolk that time forgotRead moreOne of my most memorable trips with him was paddleboarding on the river near our house. I packed a picnic and we paddled to an island, where we sat and watched the birds, while he asked what each one was called and demanded we collect some of their lost feathers to take home, in the hope we might one day be able to make a cape that allowed us to fly back here.Memories like this are priceless. I know, given his age, he probably won’t remember everything we do, but I hope going into the wild places will instil in him a knowledge that the natural world is a wondrous place and the backdrop to some of our happiest times together. For me, it helps to remember that when it comes to the holidays, instead of counting the days, I need instead to make the days count.Phoebe Smith is theauthor ofWayfarerand the2025 recipientof theRoyal Geographical Society’s Nessawardfor promotion of accessible adventure, particularly to women and those from underprivileged communitiesExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysSuffolk holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysWales holidaysEurope holidaysDay tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was crunchy and packed to the rafters with flavour, but, more importantly, it was cold. Until then, I’d been eating hot food in hot weather, but ever since I’ve been chasing that perfect cold summer meal. These coldhiyashiramen come close for me. They’re ludicrously versatile (think salad plus sauce plus noodles), and the only “cooking” to be done is boiling the noodles; the rest is chopping, blending (the sauce) and assembling. It is truly summertime where the living is easy.Sweetcorn hiyashiIf you have fresh corn cobs, boil them for five minutes, then drain, cool in cold water and slice the kernels off the cob.Prep10 minCook35 minServes48 spring onions(100g), trimmed and washed thoroughly8 tbsp good-quality neutral oil– I like rapeseed oil2½ tsp light soy sauce, plus 1 tbsp extra for the sweetcorn sauce2 tsp white-wine vinegar200g sweetcorn kernels, fresh (see introduction) or frozen1½ tbsp white miso1 garlic clove, peeled2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped300g dried ramen or soba noodles½ large cucumber(180g), cut in half widthways, then finely shredded100g cherry tomatoes, halved250g smoked tofu, cut into batons20g basil leaves, roughly tornPut the spring onions on a board and chop, chop, chop the greens and whites, running the knife over them over and over again to turn them into tiny fragments. Scrape the chopped onions into a bowl, add four tablespoons of the oil, two and a half teaspoons of soy sauce and the white-wine vinegar, then put to one side.Put three quarters (150g) of the sweetcorn kernels in a blender, add the miso, garlic, ginger, the extra tablespoon of soy sauce, the remaining four tablespoons of oil and 100ml water, and blitz: you’ll need to blend it for quite a while to break down the fibre of the sweetcorn.Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under the cold tap until cool. Drain really well, then put in a bowl, add the spring onion mix and toss very well to coat.Distribute the noodles between four plates or shallow bowls. Spoon a quarter of the sweetcorn sauce to one side of each portion, and next to it arrange a quarter of the cucumber, tomatoes, smoked tofu and the reserved whole corn kernels. Scatter over the torn basil leaves and eat.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodJapanese food and drinkVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkNoodlesSaladrecipesShareReuse this content"

Here’s the scoop …Tangy kimchi, bad ice-cream and good eggs: my tests for the food filter have changed how I shopTom HuntSat 19 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Last year, I won a grant from theenvironmental charity Hubbubto develop a food-waste-saving ice-cream brand. The learning curve was steep. Ice-cream is one of the most competitive and technically challenging foods to get right, because it has to be smooth, creamy and, crucially, shelf-stable. That has led some producers to be over-reliant on emulsifiers and stabilisers, some of which may be plant-derived, but they’re still ultra-processed, which may be a concern for some consumers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My tasting revealed a very clear quality scale. At the bottom are the foamy, highly processed tubs that shouldn’t even qualify as ice-cream. Others offered a slightly better texture and taste, but still have a processed edge, while others sit awkwardly in the middle, all food-dye yolk-yellow. But once the price hits 68p per 100g, things shift and we finally enter “real” ice-cream territory, featuring true frozen custards made from creme anglaise, and with recognisable ingredients and far cleaner flavours.Across the test, it became obvious that what’s sold as ice-cream spans from gorgeous churned custard to food-like industrial substances. Understanding what goes into these tubs, and how to taste the difference between them, can help us choose treats that actually nourish us (albeit in moderation), rather than just simulate satisfaction. My advice would be to invest in the most delicious you can afford and serve 50% smaller portions (eating by the scoop rather than the tub will help, too!). That way, we can enjoy the good stuff at the best possible price without overindulging.The best vanilla ice-creamBestoverall:Duchy Organic vanilla ice-cream£3.60 for 480ml at Waitrose (75p/100ml)★★★★☆Traditional firm scoop with a smooth, creamy texture. Mild and very clean vanilla flavour. A classic creme anglaise-style frozen custard, made with 28% cream. Minimally processed and organic, it’s barely pricier than other premium options, yet has superior credentials and is good value.Best bargain:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 480ml at Sainsbury’s (68p/100ml)★★★★☆Firm to scoop with a clean, balanced flavour and just the right level of sweetness. Less smooth than some, but satisfyingly rich with a creme anglaise-style base. Made with West Country double cream and Madagascan vanilla. Minimally processed and the best value of the lot.And the rest …Yeo Valley organic vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 500ml at Ocado (95p/100ml)£3.80 for 500ml at Waitrose (76p/100ml)★★★★☆A speckled, firm, traditional scoop with a clean, well-balanced vanilla flavour. Fractionally less smooth than others, this is still a classic creme anglaise-style custard ice-cream. Minimally processed and organic, it stands out as having lower sugar and saturated fat than most. Contains 24.5% cream.M&S Collection West Country Madagascan vanilla luxury ice-creamView image in fullscreen£4.25 for 500ml at Ocado (85p/100ml)★★★★☆Firm, speckled scoop with a clean, subtle vanilla flavour.

Contains emulsifier E471, but it’s redeemed by being made with Cornish milk and 6% clotted cream. Although I can’t give it a stamp of approval, this is one of the better more economical ice-creams I tried.Mackie’s indulgent Madagascan vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£3.60 for 1 litre at Ocado (36p/100ml)£3.85 for 1 litre at Morrisons (39p/100ml)★★☆☆☆Pale in colour with a soft scoop and light, smooth texture. Airy but pleasant. Contains E471 and is slightly higher in sugar than some, but not overly sweet. An OK budget-range option.Carte D’Or Madagascan vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 900ml at Tesco (42p/100ml)£4.75 for 900ml at Co-op (53p/100ml)★☆☆☆☆Bright yellow from carotene dye and flecked with vanilla, this has a smooth yet foamy mouthfeel. Despite the name, this highly processed dessert isn’t real ice-cream, because it’s made with reconstituted skimmed milk, coconut fat, glucose-fructose syrup and a slew of stabilisers and emulsifiers, including E471.Wall’s soft-scoop vanilla ice-creamView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 1.8 litres at Ocado (15p/100ml)£2.75 for 1.8 litres at Tesco (15p/100ml)☆☆☆☆☆Bright yellow, with a light, aerated texture and synthetic sweetness. Not technically ice-cream (it contains zero cream) and loaded with additives such as carrageenan and mono- and diglycerides (E471). Ultra-processed and lacking any real dairy character. So cheap, it’s a parody of itself.Co-op vanilla flavour ice-creamView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 900ml at Co-op (33p/100ml)☆☆☆☆☆Bright yellow with a synthetic vanilla flavour. Moussey, spongy texture and artificial creaminess. The main ingredient is water, bulked with sugars, emulsifiers and stabilisers. Incredibly, it actually contains ground vanilla pods, though you’d never guess. Unbelievably terrible.Explore more on these topicsIce-cream and sorbetThe FilterFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Isobel Clarke.FoodSemifreddo and granita: Jacob Kenedy’s recipes for Italian summer dessertsA Sicilian shaved ice dessert of fresh pomegranate juice and a luxurious frozen cream pudding layered with boozy cakeJacob KenedySat 19 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareHere are two recipes that I’ve been eating at home with my family since even before the warmer weather started to make me smile: a tiramisu semifreddo and a granita, the Sicilian iced slush (made from fresh fruit juice, nut milks or coffee) that is is the Slush Puppie’s distinguished aunt. The ultimate refreshers on a sunny day at any time of the year.Tiramisu semifreddo (pictured top)Prep5 minCook45 minFreeze6 hr+Serves106 eggs, separated350g caster sugar250g mascarpone200ml whipping or double cream200ml espresso90ml rum, or brandy or marsala60g cocoa powder, plus 1 tsp extra for dusting16-20 savoiardi biscuitsFirst, mix the egg whites with 150g of the caster sugar in a small saucepan and stir over a low heat until steaming hot (70C). Transfer to a stand mixer, whip on high speed until completely cool with stiff peaks, then transfer to a clean bowl.Whisk the egg yolks and 100g sugar in a large bowl set over a pan of simmering water, beating constantly, until voluminous and hot. Move the bowl on to a bowl of iced water and whisk again until cool. Add the mascarpone and whisk again until completely incorporated.Whip the cream on medium-low to soft peaks, then fold it into the mascarpone mix. Gently fold in the whipped egg whites.In a separate bowl, stir the espresso with the remaining 100g sugar and your chosen booze.Line a two-litre container with clingfilm and, using a tea strainer, sift a quarter of the cocoa powder over the base. Gently spread about a third of the mascarpone cream on top of the cocoa. One by one, dip half the sponge fingers in the boozy espresso syrup, soaking them thoroughly, then arrange in a neat layer on top of the mascarpone cream.Dust with another quarter of the cocoa powder, then top with another third of the mascarpone cream. Repeat with a second layer of soaked biscuits and another quarter of the cocoa powder. Top with the remaining third of the mascarpone cream and dust the top with the remaining cocoa powder. Freeze for about six hours or more, until completely set.Just before serving, turn out the semifreddo on to a cool platter, dust with the remaining teaspoon of cocoa powder, then slice and serve.Pomegranate granitaView image in fullscreenHere, I use pomegranate – a favourite fruit and emblem of Sicily – but you can use any fruit juice you fancy (or berries blended with a tiny amount of water). As with all the best recipes that call for few ingredients and minimal intervention, the quality of the granita is solely dependent on the quality of the pomegranates: look for ones with a deep, purplish garnet colour to their seeds.Prep25 minFreeze4 hr+MakesAbout 1 litre2kg whole pomegranates, or 1.2kg pomegranate seeds, or 1 litre pomegranate juice (look for one that is 100% pomegranate juice, and ideally not from concentrate)100g white sugarFirst, pick the seeds from the pomegranates, discarding any of the cream-coloured membrane, which isverybitter. Transfer the seeds to a food processor (not a blender, which would pulp the pips and release their bitterness) and whizz until the pips are still whole, but released from their crystalline flesh.Strain through a sieve, pressing to extract all the juice, then stir in the sugar until dissolved.Transfer to a wide dish and put it in the freezer. Once it starts to freeze at the edges, and every 10-15 minutes thereafter, stir with a fork or whisk, and repeat until it’s almost completely frozen and icy; this should take about four hours in all.The granita is ready to serve in this slightly wet, slushy state, but if you want to keep it longer, leave the granita to freeze solid, then take it out to thaw for 20 minutes or so before serving, then break it up with a fork.Jacob Kenedy is chef and owner ofGelupo,Bocca di LupoandPlaquemine Lock, all in LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodIce-cream and sorbetDessertNuts and seedsFruitCoffeeItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
