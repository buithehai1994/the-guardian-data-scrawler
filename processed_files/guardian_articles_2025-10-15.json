Having replaced Angela Rayner as housing secretary, he bounded around Labour conference last month dishing out Maga-red caps stamped with his credo “Build Baby Build!”. Headgear and slogan have both been filched from that very rightwing guy in the White House – because, like Robert Jenrick, Steve Reed is what happens when self-identified centrists turn populist.Imagine Donald Trump had, years ago, swerved TV fame to become instead ward councillor for Brixton Hill. Imagine if Trump had no towers, but knew his way round a Travelodge. Most of all,imagine this scenefrom the conference fringe, recounted by Inside Housing magazine:“Steve Reed skipped into the room only once the well-orchestrated chanting by his party faithful was deemed loud enough to the tune of We Built This City by Starship. He then took to the stage and proceeded to throw more signed and branded merchandise into the crowd, before cracking open a bottle of alcohol because ‘all builders need a beer’.“One sector professional’s response to the proceedings was ‘dear God’.”Steve Reed: he built this city, he built this city on rock’n’roll.Except there is no building, baby. Labour was elected last yearon a pledge of 1.5mnew homes by the end of this parliament, yet in private, Reed’s officials already accept they will end up breaking that promise. Take London, where the government wants88,000 homes finishedbefore January. That goal was always a huge stretch but now it looks like a joke: so far this year ground has broken on just 3,248 new units. The figurecomes from the consultancy Molior, which says that one in every six major housing projects is frozen: “schemes are halted, with the gates padlocked”.The shortfall is so vast as to sow panic in government and to push No 10 into a war-room exercise over a recent weekend where a team worked on a rescue package. The results will be public as soon as next week, when Reed unveils an emergency scheme, billed as gettingLondonbuilding again.I have seen a private memo circulated within the Ministry ofHousingthat reveals the measures and the thinking behind the measures. While they may help the big property developers on whom ministers rely, they will almost certainly heighten the very crisis in affordable housing that Labour vowed to fix. London is already infamous around the world for its inability to house ordinary Londoners, and this plan will add to the chaos already inflicted on families and local authorities.Sent last week, the memo details extensive discussions with senior executives at Barratt, Vistry and Berkeley – among other major housebuilders – for whom government officials rehearsed their plans. This privileged access appears to have been reserved almost exclusively for the property industry, with representatives of housing associations invited in further down the road while groups representing ordinary tenants, and even London councils, do not seem to have been involved at all.That fits with the logic of the plan, which centres on watering down builders’ commitments to provide affordable and social housing. When he was first elected as the capital’s mayor in 2016, Labour’s Sadiq Khan promised he wouldbuild homes for Londoners, not “gold bricks for overseas investors”. As a first step, he introduced a threshold: if builders reserved 35% of a development for affordable homes, their application would be fast-tracked. Affordable was loosely defined (technically, any housing at up to 80% of market value counts as “affordable”). Neither a target nor an obligation, it had the hallmark of New Labour compromise – an incentive for the market to do its bit.Yet under Keir Starmer, even New Labour can seem dangerously statist, and Reed’s department is seriously considering slashing that thresholdto just 20%affordable homes, making building in London far more profitable. If that isn’t enough of a sweetener, half will be paid for out of public money, so the cash local authorities receive from the sale of council houses will now go into padding out developers’ profit margins.View image in fullscreenReed plans other sweeteners, such as suspending thecommunity levydevelopers have long paid for amenities such as a new GP surgery or a school. Looking at government calculations, that one giveaway alone could put around £1bn back in the pockets of wealthy developers. Not all these proposals may make it into final programme, but the direction is clear.“The key test is that developers welcome the package strongly on the day,” says the memo. The same industry that, as recently as the pandemic were raking in billions in profit, is now being ushered to the front of the queue by aLabourgovernment that just last year promised “the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation” – another promise for the dustbin.One former insider at the department recalls sustained pressure from No 10 and the Treasury to bin the emphasis on social housing, which was always successfully resisted by Angela Rayner – who wielded the combined authority of deputy prime minister and deputy leader – and her housing minister Matthew Pennycook. Until the government’s personnel changed abruptly last month, that is.So much for high politics; the ground reality is of a housing crisis that just keeps getting bigger. Over 13,000 people slept rough in London in 2024-25, four times the number before David Cameron’s austerity regime. At the start of this year, 73,000 households across the capitalwere in temporary accommodation, including 90,000 children – so that on average at least one child in every classroom in Londonis homeless. The capital’s councils pay out £5.5m every day just to put them up in rooms that are too often cramped, ridden with mould and worse.None of this will be improved by these measures, as laid out here. More than one source believes developers will halt projects already under way, arguing they should be allowed to divert into more profitable housing. A source at the Greater London Authority estimates that up to 20,000 affordable homes already planned, some even part-built, could rapidly disappear. Over the longer term, says Duncan Bowie, a key architect of theLondon Planunder Ken Livingstone, the memo will take Londoners back to the housing policies of Boris Johnson. Think infinity pools in the sky, while thanks to the housing-welfare cuts brought in by George Osborne and not reversed by Rachel Reeves, lower-income Londoners are exiled hundreds of miles away from family and friends.In response to my questions, the housing ministry issued a short statement that reads in part: “We do not comment on leaks. No decisions have been made.”Ministers will probably argue that 20% of something is better than 35% of nothing – except London’s housing problem today is not primarily about over-regulation – it’s about the lack of demand. Wages are barely rising, interest rates are way off their post-crisis lows and house prices remain untenably high. As Molior put it: “No buyers = no construction starts”.Just a few months before council elections in London and elsewhere, a Labour government is about to unveil a scheme that shows who it values most – and it doesn’t look like ordinary Londoners. As Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing at Wandsworth’s Labour council, puts it: “This is rolling over for developers.”It’s not just Steve Reed’s baseball caps that look Trumpian.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not me.”Hedda gives drinks to a recovering alcoholic – and a loaded pistol to an unstable former loverThis is a typical exchange from a director and actor partnership that’s now on its third film, and seemingly built on a healthy amount of negging and mickey-taking. The first outing was 2018’s Little Woods, which starred Thompson as a bar-brawling drug mule who contemplates “just one more job” –crossing the border from North Dakota into Canada to acquire opioids. Shot on a shoestring budget, it was a stylish and bracing calling card that set the director, now 35, on a meteoric rise.Since then, DaCosta has become an in-demand director who can turn her hand to just about anything. She brought horror classic Candyman back to life ina celebrated reboot, then teamed up with Thompson again on The Marvels,the $374m budget-blowingsequel to Captain Marvel, and her next outing will be the forthcoming zombie chomp-fest 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time’ ... DaCosta directing Thompson as Hedda.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/PrimeThe pair’s latest project, perhaps understandably, raised a few eyebrows – as they chose to film a play by the notoriously dour Scandinavian playwright Henrik Ibsen. DaCosta’s first exposure to the Norwegian was viaA Doll’s House, in which a seemingly devoted wife and mother called Nora Helmer suddenly bolts. The play, which was written in the 1870s, stunned the director. “How daring, to write about a woman who leaves her children because she feels as if she hasn’t fully realised her own life,” says DaCosta. “It would be controversial now. Then I read Hedda and thought, ‘Wow –thiswoman!’”Hedda is Hedda Gabler, the titular character in Ibsen’s later play. Hedda is a rare thing: a complicated, multi-faceted female lead in a classic drama. It’s a role that has tempted many, even if pulling it off is notoriously difficult. In the UK, over the last decade or so, we’ve had Sheridan Smith’sadmirable turn; a shocking denouement in Patrick Marber’s versionstarring Ruth Wilson; and, most recently, Lily Allen,who received mixed reviews.To construct her Hedda, who is the daughter of a general trapped in a stifling marriage to an academic, Thompson delved into theatre archives in New York and London, studying hours of performances with two rules: watch each one just once and don’t take notes. “It got to the pointthat I knew the play so well, I could watch productions in Norwegian without subtitles and know what was happening,” says the 42-year-old from Los Angeles.Another influence was Mae West, the movie star who once found herself in courtafter writing a play with a gay lead character. She so inspired Thompson that the actor uses Maeas her middle nameon some social media platforms. From that heady mix, Thompson created a Hedda as extreme as any seen on stage or screen. To describe her character as quite a piece of work is putting it mildly. She’s a sexy, sultry, machiavellian, vulnerable mess of a protagonist who, as DaCosta says, does “terrible, unforgivable things”. These include thrusting drinks into the hands of a recovering alcoholic and giving a loaded pistol to an emotionally unstable former lover. The fact that Thompson’s Hedda is a mixed-race, bisexual woman adds even more complexity.View image in fullscreenBrief cameo ... Thompson in The Marvels.Photograph: Marvel StudiosIn the film, rather than being overt, the question of race subtly lingers: we see Hedda having to deal with whispered comments about her skin tone from party guests. “Her father is white and her mother is black,” says DaCosta. “And you never hear her talk about her mother. That means a lot. But there’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time, because that’s not really what we’re focusing on. But it colours everything – no pun intended.”Hedda was shot in Flintham Hall, a Grade I-listed Italianate manor house near Newark in Nottinghamshire, with DaCosta setting proceedings in the 1950s, just as the postwar dust was settling in Britain. “After the second world war,” says DaCosta, whose father is British, “people were trying to figure out what the hell to do with themselves, asking who we are, how you heal. I think people were trying to pretend everything was OK, trying to get back to what was supposed to be the way society runs. These characters are trying to figure out what freedom looks like. I thought that decade would be a really great pressure-cooker to make everything more potent.”For a big, starry film that’s going to be on Amazon soon, the whole enterprise is exceptionally dark. It’s broody and low-lit, with tempers flaring and things falling apart. That’s a recurring theme in DaCosta’s work. “Growing up, I was like, ‘Why did that person just lie? Why did that person do something cruel?’ I think the darkness in my work is really my curiosity about the darkness in other people – and myself.”View image in fullscreenHemmed in … Thompson, Nina Hoss and Imogen Poots in Hedda.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/ PrimeAll the female characters – including Nina Hoss’s incredible turn as the volatile genius Dr Lovborg, a male lover of Hedda’s in Ibsen’s original – are hemmed in, trying to find breathing space in a patriarchal world. I wonder if DaCosta and Thompson see parallels in modern Hollywood, whereone study foundthat the number of female leads in Hollywood movies had hit a 10-year low.“There are limitations,” says DaCosta, who was born in New York but lives in London. “We need to change that. We’re all chipping away at that stuff.” She mentions the support she has had from Alana Mayo, president of Orion Pictures, which produced the film. Thompson jokes that DaCosta is a “refreshing, honest and candid” voice in Hollywood. After her breakout film Candyman, DaCosta discussed the “shocking way people have talked to me in my position as a director”. When she left The Marvels in post-production to work on Hedda after repeated delays, she responded toanonymous briefings against herby saying: “They knew the entire time that I had an obligation– a greenlit movie with people who were waiting for me.”Today, DaCosta is keen to downplay any idea of her being combative, saying: “There’s no ire in any of my energy. I was on the Avengers set a couple weeks ago because I still have relationships with these people.” She mentions Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios. “He wrote me a letter for my UK visa.”View image in fullscreen‘The math is different for me’ … DaCosta at the Zurich film festival earlier this month.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for ZFFBut, despite the smooth personal relationships with major players, DaCosta knows she and other black women in Hollywood face invisible barriers, just like Hedda and Dr Lovborg. “The math is different for me,” she says. “If I want to lead a film with a white actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I know that budget. And if I want to do that same movie with a black actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I get less money.”But for now, the actor she is most keen to work with is Thompson – and, despite the negging, there’s a clear affection between the two. Is it true DaCosta has a portrait ofThompson in her dining room? “What a very targeted and bizarre question,” says DaCosta, laughing. “Yes, I have a portrait from the movie that’s really beautiful of the character of Hedda portrayed by Tessa Thompson.”“It doesn’t look like me,” says Thompson. “It’s like an expressionist version of Hedda Gabler.”How does Thompson feel about all this? “She got the painting to give to me and then she took it home and said, ‘I will give it to you if you move to London.”DaCosta, suddenly sounding like Hedda the master manipulator, responds: “She knows what she has to do to get the painting. Until then, it’s in my dining room.”Hedda is in UK cinemas on 24 October and on Amazon Prime Video from 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmTessa ThompsonHenrik IbsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That she would have had time to reflect on her performance during Tuesday’s Gaza statement and decided that being the only person in Britain who is actually against a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza was not a great stance.But self-awareness just isn’t Kemi’s strong point. She has never come across a hole she didn’t want to dig deeper. She’s just not that bright. Throughout her life, people have told her she can achieve anything if she tried hard enough and she’s made the fatal mistake of believing them.Of course, Kemi might argue that she has proved the doubters wrong. She has become leader of the Tory party, after all. Though that’s not the job it used to be. A small party becoming ever smaller. Where no sensible person really wants to be leader anyway. But credit where credit’s due – Kemi is the living embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger effect.She had come to Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions pumped up to continue her interrogation over the collapse of the China spying case. Just as everyone had expected. Not least,Keir Starmer, who opened the session with a lengthy statement.The Tory accusations were baseless. It was just a desperate attempt to make trouble. The facts of the case were as described earlier – it had been the Tories’ failure, while in government, to describe the Chinese as a threat that had led to the charges being dropped. But in the interests of transparency, he was going to publish the three witness statements, including the key one from Matt Collins, the deputy national security adviser.All this completely wrongfooted Kemi. She had come to the Commons expecting to put Starmer under the cosh simply by repeating the same allegations she had made during the ministerial statement on Monday.She had made no real headway then, but had come back for another go. She is nothing if not a trier. It had worked at her party conference where standing up for an hour without falling over and announcing a tax cut she was never going to make happen was enough to make everyone think she had been sent down from heaven as leader. The latest in a long line of Tory messiahs.Other Tories sensed the danger that Kemi was in. Neil O’Brien, shadow minister for policy renewal – whatever that means – came rushing to her side, hoping to explain the implications of what Starmer was saying. Only Kemi wasn’t really in the mood for listening. She never is. Instead she just ploughed on with her original questions.“The prime minister has had to be dragged here to make a statement,” she said. “And he refuses to answer questions.” All great, except none of it was true. Starmer had voluntarily chosen to make a statement and had said he would be happy to answer any questions. From there, it was pretty much all downhill for Kemi. She would have been better off saying she would return to the case once she had time to consider the new evidence. Put the prime minister on notice that this was not yet over. Then change tack for the rest ofPMQs. Tax rises, for example.But Kemi is Kemi. She can’t change. Can’t think on her feet. Or when sitting down, for that matter. So for the next 10 minutes she just had to suck it up while she had her arse handed to her on a plate by Starmer. While Keir appeared confident that the evidence would back up his assertions that no pressure had been put on the Crown Prosecution Service to drop the case, Kemi was all shouty conspiracy theory allegations.“You’re a lawyer, not a leader,” said Kemi at one point. Failing to appreciate that this was one occasion where it was quite useful to have some legal expertise. Keir merely pointed out that she was neither a lawyer nor a leader. Case proved.None of which is to say that Starmer provided all the answers. The case is incredibly complex and the evidence confusing. Apparently it’s fine for us to spy on the US – it’s a patriotic duty – but not for the Chinese to spy on us. Spying on friends isn’t really spying. Just backup. Helping them out.Nor was it clear why anyone might think that a Tory MP, Alicia Kearns, was worth spying on. She’s never done anything of any interest to a would-be spy. Copying out her diary would hardly be intelligence. Above all, no one has properly explained why the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges. No one – apart from Kemi – is ruling out incompetence.As it was, Kemi was out-thought and outgunned. Starmer was able to point to quotes from both James Cleverly, the then foreign secretary, and Kemi herself in which they had described being careful not to call China a threat. Time and again, he hammered home his central point that it had been the Tories’ failures that had led to the collapse of the trial. He looked and sounded like a man who thought he had nothing to hide.Tory Tom Tugendhat, who probably knows rather more about the legal complexities of the case, asked Starmer outright whether the government had put any pressure on the CPS. “No,” he said. What’s more, when he had been director of public prosecutions, no government had ever leant on him. It was an article of faith. If it turns out Starmer has been economical with the truth after this, then he will be in a lot of bother. But no one is holding their breath.A lively session ended with Cleverly making a point of order. When he had said China was not a threat, what he had really meant was that China was a huge threat. Would that do? It wouldn’t. Poor old Dimly. Sometimes he says it best when he says nothing at all.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchConservativesLabourPMQsKeir StarmerKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

But the winking references on social media to that crash-out song, about a man who discovers his girl in bed with his best friend and lets rage take over, were soon crowded out by shirtless images of the four-time Grammy winner as tribute. It’s the last thing he’d want to be remembered for.Experimental, sensual and political, D’Angelo radically redrew the boundaries of soul musicRead moreThe images all derive from the same source: the 2000 music video for Untitled (How Does It Feel), from D’Angelo’s sophomore album, Voodoo. And to hearthe multiplatinum-selling artist himself tell itover the years, he would have swiftly backpedaled from the New York soundstage where it was filmed if he had the day to do over. While the song itself was composed as an homage to Prince, D’Angelo’s handlers had the bright idea to reposition the music video as a mouthwatering teaser for Voodoo that would also exhibit a dramatic fitness transformation that had the singer striking an even stronger resemblance tothe NFL running back Marshawn Lynch.Made to look as if captured in one shot, the Untitled video revolves around a brawny D’Angelo as he lip-synchedthe sex pleawhile appearing as if completely nude. The pajama bottoms he wore were hung low as possible to remain out of view. Taking the perspective of a lover in close quarters, director Paul Hunter sized up D’Angelo like a meal, setting him against a black backdrop for the camera to tarry on his pectorals, adonis belt and lips. The steamy finished product, which elapsed nearly four and a half minutes and was repurposed for a Voodoo album cover that wound up bearing a parental advisory sticker, effectively rebooted D’Angelo – to that point marketed as the hunky but introverted R&B star from around the way – into an S-tier sex symbol to rival Lenny Kravitz.“I feel guilty because that was never the intention,” D’Angelo’s ex-manager Dominique Trenier toldSpin in 2008. “To this day, in the general populace’s memory, he’s the naked dude.” Mark Jenkins, the trainer who whipped D’Angelo into shape for the video, had regrets, too.While Voodoo debuted at the top of the charts and stayed there, D’Angelo shrank from heightened expectations and came to resent the female fans demanding his clothes as they rained lingerie on stage (his habit of simulating bedroom acts on stage wouldn’t help matters).After touring the album, he withdrew from the spotlight and spiraled into addiction until a 2010 arrest for soliciting blew his cover. His bloated and bleary-eyed mugshot gave news outlets license to kick him while he was down. CBS, that network we’re all so worried about abandoning its journalistic values, literally asked How Does it Feel? inthe headline of its news story– a move ripped from the TMZ playbook. All the while critics seized on the chance to reopen the cultural discourse about thehyper sexualization of the Black male bodyand thelimits of the female gaze.“One time I got mad when a female threw money at me onstage, and that made me feel fucked-up, and I threw the money back at her,” hetold GQin 2012. “I was like, ‘I’m not a stripper.’ When I got back home [from touring], it wasn’t that easy to justbe.”But to the fans who really loved D’Angelo, and I include myself here, the sex god image was always a footnote to his staggering musical genius. You only had to listen to extract the truth, that D’Angelo was R&B’s oldest cliche: a preacher’s kid from the deep south who broke away from the church band to pursue his dream of playing secular music. (Ryan Coogler just frameda whole horror moviearound this archetype.) A lot of D’Angelo music – the Voodoo album, not least – nods at this spiritual dissonance.My formal introduction to D’Angelo was the music video for Me and Those Dreamin’ Eyes of Mine, the breakout single from Brown Sugar – a quintessential no-skip album. (Ask anyone who was in high school or college when it dropped.) That video, which presents D’Angelo as a one-man quartet, is a much sharper encapsulation of his astounding artistic range and knack for cinching gospel and hip-hop elements together with his feline melismas to makestank-face inducingsoul grooves.The Brown Sugar video was a welcome (if too brief) reprieve from the east-west rap wars playing out across cable music at the time, and it sent me on a quest to learn more. I’m still chasing the rush I felt upon finding out that D’Angelo could in fact play all those instruments in between harmonizing with himself, like a latter-day Marvin Gaye, and stay in the pocket in each space; Jamie Foxx and Anderson .Paak, to name twoshamelessimpersonators, owe D’Angelo a tremendous debt for paving an express lane in the music industry for R&B polymaths.‘The architect of Black Gen X sonic feeling and eloquence’: D’Angelo’s 10 greatest tracksRead moreD’Angelo was the rare artist who could hear the past and the future. His distinct sound could launch a treasure hunt to track down his influences (starting with mega hip-hop producer J Dilla), and then have you wondering all over again how on earth he put together such a wide array of Black music – from the Native Tongues to Sly Stone to the Pilgrim Jubilees, an old-school gospel foursome. One of my profound regrets in life is missingD’Angelo’s Voodoo tour– which one of my dearest friends, a committed melophile, still describes as “the best show I’ve ever been to”.The making of the Voodoo album– an Electric Lady Studios group project that was happening as the Roots (Things Fall Apart), Common (Like Water for Chocolate) and Erykah Badu (Mama’s Gun) were in session and Jill Scott was popping over – belongsin the pantheon of legendary music folktales.One of the last albums I bought before renting music became the prevailing model was D’Angelo’s Black Messiah – the long-awaited third album that landed against the backdrop of a burgeoning racial reckoning movement. I kept my whole house up for JK Simmons’s turn hosting SNL in 2015 – not because I loved Whiplash, but so we could watch D’Angelo’s musical guest spotas a family. For the performance ofThe Charade, a systemic racism protest anthem, D’Angelo ensconced his fuller frame in black while his bandmates wore matching tops that read I Can’t Breathe and Black Lives Matter.Thatimage, as much a political statement as a rejection of the Untitled persona, is the one that still sticks with me. A year ago, longtime ally Raphael Saadiqlet slipthat D’Angelo was working on a fourth album. One can only imagine the emotion and the commotion it would have stirred in this fraught day and age.D’Angelo – a life in picturesRead moreAltogether, D’Angelo leaves behind a slew of collaborators (Method Man,Questlove,Lauryn Hill) and three children; the eldest is an adult son, Michael Archer Jr, whois surely reelingfrom having to suffer this loss seven months after his mother, Angie Stone, waskilled in a car crashnear Montgomery, Alabama. A neo-soul pioneer herself, Stone had a heavy hand in shaping D’Angelo’s artistic development, down to braiding the cornrows he wore on the shoot for Untitled – which achieved the 51st spot on Rolling Stone’s list of the best 100 songs of the 2000s. Its music video may have doomed him to recognition as a star-crossed sex god, but his body of work remains his lasting redemption. In the end D’Angelo made three studio albums that defined the decades in which they were released and stand together as one of the all-time great modern music catalogs. There aren’t many artists left who can honestly say howthatfeels.Explore more on these topicsD'AngeloSoulR&BcommentShareReuse this content"

And let’s hear it for the world’s first all-timber stadium!Catherine SlessorWed 15 Oct 2025 13.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 13.33 EDTShareBill Shankly, a man so beloved byLiverpoolthat there is now a hotel in the city named after him, once famously observed: “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.”Inevitably, Shankly pops up inHome Ground,a punchy new exhibition on the architecture and social culture of football stadiums. The legendary manager is pictured savouring the acclaim of an adoring crowd, part of a tableau on the farewell to the Kop prior to its metamorphosis from churning tribal terrace into a more sedate, all-seater stand.In a bizarre optical illusion, when crowds surge down the corkscrew towers, they appear to be spirallingMarinaded in the romance and obsessiveness of the beautiful game, Liverpool is a serendipitous setting for a dive into the history and destiny of football grounds. Everton have justmigrated to a super sleek new home, the 52,000 capacity Hill Dickinson Stadium on the Mersey waterfront, neatly encapsulating the distance football and its venues have travelled from rain-lashed terraces, flat caps and leaden balls, to a high-end, multi-sensory experience, with those who can afford it cosseted in private boxes and plied with fine dining, not unlike a visit to the opera.View image in fullscreenSt James’ Park football stadium, Newcastle upon Tyne.Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA CollectionsIllustrated by a rich assortment of drawings, models, photographs and other ephemera, the exhibition’s chronological sweep opens with a 1906 plan of Anfield by Scottish architectArchibald Leitch. The towering terrace of 132 steps at the home end became known as the Kop, after the bloody hilltop battle of Spion Kop during the Boer war.Drawing on his early experience of designing factories and warehouses, Leitch went on to become the imperator of early football grounds. With daunting efficiency, he notched up more than 20 across the UK, including Stamford Bridge (Chelsea), Highbury (Arsenal) and Ibrox (Glasgow Rangers). Over a 29-year period he also designed Goodison Park, home of Liverpool’s great rivals Everton. Still used by its women’s team, it was the first ground in Britain to have seats and terracing on all four sides.England may have invented and formalised the game, but in the matter of stadium design, it was its European neighbours who really ran with the ball. In Florence, Fiorentina employed the renowned modernistPier Luigi Nervito devise a graceful exercise in reinforced concrete that brilliantly exploited the material’s potential to be shaped and sculpted. In Rotterdam, Feyenoord’s stadium of 1937 embodied the functionalist ideals of theDutchNieuwe Bouwen(New Building)movement, with a lightweight, skeletal steel frame used to suspend the upper tier above the lower, offering an unimpeded view of the pitch, revolutionary for its time.In a nice touch, the show’s thematic sections are denoted by custom designed football scarves in the zinging emerald green of grass under floodlights. In the part dedicated to Italia 90, graphic designerAlberto Burri’s definitive World Cup poster features a football pitch in Rome’s Colosseum, the ur-stadium and theoretical point of origin for all modern football grounds. Italy went large on its hosting duties, spending billions upgrading existing stadiums and constructing new ones, including a sunken bowl in Bari by the Genoese hi-tech architect Renzo Piano with structural ribs resembling a whale’s carcass.Dominating proceedings like a giant wedding cake is a model of theSan Siro in Milan. For Italia 90, an entirely new structure was built over the original 1926 stadium, incorporating red steel roof trusses supported by corkscrew-shaped circulation towers. Memorably, when crowds surge down the corkscrews, the towers appear to be spiralling, in a bizarre optical illusion. Though it remains the base of AC Milan and rivals Inter, after years of protracted wrangling, its days look to be numbered.View image in fullscreenAllianz Arena, Munich, Germany.Photograph: Herzog & de MeuronThere are some surprising heirs to Archie Leitch. Though you might not think it, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are huge football aficionados with their firm producing some of the most radically inventive contemporary stadium designs. Fabricated from nearly 3,000 inflatable foil cushions impregnated with LED lighting, Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena can instantly change the colour of its skin, like a colossal, glowing chameleon. And in Braga, in northern Portugal, Eduardo Souto de Moura set a stadium in a disused limestone quarry, a natural amphitheatre where a wayward shot on goal will rebound off a cliff face.View image in fullscreenGala Fairydean FC stadium on the Scottish Borders.Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA Collections“Spaceship” is an overused epithet, but football stadiums do have an otherworldly aura, as modern colossi looming above huddled neighbourhoods, evocative of Philip Larkin’s “ships up streets”. Yet size isn’t necessarily everything. In Galashiels in Scotland, Gala Fairydean’s bijoux stand for 750 supporters resembles a piece of concrete origami, designed byPeter Womersleyin 1965.A pivotal moment was legislation for the development of all-seater grounds following the catastrophe of Hillsborough, its impactstill resonatingafter nearly four decades. Before Hillsborough, 56 people died in the 1985Bradford City stadium fire, in which the dilapidated main stand became an inferno within 270 seconds. Such disasters marked a hideous low point in British football history, showing how supporters were seen in a demeaning and dehumanised light by the authorities and how ageing structures had become rickety death traps.Unimaginably removed from the era of seething crowds on acres of terraces, the future of football stadiums lies in being increasingly sustainable and flexible. After the retractable roof comes the retractable pitch, as at Tottenham Hotspur’s new ground by arena design specialists Populus, which can accommodate everything from concerts to American football.Currently managed by former bad boy Robbie Savage, Forest Green Rovers may be minnows playing in the English league’s fifth tier, but have been described by Fifa as “the greenest team in the world”, demonstrating that a club can prioritise sustainability and still achieve success. Its proposal to build the world’s first all-timber stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will form the centrepiece of a new ecology park for the local community.View image in fullscreenTottenham Hotspur Stadium.Photograph: (c) PopulousThe growth of the women’s game is also destined to shape the stadiums of the future. American club Kansas City Current are the first to play in a purpose-built venue for women’s professional soccer, incorporating subtle design changes such as modified seating and sight-lines, all calculated to appeal to a more family-oriented fanbase.The architectural historianNikolaus Pevsneronce said: “A bicycle shed is a building; Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture.” For much of their history, football stadiums used to be more bike shed than cathedral but their time has now spectacularly come.Home Ground: The Architecture of Football is at RIBA North, Liverpool andTate Liverpool, 15 October to 25 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArchitectureThe RIBALiverpoolTate LiverpoolDesignArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The civil servant’s second witness statement, made in February, said the government was “committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China” – though it also noted that China was the “biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”.The prosecution was suddenly dropped last month in what had been expected to be a high profile case under the 1911 Official Secrets Act – prompting accusations from the Conservatives thatLabourhad not allowed Collins to supply the statements demanded by the prosecutor because Starmer and his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, wanted a more positive relationship with Beijing.Responding to Conservative claims of political interference, Starmer said at prime minister’s questions it was “absolutely not” the case and said Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, had made a “completely scurrilous allegation”.In a series of robust exchanges in the Commons, Badenoch accused Starmer of not being honest about what had happened. “The charges were brought under us, the case collapsed under them,” she said. “Can the prime minister tell us what changed and what collapsed the case?”Starmer turned his fire on the Tories, saying “it was their failure and they are just slinging mud”. He argued the only reason the case was withdrawn was because the previous Conservative government did not designate China as a threat to the UK.“To be clear, had the Conservatives been quicker in updating our legislation – a review that started in 2015 – these individuals could have been prosecuted, and we would not be where we are,” he said.On Wednesday night Conservatives argued that the release of the witness statements was “limited” and “falls short of what was requested”.A party spokesperson said that Collins’s witness statements showed “the extent of the threat that China poses to the UK” and that it was therefore “all the more shocking that the prime minister knew of the imminent collapse of this trial, but did nothing to stop it”.No 10 said Starmer was told the trial was on the brink of collapse “a couple of days” before the CPS announced it, but it insisted it was not for him to intervene in the matter. “It is for the DPP or the CPS to make a decision on a criminal case,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said.Download original documentDownload original documentDownload original documentThe pre-first world war legislation, now repealed because of its age, required prosecutors to prove China was an “enemy” – and one available definition to prosecutors was that Beijing represent a current threat to the UK’s national security.Cash had worked for the Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, while Christopher Berry was a teacher based in China. They were arrested early in 2023 and charged in April 2024, but both men had denied the accusations and always maintained their innocence.The first witness statement summarises some of the allegations made against Cash and Berry.Cash was accused of passing on information about British politics, the UK’s China policy and parliament that Berry put into research briefings for “Alex”, an individual who was judged to be working for Chinese intelligence, who in turn allegedly passed them on to a senior member of China’s ruling politburo.In the first statement, it is alleged that at one point in July 2022, Berry met “a senior CCP [Chinese communist party] leader”.Cash learned of by voice note on 18 July 2022 and responded in multiple messages a day later. One of which said: “You’re in spy territory now.”In a statement late on Wednesday night, Cash maintained that he was “completely innocent” and said that “at no point did I ever intentionally assist Chinese intelligence”.He said he had been placed in an “impossible position” because “the statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial”.A spokesperson for China’s embassy in the UK said: “We have emphasised from the outset that the allegation about China instructing the relevant British individuals to ‘steal British intelligence’ is entirely fabricated.“We urge certain individuals in the UK to stop this kind of self-staged anti-China political farce.”On Thursday, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, is expected to spell out the threats posed by China in an annual security update.Whitehall insiders are frustrated by the failure to prosecute Cash and Berry and reiterate they stand by previous warnings about Chinese hacking and industrial espionage.Earlier on Wednesday, Dominic Cummings, who served as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, said China had breached secure high-level systems involving Strap material, a security classification for highly sensitive information, and this had not been made public.But this was denied by former senior cybersecurity officials working in Whitehall and by the Cabinet Office within hours.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “It is untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised.”Other senior officials said the story was untrue.Explore more on these topicsLabourChinaForeign policyEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

And that scaremongering didn’t pay off, because this is a brilliant country and people want to live here.“And I think, when people scaremonger again this year, we should take some of that with a pinch of salt.”Reeves has previously ruled out imposing a new“wealth tax”but campaigners for changes to the system have highlighted other options, including: raising the rate of capital gains tax; levying national insurance on rental income and on partners in law firms and consultancies; and creating higher council tax bands.26:57Why it is so hard to tax the super-rich – videoThere is also speculation she will revive plans to overhaul tax-free Isas to divert cash towards the UK stock market.Reeves declined to comment on specific measures, though she stressed the package would be aimed at boosting economic growth, as well as raising revenue.Last year’s budget included a historic £40bn of tax increases and fuelled a furious backlash from business, which bore the brunt of the rise in national insurance contributions.Asked ifspending cutswould form part of the budget package, Reeves pointed to potential cost-savings from the use of new technologies but stressed that departmental budgets had been set in this year’s spending review.She hopes to deliver a decisive budget which will persuade bond markets to lower the UK’s borrowing costs and she repeatedly contrasted her approach, of sticking to Labour’s investment plans in the face of the deteriorating outlook, with the approach of the Conservatives and the Reform party.“In the budget next month, there won’t be a return to austerity. We know that we face a changing global environment in terms of the economy at the moment.“But last year, I put investment in, to reduce waiting lists, to build housing, to build the energy infrastructure to get people’s bills down sustainably, not through quick fixes, and we’ll stick to that course.”Asked how she would explain the need for further tax rises, Reeves said she hoped the public would recognise the global economic outlook had darkened.“I think people can see that this year, in 2025, the world’s been a very, very volatile place,” she said.“You turn on your TV every night, it might not always be about the economy, but every night, one of the top two or three stories on the news is going to be around some sort of global tensions that is having repercussions at home. So I think that the British people recognise all of that.”She added: “I’m being honest and I think the British people respect that and it means I’m not always able to offer the easy answers and the platitudes and the false promises.”However, she criticised the OBR for the politically awkward timing of its productivity review, coming after Reeves carried out a spending review in June.“I think that it would have been a lot better if they had adjusted their forecasts the year before the election, or even last summer, to enable the new government to really understand the economic position.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She believes a larger buffer will contain the impact of market jitters on policymaking.Reeves said that by getting a grip on the finances, she hopes to convince investors to close the gap that emerged between the UK’s borrowing costs and those of other large economies at the time of Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget in 2022.“When Liz Truss and Kwazi Kwarteng did their mini-budget three years ago, our bond yields decoupled from other G7 economies and they are still at an elevated level compared to other countries. I want to bring us back in line.”She said that the UK now spends more than £100bn a year on interest alone – with much of it going to overseas investors.“If you say to people: ‘What would you like to spend more on?’ – they’re going to say schools, hospitals, police on our streets, parks and local facilities.“No one’s going to say: ‘We’re keen that we spend more on servicing our debt to US hedge funds.’“And yet that is the item of spending that went up the most under the previous government, and there is absolutely nothing progressive about it.“I’m providing that confidence to people who buy government bonds that I’ve got a grip on the public finances. And if we can continue to do that, I am convinced we can bring down those borrowing costs.”Reeves flew into Washington presenting the UK as a “beacon of stability”.

That is exactly what I am doing.”About 22,000 people were smuggled through the western Balkans by organised gangs last year, according to the Home Office.Frontex data shows irregular crossings on the route fell by 78% in 2024, though UK officials say it continues to serve as a major transit route for both migrant smuggling and cross-border drug trafficking.The UK and Frontex signed a formal working arrangement in February 2024 to strengthen cooperation on intelligence sharing, joint operations, training and technical support.The UK border security commander, Martin Hewitt, said Britain would provide drones and night-vision goggles to support police forces in the region in dismantling smuggling operations.He made the announcement after chairing the Balkans Border Police Chiefs’ Forum in Sarajevo last week.Since July 2024, the UK government has entered into several joint operational agreements with Albania, Kosovo,North Macedoniaand Serbia specifically aimed at disrupting organised crime groups operating across the western Balkans.Next week, Keir Starmer is expected to host a leaders’ summit with western Balkan nations to agree further measures to reduce the number of people entering the UK illegally.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaKosovoMontenegroNorth MacedoniaSerbianewsShareReuse this content"

On the border of Bolivia and Brazil, thePantanal wetlandsand thedry forest of Chiquitanosuffered extreme fire events causing soaring carbon emissions.California braces as fierce storm batters fire-ravaged hillsidesRead moreWildfires are becoming more frequent and more intense as a result of climate breakdown caused by human emissions, scientists have warned.According to theState of Wildfires report, an examination of significant wildfires across the world between March 2024 and February 2025, carbon emissions were three times above average in Canada, four times above average in Bolivia and 50% above average in Brazil and Venezuela.Africa also experienced extreme wildfires, but the analysts said the continent received little international attention, despite driving record forest losses. The severe fires in particular struck Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 6% and 2.5% of their total land area was burnt in one week.Across the continent, about 22m hectares (54 acres) burned in a week.Multiple deaths were caused by wildfires across the globe. The fires in Nepal killed 100 people. In Los Angeles the wildfires that torched the city and surrounding areas in early spring last year, triggering panicked getaways and turning the skies deep orange, killed 31 people.As well as deaths, the wildfires caused extreme air pollution events from fine particulate matter, which exceeded World Health Organization guidelines by up to 60 times, the report said.View image in fullscreenA wildfire in Alberta, Canada which spread from the Northwest Territories in 2024.Photograph: Alberta Wildfire/ReutersThe report, which was compiled by a global group of experts, used modelling, regional observations and scientific expertise to track wildfires across the world.“These recent high-impact events align with a growing trend towards increasing extent, intensity and severity of fires globally,” the report said.“Climate change is intensifying the frequency and severity of drought and fire-favourable weather conditions, lowering vegetation moisture and preconditioning landscapes to burn more regularly, intensely and severely.“At the same time human activities, including land use and land use change, exacerbate the risk of large, fast moving or intense fires.”Climate breakdown supercharged many of the infernos across the world, the report said. The burnt area in southern California from the Los Angeles wildfires was 25 times greater as a result of human-induced global heating, while in the north-east Amazon it made extreme wildfires up to 70 times more likely and increased the devastation and burnt land area fourfold, the report said.Matthew Jones of University of East Anglia, co-author of the report, said the excess in carbon emissions caused by wildfires was akin to the emissions of more than 200 countries.“Our report shows that the biggest wildfire catastrophes of the 2024-25 fire season were two to three times more likely due to climate change caused by humans, and that the frequency of events like these is set to rise in future unless world leaders take decisive action to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.“Wildfires are themselves contributing to the problem of climate change – in 2024-25 we saw global emissions around 10% above average, mostly due to extreme wildfire seasons in South America and Canada, where forest fires were churning out yet more CO2emissions to the atmosphere and accelerating the pace of global warming.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

The DHSC said that interest, which has been running on the £122m from when the PPE gowns were rejected as unusable in late 2020, was now £23.7m – making the total owed almost £146m.“At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers’ hard-earned cash,” said Streeting. “PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay – they still owe us over £145m, with interest now accruing daily.“We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong – in our NHS.”Interest would now accumulate at an annual rate of 8%, the DHSC said.Questions remain overhow the government can get its money back, as the company, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, was left with little money, and was put into administration on 30 September, the day before the judgment was handed down.A spokesperson for Barrowman and Mone has said that the “consortium partners of PPE Medpro”, a reference to three intermediary companies involved in the supply of gowns, were “prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government”.Labour appeared not to have engaged with this suggestion of a discussion about a settlement, and was waiting for full payment to be made by the deadline.The DHSC awarded the £122m gowns contract to PPE Medpro, and another worth £80.85m for face masks – a total of £203m – after Mone first approached the thenCabinet Office minister Michael Govein May 2020. The contracts were processed via the “VIP lane”, operated by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government during the pandemic, which gave high priority to people with political connections. Mone was appointed to the House of Lords by David Cameron in 2015.She and Barrowmandenied through their lawyersfor years that they were involved in PPE Medpro. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed thatBarrowman had been paid at least £65mfrom PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children.In December 2023Mone admittedin a BBC interview that the couple had lied, and they confirmed their involvement in the company. Barrowman acknowledged that he had been paid more than £60m and transferred money into the trust; the couple said that his children were beneficiaries as well.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The industry standard is to allow leeway of two months to publish receipts.A spokesperson for Tussell said: “This gap in publication is deeply concerning and highlights that the government is failing to meet its own transparency standards.“Such delays undermine visibility over public spending at a time when accountability and scrutiny are more critical than ever.”Between June 2022 and May 2023 – the most recent 12-month period for which the MoJ has published its receipts – the department’s spending receipts amounted to £5bn.Tussell has calculatedthe missing spending by dividing this figure by 12 and multiplying it by the number of months when the department has failed to file receipts, which is 26. The estimated total came to £10.8bn, Tussell said.This calculation includes all Ministry of Justice arm’s length bodies, except for the family court advisers Cafcass and the Legal Services Board, which are both more up to date in their publishing.Crown court backlog in England and Wales hits new record of almost 80,000 casesRead moreTom Brake, the director of the transparency organisation Unlock Democracy, condemned the MoJ’s failure to publish.“With government finances painfully tight, spending receipts must be published promptly,” he said. “They help detect and prevent the misuse and waste of precious resources. Delaying their publication damages the government’s ability to control its expenditure.”According to government-wide calculations, the Ministry of Justice is by far the worst performing department when it comes to missing spending data.The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero is 13 months behind on disclosing its spending receipts, worth an estimated £3.7bn. The third-worst department is the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which has a 10-month lag on publication of spending estimated at £880m.The MoJ received a real-term 1.8% spending increase in June, according to the spending review announced by the chancellor.Day-to-day MoJ spending is set to reach £13.2bn by 2028-29, while capital spending will rise to £2.3bn annually for 2026-27 and 2028-29, before returning to £2bn in 2029-30. This will support the initiative to create 14,000 new prison places by 2031.The Institute for Fiscal Studies noted in February that MoJ spending was cut by 70% over the early 2010s and, within this, capital funding for HM Courts and Tribunals Service and HM Prison and Probation Service was cut by more than 90%.The government aims to create 14,000 additional prison places by 2031 by spending £4.7bn – with about 2,500 of these having already been built since July 2024.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that all spending had been accounted for.“We need to review a substantial amount of data to ensure we do not release anything that could cause any risk, particularly to individuals,” they said.“All departmental spend is accounted for in our annual accounts and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPublic financePrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, 39% of those who sawdistressing contentdescribed themselves as very or extremely upset and worried by it.More than two-thirds of children are getting news from social media apps including TikTok andInstagram, but 40% do not follow news-focused accounts and are instead coming across stories through recommendation algorithms. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of those who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the past month.Instagram restricts what teenagers can see weeks before Australia’s under-16s social media ban beginsRead moreOne 14-year-old girl told researchers: “OnTikTokyou can see stabbings and kidnappings, which are just not nice to see, especially when you are a bit younger, it makes you feel uncomfortable.”Another girl, 17, said: “On Instagram, before videos get taken down, I think there’s quite a lot of stabbing videos or gruesome videos like that. When Liam Payne died [the One Direction star fell from a hotel balcony] there was video of him circulating and I thought it wasn’t very nice. I would have wanted a trigger warning.”Of news that pops up in his feed, a 13-year-old boy said: “You don’t want to see it sometimes and don’t want to think about it.”The survey findings reflect a wider trend in social media use: the proportion of time users spend viewing content posted by their friends is falling on several platforms. Meta said incourt filingsthis April that only 8% of an Instagram user’s time is now spent viewing friend posts, down by over a third since 2023, with algorithmically recommended posts instead increasingly dominating users’ feeds, contributing to the supposed phenomenon of “brain rot”.View image in fullscreenResearch has found 61% of children who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the last month.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPThe vast majority of children (86%) do not know how to reset the explore algorithm on their social accounts, which serves the upsetting material, according to the research which involved a survey and focus groups with more than 1,000 11- to 17-year-olds.“The shift away from established news channels is radically changing how children and young people consume news, and it is having worrying consequences,” said Rachel Huggins, co-chief executive of Internet Matters, which provides advice to parents and is part-supported by tech companies including TikTok.“The algorithmic design of social media platforms is enabling children to see negative and upsetting content [and it is delivering it] to millions of children and young people who are not seeking it out.”Instagram to bring in version of PG-13 system to protect children, says MetaRead moreChi Onwurah MP, the Labour chair of the commons science and technology committee, said the findings reinforced its conclusion that the Online Safety Act “isn’t up to scratch to protect users”. She called for a stronger regime “that discourages the viral spread of misinformation, regulates generative AI and places much-needed standards on to social media companies”.Under the Online Safety Act, codes to protect childrenrequiresocial media companies to give children age-appropriate access to content that depicts or encourages serious violence or injury. Younger children are seeing news relating to war and conflict, and violence and crime, less than older children but Internet Matters said: “It is still concerning that 11- to 12-year-olds are seeing this content at all given many social media platforms have a minimum age of 13+ outlined in their terms of service.”According to TikTok, human blood and extreme physical fighting cannot be included in its “for you” feed and the platform does not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing or extremely violent content. It said it uses independent factcheckers and allows parents to block their teens from using the app during times they control and to filter content.Instagram has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsChildrenInternet safetySocial mediaDigital mediaInstagramTikTokYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

The Washington state-based firm, which suspended operations after the catastrophic implosion, was unaware of the submersible’s true durability, the report said.The victims, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, died instantly in the North Atlantic during the descent to the remains of the Titanic.The implosion also killed French underwater explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, known as “Mr Titanic”; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.The Titan’s defective engineering “resulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements”, the NTSB said.The safety board also said OceanGate had not followed standard guidance for emergency responses, and that the Titan could have been found sooner if it had. If the company had abided by expected protocols, it would have saved “time and resources”, the report said, while noting “rescue was not possible in this case”.The report was also critical of the culture at the company, quoting a former operations technician who had raised alarms about potential coast guard regulations prior to the implosion. That technician had questioned the company’s choice to call paying passengers “mission specialists”, prompting the CEO to respond that “if the Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away”, the report said, citing the technician.The NTSB report dovetails with a coast guard report released in August that described the Titan implosion as preventable. The coast guard determined that safety procedures at OceanGate were “critically flawed” and found “glaring disparities” between safety protocols and actual practices.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Wednesday.In August, after the coast guard report was released, a company spokesperson offered condolences to the families of those who died.The Titan’s implosion led to lawsuits and to calls for tighter regulation of private deep-sea expeditions.The NTSB report suggested current regulations for small passenger vessels such as the Titan were inadequate and had “enabled OceanGate’s operation of the Titan in an unsafe manner”. The safety board recommended the coast guard establish a panel of experts to study submersibles and implement updated regulations.The report also called on the coast guard to “disseminate findings of the study to the industry”, which has grown in recent years as privately financed exploration has grown.The vessel had been making voyages to the Titanic site since 2021. Its final dive came on the morning of 18 June 2023. The submersible lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later and was reported overdue that afternoon.A multiday search for survivors off Canada made international headlines. It soon became clear there would be no survivors, and the coast guard and other authorities began lengthy investigations into what had happened.The sub disaster was thesubject of a Netflix documentaryreleased earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsTitanic sub incidentThe TitanicnewsShareReuse this content"

It was early morning – my dad’s shift began at 7am, and I’d caught a ride to work with him. Already the air was heavy and moist, and the club’s 20 acres of carefully landscaped greens and lawns seemed to shimmer.My dad was responsible for maintaining the resort’s in-room air-conditioning units, not to mention its five championship tennis courts, so he knew his way around. I remember he gave me a brief tour before presenting me to the hiring manager, who agreed to take me on. That first day, I was given a uniform – a white polo shirt, emblazoned with the Mar-a-Lago crest, and a short white skirt – and a name tag that said JENNA in all capital letters. (Although I was called Virginia, everyone at home called me Jenna.)After a few days, my dad said he wanted to introduce me to Mr Trump himself. They weren’t friends, exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that – I’d seen photos of them posing together, shaking hands. So one day my father took me to Trump’s office. “This is my daughter,” Dad said, and his voice sounded proud. Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. “Do you like kids?” he asked. “Do you babysit at all?” He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends. Soon I was making extra money a few nights a week, minding the children of the elite.But it was my day job that gave me my first real vision of a better future. The spa, like the resort itself, was gilded, with luxe finishes and an immaculate, sparkling decor. There were giant gold bathtubs, like something a god would soak in. I marvelled at how peaceful everyone seemed to feel within its walls. My duties – making tea, tidying the bathrooms, restocking towels – kept me just outside the inner sanctum of the massage rooms, but I could see how relaxed clients looked when they emerged. I seized on the idea that, with the right training, I could eventually make a living by helping others reduce stress. Maybe, I thought, their healing would fuel my own.Then one steaming hot day some weeks before my 17th birthday, I was walking toward the Mar-a-Lago spa, on my way to work, when a car slowed behind me. Inside was a British socialite namedGhislaine Maxwelland her driver, Juan Alessi, whom she insisted on calling “John”. Alessi would later testify under oath that on this day, when Maxwell spotted me – my long blond hair, my slim build, and what he called my notably “young” appearance – she commanded him from the back seat, “Stop, John, stop!”Alessi did as he was told, and I found out later that Maxwell got out and followed me. I didn’t know it yet, but an apex predator was closing in.Picture a girl in a crisp white uniform sitting behind a marble reception desk. The girl is slender, with the freckled face of a child, and her long blond hair is held back with a tie. On this blisteringly hot afternoon, the spa is mostly empty, so the girl is at the front desk, reading a book about anatomy that she’s borrowed from the library. The girl hopes that studying this book will give her something she’s lacked for too long: purpose. What would it be like, she wonders, to excel at something?I look up from my book to see a striking woman with short dark hair striding toward me.“Hello,” the woman says warmly. She looks to be in her late 30s, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins. I couldn’t tell you which designers she’s wearing, but I bet her purse cost more than my dad’s truck. The woman extends her manicured hand for me to shake. “Ghislaine Maxwell,” she says, pronouncing her first name “Giilen”. I point to my name tag. “I’m Jenna,” I say, smiling like I’ve been told to smile. The woman’s eyes alight on my book, which I’ve jammed with sticky notes. “Are you interested in massage?” she asks. “How wonderful!”Remembering my duties, I offer this mesmerising woman a beverage, and she chooses hot tea. I go and fetch it, returning with a steaming cup. I expect that to be the end of it, but the woman keeps on talking. Maxwell says she knows a wealthy man – a longtime Mar-a-Lago member, she says – who is looking for a massage therapist to travel with him. “Come meet him,” she says. “Come tonight after work.”Even today, more than 20 years later, I remember how excited I felt. As instructed, I wrote down her phone number and her rich friend’s address: 358 El Brillo Way. “See you later, I hope,” Maxwell said, waving her right hand by twisting it slightly at the wrist. Then she was gone.A few hours later, Dad gave me a lift to El Brillo Way. The drive took five minutes, and we didn’t talk much. No one ever had to explain to my father the importance of making a buck.When we arrived we found ourselves in front of a sprawling two-storey, six-bedroom mansion. In countless TV documentaries, this house has been shown painted a tasteful white, as it was years later. But in the summer of 2000, the home we pulled up to was a garish pink, the colour of Pepto-Bismol.View image in fullscreenGiuffre as a teenager. ‘Epstein asked me questions. Do you have siblings? Where do you go to high school? Do you take birth control?’I jumped out of the car before my dad could turn off the engine, walked to the big wooden front door, and rang the bell. Maxwell answered and came outside. “Thank you so very much for dropping her off,” she told Dad, all smiles, but, in retrospect, she seemed impatient for him to leave.“Jeffrey has been waiting to meet you,” she said, starting up the stairs. “Come.”Walking behind her, I tried not to stare at the walls, which were crowded with photos and paintings of nude women. Maybe this was how wealthy people with sophisticated taste decorated their homes?When we reached the second-floor landing, Maxwell turned right and led me into a bedroom. We made a U-turn around a king-size bed, then entered an adjoining room with a massage table. A naked man lay face down on top of it, his head resting on his folded arms, but when he heard us enter, he lifted up slightly to look around at me. I remember his bushy eyebrows and the deep lines in his face as he grinned.“Say hello to MrJeffrey Epstein,” Maxwell instructed. But before I could do so, the man spoke to me: “You can just call me Jeffrey.” He was 47 years old – nearly three times older than me.Faced with Epstein’s bare backside, I looked to Maxwell for guidance. I had never had a massage before, let alone given one. But still I thought, “Isn’t he supposed to be under a sheet?” Maxwell’s blase expression indicated that nudity was normal. “Calm down,” I told myself. “Don’t blow this chance.”Palm Beach was just 16 miles from my home town, Loxahatchee, but the economic divide made it seem way farther. I needed to learn how rich people did things. Besides, while the man on the table was nude, it’s not like I was alone with him. The fact that a woman was with me made me breathe easier.She began the lesson. When giving a massage, she said, I should keep one palm on the client’s skin at all times, so as never to startle him. “Continuity and flow are key,” she explained. We started in on his heels and arches, then moved up his body. When we got to his buttocks, I tried to glide past them, landing on his lower back. But Maxwell put her hands on top of mine and guided them to his rear. “It’s important that you don’t ignore any part of the body,” she said. “If you skip around, the blood won’t flow right.”‘We know where your brother goes to school,’ Epstein said. ‘You must never tell a soul what goes on in this house’Only later would I see how, step by practised step, the two of them were breaking down my defences. Every time I felt a twinge of discomfort, one glance at Maxwell told me I was overreacting. And so it went for about half an hour: a seemingly legitimate massage lesson.Epstein asked me questions. “Do you have siblings?” Two brothers, I said. “Where do you go to high school?” I told him I’d quit after ninth grade, but I was only 16. “Do you take birth control?” Epstein asked. Was that a weird question in a job interview? Epstein indicated this was just his way of getting to know me. After all, I might soon be travelling with him. I told him I was on the pill.“You’re doing great,” Maxwell said, as I kept my hands in sync with hers.“Tell me about your first time,” Epstein said then. I hesitated. Who’d ever heard of an employer asking an applicant about losing her virginity? But I wanted this job, so I took a deep breath and described my rough childhood. I’d been abused by a family friend, I said vaguely, and spent time on the street as a runaway. Epstein didn’t recoil. Instead, he made light of it, teasing me for being “a naughty girl”.“Not at all,” I said defensively. “I’m a good girl. I’ve just always found myself in the wrong places.”Epstein lifted his head and smirked at me. “It’s OK,” he said. “I like naughty girls.”Then he rolled over on to his back, and I was startled to see he had an erection. Without thinking, I raised both my hands, holding them up in the air as if to say, “Stop.” But when I looked at Maxwell, she remained unfazed. Ignoring his aroused penis, she put both hands on his right pectoral muscles and began kneading. “Like this,” she said, continuing as if nothing were amiss. “You want to push the blood away from the heart.”Epstein winked at her then and moved his right hand down to his crotch. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asked as he began stroking himself.This is the moment that something cracked inside me. How else to explain why my memories of what came next are splintered into jagged shards? Maxwell peeling off her clothes, a mischievous look on her face; Maxwell behind me, unzipping my skirt and pulling my Mar-a-Lago polo shirt over my head; Epstein and Maxwell laughing at my underwear, which were dotted with tiny hearts. “How cute – she still wears little girl’s panties,” Epstein said. He reached for a vibrator, which he forced between my thighs, as Maxwell commanded me to pinch Epstein’s nipples as she rubbed her own breasts, and mine.A familiar emptiness flooded me. How many times had I put my faith in someone, only to be hurt and humiliated? I could feel my brain begin to shut down. My body couldn’t escape from this room, but my mind couldn’t bear to stay, so it put me on a kind of autopilot: submissive and determined to survive.So many young women, myself included, have been criticised for returning to Epstein’s lair even after we knew what he wanted from us. How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable. Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care. A master manipulator, he threw what looked like a lifeline to girls who were drowning. If they wanted to be dancers, he offered dance lessons. If they aspired to be actors, he said he’d help them get roles. And then, he did his worst to them.One day, probably two weeks after I’d met them, Epstein upped the ante. I was upstairs, cleaning up after another “massage”, when Epstein told me to come to his office. “How about you quit your job at Mar-a-Lago,” he said, “and work for me full-time?” He wanted to make things easier on me, he said. But he had a few conditions. As his employee, I would be at his beck and call, day and night. And another thing: I could no longer live in my parents’ trailer. Seeing me come and go at all hours might make them suspicious, he said. He held out a wad of cash – probably $2,500. “Use this,” he said, “to rent yourself an apartment.”I’d never held that much money in my hand before. I thanked him, even as a twinge of worry crept into my head. By this point, I had seen dozens of girls coming and going from his house. Many came once and never returned. If he got rid of them so quickly, would Epstein eventually throw me away, too? Epstein must’ve sensed my qualms, because he walked around his desk, picked up a grainy photograph, and handed it to me. The image had been taken from some distance, but it was unmistakably my little brother. I felt a stab of fear.View image in fullscreenAt Naomi Campbell’s 31st birthday party in St Tropez, 2001.Photograph: Pool Lafargue/ Lenhof/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images“We know where your brother goes to school,” Epstein said. He let that sink in for a moment, then got to the point: “You must never tell a soul what goes on in this house.” He was smiling, but his threat was clear. “And I own the Palm Beach police department,” he said, “so they won’t do anything about it.”From the start, Epstein and Maxwell held me to my promise to be available at all times. Some days, the call would come in the morning. I’d show up, perform whatever sex acts Epstein wanted, then hang out beside his vast swimming pool while he got some work done. If Maxwell was there, I was often told to attend to her sexually as well. She kept a bin of vibrators and sex toys handy for these sessions. But she never demanded sex from me one-on-one – only when we were with Epstein. Sometimes there were other girls there, too, and I’d end up staying at El Brillo Way all day.In October 2000, Maxwell jetted off to New York to meet up with her old friendPrince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II’s second-born son. On Halloween, along with other guests that included Donald Trump and his future wife Melania Knauss, Maxwell and Prince Andrew attended a party hosted by German supermodel Heidi Klum at The Hudson, a swank hotel. Maxwell was proud of her friendships with famous people, especially men. She loved to talk about how easily she could get former president Bill Clinton on the phone; she and Epstein had visited the White House together when Clinton was in office.While they usually slept in separate bedrooms, and rarely kissed or held hands, it seemed to me that Maxwell and Epstein lived in complete symbiosis. Epstein, who described Maxwell as his best friend, valued her knack for connecting him to powerful people. Maxwell, in turn, appreciated that Epstein had the resources to fund the lavish life she thought she deserved yet had trouble affording after the death of her father, the media mogul Robert Maxwell. In social settings, Maxwell often appeared vivacious, the life of the party. But in Epstein’s household, she functioned more as a party planner: scheduling and organising the endless parade of girls who she recruited to have sex with him. Over time, I would come to see Epstein and Maxwell less as boyfriend and girlfriend, and more as two halves of a wicked whole.When I think back on this period, I’m not proud of myself. Even though the adult me knows that the child me was battling just to survive, I wince at how passive I had become. I was turning more and more to Xanax and other drugs, which were prescribed by doctors Maxwell sent me to. Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day.Epstein and Maxwell began lending me out to their friends. The first time, he made it sound as if he were launching me on an exciting new phase of my “massage training”. My new “clients”, as Epstein described them, were a man and his pregnant wife. Both needed massages, Epstein said. They were staying at The Breakers, an exclusive Palm Beach hotel not far from El Brillo Way, and Epstein had specific instructions for how I was to treat them. “Make her comfortable. But save most of your energy for him.” When Epstein said this, I looked up. Did he mean what I thought he meant? “Give him whatever he wants,” Epstein confirmed. “Just like you do for me.”That night I took a taxi to The Breakers. The man – I’ll call him Billionaire Number One – and his wife were staying in an apartment in the residential section of the vast property. When I arrived, they showed me to the master bedroom, where I would work on the woman first. As a joke, Maxwell had warned me that I could induce premature labor if I massaged the woman’s ankles “in the wrong way”. I knew nothing about prenatal massage, but I did my best, avoiding her ankles altogether. After about 45 minutes, the woman said she was going to go to sleep.The apartment was dark, and I had to tiptoe around a bit before I found Billionaire Number One in a sitting-room area, taking off his clothes. I hoped against hope that a massage was all this stranger was expecting. I was kneading his muscles when he looked up, groaned, and asked me, “Wouldn’t you be more comfortable working in the nude?” I was disappointed, but not surprised. We had sex on the floor, and afterward, he tipped me $100. As I left that night, I felt that familiar scooped-out, empty feeling.The second person I was lent out to was a psychology professor whose research Epstein was helping to fund. He was a quirky little man with a balding pate of white hair, and, from his nervous affect, it seemed he wasn’t used to being with women. The man never asked directly for sex, but Epstein had made clear that was what he expected. “Keep him happy, like you did with your first client,” Epstein had said. So when the professor asked at one point for “one of your famous massages that Jeffrey has told me so much about”, I complied. We only had sex once, though. The next night, the man told me he wanted to watch movies instead. I was glad, but I remember feeling worried that I’d somehow disappointed the professor in a way that he’d share with Epstein.Maxwell told me: ‘You did well. The prince had fun.’ Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy’The psychologist was only the first of many academics from prestigious universities who I was forced to service sexually. I didn’t know it then, but Epstein had spent years campaigning to keep company with the world’s biggest thinkers. Epstein had convinced himself that he – a college dropout – was on the same level as degree-holding innovators and theoreticians, and because he funded many of their research projects and flew them around on his jets, he was largely welcomed into their fold.Scientists weren’t the only people Epstein used his vast resources to win access to – which is how I came to be trafficked to a multitude of powerful men. Among them were a gubernatorial candidate who was soon to win election in a western state and a former US senator. Since Epstein usually neglected to introduce me to these men by name, I would only learn who some of them were years later, when I studied photographs of Epstein’s associates and recognised their faces.On 10 March 2001 we were in London, staying at Maxwell’s pied-à-terre – a white mews house a short walk from Hyde Park. Maxwell woke me up that morning by announcing in a singsongy voice: “Get out of bed, sleepyhead!” It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince! Her old friend Prince Andrew would be dining with us that night, she said, and we had lots to do to get me ready.Maxwell and I spent most of that day shopping. She bought me an expensive purse from Burberry and three different outfits. When we got back to her house, I laid them out on the bed. There were two sexy, sophisticated dresses she’d picked out and a third option that I’d lobbied for: a pink V-necked, sleeveless mini-T-shirt and a sparkly, multicolored pair of jeans embroidered with a pattern of interlocking horses. After I showered and dried my hair, I put on the jeans and top, which left a strip of my stomach exposed. Maxwell wasn’t thrilled, but like most teenage girls then, I idolised Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and the third outfit was something I imagined the two of them might wear.When Prince Andrew arrived at thehouse that evening, Maxwell was more coquettish than usual. “Guess Jenna’s age,” she urged the prince, after she introduced me. The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. “My daughters are just a little younger than you,” he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: “I guess we will have to trade her in soon.”In contrast to his appearance today – stout, white-haired and jowly – Prince Andrew then was still relatively fit, with short-cropped brown hair and youthful eyes. He’d long been known as the playboy of the royal family. When I noticed that Epstein called the prince “Andy”, I began to call him that, too.View image in fullscreenWith Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell at the latter’s London home, 2001.Photograph: courtesy of Virginia Roberts GiuffreAs we chatted in Maxwell’s entryway, I suddenly thought of something: my mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn’t pose for a picture. I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo.After a bit more small talk, the four of us headed out into the cold spring air. We went to a restaurant for dinner and afterward to an exclusive nightclub called Tramp. The prince went to the bar and came back with a cocktail for me. Then he invited me to dance. He was sort of a bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely. On the way back, Maxwell told me, “When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.”Back at the house, Maxwell and Epstein said goodnight and headed upstairs, signalling it was time that I take care of the prince. In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved. He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright. I drew him a hot bath. We disrobed and got in the tub, but didn’t stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed. He was particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches. That was a first for me, and it tickled. I was nervous he would want me to do the same to him. But I needn’t have worried. He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.The next morning, Maxwell told me: “You did well. The prince had fun.” Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called “Randy Andy”.My second encounter with Prince Andrew took place about a month later, at Epstein’s townhouse in New York. Epstein greeted Andrew and brought him to the living room, where Maxwell and I were sitting. Another one of their victims, Johanna Sjoberg, arrived soon afterward. Maxwell then announced to the prince that she’d purchased him a joke gift, a puppet that looked just like him. She suggested we pose for a photo with it. The prince and I sat down next to each other on the couch, and Maxwell put the puppet in my lap, positioning one of its hands on one of my breasts. Then she put Sjoberg on the prince’s lap, and the prince put his hand on Sjoberg’s breast. The symbolism was impossible to ignore. Johanna and I were Maxwell and Epstein’s puppets, and they were pulling the strings.View image in fullscreenGiuffre, centre, after appearing in court in New York with other women who had accused Epstein of sexual abuse, 2019.Photograph: Kevin C Downs/Redux/eyevineI don’t know exactly when I had sex with Prince Andrew for the third time, but I do know the location: a 72-acre island Epstein owned in the US Virgin Islands. The private sanctuary, right next to Saint Thomas island, was called Little Saint James, but Epstein liked to call it “Little Saint Jeff’s”. I also know that it was not just the two of us this time; it was an orgy. “I was around 18,” I said in a sworn declaration in 2015. “Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together. The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn’t really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.”Since I gave that account, Epstein’s pilot has said in a deposition that a coded notation (“AP”) that he made on his flight log for 4 July 2001, referred to Prince Andrew. He said that Epstein, the prince, another woman and I flew from Saint Thomas that day back to Palm Beach. I guess it’s possible that the orgy I remember occurred in the days leading up to that flight, which would mean I was still 17. I’ll probably never know the date for certain. What I do know, because Epstein told me, is that Jean-Luc Brunel, the French modelling agent who was also in attendance, supplied the other girls who took part.For all that’s happened to expose Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, more action is needed. Because some people still think Epstein was an anomaly, an outlier. And those people are wrong. While the sheer number of victims Epstein preyed upon may put him in a class by himself, he was no outlier. The way he viewed women and girls – as playthings to be used and discarded – is not uncommon among certain powerful men who believe they are above the law. And many of those men are still going about their daily lives, enjoying the benefits of their power.Don’t be fooled by those in Epstein’s circle who say they didn’t know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn’t hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch. And people did watch – scientists, fundraisers from the Ivy League and other heralded institutions, titans of industry. They watched and they didn’t care.Virginia Giuffredied by suicide on 25 April 2025. In February 2022 her lawyers obtained asettlement from Prince Andrew. It was made without any admission of liability on his part and he continues to deny Giuffre’s allegations that he had sex with her, that she had been trafficked to him by Epstein or indeed that he had even met herThis is adapted from Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, published on 21 October by Doubleday at £25, and in Australia by Penguin Random House at $36.99.

But Machiavelli’s lessons are no doubt useful to him in his new reincarnation as Keir Starmer’s national security adviser (NSA), where he regularly rubs shoulders with Donald Trump and leaders in the Gulf and far east.Since his appointment – directly made by Starmer – less than a year ago, Powell has arguably become the most influential foreign policy figure in government. One insider said Powell was the “only person Starmer really trusts on foreign policy and he defers to him”.That goes some way towards explaining why Starmer has moved to protect Powell from the barrage of political criticism he has faced over thecollapse of the trial of two British men, including a former parliamentary researcher, accused of spying for Beijing.Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister saysRead morePowell attended a meeting of senior Whitehall figures in September to discuss the implications of the trial days before it was abandoned. Downing Street has strongly denied claims that Powell had any hand in shaping the government evidence that prosecutors said was the reason the charges had to be pulled.Dan Jarvis, the security minister,was dispatched to the Commonsto issue a robust defence of Powell on Monday – which inadvertently landed his deputy Matt Collins in hot water. Insiders say the prime minister is loath to lose his most trusted foreign policy aide. A senior government source said Powell was “by the PM’s side in all pivotal international moments”.Those who have worked with him over the years describe Powell as highly intelligent and considered, with the relaxed manner of a person who has seen and done it all before. A former diplomat who has attended meetings with him described him as “much more weighty than the curly mop hair-do might imply”.Asked about what issues he has most focused on, government advisers cite the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as building relations with the US and talks with China.It is a remarkably broad foreign policy portfolio for someone whose job description is to advise the prime minister on national security matters. In practice he is also Starmer’s main foreign policy adviser, filling a role once held by John Bew, and his chief envoy abroad.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Keir Starmer during a summit on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh. A senior government source said Jonathan Powell was ‘by the PM’s side in all pivotal international moments’.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesSteve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, singled out Powell’s “incredible input and tireless efforts” inbringing about the ceasefire in Gaza this week. He and Powell spoke almost daily over the summer in the lead-up to the Gaza peace plan being unveiled. Observers have noted the similarities it bears with the Good Friday agreement, which Powell helped negotiate while he worked for Blair.Over the past year, he has also been credited with helping navigate the response to the extraordinary public fallout between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last year, and drawing up a Ukraine ceasefire proposal in its wake. During the summer, he travelled to China for high-level meetings including with Wang Yi, China’s foreign affairs minister, who would not routinely meet an official.It is perhaps unsurprising that some fear Powell is overloaded with responsibilities. Downing Street appears to recognise this and has appointed Barbara Woodward, a former UK ambassador to the UN and to China, to deputise for Powell. She will take up the role at permanent secretary level and fulfil some of the functions he is carrying out. “There is so much going on that I think it will be a great help,” a government source said. “He’s always travelling back and forth,” said another.Jonathan Powell: the veteran negotiator being lauded over US-Ukraine detenteRead moreUnusually for an NSA, Powell is a politically appointed special adviser rather than a civil servant. Another government source said because of this, Powell was seen in the US as “the dean of the European NSAs”. Compared with his counterparts, they said, “he has more leeway to federate opinion and bring people together”.They added that where it often feels like Whitehall and the Foreign Office are hermetically sealed, Powell “has an extraordinary network of external experts, young and old, and is constantly taking meetings with them”.Critics, however, argue that his role as a special adviser has been used to avoid parliamentary scrutiny – until recently, ministers have rebuffed repeated requests for Powell to be quizzed by MPs and peers.Notably in his book, Powell wrote that it was “desirable that No 10 staff should not be directly answerable to parliament” on the basis that “public sparring should be left to elected politicians rather than courtiers”. Ministers have arrived at a compromise that will see himappear before a closed-doors select committee hearingnext month.He has also come under fire for his perceived doveishness on China and the controversial handover deal he negotiated last year tocede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. There are questions over the extent to which he takes direction from Starmer and Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, or shapes policy himself. Asked how he has handled the criticism, the senior government source described him as “unflappable”.“Some backroom boys aren’t satisfied with remaining in the backroom … and want to go on stage in their own right,” Powell wrote in his memoir, adding: “It is usually a mistake to make the transition.” It will not be the first time Powell has found that where the spotlight falls is not always something he can control.Explore more on these topicsJonathan PowellForeign policyKeir StarmerLabourprofilesShareReuse this content"

They lined the streets, they followed the hearse carrying his body, and they turned up at the cemetery in such numbers that the plan to hold the ceremony in the hall had to be abandoned.It was instead staged outside, to the sound of birdsong.This was the first funeral since the final 20 living hostageswere returned from Gaza, along with seven bodies. A further 21 of the dead hostagesremain missing, but at least this family now had a place to go to grieve and remember their son, friends said.Guy Illouz, a musician and sound technician, was shot in the back at the Nova music concert during the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023. Earlier that morning he had called his father from a hiding place to tell him that he loved him; to say goodbye. He was taken hostage, and according to those held with him, he later died from his wounds due to neglect.A friend of the family, Michelle, 50, said that it had been important to them that people turned up on Wednesday. The Illouzs, including Guy’s younger two sisters and brother, had taken shiva, the week-long period of mourning, after learning of his death in December last year. But now that Guy was finally back with them, they needed “people around them again”.“It warms my heart that you came,” said Michel. “We don’t take it for granted.”View image in fullscreenMichel Illouz, the father of Guy Illouz.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersHe turned to his son. “My Guy-shuk,” he said, using a term of endearment, “it’s hard for me to see or imagine the future without you. They snatched you from me – they murdered you – they kidnapped me and stole my identity and murdered my soul and heart.“I’ve been left hollow since that senseless shooting by those evil terrorists when they caught you and told you to turn around, and then simply fired two unnecessary shots into your back.“And here I am this morning, driving to Abu Kabir [forensic institute] to identify you and say goodbye. They removed the white sheet, and the first thing I saw was that smile of yours, that optimism, that serenity and nobility that so characterised you.“I touched you, tried to smell you, caressed every bone in your body. I saw you, I was alone with you, and yes, I felt with absolute certainty that it was you. Yes, I know, Guy-shuk, that you’ve returned to us. You’ve returned to your family’s embrace, to all your friends, and to the millions of citizens whose hearts your story touched.”Through the early part of the ceremony, Illouz had put all his efforts into consoling his younger children. He stroked the hair of his daughters, held his son, kissed his neck and composed himself for them. But then his voice broke.“I’ll miss so much travelling with you through this land, feeling you, hearing your music, sitting in the hills and lighting the burner to make coffee the way only you knew how – ‘Dad, do you see the coffee bubbles? You have to boil it gently, let the foam rise, then boil it again. Stir the coffee with circular motions’ – and then your smile while sipping the coffee and your delight in every single drop.“Before I left Abu Kabir today, I kept my promise. I looked at you, breathed you in one last time, and yes, I kissed you on the forehead. I was able to see your beauty even in the condition in which you returned to us.“My Guy-shuk, I love you so much, I love you. I will miss you every second and minute of my life. Rest now, my sweet one, rest after a journey of two years through worlds unknown to us. I love you, my Guy-shuk, my beloved firstborn son.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazanewsShareReuse this content"

His drama training at the Bristol Old Vic school had encouraged in him the sense that theatre work was the goal. “Then there’s films: bit dodgy. Television: like, really? OK, you gotta pay the gas bill. That was the thinking.“There was no concession [in the training] to movies at all. But secretly, most of us [students] longed to make movies, because we’d been raised on movies, and movies seemed just so wonderful to us and magical.“Not that the theatre isn’t too, but the theatre in itself is an elite cultural form. There are of course exceptions, many wonderful theatre companies that manage to put on affordable performances for everybody. But the great thing about the cinema is that everyone could – maybe not so much these days – but everyone could buy a ticket.View image in fullscreenJudi Dench and Daniel Day-Lewis onstage in Hamlet (1989)Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“Theatre essentially relies on people having had the privilege of an education that allows them to believe that they’re entitled to go to the theatre. And that education has enabled them to understand perhaps the classics in a way that they make sense to them. It’s a relatively small group of people that is available to, and that is just quite wrong. It always bugged the hell out of me, much as I loved my time in the theatre, that we were essentially performing to a group of more or less privileged people.”On Tuesday night, Day-Lewis attended the UK premiere of his new film,Anemone, which as well as starring in, he has co-written with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis – who directs. The film is the three-time Oscar winner’s first movie in seven years, after his withdrawal from the profession in 2017.Following the release of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread, representatives for Day-Lewis released a statement saying he “will no longer be working as an actor … This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.”Daniel Day-Lewis says he ‘never intended to retire, really’Read moreSpeaking to Rolling Stone last month, however, Day-Lewis declared that he “never intended to retire” and “would have done well to just keep [his] mouth shut”.During the conversation in London on Wednesday, the actor again rejected what he perceived as misconceptions about method acting, saying that “recent commentary” about the technique for which he is famed “is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves. It’s almost as if it’s some specious science that we’re involved in or a cult.”“It is very easy to describe what I do as if I’m out of my mind and plenty of people have been happy to do that,” he said, adding that people often believed he was “mad as a March hare.”Rather, he said, method acting is “just a way of freeing yourself” in order to be spontaneous and “able to accept whatever passes through you” as another person. As an example, he cited one of Anemone’s key monologues, in which recounts to his brother (played by Sean Bean) how he exacted revenge on a clergyman who had abused him as a boy, with the help of Guinness, curry and a box of laxatives.“I don’t know why I found it so funny,” he said. “The idea of shitting on a priest. It’s not normal. But I just thought it was it hilarious and couldn’t stop laughing.”View image in fullscreenDay-Lewis as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, 1989.Photograph: Palace Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe also discussed the role for which he won his first Oscar: the artist Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, in Jim Sheridan’s My Left Foot. The sea-change in attitudes toward the portrayal of people with disabilities in the 36 years since that film was shot meant he would no longer be cast in the role, said Day-Lewis.“Quite obviously, I would not be able to make that now, and for good reason – at the time it was already questionable,” he said, adding that “a couple of the kids that helped me so much at the Sandymount Clinic [for people with cerebral palsy] made it clear to me that they didn’t think I should be doing it.”The actor prepared by spending two months in a house with a wheelchair and a set of paints. “If you’ve got the responsibility of portraying a life like Christy Brown – a huge and noble figure in Irish society – then you should to try to understand as far as you are humanly able what it feels like to be inside of that experience. And I thought: ‘I’m never not gonna work like this again.’”Day-Lewis reflected that before making My Left Foot he had been “clueless” about moviemaking. “I didn’t have a fucking clue what I was doing,” he said, recalling the exasperation of director Stephen Frears on the set of My Beautiful Laundrette when shooting a scene in which his character is cleaning the shop.“There’s something like a compulsive need to find something that feels real to me,” he said. “So I’m mopping the floor and he says: ‘Just keep doing that.’ I said: ‘That bit’s clean.’ Stephen is a very clever man but he has very low tolerance. So he sent me to the cutting room with the editor and I’m looking at [the footage] and I go: ‘Oh, I see. Right. Because you need to be in the frame … ’ I was that stupid.”View image in fullscreenDay-Lewis and Rebecca Miller in 2005.Photograph: Andrea Comas/REUTERSDay-Lewis, who also won best actor Oscars for 2007’s There Will Be Blood and 2012’s Lincoln, also discussed working with his wife, the writer-director Rebecca Miller, on 2005’s The Ballad of Jack and Rose. She had sent him the script 15 years earlier, he said, before they had met.“I was very fond of her mum [photographer Inge Morath] and dad [the playwright Arthur Miller] and I got to know them and would go and stay with them in the house that Rebecca grew up in. So I heard a lot about her. And she sounded all right.”Anemone review – Daniel Day-Lewis returns for a bleak and painfully serious misfireRead moreWorking with their son, Ronan, 27, on Anemone was a similarly happy experience, he said, propped up by a generous director with time for everyone. “You can’t guarantee you’re gonna get a great film out of it, but what you will get is an experience that people will always remember happily. That was true of Jack and Rose, and it was true of Anemone.”The film, set in the late 1980s, is about two brothers, Ray (Day-Lewis) and Jem (Bean), who both served as British paramilitaries in Northern Ireland years before. Day-Lewis said that while some of his previous films, including In the Name of the Father and The Boxer, had looked at the debate from the perspective of West Belfast Catholics, there was a sense in which it was “not really cool to show the British military experience because they were the bad guys when in that situation.“But that’s not how it was. It was like anywhere in any conflict. There were young working-class people pitched against each other usually for no good reason. It was a dirty, dirty conflict. And I’d only really examined it from one point of view.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis with his son, Ronan.Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images for BFIAnemone has met with mixed notices, with critics praising Day-Lewis’s performance and the film’s stylistic ambition, but less certain on whether it adds up to a coherent piece of cinema.The film’s reception did bother him, said Day-Lewis. “You sort of try and wear a cap of defiance but it doesn’t fit that well. ‘We made this film we were happy making, it is what it is, we did what we could, we did our best etc.’ And of course it matters hugely to us.“The critics to some extent do have the power to either encourage people to see it or discourage them from seeing it. They’re the middlemen and women between us and the public. But what of course we yearn for is that when our job is done, that it will be meaningful to people. And if it proves not to be, it’s a very, very bad feeling. It’ll bring you right down.”But both he and his son cautioned against attempting to cater to public taste. “If you are trying to second-guess what people will think and how they’ll react,” said Day-Lewis, shaking his head. “There’s an epidemic proportion disease in cinema of that: trying to figure out how to get the audience to laugh, get them to cry, get them to whoop and cheer.”View image in fullscreenGordon Warnecke and Daniel Day-Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette, 1985.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDay-Lewis also recalled interactions with his own heroes of acting, including Marlon Brando, who once proposed working together, and Alec Guinness, who wrote to him with praise after the release of My Beautiful Laundrette. “That just meant the world to me.”He added that the most powerful screen performance he had ever seen was that of the first-time child actor David Bradley in Ken Loach’s Kes, saying “I didn’t know it was possible to do something like that. A young boy who’d never acted before. And it is true and a little bit demoralising that some of the great performances over the years are from people who have never trained.”Day-Lewis reminisced about his years spent attending Saturday morning picture club screenings in south London: “You’d see cartoons and then the Lone Ranger and then something in a spaceship and they’d give you a badge and it was just fantastic.”He also named Mary Poppins as one of the greatest films ever made, singling out its star for particular praise, saying: “What a doll. I had a crush on Julie Andrews.”Reflecting on his career, Day-Lewis said that while “proud of a few things, a lot of things I’d start from scratch”. But in retrospect he was relieved, he concluded, that he’d possessed the “certain steadiness” which enabled him to turn down many more projects than he took on.“I’ve done very little over the years, but I knew from an early age that I wouldn’t try to dance to somebody else’s beat.”Explore more on these topicsDaniel Day-LewisLondon film festival 2025ActingnewsShareReuse this content"

Here, he tells the story of his rollercoaster rideOobah ButlerWed 15 Oct 2025 09.23 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 11.26 EDTShareI’ve never met a billionaire before. And this isn’t how I imagined it would go. Don’t get me wrong: his brightly lit Manhattan office is pleasant, but not unusual. The pipes are scalding hot. As his assistant leads me through to the meeting room, I’m fairly sure I can spot discarded paper plates from pizza slices poking out of the kitchen bin. In other words, it is similar to most of the city’s workplaces.I’m here to meet Jim McKelvey, somebody Forbes will tell you has roughly £1.3bn to his name from co-founding the payment app Square. Jim is straight off a flight from Tokyo, I’m told. He enters the room and shakes my hand politely, but soon seems agitated. I’m not sure whether it’s his lack of sleep or if this is just how people who make more money during power naps than you earn annually deal with potentially having their time wasted. In other words, I’m going to have to ease my way in gently.“So, I Googled you on my way in,” I say, “and it turns out you’re a billionaire.” He agrees. “I worked it out,” I continue, “and it seems like £1m to you is the equivalent of £20 to me. So please can I have a million pounds?”It is over quite abruptly. Pretty much everything has been going this way for over a month, since I started this project to become a millionaire in 90 days. Today, money seems to be all people have room to care about. This makes sense: a huge number can no longer afford most things that provide stability or meaning. Simultaneously, if you look at anybody’s tailored social media algorithms, they’re being served a cultural diet of entrepreneurial slop. Business gurus in brightly lit rooms talk earnestly about meditation. Teenagers give crash courses in how to make it big in cryptocurrency. The rock stars of today seem to be founders, venture capitalists and money men.I cannot help but find this depressing. I didn’t grow up with money and have become accustomed to the idea of a life where it will be transient. However, as my savings dwindle, I find myself wondering if it has to be this way. Could there be something in society’s shift towards hustle and grift? Perhaps this could be my opportunity to make that elusive secure living. But I think there has to be some sort of pressure involved – which is why I have challenged myself to become a millionaire in 90 days.So I pitch the idea to Channel 4, keen to film my bid to bag £1m, even though I really haven’t thought things through. They seem sceptical but, before the mood sours, we make a deal.I lose my first few days to TikTok, observing the best minds of my generation – Steven Bartlett, host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, and Luke Belmar, a digital creator and investor in crypto – discuss things like whether humans actually need sleep or how the Bible tells us not to eat crisps. The consensus seems to be that I need a business. I come up with one based on my past, doing stunts like creating London’s premierfake restaurant in a garden shed.View image in fullscreen‘I need a business’ … Oobah Butler.Photograph: Chris Bethell/PR ImageAs a model, I will use the artist Banksy and the Brooklyn-based art collective/business agency MSCHF, who both manufacture headline-grabbing moments to sell expensive products and inflate the value of their brand. MSCHF sold 666 pairs of shoes in a collaboration with the rapper Lil Nas X, each containing a drop of blood, for $1,018 each. I would do similar to launch my new company, Drops. The plan is, after 90 days, to have made enough noise to sell the company for a million. But first, to fund my publicity stunts, I need investment.Even before Swoop Funding sees me out of its office in London’s Regent Street, I know they aren’t the ones for me. They want to see a business plan, disconcerted by the fact that Drops barely exists. Such old-world thinking! I need somewhere that embraces risk.Thank God for New York. On day 15 of my challenge, I arrive and immediately think: “This is going to be easy.” Ping-ponging from party to party, I realise everybody is a millionaire here. “You want to make a million?” I am asked. “Why not a billion?” Yes,why not?Iqram Magdon-Ismail is introduced to me as the co-founder of one of the US’s largest payment apps, Venmo. A company he’d sold in 2012 was valued at $38bn (£28bn) in 2020. A day or two later, I stop by his office and he explains his latest business venture, Jelly-My-Jelly, an app that seems to completely change every time we meet. He has forgotten the details of my challenge but, hearing it now, his eyes light up – he wants in.Iqram stands up, explaining how this is going to be big. He declares himself my co-founder and announces that our company is already worth $10m. In a year’s time, people will fill Madison Square Garden to hear how this business came together.A week later, I pitch my planned publicity stunts over coffee. “I want to create and sell a luxury piece of luggage that looks like a bomb.” Iqram stares blankly. I continue: “Let’s create the first legal child sweatshop in over a century!” Soon, Iqram makes it clear that positioning himself as co-founder was not legally binding. In the subsequent days, whenever I try to contact him, I am unsuccessful. Iqram doesn’t answer a text from me for a while. I am getting desperate, which means crossing one of my red lines: getting into crypto.Joining me on Zoom from inside a hyperbaric chamber, an oxygen-boosting device with contested health benefits used by many Silicon Valley loyalists, is Gunnar Lovelace. He is the founder of a crypto company named UNFK that aims to create, hype and inflate the value of its own meme coin. He wants viral ideas. I have always avoided crypto due to feeling uncomfortable about the ethics. Iqram even floated the idea of us doing a coin together, but I resisted.However, I am now running out of options. I agree to four or five viral stunts with Gunnar. Over the coming weeks, I film something about trying to trick bankers into committing crimes. I make people taste plastic burgers outside a McDonald’s to make a hazy point about chemicals in the food packaging of a Filet-O-Fish, and another poking again at Amazon like inmy last film for Channel 4. I end up making $18,000, which is a lot less than I’d hoped for.I pitch all the businesses I’ve created during the 90-day period, but claim them as winsI am now dangerously low on time. I commit to launching my headline-baiting Drops idea where unpaid kids design a £100 football shirt emblazoned with their own faux-religious cigarette brand, Holy Smokes.GQ write about therelease, whileinfluencers find it puzzling. When it comes out, we manage to sell £10,000 of shirts. It’s not enough. Drops is dead. I am forced to pivot.Inspired by how a lot of online entrepreneurs say they make millions through selling courses, I write a three-hour educational class about generating ideas that can make you rich andhave a platform built to sell it. The trailer for my class gets 2 million viewers. Only 0.5% of these people have to buy a course for £100 and I’ll be a millionaire. I am going to be rich!In the 24 hours after launching the course, I sell one.There is just over a week left. Things go from bad to worse. It turns out that Jelly-My-Jelly is no longer a podcast app or a TikTok competitor, but a meme coin. The same meme coin he tried to get me involved with is now the No 1 trending coin on popular crypto site Solana, with a $250m market cap. One trader bought $8,000 worth and in three hours made $2.4m.In spite of that, I hear from Iqram and he has an idea: I should auction off 10% of myself for £1m. This sounds frightening, but it could be the deal that gets me a million. Word of the proposal reaches Kavita Gupta, founder of crypto hedge fund Delta Blockchain. She seems genuinely interested. I leave New York and go to meet her in Miami and, in her snow-white apartment, we talk business. I pitch all the businesses I’ve created during the 90-day period, but claim them as wins. My Ethical Sweatshop fashion brand? A smashing success. My educational class? A stroke of genius! This actually works. Kavita wants to talk terms. She will own 10% of all my earnings and assets for the rest of my life. But she wants me to run all life decisions by her. In the next 12 months, I will create a crypto meme coin with her named OobahCoin.For the second time in 90 days, I am signing a contract without fully digesting it. Staring out at the Atlantic from Kavita’s balcony, I wonder if the tears filling my eyes are from the ocean air or exhaustion. I reach the end of my 90-day period, but truly this is just the beginning. Kavita and I make a deal that will make me a millionaire. Does it matter that this deal may encourage more desperate people to make bets on a cryptocurrency based on my word? Can I disregard any ethical red lines and become like the people who seemed so alien to me 90 days ago? Can I become a money-man? Perhaps I should head into a Wall Street bank and turn Kavita’s offer into even more money …How I Made £1 Million in 90 Days is on Channel 4 on 16 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDocumentaryCryptocurrenciesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It had taken four days to build. The clay, shipped up from Kettering, where, the experts said, the earth had just the right consistency, had been shaped, sculpted, pounded into a stage, the six-tonne wooden canopy had been joined, and hung from the roof, the rice-straw bales had been beaten into shape with empty beer bottles, brought over especially for the purpose, and laid in a circle around the ring, the arena had been blessed by three priests, doused with saki, and strewn with salt.Outside, an eager crowd was gathering underneath the streaming banners. There were corporate sorts, charging their bar bills to company expenses, a troop of diplomats, going to glad hand the Japanese ambassador at a VIP reception, and an awful lot of sumo super fans, some of them big men with beards, who first fell in love with the sport when it was on Channel 4 in the early 90s, some of them slight young women head-to-toe inComme des Garçons, some middle-aged salarymen holding banners decorated with pictures of their favouriterikishi. Every one delighted, every one very excited.This being London, a handful of shifty men circulated among them, whispering in thick cockney accents: “Tickets, tickets, buy or sell, who’s got tickets?” The price, if you’re asking, was “five hundred quid each for the good seats”.View image in fullscreenThe crowd was entranced by the displays of hoisting and dumping.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt’s the first time an official sumo tournament has been held outside Japan in 34 years, since it was last staged here at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991. “This is not only a sporting event, but a sacred ceremony,” said the Japanese Sumo Association chair, Hakkaku, in his welcome address. Something like Test cricket for the English, then. A lot of the fun is in the little details of the rituals, the crowd coo for the wrestlers who can lift their legs highest for the ritual foot stomping, and cackle for the ones who make a great show of tossing their salt furthest across the ring.The last time Hakkaku spoke in the Albert Hall, it was to thank the crowd for their support after he won that first tournament. He’s been chair since 2015, and is due to retire in three years. It was a personal project of his to bring the sport back to the place where he won his famous victory before he retired from office.It’s already a success. Sumo is Japan’s national sport, and this is an exercise in soft diplomacy. There are, you guess, a few new business deals being toasted up in the corporate boxes. The Hall is sold out for the week. If the prices were steep, they were still pretty cheap compared to stumping up for a flight to Tokyo to watch at the sport’s spiritual home, the Ryogoku Kokugikan. Plenty of people here are seeing it live for the very first time after years of following it online. “It’s my first time seeing a professional fight,” says Richard Riggs, vice-president of the British Sumo Association. “I couldn’t be more excited for it.”View image in fullscreenA fan holds up a banner in support of Wakatakakage before the event at the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianRiggs is a (large) member of the (small) band of British sumo wrestlers. He used to play rugby, but took the sport up during lockdown when he was looking for something new to do. Two and a half years later he was competing for the British national team at the amateur world championships.

It all happens so quickly that it’s almost impossible to tell exactly what combination of holds and twists the winner used, and the night’s opening fights end in split seconds. It’s made spectator-friendly by the ringside work of Hiro Morita, who hosts the JSA’s YouTube show, Sumo Primetime. Morita’s commentary is being piped in on earpieces, and in between the clacks of the woodenhyoshigiblocks used to summon the wrestlers, and in the bass rumble and thump of all that flesh being heaved about the ring, the hall crackles with the sound of his gleeful observations.The crowd adore Shishi, one of two Ukrainian wrestlers competing here this week. The JSA is worried about the waning numbers of sumo wrestlers, they used to have 1,000, but now they are down to just 600, which is another reason why they have decided to spread the net by bringing this tournament overseas. Hakkaku hopes that Shishi’s performances here will help inspire more European wrestlers to join up, that, somewhere out there in the hall, there will be some young sumo fan, dreaming of making a life for himself out there under the bright lights of thedohyo.Explore more on these topicsSumo wrestlingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This contrasts with her early days in politics, and her recent complaints of acreeping “ethno-nationalism”when she was labelled an“anchor baby”. As we approach the first anniversary of her troubled reign, I look at the two sides of Kemi.Adegoke vBadenochView image in fullscreenOn the cliff edge … Kemi Badenoch discusses immigration at the Conservative party conference.Illustration: Tayo Fatunla/The GuardianKemi Adegoke needed help. In 2005, stuck in a tough race to be elected the MP for London’s Dulwich and West Norwood, the 25-year-old computer engineer,reached out to her communityfor support. She appealed to their sense of family and community, urged them to push aside ethnic differences and smothered them with compliments. Her use of “we” was clear and generous.“I need your help,” Adegoke wrote in her campaign leaflet. “There are about 20 days to go before polling day, and Nigerians have been fantastic. We need to get out of this mindset where we are fighting one another and try and support each other instead,” she urged the Nigerian community, pushing them to join her mailing list. “Regardless of party allegiance, a Nigerian in parliament winning purely on merit and not because of her relatives or by buying the election will be amazing.”Kemi Badenoch, however, now the 45-year-old leader of the Conservative party and MP for North West Essex, does not see herself as Nigerian. “I don’t identify with it,” Badenochsaid in a recent interview. Particularly interesting is that, Badenoch – who lived in Nigeria until she was 16 – claimed that even as a child, she “never quite felt like she belonged” there.Since entering parliament in 2017, Badenoch has shown a disdain for Nigeria. She has used the country as the antagonist in a rags-to-riches story where her main character escapes a brutal socialist state, with nothing more than her father’s last £100 and a copy of Enid Blyton’sThe Famous Fivein her pocket.Recently, her origin story has taken on a more aggressive form: an attempt to rid herself of any connection to Nigeria that could make anyone, tempted to vote for Nigel Farage, question her allegiance to Britain. “I find it interesting that everybody defines me as being Nigerian,” Badenochtold the Spectator. “I have nothing in common with the people from the north of the country … those were our ethnic enemies, and yet you end up being lumped in with those people.”Kemi Badenoch would have found Kemi Adegoke very interesting. Adegoke proudly lumped herself in with “those people” and actively advocated that other Nigerians do the same. She didn’t name the group she created to gather support for her 2010 campaign Yorubas for Kemi or Southern Nigerians for Kemi. It was simply: Nigerians for Kemi. That same 2010 campaign promised to improve the national image of all Nigerians while fully supporting the “next generation of Nigerians trying to change things for the better”. Adegoke fully attached herself not only to addressing the challenges faced by the Nigerian diaspora but also demonstrated a personal investment in the country’s future. It’s not surprising she would feel that way. A few years earlier, what she termed a “quarter-life crisis” left her feeling disillusioned with a Britain that did not match the imaginary state she read about growing up in the very real Nigeria. Adegoke considered moving back to Lagos.A new familyView image in fullscreenPolitical distance … Badenoch has dismissed the material effects of colonialism and historic structural racism on life in Britain.Photograph: Channel 4Seven years after Kemi Adegoke finished third in the race for that Dulwich and West Norwood seat, Kemi Badenoch was elected as the MP for Saffron Walden (now North West Essex). Since that elevation, Badenoch has not only formulated that distance from her Nigerianess, but she has discouraged any attempts to see her political rise as a win for the wider Black community. Badenoch has gone out of her way to downplay the history of racism in the UK, labelling Britain as “the best place in the world to be black.” She has dismissed critical race theory, the lingering effects of colonialism, white privilege, and reparations, and accused the Black community of being too quick to see things through a racial lens.Badenoch can boldly say what many conservatives must whisper. Her maiden speech in parliament, where she spoke of Britain freeing an “African girl” like her, was widely celebrated by Tories. Her message has served her well in the party. But, it seems, not well enough.Open to a Nigerian comeback?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

November will mark the first anniversary of her accession and the point at which she can officially be deposed as leader. Tories are upset by polls that consistently place them a distant third. Her conference speech, however, full of red meat for the base, seems to have bought her time.Still, in this anti-migrant climate, she has sceptics among an influential online right who have attacked the very identity she has worked so hard to cultivate. She has been accused of being an “anchor baby”, her Britishness has been questioned, her work ethic challenged, and assumptions are made about how she became Tory leader – familiar racist tropes.In the summer, with her job at risk, Badenoch suddenly saw racism. “There’s a lot of ethno-nationalism creeping up, lots of stuff about my race and my ethnicity and the tropes around, ‘Well, she couldn’t possibly have done this all by herself,‘”she told the Sunday Times.As her political fortunes have shifted, Badenoch has gone from claiming there was no racism in the UKto acknowledging the existence of bigotry, to now notseeing anything wrong with Jenrick’s need to encounter more white faces.With an uncertain future, it’s hard to guess where she will pivot next. Look closely, though, and you might see she has left the door open for a Nigerian comeback. In the same Sunday Times interview, on her Nigerian identity, she said: “I feel British. That is my nationality.” But then she added: “I don’t see how, certainly in the job I do, I can be holding two things in my head.”She may not have that job for much longer, so whichever of her nationalities she decides to hold in her mind in the future, I’m sure that, as young Kemi Adegoke promised in that 2010 leaflet, any use of her identity “will not be about personal gain”.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe Long WaveConservativesnewslettersShareReuse this content"

With an advert for coatsStuart HeritageWed 15 Oct 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 10.12 EDTShareReaders of a certain age will remember the sheer nuclear impact of Michael Mann’s Heat on its release in 1995. Not only was it formally ambitious and wildly influential, but it also represented the first time that Al Pacino andRobert De Nirohad ever shared a screen.This, more than anything, was the film’s big draw. Two men, each justifiably thought of as the greatest actor to ever work in the medium, bristling against each other in real time. Their scene together in the diner was billed as the greatest spectacle in cinema since King Kong climbed the Empire State Building. Pacino v De Niro was Fischer v Spassky. It was Einstein v Bohr. It was Foreman v Ali. There was genuinely no way to overstate how momentous the pairing was.View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat.Photograph: Ronald GrantAnyway, they’re selling coats now.Yesterday the Hollywood Reporter announced that Robert De Niro andAl Pacinohave just combined forces for “their first-ever joint brand campaign” on behalf of upmarket outerwear brand Moncler.

Because a Moncler coat isn’t just a coat, it’s an “expression of friendship, connection and human warmth”.And signing both Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for the campaign is undeniably a big get; or at least it would have been, were this 1995 and Heat had been their only previous pair up. Because, since then, it’s fair to say that their quality control has drifted a little. The readers who were excited by Heat may also remember just how disorientating it was when they chose, of all the projects in the world, to team up once more for 2008’sRighteous Kill. That film, a generic cop thriller co-starring 50 Cent and directed by the man who made Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, immediately vapourised any sense of excitement about De Niro and Pacino ever sharing a screen together.Not even a third joint appearance on film, in the much more prestigious environs of Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, could salvage the wonder all that much. Now, that may have been because the pair of them spent a lot of their time onscreen swaddled in nightmarishly unconvincing CGI de-ageing technology, which meant that they were less De Niro and Pacino and more two plasticky androids, but that’s really beside the point.Robert De Niro and Al Pacino: ‘We’re not doing this ever again’Read moreAlso, it should probably be mentioned that the Moncler campaign would have had a lot more impact had this been their first forays into advertising. However, that is far from the case. Pacino has previously played golf on top of a grand pianoto advertise Sky Broadband(in his autobiography he blames this on an accountant who mismanaged his money and lost him $50m) while in 2019De Niro starred in a Warburtons advertwhere he got to deliver the immortal line “Bolton bakes best bagel? My butt” (he has offered no explanation for this; perhaps he just really likes bakeries).However, can you really begrudge them for this latest venture? Aside from the – presumably very large compensation – it’s important to remember that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now both in their 80s. Despite the creative missteps they may have made in the past, they remain two extremely beloved figures in the world of film. While it’s true that they’re both very good actors, the photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth. They’ve got decades of history behind them, and that’s perfectly evident.View image in fullscreen‘The photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth.’Photograph: Platon for MonclerPlus, even though the script for the YouTube video could be lifted and dropped wholesale into an advert for a building society that airs during Countdown, it’s worth pointing out that the pair of them sell the absolute hell out of it. There’s a chance that the wider campaign will be about two old friends in the winter of their lives, sincerely reminiscing about their years together. If that’s the case – and if the viewer is able to remove the cognitive dissonance that comes from knowing that this is all just to flog some coats – then it promises to be incredibly moving. All that, plus it’ll knock Righteous Kill from the podium of their best onscreen moments.

You can be nice or mean, bland or snide, accurate or wildly off-base. But none of what you write as a journalist matters much in comparison with the photo that runs alongside it. That’s the main determinant of how bitterly a subject will complain about a piece, or whether they will tip from mildly annoyed to actively raging. In this regard, Donald Trump,who went afterTime magazine this week for using a photo of him on the cover he has called “super bad” and “the Worst of All Time”, has acted in a way that, unusually for the president, is in line with how other people act.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump boarding Air Force One at Beijing airport, 10 November 2017.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesEven more unusually, he’s not wrong. The Time cover, shot from below to give readers an unrestricted view up Trump’s nose, is extremely unflattering. His turkey wattle neck looks like a ski run after the snow has melted. His eye is reptilian. His hair is the flyaway gauze of a newborn. Or, as Trump put it in the Truth Social rant he published in the early hours of Tuesday morning: “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one.” (He can’t stay normal for long – the “crown” is just flare from the sun behind his head.) In these circumstances, it doesn’t matter to Trump that the headline is fawning (“His Triumph”), or the piece positive, praising the ceasefire in Gaza as “the deal [that] could become a signature achievement”. He only has eyes for the photo.For anyone else in this situation, we might feel some sympathy; we’re all vulnerable where our appearance is concerned. But it’s Trump, a man who once mocked the movements of a disabled reporter, so we’ll take what schadenfreude we can get. Meanwhile, the question put in front of the world’s picture editors this week was (cue Anthony Clare voice): what was Time magazinetrying to saywith this photo? You have to laugh. Rival picture desks jumped to defend their profession by speculating that the photo was obviously designed to show the president as a commanding, magisterial presence. But to anyone with eyes in their head it was clearly a troll-based decision. “Look!” screamed the subtext of the Time magazine cover. “We may seem like forelock-tugging losers for coming up with that headline, but at least he looks like a tit in the photo.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, 17 June 2015.Photograph: Dominick Reuter/ReutersAnd, of course, it’s an age-old, passive aggressive, customarily tabloid tactic to run a hit photo then deny you’ve done any such thing. Weird expressions, closed eyes, any kind of off-the-cuff movement that breaks the seal on boring stock photos or airbrushed banality makes for a more interesting visual. The Guardian doesn’t use pap shots, but it isn’t above making the occasional, less flattering choice. Decades ago, I interviewed a woman in entertainment who is both famous and famously appalling – I would honestly rather have spent time with a war criminal. At a glance, the photo used of her looked fine, but on closer inspection you could see the skin had bunched up around her armpits to give it a crepe-like consistency, a small, ageing detail that triggered a Trump-like conniption after the story came out. Unlike Trump, no one ever mentions their vanity has been wounded – they fixate on the headline, or a pull quote, or a misapprehension in the text. But from the pitch of the anger, you always know when it’s the photo that’s done it.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, 2016.Photograph: The Tonight Show with Jimmy FallonAnd as a weapon, it’s inconsistently used. I’ve seen at least one prominent male figure lose the plot because of an unflattering photo (the picture editor failed to airbrush out his nose hair LOL), but women are more often the targets. The actor Olivia Colman has talked about how awful it feels: “You’re on the red carpet and they’re always trying to get photos up under your chin and everyone comments on it and says awful things and you think FUCK OFF, I wasn’t born a supermodel and I’ve had three children and my body’s stretched and bits have drooped and it’s not fair.”She’s right, it’s not fair. It’s a low blow, using a photo to make a point you wouldn’t want to put in words, and Trump understands low blows better than anyone. Looking at what he correctly described as a “really weird” photo this week, I’m inclined to shrug and say some people deserve it.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCelebrityMagazinesNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

But I didn’t recognise any of her 14th-century Dalmatian fertility rites – and neither did my mumWed 15 Oct 2025 11.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareI’ve just texted my mum to ask why, on the morning of my wedding, she didn’t advise me to drill a hole in a wooden bridge and put my penis in it. No reply from her as yet.This is the morning after I was lucky enough to be at the world premiere ofMarina Abramović’s Balkan Erotic Epicat Aviva Studios in Manchester. It is said of Ms Abramović, formidable as ever at 78, that she is the “grandmother of performance art”. Addressing us beforehand, visibly nervous, she spoke of this work as perhaps her most ambitious, her magnum opus. In the programme she writes: “This gives me the chance to go back to my Slavic roots and culture, look back to ancient rituals and deal with sexuality, in relation to the universe and the unanswered questions of our existence.” Having Slavic roots myself, I wasn’t going to miss this one. And fully acknowledging – as a friend of mine from Stourbridge would put it – that what I know about performance art and a five-pound note wouldn’t get my hair cut, here is my review.The show – that word feels inadequate – isn’t a play or a musical or a static exhibition. It’s kind of all three. It begins at the funeral of President Tito of Yugoslavia. The audience falls in behind a slow-moving, dirge-playing band to be led into the huge performance space. For me, this was most affecting, as I was brought up well aware of Tito’s cultural weight.A crowd gathered, expecting something significant. Abramović stood up, did some vague dancing, and sat back down againThe performance, or rather performances, are delivered simultaneously in 13 acts on as many stages. There is an awful lot to take in, even before you start trying to get your head around the erotic – or, rather, explicit – content. The first thing I clapped eyes on was a hairy bottom going up and down on a giant screen. Before this screen, on a representation of a grassy field, five performers were to be seen, face down, erm, humping the ground. This, we’re told, being based on a ritual performed when the crops were failing. My leeks are struggling a bit: might give it a try. As the evening progressed, these blokes humped relentlessly on. No one paid them much attention. I felt a bit sorry for them.Across from them, a group of female performers were in action, repeatedly exposing their vulvas to the ground and sky, invoking an ancient ritual aimed at scaring the gods into stopping the rain. In another corner, a group of naked women in a graveyard were busy massaging their breasts and dancing with skeletons. Away on the far side, at tables like those in a typical Yugoslav town cafe, three women, dressed as Tito’s grieving widow, sat there, austere, motionless, unmoved and unmoving, staring straight ahead. At one point Abramović herself wandered on to this cafe set and took a seat at an empty table. A crowd gathered in the expectation of her doing something significant. But she just stood up, did some vague dancing movement for a bit and sat back down again. We all stared at her until she got to her feet and wandered off. And that was that.Marina Abramović: Balkan Erotic Epic review – a thrilling collision of ecstasy and griefRead moreMeanwhile, in the middle of the room a Belgian (no idea) woman in a white coat periodically stood up and related a series of folk tales. In one, sourced to 14th-century southern Dalmatia, a woman wants to make her man love her more. So she inserts a small fish into her person and leaves it there overnight. Come morning, she fishes the fish out, makes a powder of it and stirs it into the chap’s coffee. Don’t try this at home, obvs. Also, from 14th-century Bosnia, the means by which a groom might ward off impotence on his wedding night: go to a bridge, make three holes, and penetrate each of them while reciting a mantra I’ll not repeat here. And there was more where this came from.Was my mum aware of any of this stuff, I found myself wondering. And, if so, why hadn’t she told me? Hence the text to her. And now the reply. No, she knew nothing of these things, and thank God for that because they sound stupid.I’ll probably not treat her to an evening out at the Aviva. Obviously not her thing.

When I was a Yale undergraduate, I hated being asked what my major was. “Medieval studies? What will you do with that?”, was the inevitable question from non-students. When I went on to Oxford and studied Old and Middle English, the questioning continued. I usually answered, “I am opening a medieval shop,” to shut down further discussion.Anyone who studies the humanities, or “soft” degrees, will have faced the same judgmental, bewildered queries. The implication is that these subjects have no value. Indeed, we’ve become so narrow and utilitarian that unless a degree leads specifically to a specialised career, it’s considered by many to be a waste of time, money and resources. Kemi Badenoch has pledged to end“rip-off” degreessuch as English, anthropology and psychology because, in her view, they provide weak job prospects. (Let’s ignore for the moment the £125bn that the creative industries areworth annuallyto the UK, or the2.4 million people employed.)Years ago, my son’s secondary school counsellor told me that the biggest issue he faced was parents trying to force students to study Stem subjects and not humanities at A-level, in the belief this would inexorably lead to a better job. And yet no one knows what knowledge will be “useful” to them in their career. My own “rip-off” degree in Old and Middle English led to my writing 100 Horrid Henry stories, millions of books sold worldwide and countless kids becoming readers. (And I wrote them while on one of those “indefinite leave to remain” visas that Reform UK hasvowed to revoke.) Though I didn’t know it, I couldn’t have chosen a better subject to train me to become a children’s author.View image in fullscreenHorrid Henry: Prank Wars by Francesca Simon.Photograph: SuppliedMy love of alliteration comes from having read Anglo-Saxon poetry. Horrid Henry is peppered with alliterative sentences, which are not only great fun to read – and to write – but also help newly confident readers with their fluency. Creating Horrid Henry’s gang of characters with alliterative names (Moody Margaret, Anxious Andrew, Sour Susan, Lazy Linda), each with a unique characteristic, was directly inspired by the medieval concept of the four humours: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, melancholic. Old and Middle English also gave me a feel for the rhythms and textures of English – invaluable skills for a writer.Was I aware of this excellent job-training at the time? Of course not. I didn’t study Old and Middle English, and medieval art, literature and history because I thought a great job awaited me at the end. I did it because I love learning, and studying the middle ages enriched my life while connecting me to the fears and longings and delights of the past.It’s only looking back that you can trace influences on your writing. For instance, my lifelong love of fairytales, mythology, and folk music inspired both my novel The Monstrous Child,about Hel, the Norse goddess of the dead, and the opera I wrote with composer Gavin Higgins based on it, which premiered at the Royal Opera House. Our cantata, The Faerie Bride,about the Welsh legend of the lady of Llyn y Fan Fach, and my latest novel, Salka,have similar myth-based origins. Horrid Henry himself has a rather unexpected knowledge of Greek mythology – “Wasn’t there some old Greek … ”I’m obviously not suggesting that studying Old and Middle English leads directly to a successful writing career, though I do note that three greats – JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis and JK Rowling – were all medievalists. But unless you want to be a doctor, electrician, or another job for which specific knowledge is required, any “soft” arts subject such as history, English, theology, foreign languages and so on, teaches how to think critically, research effectively, and deepens your understanding of the world: vital skills in our time of disinformation, cults and AI.Do we want to live in a world where books and culture flourish? Or in a purely functional world where the value of education is solely measured in expected earnings? Did my friend Ed blow his first in physics to teach and play banjo? Perhaps Kemi would be a better leader if she’d dropped engineering for religious studies or psychology.The University of Chicago’s motto is: “Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched.”If you’ve learned how to think, critically and creatively, then universities have done their job. Since no one truly knows what will benefit them in the future, why not study the subjects you enjoy, and discover where they take you.Far gesund!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are Republicans so clueless about women’s bodies?Wed 15 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 07.43 EDTShareRobert F Kennedy Jr is the father of six children. He’s also the US health secretary. Two facts that might lead a reasonable person to assume he possesses a basic understanding of how foetuses develop.In a shocking development, however, it seems that Kennedy – ananti-vaxxerwho says his brain was partly eaten by aparasitic worm– may not know what he’s talking about. During a cabinet meetinglast Thursday, Kennedy reasserted unproven claims that taking the common painkiller acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol, while pregnantcauses autism. Doubters of this theory, he said, were motivated by Trump derangement syndrome. To underscore his point, he referenced a TikTok video he’d seen of apregnant woman“gobbling Tylenol with her baby in her placenta”.Foetuses, of course, develop in the uterus, not the placenta. It’s possible, if we are being generous, that Kennedy misspoke. Then again, he would hardly be the first US politician to make it clear he knows nothing about the female bodies he is so keen to legislate, would he?In 2019, for example, 25 Republicans – all white men – voted for a near-total ban onabortion in Alabama. During the debate,Clyde Chambliss, one of the bill’s sponsors in the Senate,noted thatwhile he didn’t have medical training, “from what I’ve read, what I’ve been told, there’s some period of time before you can know that a woman is pregnant … It takes some time for all those chromosomes and all that.” Chamblisswent on to saythe generous bill allowed a woman to end her pregnancy “up until the point she is known to be pregnant”. Yeah, I don’t know what he means either.Then there’s the Ohio Republican John Becker, who once co-sponsored a bill prohibiting insurers from covering abortion services, except for a procedure “intended to reimplant” an ectopic pregnancy in a woman’s uterus. This ismedically impossible. After this was pointed out, Becker said he’dnever actually researchedthe issue.And there’s theIdaho lawmakerwho once asked if a woman could swallow a small camera so doctors could conduct a remote gynaecological exam. No, he was told by a doctor, because swallowed pills don’t end up in your vagina. “Fascinating,” he replied.I could go on; I’m afraid there areendless examples. But I’ll end with the late Todd Akin, a conservative Missouri Republican, who said in 2012 that “legitimate rape” rarelyresults in pregnancybecause “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down”. Yep, that same crafty female body that grows babies in its placenta.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That, very roughly, is the conclusion ofthe Competition and Markets Authority, which was obviously barking up the right tree when it decided 18 months ago to look at a sector that can take an opaque approach to pricing its goods and services.Prices have been rising far faster than general inflation between 2016 and 2023,says the watchdog. The increases cannot be justified – at least, nothing like fully – by investment in better kit or superior services or higher salaries. And, critically, there is a big difference between the prices charged by the large chains and the independents that, pre-2013, used to represent the bulk of the industry. The CMA found that the average price charged by a practice owned by a large vet group for consultation, treatment and medicines was 16.6% higher than at an independent vet.Vets could be made to cap prescription prices after UK watchdog investigationRead moreThat statistic contributes, says the CMA, to a “customer detriment” – which can be regarded as excess profits – of more than £1bn over five years. “For a substantial part of the market as a whole, profits are much higher than they should be if competition was working well,” says the watchdog.So smash up the big chains? Try to reverse the consolidation of the past decade that has resulted in six companies – IVC Evidensia, VetPartners and Medivet (all private equity-backed), CVS andPetsat Home (both listed firms) and Linnaeus (owned by Mars, which is big in pet food as well as chocolate) – owning more than 60% of practices? Set a limit on local concentration?Well, no, the CMA is suggesting nothing so radical. It will be accused of being a watchdog with more bark than bite but, actually, it is probably right to reject significant “structural” remedies. The problem here is not one of lack of choice for consumers: a 60% combined share among six firms is not unusual in a consumer-facing market (just look at the supermarket trade). Rather, it is that the customers don’t really know what they’re getting, or how they could help themselves by shopping around.Forcing vet practices to display a price list is a basic improvement – it is amazing they’ve got away without that requirement for so long. Disclosure of corporate ownership also matters now the cat is out of the bag, as it were, on price differences. But the single biggest reform isa price capof £16 for writing a prescription. Since it is probably impossible to try to set prices for thousands of medicines themselves, the easily implemented alternative is a flat fee for a prescription that can be used to shop at an online pharmacy; for repeat prescriptions, that ought to be effective in principle.It will all require the customers to do some leg work, of course, if the intensity of competition is to improve. But addressing the asymmetry in information between practices and customers is a useful place to start. The big operators, who had been making veiled threats about cutting investment if the CMA got too heavy, should count their blessings. There is nothing in this report that demands they do anything exceptional: they just have to provide levels of transparency that would be normal in most consumer sectors.The other half of the package is an overhaul of a regulatory system that is out of the 1960s and seems barely to have been touched thereafter. At the moment, only individual veterinary professionals are regulated and businesses are not. With such a hands-off setup, you can see why the private equity brigade was attracted by the financial possibilities that could come with rolling up independents into bigger national groups. Proper regulation and an ombudsman service for consumers look overdue. Again, though, the corporates should have little to fear: other sectors do this without a fuss. No need for whining.Explore more on these topicsCompetition and Markets AuthorityVeterinary medicineAnimalsRegulatorsConsumer affairsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

There have been other moments of high tension, such as during the 1980s when US cruise missiles weredeployedin Germany in response to an escalating arms race with the Soviet Union. From next year, long-range missiles will bebackon German soil, amid fears that recent Russian incursions into EU airspace herald a new and ominous phase of the war in Ukraine.As Donald Trump’s US continues to carry the status of an unreliable ally, European unity, cohesion and solidarity are of critical importance. But little of substance emerged from the Copenhagen talks. Disagreementpersists, for example, over the advisability of leveraging €140bn of frozen Russian assets to assist Kyiv.As leaders contemplate a potentially lengthy and complex hybrid conflict with Russia, a European Council summit next week will need to make some concrete decisions. On one matter, however, there is already a consensus. Soon after Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion in 2022, Ukraine wasgrantedcandidate status to the EU, along with neighbouring Moldova. Yet Viktor Orbán’s Hungary continues to block the progress of accession talks, a position that he reiterated in Denmark.Opposition to the liberal values for which the union stands has long been a badge of pride in Budapest, as Mr Orbán has positioned himself as the EU’s enemy within on issues such asminority rightsand civic freedoms. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that approach has beenextendedto EU foreign policy in ways that demand a more effective response than hitherto. Hungary has repeatedly delayed the introduction of EU sanctions on Moscow, made unilateral overtures to Mr Putin, and steadfastly maintained its reliance on Russian oil and gas. In continuing to block Ukraine’s and Moldova’s route to EU membership, Mr Orbán is compromising a dimension of Europe’s future security strategy in the face of Russia’s aggression.Given that moving through the various phases of the accession process requires unanimous approval, the question is what can be done about it. The president of the European Council, António Costa, recentlyproposedchanging voting rules to allow a qualified majority of member states to progress talks. But to do that would itself require Mr Orbán’s assent. More promisingly, Brussels now appearsreadyto bypass the technical requirement of seeking formal approval from national capitals at each stage, allowing Ukraine and Moldova to proceed with necessary consultations and reforms.Such a solution would have a morale-boosting effect in Kyiv, at a time when Mr Orbán is makingoppositionto Ukraine’s accession a wedge issue ahead of Hungarian elections next spring. Moldovans also deserve to reap the benefits of the country’s remarkable nationalpolllast month, when the ruling pro-EU party won an absolute majority of the vote despite widespread Russian interference.Last week, Mr OrbánaccusedUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of using “moral blackmail” to pressure member states over accession. In reality, it is Hungary’s prime minister who is making unscrupulous use of his power to disrupt EU foreign policy. Narrowly trailing in thepolls, Mr Orbán may be gone after next April’s election. For now, he needs to be worked around.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is threat and opportunity; a requirement to engage and an imperative to be guarded. The Communist party in Beijing represses dissent and pursues its interests overseas with coercive nationalist determination. It is not a regime with which Britain can build a relationship based on common values.But China is also a superpower with near-monopoly control of somemineral resourcesand pre-eminence in important manufacturingsupply chains. Trusting friendship is not an option; hostile rejection is unrealistic. It is not easy to manage relations through private diplomacy, let alone under public scrutiny. But Sir Keir Starmer’s government has looked especially awkward in its response to the collapse of a high-profileespionage case, involving the alleged transmission of secrets from inside parliament to Chinese officials.TheCrown Prosecution Servicedropped the case against two men, a parliamentary researcher and a teacher working in China. Both deny wrongdoing. The CPS says a conviction could not be secured if China was not named in government witness statements as a threat to national security – ostensibly a requirement of the Official Secrets Act.Opposition parties have cried foul. There are ample policy papers and ministerial statements going back many years attesting to the threat China poses. The suspicion has been raised that political pressure was applied to drop the case through fear of offending Beijing and spoiling economic relations.Ministers reject that claim and accuse the Conservatives of failing to fix flaws in the Official Secrets Act when they were in power. In parliament on Wednesday, Kemi Badenoch said the whole affair “stinks of a cover-up”. The prime minister responded that the Tory leader was “slinging mud”. He committed topublish witness statementsthat, he says, support the government’s account of events.Something is clearly amiss if the CPS thought there was an espionage case to answer, but couldn’t bring it to trial. In a climate of endemic mistrust in politics, it would be prudent of Mrs Badenoch to beware leaping from scepticism to conspiracy theory. By the same token, if wider diplomatic and commercial anxieties really are unconnected to the case, the government should have been more transparent, earlier.Partisan rhetoric has heated the debate without shedding much light on the underlying issue. There is more consensus on this question than the tone of party-political exchanges in recent days suggests.In office, Conservative ministers, including Mrs Badenoch, picked their words carefully when describing the risks of overexposure to Chinese espionage and dependence on Chinese technology, often to the frustration ofhawkish backbenchers. The suppression of political freedoms in Hong Kong was not opposed as robustly as pro-democracy activists there deserved.Managing relations with an assertive superpower is complex. Judicious language does not necessarily indicate naivety about the danger. But diplomatic protocol should not prevent candour about the limits to engagement with a regime that is often hostile to fundamental British interests.The currentLabourgovernment is not the first to send mixed signals on this point. If Sir Keir has a clear sense of how to strike the balance between trade with China and national security interests, ending confusion over the failed espionage case would be a good way to spell it out.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tragedy after tragedy, it can’t go on, 9 October) will be welcome to many, especially those healthcare professionals who have had to endure the intimidating mistrust and adversarial working culture he describes.What is missing from his account is the seminal role of government’sNHSreforms in creating these problems. In particular, the creation, then proliferation, of commercialised and competing autarkic NHS trusts and outside providers over many years. This has generated a growing culture of corporate defensiveness and reputation anxiety. Within such conditions, practitioners then adapt to behave much like employees in large commercial organisations – they must show compliance, “loyalty”, conformity and seamless performance, albeit speciously.This tendency has increased with every reform over the last 40 years; each has carried forward a neoliberal agenda – both Labour and Conservative governments have devised policies and managements to assure this. The currently vaunted 10-year plan will merely entrench the problemsJeremy Hunthas otherwise so adroitly observed and understood.Dr David ZigmondExecutive committee, Doctors for the NHSJeremy Hunt rightly points to the reluctance of healthcare workers to admit when errors have been made, and praises the example of a midwife meeting the father of a baby who died, where she expressed remorse and wished she had acted differently. This honesty led to forgiveness and improved confidence that lessons had been learned.It strikes me that, in general, politicians are similarly reluctant to admit when they get it wrong. Jeremy Hunt’s imposition in 2015 of anew contracton junior doctors (now called resident doctors) was on the false premise that if they could be forced to work more at weekends this would reduce delayed treatments and discharges.He failed to recognise that this simplistic solution would also require ancillary services – investigations, physiotherapy, social work – to be fully funded and operational seven days a week. The resulting doctors’ strike and subsequent imposition of the contract caused huge resentment. Perhaps it is a case of “politician, heal thyself”?Dr Richard SloanRetired palliative medicine consultant, Dorchester, DorsetJeremy Hunt’s comments are well meaning but not original, and he had adequate opportunity to change the system. The most significant call to end the blame culture was by Prof Donald Berwick 25 years ago in his seminal publication To Err Is Human. The Department of Health then publishedAn Organisation With a Memory, which spelled out constructive error management, but in the NHS Patient Safety Strategy of 2019 (after Hunt had been health secretary for six years), it was stated that we need to do more to change the culture.Let’s hope the 10-year plan will help to deliver that change through making it easier for patients and public to speak up.Dr Eric WattsFormer chair,Doctorsfor the NHSWhile I agree with Jeremy Hunt’s view on promoting a no-blame culture, implementing that is easier said than done. It is not just litigation that acts as an impediment to learning. Other factors such as complaints processes, coroners’ inquests (which have become increasingly adversarial) and even the threat of referral to professional bodies all act as a deterrent to a culture of openness and self-reflection.Dr Ian FreemanConsultant paediatrician, ManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Charities have championed the welfare of those who are vulnerable and ostracised, for centuries. That endeavour is vital not just to our civil society, but to our self-respect as a civilised nation.The Charity Commission will defend and protect the right – and indeed the responsibility – of charities to deliver on their lawful purposes. Over recent weeks, I have met with a wide range of charities, including a group of charities working with refugees and migrants, to hear about the challenges they are facing.I was disturbed by the measures some need to take simply to protect staff and their families from harm, including death threats, and to prevent and respond to criminal damage to property.Charitiesare not above the law, and their work should be open to scrutiny and rational debate. But nobody should face this kind of abhorrent abuse while doing their job.The commission takes seriously each and every concern that is raised with us – that is our duty and our promise to the public. But we will make short shrift of complaints that seek to weaponise charities to further political ends that have nothing to do with the charity law framework. And we will support trustees as they take measures to keep themselves, and their staff and volunteers safe from harm.Mark SimmsInterimchair, Charity CommissionHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The system put in place for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new drugs is respected the world over and is successful in applying the principle that funding a new product should not damage the NHS as a whole. This principle of cost-effectiveness has led to widespread price reductions for the NHS that have allowed the service as a whole to benefit.The chief executive of Eli Lilly links the recent pausing or cancelling of pharmaceutical industry investments in the UK to drug pricing here, when these are down to the drug companies’ desperation to kowtow toDonald Trump.Further to this, the talk of increasing Nice’s cost-effectiveness threshold, and even index-linking this, is a disgrace (NHS could pay 25% more for medicines under plan to end row with drugmakers and Trump, 8 October). The threshold is not a price that we should increase every year; it is a measure of opportunity cost. It measures what health improvements in the wider NHS we miss out on when we invest more in a new service or drug. If a new drug doesn’t generate more “health” than that which it displaces, the NHS as a whole is worse off. The rate of displacement doesn’t directly change with inflation.

The Bayern Munich striker lost three of them with his previous club, Tottenham, including the Champions League final in 2019.Kane’s response to the failure against France was to work at introducing greater variation to his penalty-taking technique, principally a stutter run where he waits for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball. The results have been spectacular.Kane went on a run of 31 successful conversions for club and country after France, the sequence broken at the start of this season when he missed for Bayern in the German Cup against Wehen Wiesbaden. Since then, he has scored six in a row, the latest coming inEngland’s 5-0 win against Latviain Riga on Tuesday. The result secured qualification for the World Cup finals, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.“I always try to learn from those moments,” Kane said. “After that penalty, I went 31 without missing. I changed my technique a little bit. I improved in that sense, which I was proud of. In terms of that being my last memory of a World Cup … yeah, I’m looking forward to the next World Cup to try to put that right, to try to go further, to try to lift the trophy as we all dream of doing. Those moments only shape you as a person, as a player and it’s definitely helped me to become a better player.”It was striking to hear Kane open up about the miss against France. “I’d say that was probably the worst that I felt in any moment,” he said. “Obviously I’ve lost finals before. To have that responsibility, you almost feel like it fell on my shoulders and I guess not being able to execute something that I’ve been able to execute many a time in my career … I think that was the hardest part to process and take.“Always as a sportsman, putting yourself in that situation … there’s going to be moments where it doesn’t quite go your way. But [it’s] the way I learned from that … the way that motivated me to get even better and improve – not just from the penalty side in terms of improving my technique but as an all-round player. To know I want to be back there at the World Cup, to help England get back there.”Kane scored twice in the victory against Latvia to move to 76 England goals. If Wayne Rooney’s previous record for the nation of 53 is fast becoming a speck in the rearview mirror, the prospect of Kane reaching an astonishing century feels increasingly feasible.View image in fullscreenKane is overcome with disappointment after missing from 12 yards against France in Qatar.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think it’s there,” the 32‑year‑old captain said. “The way I’m feeling right now, I’m not slowing down any time soon. I want to stay at this level for as long as I can. I’m on 76 now so that leaves 24 and we have a few more games between now and the World Cup … and then try to edge closer to that 100.”Kane has scored 18 goals for Bayern this season plus three for England. He feels he is in the form of his life. “I think so. The goals are there and the numbers speak for themselves. The way I feel on the pitch, the way I am seeing the game, physically and without the ball, pressing … I feel in a really good place. I feel like I have stepped up another level this season.”The England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, who signed Kane at Bayern in the summer of 2023, paid tribute to his professionalism. “For me, he never misses a penalty,” Tuchel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The facts behind his threatsDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here’s what he said – and what powers he does and doesn’t haveAlexander AbnosWed 15 Oct 2025 14.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 18.44 EDTShareWhat exactly did Trump say?Which time? Tuesdaywas the second timeTrump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it’s important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games.On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump’s use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues.“I guess, but we’re going to make sure they’re safe,” Trumpsaid. “They’re run by radical left lunatics and that don’t know what they’re doing.”Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city.“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won’t allow it to go to it. We’ll move it around a little bit,” Trump said.Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day’s press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year’s expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She’s radical left, and they’re taking over parts of Boston. That’s a pretty big statement, right?”Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees.“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let’s move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it. Very easily, he’d do it.”Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well.“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I’d probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”Does the US president have any power over the World Cup or Olympics?In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup’s case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer’s global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president’s return to office.Could Fifa actually move World Cup games from places like Boston or Seattle?Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle’s status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It’s hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It’s hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams’ travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It’s easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well.What role does the US government actually play in these events?So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won’t have visas approved in time for the games themselves.There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.View image in fullscreenBoston mayor Michelle Wu has dismissed Trump’s threat of removing World Cup games from Foxborough.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty ImagesHow has Fifa responded?So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump’s threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports.Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October,responding to Trump’s commentsabout Seattle and San Francisco.“It’s Fifa’s tournament, Fifa’s jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That’s the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”A Fifa spokesperson told Politico: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all Fifa events worldwide and it is ultimately the government’s responsibility to decide what’s in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfil all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”Outside of Fifa, Wuresponded to Trump’s threatby pointing out that much of Fifa’s host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.“We’re in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”Have events ever been moved before?Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women’s World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year’s Sars outbreak.Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country’s government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year’s U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting.The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.Why is Trump tying “safety” to these events?Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.What would happen if Washington tried to intervene?That’ll be the real test, won’t it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.Explore more on these topicsSport politicsWorld Cup 2026LA Olympic Games 2028World CupDonald TrumpBostonInternational Olympic CommitteeexplainersShareReuse this content"

The messiness of this situation is unlikely to placate an already angry fanbase. There was, however, an increased confidence from Rangers sources on Wednesday that Muscat could be delivered.Russell Martin was sackedas the Rangers manager last Sunday, his spell lasting just 123 days amid constant negativity from supporters. The Ibrox hierarchy only turned attention towards Muscat, who spent a brief time as a Rangers player, earlier this week. Yet appointing the Australian will not be completely straightforward; he is under contract with Shanghai Port for another year, with the club leading the Chinese Super League title race with four games to go.Shanghai Port’s season will not end until 22 November, before which time Rangers have eight games at home and abroad. Muscat would almost certainly have to take a pay cut to move to Glasgow. He is, though, known to be keen on managing in Britain after prior spells at Melbourne Victory, Belgium’s Sint-Truiden and Yokohama F. Marinos. The 52-year-old has maintained an affiliation with Rangers despite leaving in 2003.View image in fullscreenDanny Röhl has joined Steven Gerrard in withdrawing from the process to find a new Rangers manager.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThere was awareness within Ibrox that Röhl, 36, was likely to meet with a lukewarm reception in the stands if appointed. This caused unease among Rangers’ decision-makers. The German’s only experience as a first-team manager came at Wednesday. Muscat is considerably more popular among Rangers fans, partly because of a prior connection to the club but also because of his supposed no-nonsense approach to management.Muscat was previously in the running for the Rangers post in 2023, when Philippe Clement was instead appointed. Rangers are expected to at least clarify their short-term management plans by Friday.

Alyssa Thompson scored her first goal in west London as Sonia Bompastor’s side dominated proceedings. Sandy Baltimore opened the scoring from the penalty spot while Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert also got on the scoresheet.It was a memorable night for Thompson who added the hosts’ third immediately after the break. The 20-year-old has enjoyed a bright start to her Chelsea career since making a high-profile £1.1m move from Angel City this summer. She played an integral role in getting Chelsea this Champions League win at Stamford Bridge and Bompastor was delighted with her progression.Chelsea 4-0 Paris FC: Women’s Champions League – live reactionRead more“I’m glad for her because I think she’s been working hard and the fact that she was able to score her first goal is really important for her confidence,” she said.“She’s really quick and she has an engine. I think we haven’t seen the best of her yet but hopefully we’ll see that soon. She’s coming from abroad … It’s a new environment. She needs to learn to connect with the players on the pitch.”Chelsea had endured a frustrating start to their Champions League challenge, the only trophy to elude their grasp. This will have therefore come as a welcome result aftera 1-1 draw against Twentelast week in Enschede and a host of wasted opportunities that were starting to cause some consternation.View image in fullscreenErin Cuthbert toes in Chelsea’s fourth in the second half.Photograph: John Walton/PA“I think we were the better team,” Bompastor said. “We created a lot again. We scored really good goals from different players and we could have had more.”The recent lack of attacking cohesion has not been helped by Bompastor’s rotation. There were just two changes on this occasion with Baltimore and Sjoeke Nüsken coming in.Paris FC had suffered an equally underwhelming start, surrendering a 2-0 lead to the newcomers OH Leuven. Sandrine Soubeyrand welcomed back the goalkeeper Mylène Chavas while Maëlle Garbino and Anaële Le Moguédec also came in.It promised to be an intriguing contest between two managers who are very well acquainted. Bompastor and Soubeyrand played for France together for over a decade while also meeting often as managers in the Première Ligue.Chelsea dominated proceedings from the start. The urgency to score early was clear and led to a series of snatched opportunities when patience was needed. Nüsken and Cuthbert had efforts from distance while Aggie Beever-Jones scuffed two gilt-edged opportunities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After thrashing Bayern Munich 7-1 in their opener, Barça broke through after just two minutes in the Italian capital, Esmee Brugts scrambling the ball in from close range.Barcelona won a penalty early in the second half, only for Putellas to send her attempted Panenka over the bar. Just before the hour, Kika Nazareth volleyed into the far corner to double the visitors' lead, and Putellas made amends with her second spot-kick. Caroline Graham Hansen's late tap-in completed the rout.Twentecould not follow up last week's draw with Chelsea as they lost 2-1 atOH Leuvendespite taking a first-half lead through Jaimy Ravensbergen. The Dutch side held on until the 82nd minute before conceding a penalty, converted by Linde Veefkind. In the sixth minute of stoppage time, Sara Pusztai struck a spectacular winner for Leuven, smashing the ball into the top corner.Earlier, a much-changedOL Lyonnesside eased to a 3-0 home win over St Pölten. Jule Brand opened the scoring with her first goal for the club, and Ada Hegerberg headed the hosts' second just before half-time as the Austrian visitors paid for missed chances. Teenage midfielder Lily Yohannes completed the scoring soon after the restart with a brilliant lob from close to the halfway line.Wolfsburggrabbed a late victory atVålerengathanks to Janina Minge's penalty. The midfielder converted from the spot with the last kick of the game after Naina Inauen's foul in the area. Wolfsburg took the lead through Lineth Beerensteyn in the 57th minute, but Sara Hørte headed home just three minutes later to level for the hosts in Oslo.Guardian sportPhotograph: Matteo Ciambelli/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their pressure eventually told, however, when Nüsken went down in the box with half an hour played. The offence from Le Moguédec was not initially spotted by the referee, Michalina Diakow, but after a brief trip to the VAR monitor, she duly pointed to the spot. Baltimore stepped up to convert for the second week in a row.Chelsea consolidated their advantage just before the break when Thompson broke forward at pace. A clever turn gave her space to stand up a cross for Rytting Kaneryd to loop a header home. The winger looked slightly bemused that it had ended up in the back of the net, celebrating with an expression that said she is not accustomed to scoring with her head.Chelsea did not let their foot off the gas and extended their lead immediately after the break with Thompson’s close-range finish. They soon had a fourth when Cuthbert touched home a Sam Kerr header on the line.There was still time for the Cobham academy product and England youth international Lexi Potter to make her debut as Chelsea saw out a comfortable victory. It was an important three points on the board ahead of a trip to Austria to face St Pölten next month.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenParis FCWomen's footballUS sportsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Donotcry right now.’ But I just knew that we’d done it.”Zoe Aldcroft is reflecting on the moment last month when she realised England had won the Women’s Rugby World Cup. There were 12 minutes to play at a sold-out, increasingly euphoric Twickenham, but the hosts had created a 20-point cushion against Canada thanks to Alex Matthews’s second try.Aldcroft was correct:the game was settled at 33-13. A lifelong dream for her – and all the Red Roses – was about to become reality.English rugby unveils plan to build on women’s glory: ‘The stakes have never been higher’Read more“I ran back to the line and I was like: ‘Oh my God, we’ve done it.’ I saw my family and they were like [she clenches both fists]: ‘Come on, come on!’ Another moment was when Ellie Kildunne put that spiral bomb up [before the final try]. I thought: ‘We’ve got this in the palm of our hands.’ And the final whistle. We’ll never forget that moment.”Aldcroft describes the weeks since as a “massive whirlwind”. Pressed to choose one word to describe the entire experience, she settles on “phenomenal”. It’s back down to business now: the Premiership Women’s Rugby season begins next Friday and the flanker has returned to training this week with the champions, Gloucester-Hartpury. After a run of three consecutive titles, they will kick off against Saracens at Kingsholm on Sunday week.Hopefully she had time for a holiday first? “I had a few days away with my husband, Luke, then to Ibiza with a few of the Red Roses,” Aldcroft says. “That was unbelievable, it was great. We went to Pacha and it was really fun.”View image in fullscreenAldcroft (second right), and her England teammate Alex Matthews (right), train with Winscombe Warriors at the home of Melksham RFC in Wiltshire.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThe break was well earned.As captain of the overwhelming favourites, the 28-year-old shouldered a remarkable amount of pressure, particularly after England’s heartbreak at previous World Cups. Reminded of the crucial second-half tryagainst France in England’s semi-final, when they led 7-5, Aldcroft describes the calmness under pressure that made the difference.“I think one of our greatest strengths as Red Roses is we are so calm in those moments,” Aldcroft says. “I remember half-time [in the semi-final] being literally a couple of instructions and we were like: ‘All right, there we go then.’ Even when Canada scored first in the final there was no emotion to it. We’ve got so much belief.”What did she take from the tournament? “I learned every single day about who I am, the leader I am, the leader I want to be,” Aldcroft says. “The biggest thing I’ve taken is going off feel: instinct is probably my biggest strength.“Trying to get a sense of what everyone’s feeling, how they’re motivated, if they need to be left alone or brought together. And leading into the final, how people dealt with that: everyone is so different. You need to work out how they want to be. Everyone in that week just switched it on and we were ready to go.”England’s men’s World Cup winners of 2003 have described their struggles in returning quickly to club duty, and Aldcroft admits it has not been entirely straightforward. “Sunday came and it was: ‘Right, got to switch back to club.’“I had a couple of calls with Murph [the new Gloucester‑Hartpury coach Dan Murphy] last week. He was going over what was new and I was like: ‘I donotwant to be listening to this right now.’ But for me to be part of this journey going into the season is important.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beyond winning more silverware Aldcroft describes the more subtle factors now driving her. “This only came to me yesterday, but I think a big motivation for me now is bringing that next generation up. We’ve got a lot of new girls that have come through the pathway at Gloucester-Hartpury.“I want to lead them through my actions, give them my knowledge, to help them come up through their own journey. And also finding things I want to improve: whether that be mindset, experiences, skills on the pitch. But yeah, that was my biggest one: bringing up that next group of players to join the Red Roses.”A World Cup win is a life‑changing experience for any athlete, and Aldcroft confirms her agent has been busy. “There are a lot of things coming in. It’s important to take those opportunities, to put ourselves out there and expand women’s rugby. Personally I’m quite a content person so I’ll take it as it comes. I’m happy to do things if they come and not if they don’t. I’m just taking it in my stride.”Just like she did in winning a World Cup.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Only further rain saved England’s blushes.“Pakistan bowled brilliantly and made it really hard for us to get into the game at all,” the England captain, Sciver-Brunt, told Sky Sports. “We weren’t good enough and we’ll hold our hands up. Everyone’s practising really well and I guess it’s about finding a way to do that in games.”The no-result means that England remain on course to progress to the semi-finals if they win one of their final three group-stage games against India, Australia and New Zealand.This tournament has so far been a spinner’s paradise, but here it was prodigious swing that caused the England top-order problems, after massive rainfall 24 hours earlier which washed out the second half of Sri Lanka’s match against New Zealand. Pakistan’s young captain, Fatima Sana, sent down a remarkable spell of 5-1-19-3, including a wicket maiden first up, bowling Amy Jones through the gate with an inswinger.Knight once again saved herself with a timely DRS review against Sana which was missing leg stump, only for the Pakistan captain to strike twice in the next over with two further hooping deliveries – one which Sciver-Brunt chopped on to her stumps, and a second which struck Knight plumb in front.Earlier, Tammy Beaumont had shouldered arms to Diana Baig and was bowled by a nip-backer which clipped the top of her off-stump, while it was the left-arm spin of Sadia Iqbal which did for Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lumb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the length of the contracts signed by the Briton and his teammate, Kimi Antonelli, have not been specified, potentially leaving the F1 team open to once more pursue Red Bull’s Max ­Verstappen for 2027.The long-expected decision comes after a protracted period of negotiation with Russell, as Mercedes seek stability going into the new regulations of 2026. The 27-year-old British driver has five wins in eight seasons in F1, including victory in Singapore, helping propel Mercedes into a fight for second in the world championship with Ferrari and Red Bull.Norris as Senna and Piastri as Prost? No, but McLaren must hope title is settled on track | Giles RichardsRead moreRussell, who came up through the Mercedes junior programme, is fourth in the world championship. “I am really proud to be ­continuing our journey together,” he said. “Next year will mark my 10th since I signed with Mercedes back in 2017. It has been such a long and successful partnership so far and I can’t wait to see what lies ahead, particularly as we embark on one of the largest regulation changes in the sport’s history next year.”It is understood his desire to reduce his marketing and PR commit­ments was part of the deal but the length of the contract is likely to have played a significant part. This year the ­Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, madeno secret of his desireto lure the four-time world champion ­Verstappen away from Red Bull.However, before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen confirmed he wouldremain with Red Bull for 2026, so Mercedes were expected to stick with their drivers for the new season.The team’s announcement, made before the US Grand Prix this weekend, makes no mention of the duration of the new deals. A two-year arrangement is standard but both drivers could be on a 1+1 deal which enables either party to exercise an opt‑out after the first year.View image in fullscreenKimi Antonelli has also signed a new deal with Mercedes.Photograph: Jayce Illman/Getty ImagesWith a complete reset of the regulations next season the form book could change radically and ­Mercedes will be looking to be flexible come mid-season when it becomes clear who has come out on top, leaving the door open for another pursuit of Verstappen. A switch would look more attractive to the Dutch world champion should, as many expect, Mercedes emerge with a strong car.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Masters champion’s wife washit by a beer thrown from the galleriesat one point, with McIlroy himself subjected to abuse throughout.McIlroy’s return to the competitive fold, this week at the India Championship, has led him to try to change the topic of conversation. “I’ve been following the narrative coming out of theRyder Cupjust like everyone else,” said the Northern Irishman. “Unfortunately, I think it takes away from what we focused on, which was what an incredible performance it was by the European team.“As I’m playing my matches, I’m focused on trying to win my point. You see that the other guys are winning their matches or they are doing well but you don’t realise how well they are playing.“So just over the last two weeks, being able to watch the highlights and just see, especially those first two days, in the foursomes and the fourballs how good the European team were. The Americans would hit it close, we hit it closer. The Americans hole a putt and we hole a putt on top. It happened every single time.View image in fullscreenTeam Europe’s Rory McIlroy celebrates with the trophy during the presentation after winning the Ryder Cup.Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters“The unfortunate thing is people aren’t remembering that and they are remembering the week for the wrong reason. I would like to shift the narrative and focus on how good the European team were and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.”In the immediate aftermath of Europe’s win, McIlroy insisted golf should be proud to seek high standards from competitors and spectators. Some believe this presents the sport with a dilemma as it looks to engage youngsters.“You don’t want your sport to be unwelcoming to newcomers,” McIlroy added. “I absolutely get that. But you also don’t want newcomers coming into the game and ruining centuries of traditions and values of what this game represents or what it upholds. I think there has to be a balance.“I certainly think that golf can grow but it can grow in a way where the people that are coming into the game still respect and acknowledge that this is a little bit different than maybe other sports. I say it in America all the time, golf doesn’t need to be the NFL. It doesn’t need to be these other sports.Golfis golf, and that’s fine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donald is also in the field, with the Englishman yet to decide whether he wants to captain Europe for what would be a third time, at Adare Manor in 2027.“I think what Luke Donald has done the last two Ryder Cups has revolutionised the captaincy within Europe,” said McIlroy. “The effort and the dedication that Luke Donald has put into the last four years, it’s been absolutely amazing.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder Cup 2025US sportsGolfRyder CupnewsShareReuse this content"

This could include delaying investments that were not needed by the UK energy system in the short term, she added.Fletcher appeared before the committee alongside senior executives from Britain’s biggest energy suppliers. Chris Norbury, the chief executive of E.On UK, said the supplier’s own modelling had suggested that even if the wholesale price was zero bills would still be where they were today because of the increase in non-commodity costs.A government spokesperson said: “We categorically reject this speculation. Wholesale gas costs for households remain 75% higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the main reason energy bills remain high.”​”The only way to bring down energy bills for good is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, which will get the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power that we control,” the spokesperson said.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has repeatedly blamed the global gas market forrising energy bills, and has said breaking the country’s reliance on gas-fired power plants would help to reduce bills by up to £300 a year by 2030.The typical household energy bill under thegovernment’s price caphas climbed to £1,755 a year for the average dual-fuel customer this winter, despite market prices falling in recent months.The cap is nowjust over £500 a year higherthan in the winter before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated already increasing gas market prices. However, only about £200 of this higher cap can be directly attributed to the wholesale cost of energy.Other costs that have risen over recent years include the price of upgrading Britain’s energy networks, which has increased by more than £140 annually in the last four years to £396 a year under the cap. Policy costs, which include supporting low-carbon electricity projects, have climbed by £86 a year to £215 under the current price cap.“It’s time we got this burden under control,” Fletcher said. “There’s no budgetary control of this and yet it all ends up on household bills or contributing to making our electricity some of the most expensive in the industrialised world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despiteearlier reportsthat education, health and care plans (EHCPs) that detail support for each child would be scrapped as part of the overhaul, sources have told the Guardian that the plans will now survive the reforms.The report by the Sutton Trust found that 65% of working-class families interviewed spent nothing on their child’s EHCP application, while only 29% of middle-class families did the same. In contrast, one in 10 of the middle-class families interviewed had spent more than £5,000 on the application process, including medical assessments, consultants and legal advice.Third of UK parents have sought special needs assessment for their child, survey findsRead moreEHCPs were introduced in 2014, as a legal agreement between local authorities and parents for the additional support required based on a child’s needs. But the Sutton Trust report shows that parents able to spend thousands of pounds on their child’s applications were more likely to obtain sought-after special school places.The research found that 12% of parents with children in special schools had spent £5,000 or more on their EHCP application, compared with just 1% of those attending mainstream schools.Affluent parents were also more likely tocontest local authority decisions at tribunals, the vast majority of which result in the successful award of an EHCP. Overall, middle-class parents were eight percentage points more likely to obtain an EHCP for their child than working-class parents.Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which campaigns for improving social mobility, said: “It’s unacceptable that a child’s background can dictate whether they get the help they need to thrive and be happy at school. This is a major barrier to their opportunities and can profoundly impact their long-term prospects.“Right now, disadvantaged kids with Send are being failed by a system beset with inconsistency and mind-boggling bureaucracy. Getting the right support for a child shouldn’t be about a parent’s ability to pay. We need urgent action to make the system work better for everyone.”Margaret Mulholland, the Association of School and College Leaders’ Send and inclusion specialist, said: “Schools and colleges work tirelessly to support these students but they are critically under-resourced and face wider problems of delays to assessments for EHCPs, and shortages of specialist staff such as speech and language therapists.“Desperate families often pay for assessments themselves and fight for the level of care they want for their child through tribunals. But such measures are often more difficult for disadvantaged families and this means that we effectively have a two-tier system.”The report found that children with special needs from poor backgrounds were “doubly disadvantaged”, likely to receive less support at school and end up with worse exam results than their better-off peers.While 26% of schoolchildren in England qualify for free school meals, they account for 44% of children with EHCPs, while a further 39% receive additional support without an EHCP.What are EHCPs and why is Labour bracing for a backlash over its overhaul plans?Read moreA Guardianinvestigation into the costs of Sendfound the highest-spending local authorities were concentrated in large, wealthy county areas in the south-east and east of England with higher prevalence of affluent parents.Of the 10 English councils with the largest accumulated Send deficits, four were in the wealthiest fifth of council areas and a further five in the wealthiest two-fifths.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Support should be based on children’s needs, not where in the country they happen to live, the ability of their parents to make the case, or whether or not they have an EHCP – which given shortages of funding and specialist staff is far from a silver bullet to ensure pupils get all the help they need.”Georgia Gould, the minister for school standards in England, said: “This report lays bare how badly children with Send have been let down and denied the opportunities and support they deserve. Our mission is to break down barriers to opportunity so every child, not just the privileged few, can achieve and thrive.“I’ve met parents who’ve had to fight every step of the way and we will not stand by whilst they continue to face a system that has failed them for far too long. That’s why we’re building a system with improved training for teachers, £740m to help create more specialist school places and earlier intervention for speech and language needs – reassuring parents that support will be available for, as routine at the earliest stage.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsChildrenSchool fundingEducation policyLocal governmentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities said at the time they had identified eight victims of “White Tiger”, aged between 11 and 15 and from Germany, England, Canada and the US.The case has prompted questions about whether German authorities could have acted sooner and prevented some of the abuse.The Zeit newspaper reported that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US had alerted German authorities in 2021 to an apparently Hamburg-based predator using the name “White Tiger”.According to Zeit, NCMEC provided a roughly 40-page document containing chat transcripts from the online platform Discord in which “White Tiger” demanded photos from two young girls, urging them to harm themselves and suggesting they take their own lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was eventually accused of breaching professional standards over the use of force.But on Wednesday the case was dismissed after the panel’s chair, Chris McKay, ruled there was no case to answer. He said the panel’s full reasons for the decision would be issued in the next five days.Baker’s family said there was no justification for the killing and questioned how W80’s action had escaped scrutiny. The police watchdog said the case has dented public confidence in police accountability.Baker, a father of two from Tottenham, north London, was shot at close range by counter-terrorism specialist firearms officer W80, who thought Baker was reaching for a gun.Baker, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of a stolen Audi A6, was unarmed. An imitation firearm was later found in the back of the Audi, the misconduct hearing previously heard.W80 was in the “highest tier” of armed officers in the country and had been trained to carry a gun since 1998.Prosecutors said in 2017 that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges over the shooting, but theIndependent Office for Police Conduct(IOPC) directed that the officer should face misconduct proceedings, prompting a lengthy legal dispute between the watchdog and the Metropolitan police.In 2023, thesupreme court found in the IOPC’s favour, paving the way for a misconduct hearing. There was also a public inquiry into Baker’s death which concluded in 2022 that he had been lawfully killed.Margaret Smith, the mother of Baker, said she was not surprised by the decision.She said: “Since the day almost 10 years ago that my son Jermaine was shot and killed by W80, the Metropolitan police has taken every possible step to avoid their officer or their organisation from facing scrutiny and accountability for his death.“That included going all the way to the supreme court to avoid W80 facing disciplinary proceedings. Against that background, my family and I never had any faith in this gross misconduct hearing.”The IOPC director, Amanda Rowe, said: “This case highlights the complexities of the police accountability system, which leave it open to legal challenges and lengthy delays that have a detrimental impact on the confidence of both the public and the police officers involved.“We have long called for a review of end-to-end processes and said that the complaints and disciplinary system need fundamental reform.”Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, welcomed the decision but accepted that the system needed reform.Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, he said: “Officers will be encouraged by the fact this has been dismissed – it will give them some confidence that the right decision has been reached in the end.”He said W80 had endured a “decade of legal madness” in which his life “was put on hold”.Rowley added: “We were very clear with the IOPC that we weren’t sure this hearing was necessary, but the more important message today is the system itself, the regulations which hold police to account do not have the right balance.“They’re exploited too often by criminals and their legal teams to undermine police officers’ confidence, and we need a system which looks fairly at split-second decisions taken by officers in the most difficult operational moments.”He urged the government to act on an independent review of police accountability which reported to the Home Office earlier this year, adding: “Until we have a more just and more timely system, it will continue to crush the spirit and confidence of good officers who go out there every day to police London and to keep us all safe.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In that case, a judge ruled in favor of the youth plaintiffs who argued that the Montana state government had violated their constitutional right to a healthy environment.In Wednesday’sruling, Christensen said that the plaintiffs presented “overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing at a staggering pace, and that this change stems from the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels”.However, Christensen said: “Yet while this court is certainly troubled by the very real harms presented by climate change and the challenged [executive orders’] effect on carbon dioxide emissions, this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act.”He added: “Granting plaintiffs’ injunction would require the defendant agencies, and – ultimately – this court, to scrutinize every climate-related agency action taken since” the start of Trump’s second presidency on 20 January 2025.“In other words, this court would be required to monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction. This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent,” Christensen continued.In response to Christensen’s decision, Julia Olson, chief legal counsel at Our Children’s Trust and lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said: “Every day these executive orders remain in effect, these 22 young Americans suffer irreparable harm to their health, safety, and future. The judge recognized that the government’s fossil fuel directives are injuring these youth but said his hands were tied by precedent.”Olson added: “We will appeal – because courts cannot offer more protection to fossil fuel companies seeking to preserve their profits than to young Americans seeking to preserve their rights. This violates not only the constitution and supreme court precedent, but the most basic principles of justice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In August, his administration released a report that said “climate change is a challenge – not a catastrophe”, a claim that drewsharp criticismfrom climate experts who called the report a “farce” filled with misinformation.Explore more on these topicsUS newsClimate crisisYoung peopleFossil fuelsDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Another factor was an upsurge in wildfires in conditions made hotter and drier by global heating. Wildfire emissions in the Americas reachedhistoric levels in 2024, which was the hottest year yet recorded.However, scientists are concerned about a third factor: the possibility that the planet’s carbon sinks are beginning to fail. About half of all CO2emissions every year are taken back out of the atmosphere by being dissolved in the ocean or being sucked up by growing trees and plants. But the oceans are getting hotter and can therefore absorb less CO2while on land hotter and drier conditions and more wildfires mean less plant growth.Carbon sinks were already known to be less effective in El Niño years such as 2023 and 2024, when changes in Pacific winds and ocean currents lead to higher global air temperatures. But human-caused global heating has already raised the average world temperatures by about 1.3C and researchers, who recorded an “unprecedented failure of the land sink” in 2023 and2024, fear this may be weakening the sinks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Is nature’s carbon sink failing?Read moreDr Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer, said: “There is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming. Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops.”Rising CO2emissions not only impact the global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of the gas’s long lifetime in the atmosphere, the WMO says.Ko Barrett, the WMO deputy secretary general, said: “The heat trapped by CO2and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community wellbeing.”Atmospheric concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide – the second and third most important greenhouse gases related to human activities – also rose to record levels in 2024.About 40% of methane emissions come from natural sources. But scientists are concerned that global heating isleading to more methane production in wetlands, another potential feedback loop. The rest comes fromfossil fuel exploitation; livestock such as cattle;rotting waste in landfills; and rice paddies. Human-caused nitrous oxide emissions include those from overuse of fertiliser by farmers and some industrial processes.The WMO released its annual greenhouse gas bulletin a month beforeCop30, the UN climate change summit in Belém, Brazil, where representatives from the world’s countries will attempt to ramp up climate action. The data comes from a network of500 monitoring stationsaround the world.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisUnited NationsExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

Overall, tropical forests are thought to be carbon sinks – absorbing more CO2than they release – and uptake is assumed to increase amid rising atmospheric concentration.But nearly 50 years of data collected from tropical forests acrossQueenslandhas revealed this crucial carbon sink could be under threat.About 25 years ago, tree trunks and branches in those forests became a net emitter, with more trees dying and insufficient new growth, according to the research.“It’s the first tropical forest of its kind to show this symptom of change,” said lead author Dr Hannah Carle from Western Sydney University.Victoria’s mountain ash forests could lose a quarter of giant trees as temperatures riseRead more“We know that the moist tropics in Australia occupy a bit of a warmer, drier climate space than tropical forests on other continents, and therefore it might serve as a future analog for what tropical forests will experience in other parts of the world.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterProf Adrienne Nicotra from the Australian National University, a co-author of the study, said it remained to be seen whether Australia’s tropical forests were a harbinger for other tropical forests globally and further research was needed.But if so, the findings could have significant implications for global climate models, carbon budgets and climate policies.“This paper is the first time that this tipping point of a switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source in tropical rainforests has been identified clearly – not just for one year but for 20 years,” said Prof David Karoly, an emeritus professor at the University of Melbourne and an expert in climate change science.Karoly, who was not involved in the research, said on a global scale the share of carbon dioxide absorbed by forests, trees, and plants had been quite stable over the past 20 to 30 years, which was assumed to continue under many climate models and policies.But if similar shifts – from sink to source – were observed in other rainforests, climate projections mayunderestimate global warming in future. “Which is bad news,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their reduced capacity to absorb extra carbon would make emissions cuts “a lot harder” and require an even more rapidtransition away from fossil fuels.The analysis drew on a unique set of forest data dating back to 1971, including records tracking roughly 11,000 trees across 20 forest sites inQueensland. It considered the carbon stored above ground in tree trunks and branches but not the gains and losses below ground from soil and roots.Dr Raphael Trouve, who studies forest dynamics at the University of Melbourne and was not involved in the study, said the research highlighted the value of collecting and maintaining long term data.Trouve’s own research published earlier this year, which found mountain ash forests werethinning rapidlyunder drier and hotter conditions, relied on a different 50-year dataset collected in Victorian forests.The surprising findings in tropical rainforests showed the value of the data in quantifying changes in the environment, he said.“We thought the forest would be able to store more carbon because [CO2] is increasing. But looking at these long term empirical datasets, we find that is not the case – it allows us to confront the theory with reality and better understand how these systems work.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsAustralian climate and environment in focusQueenslandClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

At least one person was killed and two were missing. The hardest-hit communities included Kipnuk, population 715, and Kwigillingok, population 380, where the storm damaged every single home.“It’s catastrophic in Kipnuk. Let’s not paint any other picture,” Mark Roberts, an incident commander with the state emergency management division, said during a news conference Tuesday. “We are doing everything we can to continue to support that community, but it is as bad as you can think.”Officials are still scrambling to shelter those displaced by the storm. Hundreds of people were staying in school shelters, where toilet access and power has been limited. State authorities have acknowledged people are “miserable” and said they are moving as fast as they can.“We need to have places for people to go safely, where they can be warm and fed and taken care of. We’re moving quickly to have that established, but it’s taking some time,” Roberts toldAlaska Public Radio.Across the region, more than 1,500 people were displaced. Dozens were flown to a shelter set up in the national guard armory in the regional hub city of Bethel, a community of 6,000 people, and officials were considering flying evacuees to longer-term shelter or emergency housing in Fairbanks and Anchorage.Among those awaiting evacuation to Bethel on Tuesday was Brea Paul, of Kipnuk, who said in a text message that she had seen about 20 homes floating away through the moonlight on Saturday night.“Some houses would blink their phone lights at us like they were asking for help but we couldn’t even do anything,” she wrote.The following morning, she recorded video of a house submerged nearly to its roofline as it floated past her home.Paul and her neighbors had a long meeting in the local school gym on Monday night. They sang songs as they tried to figure out what to do next, she said. Paul wasn’t sure where she would go.“It’s so heartbreaking saying goodbye to our community members not knowing when we’d get to see each other,” she said.About 30 miles (48km) away in Kwigillingok, Ella Mae Kashatok, 67, was found dead and authorities on Monday night called off the search for two men whose home floated away after what they described as a “robust and extensive search” with drones, boats and aircraft.“This is not a decision any of us ever wanted to make,” Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Alaska state troopers, told theAnchorage Daily News. “It comes after a careful evaluation of all of the available information and the available resources.”In Kwigillingok this week, the school was the only facility in town with full power, but it had no working toilet and 400 people stayed there Monday night. Workers were trying to fix the bathrooms; a situation report from the state emergency operations center on Tuesday noted that portable toilets, or “honey buckets”, were being used.A preliminary assessment showed every home in the village was damaged by the storm, with about three dozen having drifted from their foundations, the emergency management office said.Power systems flooded in Napakiak, and severe erosion was reported in Toksook Bay. In Nightmute, officials said fuel drums were reported floating in the community, and there was a scent of fuel in the air and a sheen on the water.The national guard was activated to help with the emergency response, and crews were trying to take advantage of any breaks in the weather to fly in food, water, generators and communication equipment.Officials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities. Most rebuilding supplies would have to be transported in and there is little time left with winter just around the corner, and communities accessible only by water or air.“Indigenous communities in Alaska are resilient,” said Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “But, you know, when you have an entire community where effectively every house is damaged and many of them will be uninhabitable with winter knocking at the door now, there’s only so much that any individual or any small community can do.”Thoman said the storm was likely fueled by the warm surface waters of the Pacific Ocean, which has been heating up because of human-caused climate change and making storms more intense.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaExtreme weatherUS weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

They also argued that it was a way of welcoming a larger, more diverse group of visitors to the Lake District.The Elterwater zip wire plan was turned down in 2023, but approved by planners in May 2024. The campaign groupFriends of the Lake Districtthen sought a judicial review that led to a two-day hearing in April this year.The group argued that planners had misunderstood their responsibilities but in his rulingthe judge backed planning officialsand dismissed the arguments made against the approval.View image in fullscreenThe Velocity 2 zip line at Zip World in Penrhyn Quarry, Snowdonia.Photograph: Crown copyright (2018) Visit Wales. All rights reservedMichael Hill, the CEO of Friends of the Lake District, said they were now considering the implications of the judgment and whether to appeal. He said: “We are disappointed, but we are energised by the fact that we’ve managed to make a point about what we stand for.”Hill added that the charity had nothing against people coming to learn about the industrial history of the quarry, “but we believe that the way the attraction is configured with zip wires is going to trivialise the experience. It will not honour the memory of the quarrymen and the miners who worked there. It will just be an adrenaline experience.”Others to object to the plan include theInternational Council on Monuments and Sites(Icomos), an advisory body to the international heritage organisation Unesco.Icomos said the plans imperilled the area’s “tranquil and contemplative” quality and described the attraction as being “of a type that would transform the quarry or part of it into a theme park and would trivialise the experience of an important aspect of the Lake District’s heritage”.The envisaged use of the caverns was more “adventure tourism” than “cultural heritage interpretation”, it added.Hill said the stakes were high and he feared the Lake District could lose its Unesco world heritage status. “Unesco took away world heritage site status from the docks at Liverpoola few years ago and they’ve done it for other places around the world,” he said. “And they could do it here if we carry on disregarding their advice about the special characteristics of this place.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have seen a change in language, people telling us their family’s attitudes are changing, as well as increasing narratives around benefit claimants and some very difficult and terrible instances of violence linked to mental illness – it feels like a lot of things have come home to roost.”She said the charity was “hearing from mental health services who are getting challenges from neighbours like frequent complaints, objections in planning applications or operating in inhospitable environments”.The survey also showed a significant drop in the number of people who – correctly – believe people with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or psychosis, can fully recover. The figure stood at 67% in 2019, and is now 53%.Prof Claire Henderson from the IoPPN said the survey showed that although people’s attitudes towards specific individuals with mental illness had improved, their attitudes towards mental illness generally had declined “back to baseline”.She said recent high-profile criminal cases involving perpetrators with mental illness, such as Valdo Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia and fatally stabbed three people in Nottingham in 2023, could have increased stigmatisation.“There is this fear about people who are visibly unwell, and there has been a push to more coercive care, whereas really it’s about having the resources to be able to respond to people when they are in crisis,” she said.“But if you have a neighbour who’s very unwell and not getting treated, or if you’re on the bus and somebody is yelling for no clear reason and you’re with small children, people worry. It’s not fair just to say that people are ignorant or prejudiced.”She said difficulty accessing services was adding to pessimism about whether therapy worked. “We asked people: ‘Can medication work? Do people recover?’ And if you don’t see that happening, then you will not answer positively to those questions,” she said.Henderson said a growing “negative discourse about young people with mental health problems” was “trivialising” some conditions, and feeding misconceptions about benefit claimants.The findings were released as part of Mind’s annual Big MentalHealthreport, which found there were 1.66 million people waiting for community mental health care in England and Wales in the third quarter of 2024-25.Jenny Tan, 22, a psychology student who waited years to receive treatment for anorexia, said she had faced stigma and unfriendliness when disclosing her mental ill health.“There are so many more celebrities now coming forward and talking about this. I thought society was a lot more accommodating, a lot more understanding,” she said. “But when people think of mental illness, they stereotypically think of disorders that are presented as being dangerous in the media, things which have been associated with violence.“But I think if people actually understood what it was like to have a mental health condition, their reaction would not be disgust and running away.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHealthEnglandVoluntary sectorResearchKing's College LondonnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the IfG report suggests the damage done by years of cuts is so severe that many people will not notice any difference to their local services.graphicStuart Hoddinott, the author of the report, said: “Most public services struggled when spending was cut during the early 2010s, but few as much as local government. Cuts were so deep that, even with sustained increases throughout the 2020s, funding is still due to be lower in real terms in 2028-29 than it was almost two decades earlier.”Mark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the report, said: “Over the past 15 years, per person spending on local authority services excluding social care has fallen by a staggering 38%. These cuts have had a direct impact on people’s lives, their wellbeing, and the resilience of their communities.”The report tracked councils’ spending power since 2010, when the coalition government began to slash local authority funding. It found that even with Labour’s spending increases, English councils would have nearly 15% less spending power on average per capita than they did in 2010.View image in fullscreenBirmingham, the largest local authority, remains under acute pressure as it uses its reserve fund to maintain statutory services.Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesFrom 2009-10 to 2023-24, the researchers found, councils cut spending on youth centres by 60% and on libraries by 50%, and focused almost exclusively on essential services such as statutory social care, which now takes up more than two-thirds of budgets.The rise in social care spending has been caused by an explosion in demand for statutory services for an ageing population, the rise in numbers of children and working-age adults with complex physical and emotional needs, andthe ballooning costof privately provided specialist care services such as children’s residential homes.GraphicOne interviewee told the report’s authors that local authorities had become “adult social care factories”.The IfG also found a record number of councils were relying on emergency funding, and that if the government had notdelayed a requirementfor authorities to account for special educational needs provision, 40% would have been driven to the point of bankruptcy.Hoddinott said that one reason for dissatisfaction with public services was that while money had started coming back into local areas, it was being almost entirely spent on essential services for vulnerable people, rather than amenities used by the general population.GraphicMeanwhile, councils are increasingly using their budgets to pay for costly crisis services such as child protection and children’s homes, rather than preventive services. Spending on looked-after children went up by 71% between 2009-10 and 2023-24; over the same period, investment in early intervention services such as children’s centres fell by 79%.These pressures are being most acutely felt inBirmingham, the country’s largest local authority, which in effect declared itself bankrupt two years ago and is still struggling to balance its budget.The council’s latest figures show it is expected to use £80m of its reserve funds, about 8% of the total, by the end of the financial year, partly owing to a £13.4m overspend and £14m in costs from the city’s continuing bin strike.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentAusterityPublic services policyThinktanksEconomicsSocial careBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

This would encompass people either with a BMI greater than 40; or those with a high BMI and at least one raised figure for measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or waist-to-height ratio; or those with two such raised figures regardless of BMI; or those with direct measures of excess body fat based on scans.In addition, they said obesity should be split into two categories: clinical obesity – where there are signs of illness – and pre-clinical obesity, where there are not.Now research suggests the revamped definition could result in a dramatic rise in the prevalence of obesity among adults in the US.Dr Lindsay Fourman, the first author of the study, from Mass General Brigham in the US, said the increase in obesity prevalence based on the new definition was striking, and was largely driven by people who would not have been considered to have obesity based on their BMI alone.“Recognising people with [this type of] obesity can lead to more accurate health risk stratification,” she said. “For example, someone with BMI 23 but excess abdominal fat could benefit from lifestyle interventions such as improving diet and increasing physical activity, even though their BMI is in the “normal” range. Their physician might also more closely monitor for obesity-related complications such as pre-diabetes or fatty liver.”Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, Fourman and colleagues describe how they applied the traditional and new definitions of obesity to a nationally representative group of 301,026 participants, aged 18 to 80, who had enrolled in a US-based health study between the end of May 2017 and the end of September 2023.While traditional BMI-based criteria would mean 128,992, or 43%, of the participants were deemed to have obesity, the team found this increased by nearly 60% using the new definition, encompassing 206,361, or 69%, of participants. For those aged 70 years or older, prevalence under the new definition was 78%.Almost all those with obesity under the traditional definition also had obesity under the new definition, with only 678 participants no longer considered to have obesity. However, the new definition meant 78,047 participants who would not previously have been considered to have obesity based on BMI alone would be deemed to have the condition.“Our data show that these individuals have a heightened risk of organ dysfunction and long-term health complications, suggesting that their classification as having obesity is clinically appropriate,” said Fourman.Of those deemed to have obesity without a high BMI, 48% had clinical obesity. For those who had obesity based on their BMI together with other measures, this figure was 56%.The researchers noted that while the prevalence of obesity under the new definition was similar between men and women, men showed a greater increase upon the use of the new definition, adding that while prevalence increased by a similar number of percentage points across racial groups, the greatest relative rise was among Asian individuals.Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the study, described it as thought-provoking and said further research was now needed, but noted that the newly proposed definition of obesity had yet to be adopted.“Regardless of definitions, it’s clear that current obesity levels pose major challenges especially in high-income countries like the UK, with rising weight levels underscoring the urgent need for more effective strategies to support healthier living,” he said.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthResearchHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

He also dismissed Russian concerns that supplying US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine would be unnecessarily provocative.The move by Russia had involved 21 drones in a seven-hour incursion in early September, forcing the closure of airports in the east and centre of the country. “We think the preponderance of evidence suggests that it was deliberate,” Sikorski said.Ukraine war briefing: Poland minister shows Shahed drone and warns of ‘deep’ Russian threatRead more“They were launched from a single location, and they were all unarmed. If this was an accidental offshoot of that night’s attack on Ukraine, you would expect the mix of drones to be the same, some armed, some unarmed. All the ones that crossed intoPolandwere unarmed,” he said.The drones, understood to be Russian-made Gerbera decoys, were launched from Russia, in an incursion that was “seemingly coordinated with Belarus”, he said. It was, he added, partly a test of Poland and Nato’s air defences, forcing Poland and Nato allies to respond by scrambling fighter jets and other air defences.Sikorski was speaking before a planned meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, at which the defence of Europe’s eastern flank and supply of drones to Ukraine will be discussed. After the Polish incursion, Nato allies agreed to supply further jets for air policing as part of an operation called Eastern Sentry.According to a leaked defence paper to be published on Thursday, the European Commission will also call for European drone defences to be “fully functional by the end of 2027” as part of a project previously known as the “drone wall”.The Polish drone incident is one of several incursions into Nato airspace by Russia in September, with Russian drones also sighted in the Baltic states, Romania and Norway, and potentially elsewhere in Scandinavia.Sikorski said the incursions were a reminder that Putin believed he was “at war with us” – a situation that he argued dated back in the Russian president’s mind to the2006 Alexander Litvinenko poisoningand his combative speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference.“He’s been at war with us, but we didn’t acknowledge it because it seemed too preposterous and too strange,” Sikorski said. The incursion into Poland was part of a “spectrum of provocations”, he said, including poisonings, sabotage and arson attacks, such as incendiary bombs at parcel sites in Poland, Germany and the UK.View image in fullscreenThe roof of a house damaged after Russian drones violated Polish airspace and were shot down.Photograph: Kacper Pempel/ReutersThough Putin was “probing”, Sikorski said, the incursions and other hybrid threats had been “tactically stupid and counterproductive for him. What is he achieving? He is achieving the consolidation of public support for a policy of deterrence against Russia.”Donald Trump is expected to discuss whether to supply Ukraine with US Tomahawks, which have a range of more than 1,000 miles, in a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that the issue was of “extreme concern” to Russia.But Sikorski said concerns about the conflict spreading were exaggerated. “Every time we intended to give Ukraine new missiles, new types of weapons, somebody said: ‘Don’t do it, it’s escalatory. Don’t send them tanks. Don’t send them MiG fighters. Don’t send them F-16s. Don’t give them Himars [rockets] don’t give them Atacms [missiles].’ And every time Russia has had to adjust.”The Tomahawks, Sikorski said, could be used to target Russian oil refineries, the subject of recent Ukrainian drone strikes. “Russia’s vastness means that you don’t have enough anti-aircraft assets to protect all the targets,” he said, noting Ukraine was having success in reducing Russia’s capacity to produce oil. “When you achieve success you should reinforce it.”Sikorski said that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, had been “whispering into Trump’s ear that Russia always wins”. However, the Polish minister said that Russia had been defeated in Crimea in the 19th century, in the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, in the first world war, against Poland in 1920 and more recently in Afghanistan.“Only when Russia loses a war are there any reforms,” Sikorski said. “If Russia lost the war it would be good for Ukraine, it would be good for Europe, but it would also be good for Russia.”The Polish minister was in the UK for routine meetings, including with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, and Jonathan Powell, Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. He also visited parliament, where he helped unveil a decommissioned Shahed-136 drone at an event organised by United Against Nuclear Iran.The UK on Wednesday announced fresh sanctions against Russia, targeting its two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, and 51 “shadow fleet” oil tankers, in what it described as a new attempt to tighten energy sanctions and choke off the Kremlin’s revenues. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Washington would be willing to work with European countries on steeper sanctions.Thedrone wall idea, proposed by the EU executive, envisaged a system of “anti-drone capabilities for detection, tracking, and neutralisation, as well as capabilities to hit ground targets leveraging drone technology for precision strikes” according to a draft defence roadmap seen by the Guardian.However, EU sources said the name “drone wall” would be dropped to help the initiative win broader support. EU leaders will be asked to endorse the defence roadmap at a Brussels summit on 23 October as part of a drive to ensure the continentcan defend itself from foreign invasion by 2030.The idea originated in the Baltic states, but has met scepticism farther west. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said something “a little more sophisticated and complex was needed”. In Germany, where the word “wall” has an unhappy historical resonance, senior politicians have cast doubt on the idea, while endorsing drone defence.To help win broader geographical support, EU officials argue drone defences could help protecting borders and infrastructure, combating organised crime.Explore more on these topicsPolandRussiaDrones (military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And, frankly, this is an issue that we have here inNew YorkCity, and, frankly, even across this country.”Mamdani said he had spoken to people who voted for Donald Trump in New York who told him it was the “cost of living” that “drove them to vote” for the president.Mamdani said that, despite that, “what we’re seeing time and time again is we’re more focused on the question of billionaires and the most profitable corporations than we are on people who can’t even afford to make ends meet in the city”.Following his surprise victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, Mamdani has for months led the polls to be New York’s next mayor. A survey releasedby Quinnipiaclast week showed Mamdani winning 46% of the vote to the former New York governor’s 33%. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, was at 22%.Republican in New York’s mayor race: eccentric street vigilante who could secure Mamdani’s winRead moreThat rise has brought attention from outlets such as Fox News, which has closely covered Mamdani, sometimes publishing multiple news stories on him a day. Jesse Watters, the network’s primetime host, has beena frequent critic, describing Mamdani as a “communist”, which he is not, and calling him “Kamala Harris with a beard”, while Sean Hannity suggested that the rise of Mamdani, who is Muslim, is evidence that “an extremism is taking root right before your very eyes”.In an interview that rehashed several rightwing critiques of Mamdani, MacCallum suggested he may lack the qualifications for the role. “President Trump said that you never worked a day in your life,” MacCallum told Mamdani, before asking what qualifies him to run the city.In response, Mamdani spoke directly into the camera, alluding to how the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, bowed to pressure from the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration crackdowns – before the Trump-led justice department dropped a federal corruption case against him.“I want to take this moment, because you spoke about President Trump, and he may be watching right now, and I just want to speak directly to the president,” Mamdani said.“I will not be a mayor like Mayor [Eric] Adams, who will call you to figure out how to stay out of jail. I won’t be a disgraced governor like Andrew Cuomo, who will call you to ask how to win this election. I can do those things on my own. I will, however, be a mayor who is ready to speak at any time to lower the cost of living.“That’s the way that I’m going to lead this city. That’s the partnership I want to build, not only with Washington DC, but [with] anyone across this country.”The interview came as Mamdani prepared for a debate with Cuomo and Sliwa on Thursday night. Adams suspended his re-election campaign in late September.Cuomo, who has centered his campaign on reducing crime, will likely seek to contrast his decades of experience in politics with Mamdani’s newcomer status. The former governor, who resigned in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, has run numerous ads attacking Mamdani.The issue of the Israel-Hamas peace deal is likely to come up, given Cuomo’s strong support for Israel and Mamdani’s opposing stance. Mamdani has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza and called the bombing of the territory a “genocide”. Mamdani was asked questions about the region on Wednesday, including whether he would give credit to Trump for the fledgling deal.Mamdani, stressing that his focus would be on New York rather than international politics, said he was thankful for the ceasefire, adding: “I have hope that it will actually endure and that it will be lasting.”“I think it’s too early to [give credit],” Mamdani said. “But if it proves to be something that is lasting, something that is durable, then I think that that’s where you give credit.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkFox NewsTV newsUS television industryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The driverless taxi that could also get you a job – or a dateRead moreThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I’m delighted that Waymo intends to bring their services to London next year, under our proposed piloting scheme.“Boosting the AV [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment and opportunities to the UK. Cutting-edge investment like this will help us deliver our mission to be world leaders in new technology and spearhead national renewal.”A fuller rollout of self-driving taxis is expected in the UK after the Automated Vehicles Act fully takes effect in late 2027.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents black-cab drivers, known in the city as “cabbies”, said: “It’s a fairground ride.“It’s a tourist attraction in San Francisco. Quite frequently one of them will lock up in the middle of a junction because it gets confused and the police have to come and park, wait for the Waymo man to get his laptop out and get it going again.”He said London would pose a bigger challenge for Waymo, due to its irregular road system. He added that he did not believe there was public appetite for the technology.“If there was demand for it, Nigel Farage would be saying get rid of immigrants, have driverless cars instead. But there’s no demand for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also launching services in Tokyo using Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles, its only other current venture outside the US.Its co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana said the technology was “making roads safer and transportation more accessible”, adding: “We’ve demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing, and we can’t wait to expand the benefits of our technology to the United Kingdom.”Waymo launched its autonomous taxis in 2020 and has amassed a fleet of more than 2,000 driverless vehicles. It says it has taken more than 10 million passengers in the US, offering services in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Atlanta.London would become the only European city in which the company is operational, pending approval from central government and Transport for London.Despite somealarming incidents, Waymo said the data showed that cars driven by humans were involved in incidents that injured pedestrians 12 times more often than its autonomous vehicles.Its cars use cameras, artificial intelligence, radar and lidar – sensors that use lasers to measure distance in three dimensions – to create a map of objects around the vehicle, including in darkness and weather conditions such as rain.Explore more on these topicsWaymoSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryTechnology sectorLondonEuropeTfLnewsShareReuse this content"

His idea is to “create the opportunity for people to do that at home with real top-notch food.”Bigham launched his eponymous food business from his kitchen table in 1996. The company is sold in supermarkets including Waitrose and Tesco, and its founderappears in its TV adverts in animated form.View image in fullscreenCharlie Bighams Brasserie beef wellington.The range, which has been a year in development, will initially launch in 70 Waitrose stores this week, with some meals costing triple the £9.95 typically charged for its bestselling fish pie. “It’s fairly and squarely aimed at that weekend occasion,” he said.“I can safely say that our food is better than a slightly soggy takeaway pizza and far more nutritious and far better for you.”He suggested the range, which also includes duck confit and salmon wellington filled with a sashimi-grade fillet, could be “spot on for some Christmas celebrations” and if the range is well received there could be more options on the way.Bigham said the squeeze on household budgets had been “slightly overstated” and certain consumers, who have had recent pay rises, had more money to spend.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has struggled to get the economy moving quickly this year, and consumers have facedrising grocery pricesand high energy bills, putting pressure on spending.Bigham said: “We’re talking ourselves into everybody feeling poorer, and actually, the facts would suggest maybe otherwise.”View image in fullscreenConfit duck is also included in the five-option range.Speaking over video call from his colourful living room, Bigham said UK consumers were “waking up to the fact that making food cheaper has consequences” both for the environment and health. “Facing into these issues does cost a bit more but it’s worth it,” he said.“I’m not one of those doom and gloom merchants. I know awful things are happening in the world and we are in an unpredictable place but luckily we have the joy of food.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sales rose 8.8% to £144.3m in the year to 31 August 2024, when pre-tax profits rose more than a third to £7.7m. Shareholders led by Bigham himself paid themselves a £2.3m dividend, up from £2m a year earlier.In the year to the end of August 2025, growth has been stronger again with sales up more than 14%.“There’s still lots of people who’ve never tried our food. So we’re in the foothills,” Bigham said. In times of instability shoppers wanted value for money and that could take many forms, he added.Bigham was coy about whether the brand would have to put up prices again – amid rising meat, fish, labour and packaging costs, but said: “We hate putting prices up, because consumers don’t like it. However, if our costs go up, then we kind of have a choice: we can either … salami the quality off a bit and say, let’s scrimp and save, or we have to pass on those increases.”Newtaxes on packaginghave hit the business, which uses eco-friendly wood-based cartons that are compostable rather than recyclable.However, he is supportive of the idea in general, saying businesses were thinking “very carefully” about how to use recyclable materials.On wider taxes, Bigham said businesses recognised Reeves had afinancial hole that needed to be filledand the main fear before the 26 November budget was that the government “might choose the wrong taxes to put up”.Bigham, 58, is annoyed about changes to inheritance tax on family businesses. He said “these businesses are the engine of growth in the economy” and were facing a tax that does not apply to corporate equivalents.Bigham, who has four children, said last year he had no plans to sell up or cede control of the business.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

However, the exemption had been criticised for enabling the rapid growth of cheap imports from China via Shein and Temu.Income tax paid by the group remained steady at about $188m, although that included $6.1m deferred and adjusted tax relating to prior years.Shein’s UK arm has beenaccused of transferring the “vast bulk of income”to its Singaporean parent to cut its British tax bill.The company paid £9.6m in corporation tax in the UK despite making £2bn in sales last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His second long-player, Voodoo, reached No 1 in the US and his third and final album, Black Messiah, also made it into the Top 10, with both releases winning two of his four Grammys.D’Angelo was born Michael Archer in Richmond,Virginia, to Luther Archer, a Pentecostal minister, and his wife, Mariann (nee Smith). A talented pianist and singer from an early age, he learned his music in the church, and in his teens put himself on the map by winning three consecutive amateur talent night contests at the Apollo theatre in Harlem, New York.He also played in a series of groups in the Richmond area, including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly But Unique (IDU).By 1993 he had been signed up as a songwriter with EMI, for whom he composed U Will Know, a charity single addressing black-on-black violence that was released in 1994 by the supergroup Black Men United (includingLenny Kravitz, R Kelly and members of Boyz II Men), and made the Top 30 on both sides of the Atlantic.His platinum-selling Brown Sugar album – under the new name of D’Angelo, which he had derived from Michelangelo – appeared the following year, peaking at No 22 in the US charts and spawning two Top 30 hit singles in the US with the title track (“an ode to marijuana disguised as a love song”) and Lady. In 1998 he appeared on another landmark neo-soul album, Lauryn Hill’s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, singing and playing electric piano on Nothing Even Matters.View image in fullscreenD’Angelo playing in Manchester, Tennessee, in 2015.Photograph: FilmMagicThanks to a long spell of writer’s block – allied to his obsessive nature in the studio – it was not until 2000 that D’Angelo’s follow-up album, Voodoo, was released. But the final product, with a more experimental, darker feel and honed in collaboration with the Soulquarians musical collective – which included the drummer-producer Questlove, and occasional vocal collaborators Erykah Badu and Mos Def – was worth the wait. Described by Variety magazine as “a cornerstone of modern R&B” and listed at 28 in Rolling Stone magazine’s 500 greatest albums, it was a critical triumph, topping the US charts and peaking at No 21 in the UK.Five singles were spun off from Voodoo, but despite the album’s success only one of them,Untitled (How Does It Feel), reached the Top 30 of the US charts, partly on the back of a highly eroticised accompanying video that D’Angelo later came to regret, feeling that it cast him in many eyes as just a sex symbol. The image stuck, despite the song winning a Grammy.After touring with Voodoo worldwide for more than a year following its release, D’Angelo fell into a long period of alcohol and drug abuse that resulted in an even longer gestation period for his final album, Black Messiah (2014), which took more than a decade to take shape.Nonetheless, he still had many fans in waiting, and the album was another critical and commercial success, shooting to No 5 in the US on its release, also making it into the Top 50 in the UK. Rolling Stone rated the Grammy-winning album “a warm, expansive masterpiece” whilePaul Lester in the Guardian called it“a restatement of faith in the principles and sounds of the pre-digital era of black music”. The first single from it, Really Love, earned D’Angelo his fourth Grammy.Apart from a one-off single, Unshaken, in 2019, however, there were to be no further releases from the star. Although there was occasional talk of another album in the offing, he became increasingly reclusive across his final years, and the American public’s main awareness of him came largely through occasional live appearances or guest recording slots with other artists, including alongside Jay-Z last year on the song I Want You Forever from the soundtrack to the 2023 film The Book of Clarence.The American music journalist Sheldon Pearce noted that there seemed to be “a clear disconnect between D’Angelo’s compulsion to be heard and his reluctance to be seen” – an internal tug-of war that resulted in much of his material either failing to make it into the public domain or languishing for years until it emerged.D’Angelo himself rejected categorisation. “I never claimed I do neo-soul,”he said in 2014. “When I first came out, I used to always say, ‘I do black music. I make black music.’”He is survived by three children, Michael, Imani and Morocco, the first of whom was from a relationship with the singerAngie Stone, who died earlier this year, and with whom he had also collaborated musically.D’Angelo (Michael Eugene Archer), singer and songwriter, born 11 February 1974; died 14 October 2025Explore more on these topicsSoulR&BVirginiaLauryn HillLenny KravitzobituariesShareReuse this content"

Likely inspired by New Age theories, he urged expectant mothers to dip in the ice-cold water of the Black Sea, commune with dolphins, and give birth underwater. In the “very near future,” he claimed, “a newborn child would be able to live in the ocean with a pod of dolphins and feed on dolphin milk”.The oddest thing about Charkovsky was not so much his theory, but its remarkable resilience within both Soviet and western culture, as Justin Gregg sets out in his illuminating and lively new book. Gregg’s work is both a dissection and an ode to the irresistible allure of anthropomorphism, our tendency to apply human characteristics to non-humans, whether animals, objects, AI, or God. An expert on animal cognition who also teaches improv, Gregg deftly guides us through our alternately charming, destructive and wrong-headed fantasies about everything from marine mammals to our iPhones.A guiding spirit of this book is 17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon: “Human understanding,” he wrote, “is like a false mirror which receives light irregularly, then distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.” And how distorted and discoloured is this mirror, less faithful reflection of a dolphin, dog or computer, than a warped looking-glass at a carnival.Anthropomorphism has long been a dirty word amongst those who study animal behaviour, but Gregg sees it as a positive forceGregg introduces us to dog owners who insert “neuticles”, prosthetic testicular implants, into their neutered pet to relieve them of the shame of castration. This is a purely Freudian drama; the UK’s Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons’ line is that silicone implants offer no benefit to a dog whatsoever. I scoffed at these passages, until Gregg moved on to our assumptions about cats, where I have more skin in the game. So enmeshed is my own cat within my family’s psychodrama that Gregg’s gentle questioning of the realities of feline cognition left me unmoored. We are all, one way or another, clinging to the anthropomorphism game, imagining our pets’ inner thoughts, naming our cars, gendering God; if Charkovsky was deranged, it was only a question of degree.Anthropomorphism has long been a dirty word among those who study animal behaviour, but Gregg sees it as a positive force if used reflectively. The late primatologist Jane Goodall, for instance, urged its judicious use. “Just because you feel that an animal has a humanlike characteristic you cannot assume that is the case,” she argued. “Intuition alone is not enough – but it is a wonderful basis for further questioning, testing, and ultimately proving yourself right or wrong.”Some of Gregg’s case studies point in the other direction, showing how our projections cause catastrophe. In 1977, Nippon Animation released Rascal Racoon, an anime TV series that depicted a young boy’s idealised relationship with a raccoon in the American midwest. The series prompted the Japanese to import thousands of raccoons as pets, not knowing that adults can bite and, when bored, will easily tear up a small flat. Nearly 50 years on, there are few raccoon pets left, but many living in the countryside, feasting freely on native species like salamanders and crayfish.I valued this book most when it touched on Gregg’s area of expertise, non-human cognition. His stories repeatedly surprised and enlightened me, overturning my assumptions about other species, particularly reptiles. He cites research into crocodilians which demonstrates their capacity for play and social relationships; through subtle shifts in perspective and focus one could reimagine these staple villains of wildlife documentaries as playful, albeit from the safety of dry land.When in doubt as to whether a non-human animal possesses consciousness, Gregg urges a kind of Pascalian logic: better to assume a spider can feel suffering rather than deny it and risk harm. He draws a firm line between animals and the large language models that power tools like ChatGPT – the latter cannot be said to possess anything resembling consciousness, which is biologically rooted. (Given this position, I might gently question his repeated use of “hard wired” in relation to the human brain; as Siri Hustvedt has noted, such metaphors do not help us understand how our minds are different from machines.)It’s a strange irony that, as we discover more about the workings of other minds, our tendency to cast our dreams on to them does not diminish. For Gregg, anthropomorphism is a function of separation (it makes little sense, he argues, to invoke anthropomorphism in relation to some indigenous cultures where wild animals and humans are regarded as being of the same blood). If separation can be measured by the diminishment of wild species, or the hours we spend online and alone, then truly ours is the age of anthropomorphism. Charkovsky has not yet had his day in the sun.Humanish: How Anthropomorphism Makes Us Smart, Weird and Delusional by Justin Gregg is published by Oneworld (£18.99).

But even though it’s hard to watch for long, it’s a humbling reminder of who we areStuart HeritageWed 15 Oct 2025 07.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 07.30 EDTShareIrealise that, at this point, there are already far too many shows. Every channel, every streaming service is teeming with content demanding your attention, and there are simply too few hours in the day to watch them all. However, with that in mind, may I recommend a new show calledSpaceLive? There’s only one episode. The only potential downside is that the episode literally lasts for ever.Actually, that’s inaccurate. Space Live isn’t a show, it’s a channel. It launched on Wednesday morning, tucked away on ITVX, and consists only of live footage of Earth broadcast from theInternational Space Station. It’s beguiling to watch, especially for anyone who didn’t realise that a person can be awestruck and bored simultaneously.It’s billed as a world first. ITV has partnered with British space media company Sen to use live 4K footage from its proprietary SpaceTV-1 video camera system, mounted on the International Space Station, giving us three camera views: one of the station’s docking ports, a horizon view able to show sunrises and storms, and a camera pointing straight down as the ISS passes across the planet. A tracker in the corner of the screen shows the live location of the ISS, while a real-time AI information feed provides facts about our geography and weather systems.View image in fullscreenSpace Live’s footage is a significant improvement on Nasa’s.Photograph: ITVOf course, if you wanted to be picky, you could argue it isn’t exactly new. Nasa’s YouTube channel has been streaming live footage from the ISS for years, and uniformly draws an audience of a few thousand. But Space Live is, if nothing else, slightly snazzier. The footage is certainly nicer: at 8.30am on Wednesday, Space Live showed gorgeous images of the sun’s glare bouncing off the sea around the Bay of Biscay, while allNasacould offer was a piece of cloth with the word “Flap” written on it. There’s even a soundtrack, a constant, soothing kind of hold music that loops and loops without ever becoming fully annoying. It’s an improvement, in other words.And, at least for the first orbit, it is absolutely spellbinding. While not quite offering the overview effect – the cognitive shift felt by those who see Earth from space, leading to new perspectives about humanity and its place in the universe – it is still extremely humbling to see just how small the planet is. The time it took for the ISS to pass from south-east England (where I am) to war-ravaged Ukraine could be counted in seconds. And then on, over Asia towards Australia. There really is very little separating us at all.Inevitably, as the station crosses the Earth, drifting endlessly between sunrise and sunset, your thoughts shift towards people you know from wherever it happens to be. There’s something palpably comforting about that.However, God knows you can’t be awestruck for ever. And so it is with Space Live. Eventually the magic of the technology and the perspective and the beauty of our planet starts to wear off, and the experience becomes something akin to the map you end up staring at on a flight when you’ve run out of films to watch. Your attention starts to stray, and you realise that ITVX has other live channels to watch. One of them just shows Love Island. Another just shows Christmas films. And then you realise, with a slump, that the majesty of the only home we’ll ever know spinning silently in space has become just another content option, along with whichever ITV channel shows American Ninja Warrior Junior.View image in fullscreenThe views are simultaneously awe-inspiring and comforting.Photograph: ITVBut even though you won’t watch it all the time, it’s nice to know that Space Live is there. It isn’t the sort of thing you’d imagine they’d stick on the big screen in pubs – not unless people really start getting into going “Weeeeeey” every time they see the Ural River – but as something to have on in the background, it’s undeniably soothing. My guess is, for a dedicated few, the channel will be something they’ll keep on silently as they go about their day.And, sure, that might not be why humanity first chose to embark upon the miraculous achievement of escaping the surly bonds of Earth – you’ll remember that Neil Armstrong pointedly did not say, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for the screensaver industry” – but, as an idea, Space Live can’t be faulted. I might not have it on all the time but, whenever I need to be reminded of who we are and how little separates us, I guarantee it will be my first port of call.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionInternational Space StationSpaceLivestreamingNasafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor and the rock star walked on separately, but to the same clip of entrance music: the opening lines of Atlantic City, from Springsteen’s 1982 album Nebraska.It is, after all, the making of this record that provides the focus for Scott Cooper’s new filmDeliver Me From Nowhere, that sees White cast as Springsteen at a critical moment in the singer’s life and career. Much of the evening’s conversation, steered by Edith Bowman, focused on the intricate process of becoming Bruce, and the unavoidable peculiarity of art meeting life.Springsteen – throughout, a portrait of reptilian poise – spoke of first sighting White during a sound check at Wembley Stadium, in the summer of 2024. “Jeremy was wearing all white, so he was easy to spot,” he recalled. “I just kind of waved him to the stage and we said hi.” White was already well steeped in Springsteen’s music, had watched hours of concert footage, and read a glut of interviews and biographies. The Wembley show was an opportunity for a greater understanding of Springsteen as a live performer, and to discuss some of the specifics of the Nebraska period with the singer himself. Springsteen recalled bracing himself for an interrogation that did not come: “I thought this guy is really gonna be interested inme…” he said. In the end, however, “Jeremy was so prepared, he really asked very few questions.”It was an intimidating role to take on, White said. He referred repeatedly to the sheer weight of Springsteen information available, the amount of learning he had to take on, and spoke of “the pressure I was putting on myself. Bruce called it ‘focus’. I called it ‘anxiety that hardened, maybe, into focus.’”View image in fullscreen‘A lot of energy was going into the musical component of the film’ … Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen in Deliver Me From Nowhere.Photograph: Macall Polay/20th Century StudiosFor all the learning he undertook, it was through the music itself that he really connected to the part. “A lot of my energy was going into the musical component of the film,” he said. “[Scott] wanted me to sing and play the guitar, and I said, ‘I don’t do those things … are you sure?’” Cooper was adamant. White duly recorded his own versions of Springsteen’s songs. “I remember being in Nashville, at RCA [studio], in the booth, singing Nebraska, and finding some confidence … feeling close to Bruce, in a way,” he said. “When you’re reading a great script, your job is very easy,” he said. “And when you’re reading Bruce’s lyrics, it’s the same. Everything’s right there.”Springsteen also sent White a 1955 Gibson J-200 – the closest he could find to the guitar used for Nebraska, and “just about the nicest guitar you can learn on,” White says. He began guitar lessons, via Zoom, with session player JD Simo. “Hey, I’m so excited to learn guitar with you,” White recalled saying on their first meeting. “We don’t have time to learn the guitar,” Simo replied. “We have time to learn these five Bruce songs.”View image in fullscreenJeremy Allen White and Bruce Springsteen on the set of Deliver Me From Nowhere in 2024.Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesSpringsteen’s own feelings about the film were initially less complicated. “I figured I’m 76 years old, I don’t really care what the fuck I do any more,” he said. “Yeah, go ahead. At my age you take more risks, in your work and in your life in general.” It helped that Cooper was “a real blue-collar film-maker” making “the kind of film I would be interested in,” he said. “Not your standard musical biopic, but more of a character-driven drama with music.”As the project gathered pace, it perhaps became stranger. Springsteen visited the set often, apologising to White each time he made an appearance. “It’s gotta be really weird with the guy’s stupid ass standing there,” he said. But he liked what he saw: “I’ve said this before, but I kept thinking ‘Damn, when did I get that good-looking?’” In the seat beside him, White wags his finger and shakes his head.Springsteen had few doubts about White’s casting; he knew that the actor was equipped to portray the most introspective time in his recording career. “I’d watchedThe Bear, and how the camera followed his internal life,” he said. “And if you see him in a film, it’s a cliche, but he’s a rock star.”When he first saw White playing him, he was struck by the actor’s approach. “His performance was totally from the inside out, not just picking elements and wearing them like clothes,” he said. “It’s a non-imitative performance, but somehow it greatly relates to my story and myself.” He saw it as something akin to his own approach to songwriting – to writing about people whose lives differ so greatly from his own. “You have to find the part of them that is part of you.”More unsettling was the way the film forced him to revisit difficult periods in his own life. The recreation of his grandparents’ home in Freehold, New Jersey – a house he once described as “the greatest and saddest sanctuary I’ve ever known” was uncanny; Springsteen described how often he visited the home in his dreams. “So, to be in that house again … it was quite a miracle, and quite wonderful.”Similarly, it was “a very powerful thing” to seeStephen Graham as his father– capturing his volatile early years, when he suffered undiagnosed mental health issues and drank heavily, and the vulnerability and sweetness of his later years.Bossing it! The makers of Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere on turning Jeremy Allen White into the rock iconRead moreSpringsteen told of watching an early screening in the company of his sister, who held his hand throughout. Just a year younger than her brother, “she remembered everything”. At the end, she turned to him and said: “Isn’t it wonderful that we have that?”There was an echo, perhaps, of the feeling Springsteen hopes to give his own audiences through his live shows. “You create an ideal world for three hours,” he told the small crowd before him last night. “It’s not a fantasy world. It’s a very credible world. It has all the wonderful and terrible parts of life … But hopefully there’s an element of transcendence that my audience takes with them. And hopefully it stays with them for as long as they need it.”Legend: The Bruce Springsteen Story, presented by Laura Bartonis available on BBC SoundsExplore more on these topicsSpringsteen: Deliver Me from NowhereJeremy Allen WhiteBruce SpringsteenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Screenwriter Rowan Joffe adapts the 2014 novel by Lawrence Osborne, whose title is ironic. He would not have these problems if he really was a small player. He is a big player and a big loser, although his smallness comes through in other ways.Colin Farrell plays a professional gambler who styles himself “Lord Doyle”, adrift in the Chinese gambling mecca of Macau, the Asian Vegas; he is a despised “gweilo” or foreign ghost. Farrell shows us a seedy guy with an outrageously spivvy moustache and a flop sweat, running up a massive bill at the kind of five-star establishment which tolerates this sort of thing on the tacit understanding that the guest will bet and lose massively at the hotel casino. Doyle never lets the staff in to clean his room so wakes up hungover every morning in an accumulating chaos.One night, while waiting for his unlucky streak to end at the baccarat table, Doyle encounters the coolly charismatic Dao Ming (Fala Chen), one of the unofficial “brokers” or moneylenders who haunt the tables. Their transaction is calamitous, and yet Doyle prevents Dao Ming from being beaten up by the widow of a gambler she has driven to suicide. They become friends, or even spiritual lovers, an affair between two phantoms – but in having a certain mysterious number, Doyle has – ambiguously – been given the means of his own redemption or destruction, forced to confront his own destiny as a “hungry ghost”, always gobbling and never sated.It is an elegant and intriguing contrivance, althoughTilda Swintonhas a frankly preposterous part as Betty, a cartoony woman who is pursuing Doyle and knows his terrible secret back in the UK; her character and plot-purpose are neither convincing in any realist sense or particularly funny. Perhaps it would have been better to develop Dao Ming’s persona instead.Berger and his cinematographer James Friend charge the screen with florid panoramas ofMacauand its hazy waterfront, and also with exotic, sinister interiors; the world of the hotels, with their synthesised grandeur and cavernous spaces where anonymity is liberating and oppressive. It’s a movie of big moods and grand gestures, undercut by the banal inevitability of losing.Ballad of a Small Player is in cinemas from 17 October and on Netflix from 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsColin FarrellTilda SwintonChinaMacaureviewsShareReuse this content"

What made Brown Sugar such a seismic jolt in the 1990s R&B landscape though was its smouldering sensuality laced with undercurrents of hip-hop’s don’t-give-a-damnedness; studious, devoted instrumentality; and an infectious commitment to the art of the infinite jam. Lady is the sister, so to speak, to the title track of D’Angelo’s audacious debut album. And whereas the latter introduced listeners to a hood Romeo on the make, Lady revels in the pleasures of a lover who’s already won the chase and whose twinned passion for intimacy and privacy takes the form of a thick, bass heavy, groove recitation. Behold the birth of neo-soul.Higher (1995)Leave it to D’Angelo, that rigorous forever-student of Black music history to close out his first album with a track that flaunts its sacred-meets-profane, pulpit-meets-the-juke-joint sensibilities. Higher fuses Sunday morning modern gospel iridescence with light bedroom innuendo (“‘Cause you take me higher / Further than the stars above / Send me in ecstasy, baby / With your love, with your love”). But its emphasis on the declaration of epic, cosmic love, Bowie-esque “Heroes” love, the kind in which you “put your hands into mine … and then we’ll take off to the skies above” – with the help of that soaring Hammond B3 organ – is proof that even on his earliest record, D’Angelo was interested in imagining Black love as not just a form of escape but as a kind of mobile shelter, monumental in scope and intensely divine. And like so many of Brown Sugar’s tracks, it reminded us of the precious and singular power of the soul falsetto. In the midst of an era ruled by hip-hop MCs and showmen producers, it doubled-down on the virtuosities of Black male vocality, treating it like the prodigal son, crown jewel star of pop we had always known it to be. Here, then, was the architect of Black Gen X sonic feeling and eloquence.Devil’s Pie (2000)From his first masterpiece, Voodoo, Devil’s Pie is, arguably, the dark and intricate sequel to Lauryn Hill’s Lost Ones, her hip-hop sermon-on-the-mount directed at ex-lovers and fellow MCs felled by the materialism of the game. In both form and content, Devil’s Pie swings even harder than Hill’s judgment jam with its sparse, pounding rhythm section, its haunting, gradually stacked vocals, and its horror film imagery. He plunges us into a Walking Dead universe of ravenous zombies, all clambering for a slice after slice of the whole “pie”, the whole racial capitalist laundry list of goods and vices: “greed and lust, jealousy, envious / Bread and dough, cheddar cheese / Flash and stash, cash and cream …” D’Angelo, himself, likened Devil’s Pie to “a blues song” with vocals inspired by the sound of a “chain gang … or like the feel of … the field slaves … picking whatever the fuck the master had us picking”. His indictment is stone-cold daring as it turns an eye towards the nightmares of systemic failure as well as our own. “Ain’t no justice,” D’Angelo declares, “it’s just us …”Untitled (How Does It Feel) (2000)Yes, it’s one of the greatest tributes ever to D’Angelo’s all-time hero Prince. Sonically and sexually, Untitled radiates with the Purple One’s masterful grammar of tenderness, his irresistible alchemy of masculine eros and feminine intimacy. But it also takes those elements of his majesty’s repertoire and turns them out, so to speak. Though its hotter-than-July accompanying video is the first thing you might remember about this song, the last thing you’ll hold on to is surely the way Untitled makes youfeel, how it seduces you into contemplating the wonder and the glory of a slow-burning, coital journey unfolding in real time, how it makes you believe in the possibility of being taken by a songandan artist who wants nothing more than for you to surrender to slow-rolling, woman-centred, orgasmic energy. One of the greatest works of pop music eroticism ever recorded.View image in fullscreenD’Angelo at Bonnaroo festival in 2012.Photograph: Mediapunch/ShutterstockAfrica (2000)Post-civil rights-era pop has its share of stirring lullabies and love songs to artists’ children. It’s a sub-genre that thrives on often weaving together some combination of historical, Biblical or geographical images that frame the conditions of a newborn’s arrival and the legacies that promise to supply this golden child with succour and survival. Think Stevie’s Isn’t She Lovely?, Lauryn Hill’s To Zion or Beyoncé’s Bigger, the latter of which seems to take direct inspiration from D’Angelo’s Africa. Born Michael Eugene Archer, D’Angelo shared a son, Michael Jr, with the equally formidable, powerhouse neo-soul singer Angie Stone who, in a sorrowful twist of fate, died earlier this year as a result of car crash injuries. Africa is a message from father to son, delicate like an ocean’s breeze, gently rolling like a river over Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s steady percussion. It is a love song born out of diasporic inheritance (“Africa is my descent”), a recognition of the scale of a people’s past (“from kings and queens becomes a prince”) and an embrace of fatherhood’s restorative humility (“I receive the love that radiates from your glow”).Ain’t That Easy (2014)The drought between one gamechanging record and the next for D’Angelo ended in the early weeks of winter 2014 when the album Black Messiah dropped. If the dawn of the Black Lives Matter era featured a cluster of brilliant and incisive works by artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Solange and Beyoncé, D’Angelo’s entry was its own astonishing revelation. Its opening track, Ain’t That Easy is signature D’Angelo with its neo-soul wall-of-sound bass and percussive density. We are swept into the world of lovers at odds with each other, dropped into a relationship on the verge of falling apart, but D wants us to lean into the struggle with him. “You can’t leave me / ain’t that easy …” At the end of a long year of Black folks taking to the streets and fighting for recognition of their full humanity, fighting to not be abandoned by their country, Ain’t That Easy bristles with metaphorical electricity as it recalls James Baldwin’s argument in The Fire Next Time: “If we – and now I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others – do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world …” No easy task.The Charade (2014)Black Messiah’s gut-punch of a track. Think George Benson’s cover of Leon Russell’s This Masquerade, sped up and drenched in political fire. If that 1976 classic emerged as a kind of ironic post-civil rights ballad for Black Americans living in the wake of freedom struggle advances and, likewise, witnessing gradual backlash (“are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?” croons Benson), The Charade turns up the volume on the shibboleths of racial equality in America. We are “crawling through a systematic maze” with D and his furiously tight ensemble, The Vanguard. Soaked in Prince, Hendrix and Sly sonic references, The Charade rips the Band-Aid off and thrives on second-person questioning, witnessing and confrontation (“Degradation so loud that you can’t hear the sound of our cries …”). With the murder of Michael Brown and countless others fresh on our minds and in our hearts, 2014 D’Angelo returned to the scene to call it like he saw it: “All we wanted was a chance to talk / ‘Stead we only got outlined in chalk”. A tornado of a song whose live rendition on Saturday Night Live rocked the foundations of late night TV, offering the fierce musical antidote to anti-blackness.Really Love (2014)He’ll always be a loveranda fighter. Black Messiah’s grand romance track, Really Love, wears its cinematic ambitions on its sleeves with spoken word opening verses delivered in Spanish by Boricua artist Gina Figueroa. Cue the swirling strings and let Figueroa do her thing with a short, biting monologue (“Yeah, you love me? I love you very much … I did not want to fight you. I only wanted to love you. But you are very jealous”). The greatest falsetto singer of his generation is all about the determined serenade here, taking the playful sensual route to win this woman back into his arms with Latin guitar licks creating a delicate tapestry for our suitor. With dashes of melodrama and romcom energy, Really Love conjures the spirit of Prince on any one of his please baby, baby, please, you’re-so-hard-to-get anthems, delighting in the act of supplication; D’Angelo, like his idol, knows how to turn tender passivity into blue flirtation.Prayer (2014)In an era when we were hungry for anthems (Alright, Freedom, Don’t Touch My Hair), D’Angelo turned the concept of the anthem on its head with Prayer, a swamp groove holy revival, a dense odyssey that takes us to the centre of our struggle to survive and persevere; a cathartic, slow-tempo P-Funk exorcism of our long, trans-generational fight to be free. D wills us forward like a lowdown preacher in call-and response mode with a “Lord have mercy” blues guitar lick as his foil. He sees “the devil on your feet” and knows “that he will … try to stop you / From seeing your days / But you got to pray all the way”. The time is now, and the ominous chimes on this track tell us so. This is Black exhortation from the pulpit delivered in the club, chanted on the front lines, crooned from the lip of the stage. It is prayer come to life in full force, percussive strength, beat out in hand claps and a stomping resolve. It’s a slow-moving step show for the movement, the church service, the party. It’s Black hope, faith and resistance made manifest in the form of sonic spiritual rebellion.Lauryn Hill – Nothing Even Matters (ft D’Angelo) (1998)How does one measure tenderness? Lauryn Hill and D’Angelo showed us the way on one of the great duets of the 1990s – great in its use of “quiet,” this expressive mode that the Black studies scholar Kevin Quashie defines as, in part, a sign of a potentially “dynamic and ravishing” interior. Hill and D’Angelo build a fortress of quiet as they take in one another and let everything around them fall away. “Your love makes me feel 10 feet tall / Without it I’d go through withdrawal / ’Cause nothing even matters at all”, sings D’Angelo while his shared warmth with Hill fills up the spare, intimate spaces in the song. Encircled by finger snaps, a poignant guitar, a gentle rhythm section that gives these two titans room to breathe, they take each other in. “These buildings could drift out to sea / Some natural catastrophe / Still there’s no place I’d rather be / ’Cause nothing even matters to me”, adds Hill. You want these two in a Barry Jenkins romance with the cameras spinning all around them. You want to lose yourself in this Black love that is salvation itself. Signature D’Angelo alongside his neo-soul genius peer: how we wish that we could hold this scene for ever.Bonus tracks: the D’Angelo cover versionsD’Angelo – Cruisin’ (Smokey Robinson cover)D’Angelo, Femi Kuti, Macy Gray, Roy Hargrove, the Soultronics and Positive Force – Water No Get Enemy (Fela Kuti cover)D’Angelo – Can’t Hide Love (Live at the Jazz Cafe, London, 1995) Earth Wind & Fire cover)D’Angelo – She’s Always in My Hair (Prince cover)D’Angelo with Princess (Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum) – Sometimes It Snows in April (Prince cover)D’Angelo and Erykah Badu – Your Precious Love (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell cover)And one more D’Angelo-related favouriteRoman GianArthur – OK Lady (EP with mashed-up covers of Radiohead and D’Angelo tracks)Explore more on these topicsMusicD'AngeloSoulR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the first five minutes or so, the musicians played his String Quartet No 15 in D Minor exactly as it was written until, suddenly, the conductor began acting like the host of a bingo game by throwing a six-sided die, with each side representing a particular player.“Two,” the conductor cried, before pointing at the second violinist, who immediately stopped what she was performing and began to play her part in the piece back from the start, while the others soldiered on through the score. “Four,” the conductor called after his next toss, pointing at the cellist who, likewise, went back to the beginning of his part, in the process establishing a pattern of calls and restarts that continued for the next 25 minutes. Amid the unfolding drama, one of the world’s most well-worn classical works was twisted into something strangely fresh, resulting in not so much a deconstruction of Mozart’s work as a reformation of it, with each component treated like a separate piece in a bold new puzzle.‘We’re ripping ourselves to shreds’: with dance music bitterly divided, how far should cultural boycotts go?Read more“At one point, the sonata started to sound like something by Bartók,” said Stephen Prina, the musician-slash-artist who created this wild riff on the master. “At another, it started to sound like Shostakovich! It just kept changing.”The result, says Prina, “plays with the relationship between the familiar and the unfamiliar. What do you have to do to something that’s familiar to render it so unfamiliar that you can exact a different relationship with it? How do you take works that are on a pedestal and listen to them again instead of simply revering them?”Prina has been posing questions like that in his work for five decades now, using a broad array of forms to do so, including visual art, music, dance, film and spoken word. The music in his pieces draws from the worlds of classical music, movie scores, rock, pop and folk, repositioning works by guitar bands (like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Sonic Youth), singer-songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens and Odetta), and composers (Beethoven, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg). Distinctions between “high” and “low” are a mirage to him. The most enduring of Prina’s sources sit comfortably next to fleeting cultural blips such as Who Let the Dogs Out?View image in fullscreenStephen Prina’s accordion.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and PetzelNow, for the first time, the full range of Prina’s music-based pieces are on display at MoMA in a retrospective titled A Lick and A Promise. The title echoes an antique phrase that means a job hastily done. In fact, Prina’s works couldn’t be more thoughtfully planned. He chose the title because “big survey or retrospective shows can be intimidating for an audience – and for an artist”, he said. “I felt it needed a modicum of self-deprecation.”That element in his work might not be obvious to everyone, given the density of ideas on display and the sometimes arch construction of his pieces. At the same time, Prina took it as a compliment when a friend recently described one of his string works as “hilarious”. “I’m all for instilling more playfulness in things,” he said, “especially in the domain of art.”In fact, play is central to his work, which commonly involves reinventions of pre-existing pieces. All of the works and performances in the MoMA retrospective involve some act of appropriation. Even the element of chance he introduced to his Mozart-based piece was borrowed, in this case from one of his heroes, John Cage, who memorably composed pieces that involved a throw of the I Ching wands. For Prina, allusions to other works aren’t just inevitable but illuminating. “Every artwork is an act of cultural appropriation whether the artist intends it or not,” he declared. “Unfortunately, a lot of people are gunning to demote any act of appropriation as not being ‘original’. In fact, there are no original thoughts. Nothing happens in a vacuum.”Instead, he sees his work “as seizing upon a cultural product that’s already in circulation in the culture. Then I treat it in some way and re-release back into the culture,” he said. “I feel that connects me to something bigger than the relatively autonomous world of the art object.”According to the curator of the retrospective, Stuart Comer, one of the reasons MoMA wanted to mount the show to begin with was because the museum had already showcased other artists who work intimately with appropriation, including Barbara Kruger, Louise Lawler and Christopher Williams. However, “most of those artists deal with photographic appropriation”, Comer said. “Prina is doing something really different by working with sound and music. More, he began doing so during the rise of hip-hop and sample culture, which connects his work to something broader.”Because Prina himself performs covers and original works in some of the presentations, he sometimes likens his work to performance art. Some critics have also tried to categorize him as a conceptual artist, a tag that makes him bristle. “I owe a big debt to that movement,” he said, “but I always like to say, ‘I’m too young for it.’” (He’s 70).View image in fullscreenMike Kelley, Anita Pace, Stephen Prina – Beat of the Traps, 1992. Performed 18 September 2025.Photograph: Maria Baranova / Museum of Modern Art, New YorkInstead, Prina prefers to label his art “post-conceptual”, an approach that uses ideas as a foundational part of the piece while elaborating them with the physical experience of the objects he creates or varies. The term “post-conceptual” came into use in the early 70s through the artist John Baldessari who taught at the California Institute of the Arts where Prina went to school in the 80s. Though Prina grew up in the small midwest town of Galesburg, Illinois, he was lucky enough to encounter avant-garde musical influences as a teenager when some local kids in his neighborhood began improbably roaming the streets reciting lyrics from Captain Beefheart songs. “I ended up being in bands with at least two of those people,” Prina said with a laugh.He studied music and art at Northern Illinois University before going to Cal Arts for his MFA. In the 1980s he taught at Artcenter College of Design in Pasadena where, in the 90s, he taught a class on Keanu Reeves, a move that would barely bat an eye in today’s academia where even Harvard offers a class on Taylor Swift. Back when Prina did it, though, pearls were clutched. “The Los Angeles Times accused me of being a primary agent in the deterioration of higher education,” he said. “Secretly, I found that flattering.”He began showing his work in museums during the 80s and started teaching at Harvard in 2004. (He recently retired from that post.) His Mozart piece, cheekily titled String Quartet for Six Players, conceived in 1976 when he was 21, represents the oldest of his works in the retrospective. One of the most elaborate, and certainly the loudest, piece, dating from 1992, called Beat of the Traps, focuses on the core of popular music – the beat. A multi-disciplinary piece, Beat comprises dance, spoken word monologues, live drummers and a performance by Prina of whatever song topped the Billboard chart that week.That last component references a separate piece he created that’s also on display at MoMA titled The Top Thirteen Singles from Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles Chart for the Week Ending September 11, 1993. For that piece, he tricked up a giant clock to chime on the hour with one of the top hits of that week, including songs by artists ranging from Janet Jackson to Soul Asylum. Prina calls the work “a monument to the ephemeral”, a description that nails one of pop’s central ironies. While pop can be fleeting – yesterday’s top hits might be forgotten tomorrow – it’s also eternal because, Prina said, “once something is out there in the culture, it’s always out there”.View image in fullscreenStephen Prina - The Top Thirteen Singles from Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles Chart for the Week Ending 11 September 1993.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New YorkComer thinks there’s a parallel between Prina’s use of Top 10 hits and MoMA’s mission. “Our identity is based on building the canon of modern art, which is like creating a Top 10,” he said. “At the same time, Stephen is playing with the idea of hierarchies to form an institutional critique through his work.”The monologues in Beat, written by Prina’s collaborator in the piece, the late artist and punk rocker Mike Kelley, were inspired by four of rock’s heaviest drummers – Keith Moon of the Who, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Paul Whaley of Blue Cheer and Mitch Miller of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The monologues, read by an actor, comprise disjointed elements of the drummers’ work and personae. “It’s almost as though you’re looking at the desktop of someone who’s doing research on rock music,” Prina said. “These are your notes before you commit to the final essay.”In the piece, the drummers play various patterns from the stars’ recordings, culminating in Bonham’s part from Led Zeppelin’s When the Levee Breaks. Only in this case, the drummers play a beat out of sync from each other and their snares have been tuned slightly differently. “I think that would drive John Bonham crazy,” Prina said with a laugh.Much like his Mozart piece, Beat takes elements of a canonized work and pulls them apart like strands of yarn from a sweater. The move means to make listeners more aware of every component of a classic, in the process encouraging closer listening. The result also has an element of protest by countering the age of social media, which has made us less attentive than ever. More, the mutations in the piece force listeners to take a more active role in the music as they try to make sense of its new shape. “Marcel Duchamp famously said that the artwork is not completed in the artist’s studio,” said Prina. “It’s complete when it meets the spectator.”To physicalize that point, the Mozart performance I caught featured a reprise in which the musicians repositioned themselves behind the audience where they took a second run at the piece. In puzzled reaction, the audience slowly began to turn their chairs around, making us virtual collaborators in the piece. Not that everyone always chooses to do so. In one instance, Prina said, an audience member wouldn’t turn his chair around and, so, wound up staring directly into the face of the person who had been in front of him. “It created a whole new drama!” the artist said.At one point during the Mozart performance, the conductor fumbled the die, sending it hurling towards the floor, in the process adding an extra level of randomness. “The conductor was mortified,” said Prina. “I was delighted!”Another key element in his pieces fosters rediscovery through the use of jarring juxtapositions. In his pieceSonic Dan, he brings together works by Sonic Youth and Steely Dan by performing covers from each. “People have asked me, incredulously ‘How do these things come together?’” Prina said. “I say, they come together inme.”Given the daunting number of allusions in his survey, it’s unlikely that any individual listener will get all of them. That doesn’t bother the artist in the least. “EvenIdon’t get all of my references,” Prina said. “I think that’s good. As a kid, I was always drawn to whatever I didn’t understand. Some people get angry at that, but I just thought, ‘what an interesting proposition?’ At the end of the day, isn’t that what all artwork is about? Each piece is a proposition on how to think and live in the world.”A Lick and A Promise continues at MoMA on New York through 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsMusicArtMuseum of Modern ArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps the less suited a person is to rule, the more urgently they feel the need for a companion, a favourite, who will ease their worries and provide their pleasures. James I of England was just such a monarch. Although he had an unshakeable faith in his right to rule, he required distraction from the heavy burden of state. Scholarship, including musing on the divine right of kings, was one of these escape routes; hunting and drunkenness, too; but his true solace, for nearly 10 years, was his beloved bedfellow, George Villiers, whom he raised from humble origins to become Duke of Buckingham.Buckingham has been relatively overlooked because his identity-bending role as James’s “sweet child and wife” rendered him somehow suspect. A man whose skills included dancing like a dream and looking marvellous on a horse was seen as less worthy of study than a minister of state, despite the decade-long role Buckingham would grow into as co-architect and implementer of Stuart policy. The fact that the issues that would tear the country apart when the civil wars began 14 years later had their roots in these policies only adds to his importance. This fabulous biography is long overdue.Historians need anthropological as well as psychological skills, and these Hughes-Hallett possesses in abundance, along with an easy, wry wit. Guiding us through Buckingham’s “entrancingly strange” netherworld, she strikes a delicate balance between exploring the attitudes of 17th-century society and keeping her feet firmly in the present day.Lucy Moore£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionIngenious cosy crime spoofThe Proof of My InnocenceJonathan CoeThe Proof of My InnocenceJonathan CoeIngenious cosy crime spoofWell, it worked for Richard Osman. Twenty-three-year-old Phyl, stuck in her parents’ house with an English degree and a zero-hours job in a sushi chain, is wondering how hard it could be to write a cosy crime novel. “Death in a Thatched Cottage? The Beach Hut Murders? The Flapjack Poisonings?” As another character points out, it’s bizarre that violent homicide has been rebranded as “cosy”. “It’s very British, in some indefinable way.”Jonathan Coe, the laureate of Britishness, sets his 15th novel against a particularly wobbly period of national history: the short-lived ascendancy of Liz Truss and the death of the Queen in autumn 2022. It is indeed a happily playful and nicely satisfying slice of cosy crime, scattered with clues and red herrings, locked‑room mysteries, teetering cliffhangers and stagily withheld information.There’s a lot going on, and Coe marshals it all with ingenious ease. As ever, the real target – the savagery behind the cosiness – is the amoral individualism and free-market greed of those with power and privilege, first excoriated in 1994’s What a Carve Up! Here, rightwingers gather at a country house hotel for the TrueCon conference, delighting in the elevation of Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. Alongside the culture war comedy of speeches such as “Britain’s Real Pandemic: The Woke Mind-Virus” is the serious business: big money jostling to get in on the carving up of the NHS.Coe enjoys himself satirising literary fashions, creative jealousy and the inevitable passing of time, with a bittersweet nostalgia for his own youth, when society was seduced by money, and the books world by Martin Amis’s Money. He gives himself a walk-on part in the Cambridge section as Tommy Cope, an ineffectual English student mainly known for writing incredibly bad poetry who later surprises his peers by achieving “modest success” with the “mildly satirical” Quite the Mash-Up.Coe’s subject may be inertia and nostalgia, but The Proof of My Innocence is full of energy. It’s a madcap caper, a sideways memoir, a tricksy jeu d’esprit that is also a quiet defence of fiction in a post-truth age, and enormous fun to read.Justine Jordan£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionHumanity’s futureUnder the Eye of the Big BirdHiromi KawakamiUnder the Eye of the Big BirdHiromi KawakamiHumanity’s futureIn Keepsakes, the opening section of Hiromi Kawakami’s haunting novel-in-stories, a woman describes her world. Although peaceful and orderly, it is an unsettling and strange place: people are made in factories from animal DNA, then live startlingly brief lives, growing to adulthood in a handful of years and often dying young. Memory, both personal and historical, is fragmentary and, in the case of memories of childhood, actively suppressed. Meanwhile, the society’s anxieties are focused on preserving the children the woman helps raise and the biological diversity they embody: as one of the characters declares, “If we lose the children, that’s the end of the world”.This spectre of genetic decline and extinction stalks all 14 of the stories that make up Under the Eye of the Big Bird. In one, men – now vanishingly rare due to their genetic fragility – are assigned to breed with particular women; although they “marry” them, the question of consent is never invoked. In another, one of the characters reflects that, “as a species, we simply don’t have what it takes”.Despite this thread the connection between the different stories is not clear at first. Instead, as they shift between characters and timeframes, each section seems to offer a glimpse of a new and newly nightmarish future. Gradually, however, a larger story begins to emerge. After a long period of falling population due to declining fertility, a last-ditch attempt has been made to save humanity by dividing us into separate communities, each under the supervision of “watchers”, raised and trained by AIs known as mothers. Within these communities “all reproductive taboos would be lifted” in the hope of jumpstarting human evolution by provoking “mutations on a far shorter timescale than in any previous evolutionary process”.In its final stages, Under the Eye of the Big Bird bends back on itself, suggesting that this far-flung future may also be the past, or at least that the ending it conjures may in fact be a new beginning. As it does so it offers a powerful corrective to the assumption of human primacy, instead reminding us that we are not the endpoint in the process of evolution, but simply one link in a much longer chain.James Bradley£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseScienceThe great biologist’s swansongThe Genetic Book of the DeadRichard DawkinsThe Genetic Book of the DeadRichard DawkinsThe great biologist’s swansongThe “dead” of this book’s title refers not to our long departed ancestors, whose ancient DNA scientists like me now scrutinise. Instead, it’s a metaphor for genes as artefacts of past organisms and their environments. As ever, Dawkins shines his light on the gene-centric view of evolution – it is not the individual, the population or even species that are the subject of selection, but these units of inheritance composed of DNA. He showcases the effects of nature’s genetic choices in mimicry, camouflage, predation, mating – all areas that have been very well covered elsewhere (not least by Dawkins himself). He does do it well, albeit with the tone of a Victorian gentleman naturalist. All life is in these pages, and by all, I mean almost exclusively cute animals, which make up a vanishingly tiny proportion of life on Earth, but have given us so many of the vital clues to the puzzle of evolution. Bower birds, horned lizards, naked mole rats, cuckoos, mossy frogs, owls and Tasmanian tigers and bears, oh my!This is a wonderful book in so many ways, but I didn’t love it, I think because my tastes in prose have evolved. It feels like the last instalment from a bygone era of grandiloquent science writing, one of which Dawkins was the doyen, the raconteur. It’s a greatest hits, or Dawkins by numbers, depending on your point of view.Adam Rutherford£13.49 (RRP £14.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA thrilling coda to an otherworldly trilogyAbsolutionJeff VanderMeerAbsolutionJeff VanderMeerA thrilling coda to an otherworldly trilogyTen years ago, Jeff VanderMeer published the three volumes of the Southern Reach trilogy, which between them charted the incursion of the otherworldly into a stretch of Florida coastland. In Annihilation, scientists venture into what has been dubbed “Area X” and quickly find themselves physically and psychologically transformed. Authority follows a middle manager who, in the wake of this mission’s failure, is dispatched by the shady “Central” to evaluate the people who have made studying Area X their life’s work. Acceptance jumps between timelines: the days preceding Area X’s creation, the weeks preceding the departure of the mission in Annihilation, and the aftermath of Authority, in which Area X breaks its bounds and seems set to transform the world.Absolution, the unlooked-for follow-up to the trilogy, seems at first glance like a series of outtakes from it, featuring familiar names and previously unknown backstory. Twenty years before the event that triggers Area X’s emergence, a scientific expedition – secretly bankrolled by Central – encounters harbingers of weirdness, such as the appearance of thousands of cannibalistic rabbits, and a mysterious figure dubbed the Rogue. And then 18 months before the event, a disgraced Central agent known as Old Jim is dispatched to the region to investigate the expedition’s failure and find the Rogue. A year after the event, that first expedition into the site is related to us in the drug-addled, profanity-laden voice of one Lowry, whom readers of Annihilation will recognise as the expedition’s sole survivor.Much of what made the original Southern Reach books powerful and disturbing can be found in this new volume. There is, however, a shift in Absolution’s focus, one that perhaps reflects the intervening decade of real-world events. The original Southern Reach books often featured grey bureaucrats attempting to quantify the indescribable. Absolution turns its attention to these bureaucrats, in the process revealing that they are not so grey. Central may in fact be a greater danger than Area X.Readers looking for a solution to Area X’s mysteries in Absolution will come away puzzled. The novel adds new information to our understanding of the site and its genesis, but also opens new questions, and leaves some dangling loose ends. What it does do is reinforce the original series’ contention – that the boundary between the uncanny and the familiar is more porous than we realise.Abigail Nussbaum£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoliticsThe Watergate veteran on Gaza, Ukraine and TrumpWarBob WoodwardWarBob WoodwardThe Watergate veteran on Gaza, Ukraine and TrumpBob Woodward is probably the best-known journalist in the world. He built his reputation on Watergate, of course, and just about everything he and Carl Bernstein wrote about it turned out to be entirely accurate: including the existence of Deep Throat, who was sometimes thought to be a “Woodstein” invention, but was much later revealed to be a top FBI official. If you talk to Woodward on deep background, he won’t break trust with you and leak your name; so hundreds of senior officials and politicians over the years have had the confidence to speak to him on condition of anonymity. In War, as in every other one of Woodward’s 22 books (this one billed as a “behind-the-scenes story of three wars – Ukraine, the Middle East and the struggle for the American Presidency”), you can have total faith in the accuracy of every quotation he provides.However, the problem with the book is that it simply reinforces everything we already know about Ukraine, Gaza, and the presidential campaign. I read War, which like all Woodward’s work is well-written, even a page-turner, without coming across a single thing that was a genuine surprise. We don’t need Woodward to tell us that the CIA and MI6 had complete knowledge of Putin’s plans for the invasion of Ukraine, because the two intelligence agencies made it absolutely plain at the time.Still, the fundamental verdict of War is a powerful one. Trump is “the wrong man for the country” and is unfit to lead it, Woodward says, magisterially. (In return, Trump calls Woodward a liar, and his spokesman has implausibly denied that most of the quotes in the book were genuine.) Yet here again there’s a problem. Woodward is no longer the impartial recipient of the confidences of hundreds of well-placed people across the spectrum; he has got his own strong views, and he wants to convince us they’re correct. The fly on the Oval Office wall has fluttered down and joined in the argument. Where does Woodward’s long, masterful, often mesmerising series of Washington insider books go after this?John Simpson£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA daringly old-fashioned novellaThe PartyTessa HadleyThe PartyTessa HadleyA daringly old-fashioned novellaTessa Hadley’s novella has an alluring opening line: “The party was in full swing.” Evelyn is following her glamorous older sister Moira to an ostentatiously unglamorous gathering in a docklands pub in postwar Bristol, where there’s “sawdust on the stone-flagged floor” and smoke-stained plaster walls “crowded with advertising for brands of beer and rum and tobacco which hadn’t existed for decades”. Hadley, usually a writer of bourgeois households, strong on gardens and antique furniture, has a good time with dereliction, adding memorably to the literature of urination when the sisters can’t find a loo. Evelyn has just started a BA in French and is working with sweet self-consciousness on her transformation into adulthood, hyper-aware of her clothes and manners and vocabulary in the way of a young adult changing class. Moira, studying fashion design at art school, seems – at least to Evelyn – more confident, more experienced, less interested in changing status.Evelyn meets people she knows at the party, her sister’s colourful friends and a smart and kind fellow student, Donald, whose niceness makes him unattractive to her but not to the reader. She asks him to buy her a drink to alleviate her disappointment with the evening: “I’m not talking to anybody,” she says to him, “or at least not anybody I actually like.” When he obliges, she abandons him: “she submerged herself effectively in the flamboyant, quarrelsome, ecstatic, flirting mass, drifting between different groups as if she were always on her way somewhere else”. Poor Donald. This is not a world in which a woman can buy her own drink.In some ways this is daringly old-fashioned writing, its forms as retrospective as the bombed city and prewar furniture. There’s an omniscient narrator, no trendy close-third here, and, as the quotations suggest, no coyness about adjectives. This novella isn’t a parable or a political fiction, as many recent short novels have been. It’s a pen portrait of a particular family in a particular time and place, quick and bright despite – or maybe, oddly, because of – the magnificently Victorian tendencies of the prose.Sarah Moss£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirFrom fish out of water to Hollywood starSonny BoyAl PacinoSonny BoyAl PacinoFrom fish out of water to Hollywood starAl Pacino, whose nickname “Sonny Boy” comes from the Al Jolson song of that title, begins this fine memoir in 1943 when he is three and his mother, Rose, a pretty, sensitive factory worker, starts smuggling him into the local picture house. Together they drink in the stories unspooling from the silver screen, doubly delicious since their own lives are so bleak. Rose’s impossibly handsome boy-husband has already skedaddled to another marriage and Rose has taken little Alfredo back to the South Bronx to live with her parents. Sonny delights in the role of provider and protector, buying his mother Kotex from the drugstore and shouting at the construction workers who dare to leer.Pacino’s account of New York’s postwar mean streets is startlingly cinematic. He introduces us to his gang of little toughs, kids called Cliffy, Bruce and Petey who bunk off school to play in the derelict allotments or fish in open sewers for anything shiny that they can sell for a dime. They can’t afford to join the Scouts so they beat up the kids who can – the lucky ones with two sober parents and a dad who has a job. It is, says Pacino, only thanks to Rose’s care and attention that he doesn’t end up the same way as his friends, all dead by 30 from being “on the needle”. With her encouragement and his own penchant for declaiming Ray Milland’s speeches from The Lost Weekend around their tenement apartment, Sonny gets a place at New York’s High School of Performing Arts.He is both a fish out of water and an absolute star. When, after a particularly good performance, someone says “Hey kid, you’re the next Marlon Brando,” he doesn’t know who they are talking about. What the reader is waiting for, of course, is the moment in 1972 when Francis Ford Coppola plucks him out of the ranks to co-star in The Godfather. The studio had wanted Jack Nicholson but when Pacino learns that his grandfather, Rose’s father, was born in a Sicilian town called Corleone, the whole thing begins to feel like fate.Kathryn Hughes£9.89 (RRP £10.99)\n - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirThe magus speaksPowsels and ThrumsAlan GarnerPowsels and ThrumsAlan GarnerThe magus speaksGarner lives where generations of Garners have before him. The “powsels and thrums” of his weaver ancestors were fabric scraps, cutoffs, experiments, intriguing threads: a homely metaphor for this collection of poems, lectures, memoir fragments and essays. Certain notes recur from past work: tales of his grandfather, Joe Garner, who first told him the legend of the sleeping heroes of Alderley Edge, in Cheshire, and issued the gnomic advice: “If the other feller can do it, let him.” In other words, find the work that you, and only you, can do. We see again how Garner, living by the Jodrell Bank telescope, is both rooted in the land and gazing at the stars: the brief poem Nova just as cosmic as his astounding novel Red Shift. The little contains universes.This rich collection underlines the homogeneity of his life’s work: how themes and processes jostle against each other again and again – deep history, ancestry, cosmology, archaeology, anthropology, myth and legend.Garnerworld might be a narrow plot, but he’s dug it deep, in every sense. In The Carr he records hard graft to tame his land – the hewing of a vicious alder in boggy ground that threatens to swallow him up – in language as precise as it is poetic. Elsewhere, the neolithic hand axe he finds (his house is built on a barrow) sends him looking up to the stars again, at light reaching him from before the stone was shaped.The Bull on the Tongue is a vital reflection on creativity in which Garner puts forward a counterintuitive but persuasive argument on the constraints of imaginative writing. “The visionary-based mind can’t be as prolific as the observational,” he argues. Conveying the nebulous, the liminal, that which lurks behind the veil of everyday life, entails discretion, and demands that the writer trust that readers can follow wild, intuitive leaps. Old Men’s Trousers and The Making Strange of Things races from Russian interpreters, the difference between creole and pidgin and the peculiarities of the Basque language, to Garner’s magnificent dismissal of academic approaches to his work: “philately may be the harmless affair of consenting philatelists, but it is not the concern of the postman”.Suzi Feay£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseEssaysThe pen and the swordNamesakeNS NuseibehNamesakeNS NuseibehThe pen and the sword“Floating in painful limbo, I belong to no one,” writes British-Palestinian doctoral student NS Nuseibeh in her first book of essays. She uses memories, historical research and stories from early Islam to reflect on her identity and on what it means to be a Muslim feminist in these turbulent and sorrowful times. Born in East Jerusalem, Nuseibeh doesn’t fit cliched expectations of a Palestinian Muslim. She has light skin and an American accent, and studied the Qur’an at university, not in a mosque. In moments of doubt and insecurity, she searches for connection with her indomitable ancestor and namesake, Nusayba, a mythic warrior, mother and early convert who fought alongside the prophet Muhammad. Nusayba is an enthralling conduit into her family’s cultural heritage and “easy for me to imagine, as I sit curled up here on my bed, in a slightly cold room in Oxford, thirteen hundred or so years later: a stout, muscled woman atop a horse, licking sweat from her lips as she strings a bow one-handed”.Searching and honest, these essays carry the reader from New York dinner parties to seventh-century battlefields to Jerusalem checkpoints and down the alleyways of a shrewd and compassionate mind. As she trails Nusayba, the academic in her recedes and you can hear a girlish heart racing, her belief in her own courage blossoming. This subtext is what makes Namesake a pleasure to read: the shy, people-pleasing scholar behind all that incisive research diving headfirst into old myths as if trying to resurrect her redoubtable foremother. Will she find belonging and a connection to her ancestors? Will she ever return to Gaza or get flagged by Prevent? Will she stop worrying, make peace with overstaying houseguests and English aubergines? Will she be allowed to introduce herself as Arab and feminist without having to reject her Muslim history? At once vulnerable and intellectually rigorous, here is an illuminating and trenchant exploration of Muslim feminism. An essential read in the war against lazy stereotypes, cultural annihilation and every form of apartheid.Dina Nayeri£9.89 (RRP £10.99)\n - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseShort storiesChilling tales for HalloweenThe HotelDaisy JohnsonThe HotelDaisy JohnsonChilling tales for HalloweenFrom the tricksy, unstable terrain of Fen, her debut collection, through the Booker-shortlisted Everything Under, to the darkly gothic drama of her 2020 novel Sisters, Daisy Johnson’s fiction has long bumped up against the edges of horror. She has deployed the tropes and played with the imagery, but always left the reader with a way out – the option to interpret her work as magical realism, or psychological drama. The Hotel is different. In this new book of short stories, she fully, deliciously commits to the genre, via a series of brief, chilling tales of ghosts and witches, monsters and manifestations; rooms that change shape and “footsteps close behind you but no one there when you turn”.The connective tissue is The Hotel of the title: nameless throughout, but always capitalised; looming over every sentence in which it appears. The stories take us back through The Hotel’s history: its ill-starred construction; the people who are drawn to and undone by it; the semi-sentience that roils and twitches within its walls. In Johnson’s work, landscapes have always set the tone and powered the action, and The Hotel is no exception: the flat, wet land of the Fens dampens its walls and sucks at its foundations, refusing readers firm footing.Sarah Crown£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseBiographyRock's poet of the shadow selfLou Reed: The King of New YorkWill HermesLou Reed: The King of New YorkWill HermesRock's poet of the shadow self“King of New York” was the epithet given to Lou Reed by David Bowie, an obsessive Velvet Underground fan who rescued Reed’s lacklustre solo career by producing Transformer, which spawned his biggest hit, Walk on the Wild Side. It’s also the title of Will Hermes’s meticulous yet vivid new biography, the first to draw on the archive donated to the New York Public Library by Reed’s widow Laurie Anderson. As in his 2011 book Love Goes to Buildings on Fire, about the city’s mid-70s musical landscape, Hermes expertly conjures the different scenes Reed inhabited, placing him amid a rich cast of collaborators, friends and lovers.There’s a sense that he’s updating Reed for a new generation, particularly as a prophet of queer liberation and gender nonconformity. This isn’t a stretch: one of his best songs, 1969’s Candy Says, is an achingly poignant evocation of gender dysphoria, among other things. On 1972’s Make Up, three years after the Stonewall riots, he proclaimed “Now we’re coming out, out of our closets / Out on the streets”. From 1974 to 1977 his partner was the trans woman Rachel Humphreys, and there was nothing closeted about their relationship.Hermes diligently recounts the creation of albums through the 80s, 90s and beyond, even as the cheques for use of his old songs in samples and ads started to roll in, making him a wealthy man. His greatest late-career release, New York, turned an unflinching eye on his hometown, railing against poverty and prejudice, mocking a hopeful poem about the statue of liberty: “Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor, I’ll piss on ’em.”But if he made his name as rock’s poet of the shadow self, whether his own or society’s, it was in the service of a more truthful beauty. In his moving final chapter and epilogue, Hermes describes Reed’s final days in 2013 – his body had rejected a transplanted liver, and he knew he was dying. “I am so susceptible to beauty right now,” he said, as friends played him the Shangri-Las, Nina Simone, Frank Ocean and Radiohead while he floated in his heated pool. In reality, he always was.David Shariatmadari£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionBody horror with historical biteCarrion CrowHeather ParryCarrion CrowHeather ParryBody horror with historical biteYou don’t tend to encounter much body horror in historical fiction. We have our bold innovators, to be sure, but for many the archaic and the genteel remain oddly synonymous. The good news, if that’s you, is that there’s almost no swearing in Heather Parry’s new novel. The bad news is that it’s vile and unspeakable in almost every other way. But don’t let that put you off. Carrion Crow may be set in a fetid late Victorian London and couched in lightly brocaded prose, but what lurks within is unmistakably red in tooth and claw, a creature nearer in kinship to Kathy Acker than to Sarah Waters.The body undergoing the horrors belongs, in this instance, to Marguerite Périgord, the daughter of a French noblewoman in reduced circumstances. When the wayward Marguerite attracts a suitor, a strenuously unromantic solicitor named Mr Lewis, Cécile Périgord isn’t taking any chances. In a show of aristocratic mettle, she imprisons Marguerite in the attic, there to acquire the complexion and manners her wifely vocation will require.Deprived of any other agency, Marguerite tests the limits of her body’s mutability. Finding that her hairpins prick her as she sleeps, she eats and later expels them, “each one bringing a satisfied smile to Marguerite’s face as it tinged off the chamber pot”. By way of a wretched dirty protest, she then hammers the pins into the ceiling.There is much worse to come as Marguerite sets about her self-destructive rampage. Shorn of all dignity, she brings about a martyrdom of debasement and self-harm. If it oozes, flakes or erupts from the human frame, it is almost certainly described here, and in glistening detail. Parry can write with an easy grace, but for the most part she denies herself the luxury. All Marguerite wants is “to feel adult and fecund”, but all she hears is that she is “not quite delicate enough”. Carrion Crow isn’t anyone’s idea of delicate, either, but it is richly fecund and adult in every sense of the word.Paraic O’Donnell£8.99 (RRP £9.99)\n - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

(If your 10-year-old is pulling out crumpled Kandinskys from their schoolbags on a regular basis then lucky you, I say.) But what about art criticism? Could a child’s understanding of art be as radical as John Berger’s or as wise as Sister Wendy’s, for instance?Arthistorian Thomas Schlesser thinks so. His debut novel,a bestseller in France, has been translated into 38 languages. Perhaps in one of them it lives up to the hype.In Mona’s Eyes, a 10-year-old girl embarks on an artistic adventure with her grandfather, visiting the most famous works in Paris museums over the course of a year. They pledge to gaze at these works intently and to discuss them deeply. The resulting conversations are intended to be charming and moving. The kindest observation to be made about this book is that they are not.Pitched as a kind of Sophie’s World for art history, with the fabular shades of The Little Prince, the story begins with Mona struck by a sudden and mysterious episode of blindness. Although Mona recovers quickly, her parents fear she may lose her sight permanently and consult with a doctor. Enter Henry, Mona’s maternal grandfather, otherwise known as Dadé. Instead of taking Mona to appointments with a psychiatrist as instructed, he unilaterally decides that what Mona really requires is a treatment of his own devising. Every Wednesday Mona and Dadé will inspect one great work of art, making their way through the Louvre, the Musée D’Orsay and the Centre Pompidou. As an educational scheme, it’s not a terrible idea. The trouble is that Dadé is a terrible person and Schlesser seems entirely oblivious to it.Schlesser dedicates his novel “to all the grandparents of the world”, and yet the grandparent he imagines here behaves in a deeply objectionable way. Schlesser depicts him flatteringly: a dashing octogenarian, a former photojournalist, a figure of towering intellect and worldly experience. But without the consent of Mona’s parents, he acts with alarming impunity and irresponsibility. He deems that Mona’s childhood lacks beauty and intends to aid her in “the refinement of taste, the development of sensibility”, but only after inwardly sneering at the things she loves, her bedroom with its “plastic jewellery, that cartoon-princess-style furniture … The acidic colours of all this clutter choked him.”Mona's contributions are largely limited to clumsy prompts: 'Tell me more about that luminosity, Dadé'Partway through the novel, an eavesdropping art curator interrupts them on their way to see Monet’s Saint-Lazare station paintings. She fulsomely celebrates their insights, bewilderingly declaring their interaction “the reward of an entire career”, but Mona and Dadé’s exchanges during these excursions are uniformly pedestrian. Grandeur poses as profundity. “This painting tells us,” Dadé intones, “about the wonderful thrill of imagining things, ever more deeply, and invites us to trust this prodigious faculty, which allows the invisible to become visible and the improbable possible.”In between the gnomic phrases and metaphysical abstraction, Dadé marvels at Mona’s apparently unique child’s-eye view. In reality, her contributions are largely limited to exclamations such as “Got it, Dadé!” or clumsy prompts: “Tell me more about that luminosity, Dadé”. Dadé’s analysis of the works, instead of being enriching and enlarging, feels mechanistic. Chiaroscuroin a self-portrait by Rembrandt, he decides, is the ideal way to teach Mona how to challenge “binary concepts of good and evil”.These are ideas understandably beyond poor Mona, who on seeing a photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron observes: “That sure is different to a photo taken on a phone.” The problem is that Schlesser seems to be working with a diminished idea of anything a child might do, imagine or desire. Minor plotlines involving Mona’s schoolfriends, her alcoholic father, the frankly weird doctor who is directing her treatment and a mystery about her dead grandmother reduce her to a vehicle for a tedious plot, rather than investing her with interiority. As a child muse, she is puzzlingly charmless, unequal to the weight she is tasked to carry in this novel.Schlesser seems like a decent art critic and he has sensible, informative things to share about the works he has selected here, but his clunky novel is mostly concerned with affixing life-affirming lessons to masterpieces rather than exploring any real intellectual stakes. And in an age of brilliantly intelligent art writing (TJ Clark, Laura Cumming) and stirring meditations on seeing (Ann Wroe, Lavinia Greenlaw), Schlesser’s prose and Dadé’s sermons are disappointingly didactic.Hildegarde Serle’s English translation adds to the problem. “Holy smokes,” the elderly Dadé improbably exclaims at one point; Manet is awkwardly described as coming from “a swanky social milieu”; towards the end of the novel, “the music of spring wafted in the air”. An undeniable strain of sentimentalism runs throughout, manifest in the prose and the sensibility. It may seem cruel to be critical about a book that is so transparently well-meaning, but this is not to deny the redemptive power of art. Cynicism is an attitude that isn’t inherently cool or wise, but neither does sincerity have to be as unsophisticated and simple-minded as it is here. Do take a child to a gallery. But go for the cake and the chaos rather than lessons in chiaroscuro.Mona’s Eyes by Thomas Schlesser, translated by Hildegarde Serle, is published by Europa (£20).

The long-running military shooter series, which specialises in gigantic online multiplayer conflicts involving dozens of ground troops, tanks and aircraft, has returned for its sixth main instalment – andit’s thrilling, epic and compulsive.Apart from the single-player campaign mode, which I absolutely hated. It’s another oh-so-familiar tale of preternaturally talented soldiers just doing their jobs to defend the free world in the face of evil private military companies, terror organisations or double-crossing CIA operatives. It could be almost any military shooter of the last decade or any straight-to-streaming war film starring one of the Hemsworths. But it’s not. It’s a seven-hour cliche bombardment that you have to take an active part in.The thing is, nobody buysBattlefieldfor the campaign mode. In fact, most games in the series haven’t had one. So this was a chance for the developers to experiment a little, try something new or even subversive. The mainstream movie biz may have been equally guilty of dressing up jingoistic celebrations of the military-industrial complex as thrilling action flicks, but it has also produced Paths of Glory, M*A*S*H and The Deer Hunter. While Battlefield 6 does make the occasional nod towards the less-than-ideal circumstances of modern hybrid warfare, you don’t care much because the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no backstories who speak in nonstop military jargon.There have been a few big games that have challenged the narrative of the moral warrior acting in the world’s best interests on behalf of largely benign military divisions. Metal Gear Solid is clearly a pacifist text on the horror of nuclear war, while Ubisoft’s Valiant Hearts is a beautiful meditation on war and love. The key example, though, remains Yager Development’s fascinating 2012 adventure Spec Ops: The Line, in which you play the commander of a covert delta team sent into a disaster-hit Dubai to discover the whereabouts of a rogue US military unit.As the narrative progresses, your character descends into exhaustion and trauma, experiencing increasingly nightmarish hallucinations. The aim was to show the damaging psychological impact of war, while also providing a gripping and exciting experience. The mission was successful.View image in fullscreenWar stories … Spec Ops: The Line is the rare military game with meaning.Photograph: YagerIn the rapidly consolidating games industry, where gigantic mega-corps are willing to invest the equivalent of a small country’s GDP into capturing tens of millions of players, it seems that narrative innovation is unlikely. As is making any kind of political statement. But contemporary audiences are spoiled for choice when it comes to shooters – as the success of oddities such as Atomfall and Megabonk have shown – there’s money to be made in straying off piste.Could the Battlefield 6 campaign have been a tense claustrophobic single-set thriller like Alex Garland’s Warfare? Could it have plunged our hero into a series of survival dramas like Until Dawn? Could it have been a sandbox adventure with various tasks, items and enemy units to discover?Over the past two years we’ve seen several multimillion dollar projects axed and staff made redundant because the “pick-me” approach of green-lighting only titles that will compete directly with the always on nature of Fortnite, Call of Duty or Marvel Rivals is a zero sum game – you win or you die. Call me naive, but that doesn’t seem sustainable (not even forthose mega-titles) – and considering the human cost of mass layoffs, it’s also repugnant. Games cannot live on cliche alone. The modern world, with its shifting allegiances, its climate instability and its displaced populations, is a horrifyingly fascinating place for brand-new war narratives that actually mean something.

What do you recommend?”There are lots of options here. The children’s electronic toy manufacturer Leap Frog has a range ofLeapsterhandhelds, which can be picked up second hand for around £20-30 usually with a couple of cartridges. They’re chunky and safe, and the games are OK. However, I’d rather go for aNintendo DSor the newer and more hardy2DS, both of which go on eBay for around £10-£50 depending on condition.There are hundreds of children’s games available for these systems (original DS games can be played on both systems, but the 2DS will also play newer 3DS games – though not in 3D) and games can be picked up for as little as 50p in charity shops or at your localCeX store. With the original DS, the hinge that connects the two screens is the most vulnerable point, but it depends on how rough your daughter is with it. Also, both systems come with a stylus, which is a potential choke hazard so you need to be around when she uses it. Also, my sons lost dozens of them. Luckily a lot of games don’t need them.

She had been abducted by the group months earlier and her court testimony told of how she was locked in a closet and raped during captivity.This memory play traces the fallout of such a case through a fictional encounter between heiress Holly (Abigail Cruttenden) and the attorney Robert (Nathaniel Parker) who lost her case.They meet many decades after the event. Robert has become a celebrity lawyer in California and his life has been upended by allegations of sexual misconduct. He invites Holly, now fully rehabilitated into high society, to his apartment in hope she might speak out on his behalf. The ironies could not be greater, given the doubt he cast back in 1978 over her account of rape. “How things change,” says Holly. “Forty years ago, it was sex. Now it’s rape.”It begins in 2017, a few months before the allegations of sexual assault made against Harvey Weinstein, though this is not spelled out. The toxic inheritance of the 1970s is revisited from our post #MeToo perspective. The subject matter is explored with gripping tension, although some of the complexities of Hearst’s case are flattened; there is no discussion of coercion or brainwashing, as there was around her trial. But all the issues are there, and the drama too, in abundance.View image in fullscreenArtful … The cast of Ragdoll at Jermyn Street theatre.Photograph: Natasha Ketel/Alex BrennerAt heart this is a two-hander played out as a four-hander, with younger versions of both characters (Katie Matsell as the heiress and Ben Lamb as the lawyer) enacting flashbacks. Under the artful direction of Josh Seymour, the older characters turn to their younger selves and begin interacting with them, as if the past has turned to flesh and blood. It gives the play an audacious theatricality which works with surprising subtlety.Neither Holly nor Robert are particularly likable: he is simply odious, she is self-regarding and entitled. But her privilege is part of the genius of this play: it still renders her powerless, despite her powerful family.The play is best in combative mode and does not quite know how to finish but that doesn’t matter. Moar’s dialogue is so deft and sparkling, you could listen on and on. Her debut play,Farm Hall, about Germany’s nuclear programme in 1945, premiered at this theatre and found greater life in a West End transfer.

There are jokes. There is a handwritten text in watercolour, copied out again and again, freeing the writer from the injustices of their ancestors (I AM FREE, it concludes). There is work riffing on Marcel Duchamp’s moustachioed and goateed Mona Lisa, swapping his ribald but puzzling 1919 caption LHOOQ with LGBTQ+. There are book jackets about Palestine’s wrecked ecology and visual activism in Palestine post 7 October, each wrapped around blocks of stone, like messages to be sent crashing through somebody’s window.At the 2024 Venice Biennale, Claire Fontaine’s neon signs reading Foreigners Everywhere appeared and reappeared, written in dozens of languages, around the Giardini and the Arsenale, and also lent the biennale its overall title, turning a familiar kneejerk complaint into a celebration of difference. A new neon sign reading FATHERFUCKER, suspended and glowing behind the window of Mimosa House, opens their biggest London show to date.This image is completely anonymous. It is a description of the tortures prisoners were enduringSomeone walks by and catches the word in their peripheral vision. Taking a couple of steps backwards, they rewind to look again. Others lark about at the window, taking selfies. Someone else has already alerted the council to complain. “The word motherfucker probably comes from a place of a total lack of empathy. We’re at the point where we don’t have any sympathy any more,” Fulvia Carnevale tells me, as she and James Thornhill, collectively known as Claire Fontaine, are finishing the installation of their show, called Show Less, in the gallery. Fatherfucker reverses the insult. “These works are all about injustice,” Carnevale adds. “The show revolves around structural injustice and how we deal with that. You know, patriarchy is an injustice, but it’s an injustice for men too.”View image in fullscreenSwitched gender … Fatherfucker, in Show Less.Photograph: Christa HolkaClaire Fontaine call themselves a “ready-made artist”, their name borrowed from the famous French stationery brand. Claire Fontaine also means clear fountain, which can also be taken as a reference to Duchamp’s 1917 Fountain, his ready-made urinal. Not all their references are so obvious. The gallery floors and stairs are completely covered in newspaper, filleted from recent editions of the Guardian, donated by the staff. This is a distant reference to a group of 1949 photographs by Robert Capa, showing Henri Matisse working on his designs for the chapel he was designing in Vence, outside Nice. Matisse had covered the floor of a temporary studio with newspaper, to protect the tiles beneath. Here, it is a news floor, a constant background rumble of yesterday’s news, cycling beneath our feet.Currently, Thornhill and an assistant are mounting a big, backlit Venn diagram on the wall, three intersecting circles in blue, peach and yellow, the circles denoting witnesses, perpetrators and victims. Titled Intersections, Claire Fontaine sourced the diagram on the internet. It casts a blush of colour on the newspapers beneath. “It’s not about who’s innocent, who’s guilty, who’s the victim – it is about how do we deal with the violence of our daily life that is destroying every dignity, basically, for art, for making a symbolic action,” Carnevale says.View image in fullscreen‘It is about how do we deal with the violence of our daily life’ …’ Intersections by Claire Fontaine.Photograph: Christa HolkaTwo other light boxes, their proportions based on those of a mobile phone but vastly enlarged, like airport advertising, hang nearby. One contains a blown-up photo of a drawing smuggled out from a Yemeni prison and posted on the internet in 2018. Untitled (They Sexually Harass and Torture Then Photograph and Publish) is a sorry scrap of packaging foam on which a prisoner has urgently detailed their experience. The light boxes are overlain with a second image of a broken phone screen, the cracks becoming an integral part of the image beneath.“This image is completely anonymous,” Thornhill says. “It is a description of the tortures that the prisoners were enduring.” Carnevale points at the crude little drawings. “This is somebody getting ready to be raped and these two guards beating this guy have been depicted headless. It’s an incredibly brutal image of total darkness and the scribbled Arabic text is a description of what you see. The fact that we’re seeing through a broken screen reflects in some ways the reality of how we don’t understand.” One part of the image was censored at source. We don’t know what has been blocked out. What you don’t see here is probably the most frightening thing about it.Multiple lifesize copies of Gustave Courbet’s notorious 1866 oil painting L’Origine du Monde line one gallery: one closeup, spread-legged view after another of a woman’s pubis and vulva. Her breasts are partly swathed in a sheet. Having passed between multiple collectors, from an Ottoman diplomat who collected erotica to psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Courbet’s painting is now in the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. The copies, commissioned by Claire Fontaine, were all hand-painted in China, each one a subtly different transcription.View image in fullscreen‘You’re always nervous about making the first mark’ … James Thornhill and Fulvia Carnevale.Photograph: Christa Holka, Courtesy of Mimosa HousePreviously, they had been working over postcards, including a Modigliani, Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe and his Olympia, each of them iconic paintings with naked women who are also staring at you. “We have vandalised them in a kind of feminist key,” says Carnevale. “We asked to get 12 copies made of the Courbet. Everything was done by hand, without resorting to copying over projections of the original. The slight changes in position, the hair, the sex, the vagina and the colour are all different. When they arrived at our studio in Palermo we felt like they were an accumulation of dead bodies. It started feeling like a rape scene. So then we worked on them slightly differently, less brutally, than in our postcard version.”Sometimes, the spray painting leaves a mist or a bruise, a blush or a hint of gangrenous pallor. The spraying is horribly intimate. “You’re always kind of nervous about making the first mark, but then once you get into it, it decides itself. Painting is a kind of magical process,” says Thornhill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The postcard of Courbet’s painting is the second most popular in the Musée d’Orsay gift shop, after a Renoir.We start looking down, scrutinising the floor and picking up headlines. What you have to watch out for is people who spend all their time in here looking at the newspaper instead of the other work. You seem to have a sort of an ever-expanding repertoire of works, that you use and reuse and recombine, I say. Your work is about reconfiguring.“Foreigners Everywhere expanded in a way we never would have imagined,” says Carnevale. “Our work gets picked up and appropriated. Not worrying about being original frees you up. And it gives you a whole host of available material to work with.”At one point, Carnevale quotes some lines from Bertolt Brecht, written in 1939:In the dark timesWill there also be singing?Yes, there will also be singingAbout the dark times.It’s totally of our time, she says. “But now when you make songs about the dark times, they say you’re a sellout and a monster. In many moments, contemporary art has been a comfort to us in terms of being in a space where we are allowed to live and exist and do things that weren’t understood or valued elsewhere. Now, it looks like a space of privilege. And that’s bad for everybody. I think it’s about resonating with your present, and trying to keep a dignified position. People can say whatever they want, but I’m pretty sure that everybody needs to think that there is something out there that isn’t bullshit.”Claire Fontaine: Show Less is at Mimosa House, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a space designed for scale, flexibility and form-defying experimentation, all of which apply to performance artist Marina Abramović’s ambitious, uncompromising, sprawling new show, which takes over the whole of the venue’s vast warehouse space.The four-hour performance gives audiences a journey through the folklore and rites of the Balkans, gathering traditions from across the region. There’s dancing, singing and a variety of surprising uses of the human body, from fertility ceremonies to wedding preparations. These rituals are enacted through live performance and projected film, organised across 13 scenes designed to be experienced by freely roaming audience members. Some are durational tableaux, repeating and accumulating, while others build to a climax and then reset. And wandering through it all is Maria Stamenković Herranz as Abramović’s strict, buttoned-up mother, looking on with disapproval but curiosity.View image in fullscreenCompelling unpredictability … Balkan Erotic Epic at Aviva Studios.Photograph: Marco AnelliThe emphasis is as much on the Balkan as on the erotic. Yes, there are naked bodies and giant penis sculptures, but Abramović resists simple titillation. The nudity here is ritualistic, not pornographic. A chorus of roaring women bare their vaginas to the sky in a bid to scare the gods and stop the rain; naked figures dance with skeletons in an act of mourning for their dead husbands. Meanwhile, the more explicit traditions – a woman inserting fish in her vagina to create a love potion, or a groom penetrating holes in a bridge to ward off wedding night impotence – are represented through animations on a screen, narrated by a “scientist” character.There’s as much death as there is sex, intermingling ecstasy and grief. The performance opens with a funeral lament for communist Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito, who looms over several of the scenes. Elsewhere, corpses are raised on plinths and men and women in traditional costume perform a haunting funeral dance.View image in fullscreenIntense … Maisha Kungu and Lizzy Owen in Balkan Erotic Epic.Photograph: Marco AnelliThe erotic and the morbid collide most powerfully in the black wedding: a striking scene in which a young, unmarried dead man is symbolically joined with a young woman. In a way that’s characteristic of the intensity and commitment of the performances throughout, black-clad dancers violently fling themselves at one another and at the ground.Breast-kneaders, skeleton orgies and five-metre-high penises: Marina Abramović on her most daring show everRead moreLeft to meander through all these strange and forceful scenes, the experience can be overwhelming at times. Cries, moans and rhythmic chants ring out across the cavernous space, often wrenching attention away from what’s happening in front of you. But as the performance goes on Abramović and her team subtly direct the audience into specific areas, building to collective spectacles that give the evening a satisfying shape, as opposed to being simply a collection of randomly ordered curiosities.It’s rare and thrilling to see an artist working on this scale. Balkan Erotic Epic is a test of endurance for performers and spectators alike, but the compelling unpredictability makes it worth the long haul.AtAviva Studios, Manchester, until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageMarina AbramovićPerformance artTheatreArtDanceFolk dancingreviewsShareReuse this content"

The American artist’s first proper London exhibition is a splodgy, orgiastic celebration of her material, but there are some big messages smuggled through if you can scratch your way towards them.Schutz’s approach – which has seen her lauded as one of the most important figurative artists of her generation – is all about surface, brush strokes, colour and materiality. It’s painting for painters, real high-level art-nerd stuff. If you get your kicks losing yourself in layers of pigment and shadow, there’s enough here to keep you going for a while. But it’s Schutz’s grotesque, surreal, cartoony, metaphorical imagery that really makes the paintings tick.The works in the first gallery are full of giant-headed cyclopses and baying crowds. In one, a group of figures stomps senselessly towards something off canvas, brandishing fists and leaving a trail of trash in their wake. In another, a figure is given a huge mask in some bizarre initiation ritual in front of a horde of ugly supporters. It’s not hard to read any of this as political, as commentary on the state of the US, on how society is divided and angry, and mob mentality is turning everything to rubbish.View image in fullscreenThe Kiss by Dana Schutz.Photograph: Kerry McFate/© Dana Schutz. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery, David Zwirner and Contemporary Fine Arts, BerlinIn the other gallery space, Schutz seems to shift her focus to the people in power, rather than the crowds that follow them. Shadowy figures stuff their mouths with grapes and steak in a sombre dining room; a cardinal and a man in green recline in golden chairs – while in other works a couple console each other in a landscape filled with corpses, and a woman, maybe Schutz herself, lies naked, forlorn and powerless in bed.This is ultradense, thickly layered stuff, covered in allusions. There’s the dreamy surreal symbolism ofOdilon Redon, the fleshy pink cartoonishness ofPhilip Guston, the carnival grotesqueries ofJames Ensor, the big-headed weirdness ofPaul McCarthy. There are riffs on the history of painting, countless nods to pop culture (I am almost 100% sure that one painting is a portrait of Handsome Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants). You could spend hours spotting all the bits of Cézanne and David with which she’s littered the works.Painting this dense, complex and allegorical leaves itself open to interpretation. I feel as if I’m being quizzed on the symbolism of a Titian but, for my money, there are two relatively clear narratives: the people in power, and the crowds that they bait.View image in fullscreenThe Example by Dana Schutz.Photograph: Stephen Arnold/© Dana Schutz. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery, David Zwirner and Contemporary Fine Arts, BerlinAnd Schutz should know about that. Back in 2017, her painting Open Casket – a semi-abstracted depiction of the corpse of Emmett Till, a black teenager who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955 – caused untold controversy when it was shown at the Whitney Biennial in New York. She was accused of exploiting black death for her own gain. A protester picketed the painting daily, and others called for it to be destroyed. A white artist painting – arguably with great sympathy – a scene of black pain was the biggest story of the biennial. It was the peak of the late 2010s culture wars, a time that saw people turning on each other even if they were on the same side. Looking back now, in a world more divided, less nuanced and angrier than ever, it feels almost quaint that people had the time to get angry at this heartfelt, sorrowful painting.It could have ruined her career, and Schutz probably wants to move on. But everything she’s done since exists in its shadow. She inevitably came out of that experience a changed artist. But what hasn’t changed is how good she is, how she still engages in brilliant, sickly, gloopy and deeply political painting at the highest level.Dana Schutz: One Big Animal is at Thomas Dane, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

So a surrogate was used. Tragically, the foetus didn’t reach full termInterview byCharlotte JansenWed 15 Oct 2025 10.52 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareThis photograph captures a moment of fragile hope: the world’s first IVF rhino pregnancy, a tiny foetus that reignited optimism among scientists fighting to save the northern white rhino from extinction. There are only two female northern white rhinos left on the planet – Najin and her daughter Fatu. Neither can carry a pregnancy due to health complications. The last male died in 2018 and that makes the species functionally extinct.For the past 15 years, theBioRescue Project– an international consortium dedicated to saving the species – has been collecting and preserving sperm from deceased males. Using this genetic material and egg cells from Fatu, they’ve created 38 embryos. It may sound like a lot, but it’s not. Since Najin and Fatu cannot carry a pregnancy, surrogate mothers are essential and it was decided to use southern white rhinos, a less endangered subspecies. The team also needed to prove that their technique would work with southern white rhino embryos before transferring any of the northern white rhino embryos into a surrogate.After 13 attempts to transfer an embryo they achieved the first viable IVF pregnancy in a southern white rhino. The foetus in this image is the result after transfer. Tragically, the pregnancy didn’t reach full term (16-18 months), as the surrogate mother died from a bacterial infection at 70 days. But the pregnancy demonstrated that the technique is viable – a critical milestone.This image goes beyond documentation. It's not showing a living animal but something much more fragileEthics are central to the project and a dedicated team of ethical scientists monitor every step to ensure no harm is done. The northern white rhinos live in a conservancy in Kenya, protected around the clock by devoted rangers and caretakers. I understand that some may feel uneasy about surrogacy and IVF in animals, but I’ve seen first-hand how carefully the team evaluates animal welfare. Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the project’s lead, says science cannot be an excuse to repeat the mistakes of the past; it cannot be the sole solution; conservation must go hand in hand with science to prevent extinction.Before becoming a photographer, I studied biology. I dreamed of being a scientist, but science felt too vast, and my applications to research institutes were clumsy and naive. It never happened.Photographybecame my way back in. Years ago, I met the press officer for the BioRescue Project, based in Berlin, where I live and in 2020 he invited me and my partner – a journalist – to document the first embryo transfers of southern white rhinos in Germany. I was blown away. As a frustrated biologist, I was thrilled to work alongside this extraordinary team. Since then, I’ve followed their work – first in German zoos, and since 2023, in Kenya.I remember being at the airport in Germany, about to fly to Kenya to document what we hoped would be the first successful surrogacy – the team were buzzing with excitement. But while we were still at the airport, we received the news that the surrogate had died. It was devastating. The emotions were hard to put into words. This photograph was taken when the scientists were performing DNA checks on the foetus.The project came heartbreakingly close to success – it’s only a matter of timeThe image feels very different to the others I have taken for the project. It goes beyond documentation – it’s not showing a living animal or a scientific procedure, but something much more fragile. For me, it represents success and loss. It proves that the science works, but it also reminds us how close we are to losing this species for ever. I think it captures the emotional essence of the whole story.Even though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we listen to scientists and support their efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place. Yes, bad news matters – but we also need stories of perseverance. There are incredible people working tirelessly, refusing to give up. The project came heartbreakingly close to success. It’s only a matter of time.But time is running out. The German government, which has funded the project since 2019, has yet to confirm continued support. The next funding decision is due at the end of November. Without it, progress could stall – not just for the northern white rhino, but for other endangered species, too. That’s deeply disheartening, especially when the goal is within reach. If we keep sidelining environmental issues, we risk crossing a point of no return.This image is the winner of the 61st Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition’s photojournalism category.

And nowStar Warsfans may have to do the same after confirmation that the beloved fictional alien was very nearly blue, or even purple.Reviews of archival sources – and new testimony from a special effects makeup artist who worked on the first Yoda puppets – suggest film-makers made a decision late in the development process to switch the character’s skin colour to green.Had producers of The Empire Strikes Back closely followed the final screenplay, then Yoda would have been “bluish”.In the text, Luke and his droid companion, R2-D2, are surprised after being confronted by a small creature who appears on the swamp-covered planet of Dagobah. “Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags,” reads the screenplay.View image in fullscreenYoda as he appears in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back.Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/AlamyDerived from George Lucas’s original story, the screenplay for the second film in the original Star Wars trilogy was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. While final movies always differ slightly from the screenplay, most other elements from the text were kept in the feature film, raising questions about why that detail was changed.Yoda’s eventual colour change is not unknown among fans. Early concept art sketches from around 1978 show Yoda in different hues, sometimes colourless and other times light blue or pink.However, two other printed works from 1980, the same year the film was released, continue to describe or portray a blue or purple Yoda, indicating a late-stage switch.The first document, a novelisation released as the movie was out in cinemas, describes him as “blue-skinned”.One version of that book was even published in July 1980, two months after the film had already premiered with a green Yoda.View image in fullscreenThe Marvel Comics tie-in book of The Empire Strikes Back depicts most scenes as they appeared on screen – only with Yoda a different colour.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianA second, more visual example of a non-green Yoda, comes from comic book versions of The Empire Strikes Back. Several scenes portray him as purple, and also much smaller and elf-like than in the feature film, with long white hair. The book, a collected version of the Marvel Comics adaptation of the film, depicts most scenes as they appeared on screen, suggesting the decision to change Yoda’s colour was made after most other character and set decisions were agreed.It is not clear why Yoda was changed to green. Attempts to seek comment from Lucasfilm and its parent company, the Walt Disney Company, went unanswered.Many senior people involved in those early days are now dead, including the comic book writer Archie Goodwin and artist Al Williamson. Stuart Freeborn, the British pioneering movie makeup artist behind​ the creation of Yoda – as well as the 7ft-tall Wookiee Chewbacca and the slug-like Jabba the Hutt –died aged 98 in 2013.Freeborn is alleged to have mirrored Yoda’s face on his own, and Yoda’s looks were also said to be partly inspired by Albert Einstein.Nick Maley, a special makeup and creature effects designer who worked on the Star Wars series, said he was not sure exactly who decided to make Yoda’s character green, but that the decision had already been made before he joined the project in 1979.View image in fullscreenIn the comic version of the film, Yoda has long white hair and appears much smaller than he does in the film.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“By the time I got to work on him, he was green,” said Maley, who is sometimes referred to as “That Yoda Guy” because of his work on Yoda’s skin. “I have a memory of a particular drawing … I seem to remember him being green in that drawing, and that would be before we’d ever started trying to try to make him.”Maley did, however, note there was a rushed period in the summer of 1979 when Yoda’s look was finalised at Elstree Studios in the UK. “We sat around for five months,” he said, while producers tried “to decide what Yoda would look like, and then left us like seven weeks to try and actually make the world’s first animatronic superstar work.”Asked about the colour change in the 1980s comics, he said that tie-in books were often made independently of film production, and may have used outdated source material, such as superseded concept art. “All sorts of crap goes on based on misunderstandings through the course of having a large organisation of different people doing different things along the way,” he said.Still, he added that green might have been the obvious choice.“I mean, I assumed everybody kind of tended to think: ‘Oh, Martians are little green characters.’ Right? So, you know, the green alien is a classic in people’s minds,” he said. “I never questioned the fact that he was green. I never asked any questions about it, but we actually put dyes into the foam latex so that we didn’t have to paint it too much. That was green.”Yoda’s character is one of the most mysterious of the many hundreds of aliens in the Star Wars franchise, with his home planet never revealed. Little is known about the species, which is also unnamed, other than they live for many centuries, have strong “force” powers and are always depicted with green skin.There was renewed interest in Yoda and his kind after the release of the Disney+ seriesThe Mandalorian, where an infant member of the species called Grogu plays a leading role. That character is colloquially referred to as Baby Yoda, although they are not known to be relatives.Explore more on these topicsStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsStar Wars: The Empire Strikes BacknewsShareReuse this content"

The postwar destruction of London communities engaged her lifelong interest in urban conservation.Photograph: Mike Hollist/ANL/ShutterstockBooksObituaryGillian Tindall obituaryWriter, historian and biographer who wove archaeology, social history, myth and religion into her workCatherine DilleWed 15 Oct 2025 12.14 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 12.16 EDTShareThe writer Gillian Tindall, who has died aged 87, wrote books that bridged the boundaries between fiction, memoir and history. Over more than six decades, she explored with a novelist’s intuition and historian’s precision how the hidden past shapes places and the people who inhabit them.No Name in the Street (1959) was the first of more than a dozen novels and short-story collections, leading to the Somerset Maugham award in 1972 forFly Away Home. Her evolution towards non-fiction began with a biography of a Victorian novelist – The Born Exile: George Gissing (1974) – in whose work London was a powerful presence.The Fields Beneath: The History of One London Village(1977) traces the gradual absorption of Kentish Town into the capital’s expanding metropolis. It redefined the possibilities of local history by presenting it as a vivid and accessible form of social history.Its title, like other “found” objects that inspired her work, was discovered carved on to the lintel of a local house – The Fields Lie Sleeping Underneath – and epitomised her representation of the multilayered city.The persona of the historian always hovers close to Gillian’s narratives, many of which originated from a personal experience or discovery:Célestine: Voices from a French Village(1995) begins with the chance find of a cache of letters in a French farmhouse: a key to revealing the intimate lives of rural families over generations.She regarded The Fields Beneath and Célestine as her best works; both saw multiple editions, and Célestine was published in French to critical praise.It amused Gillian that in France she was known as the author of Célestine, while in India she was the author ofCity of Gold: The Biography of Bombay(1982). Londoners have benefited from whatthe Times called “masterpieces of micro-history”, in which “‘she deftly weaves together archaeology, social history, politics, myth, religion and philosophy”.Each new book adopted a distinctive historical framework: the story of a single house over 450 years –The House By the Thames and the People Who Lived There(2006); an account of how Crossrail’s modern line follows an ancient path through the city, inThe Tunnel Through Time(2016); biographies centred on remarkable but forgotten individuals; a clutch of talismanic objects that, placed in context, illuminate wider themes in history, inThe Pulse Glass: And the Beat of Other Hearts(2019).Her final completed book unexpectedly brings her work full circle with a return to fiction;Journal of a Man Unknown, the imagined diary of a 17th-century Huguenot ancestor, will be published next month by Spitalfields Life Books.View image in fullscreenGillian Tindall at the cafe in Kentish Town, north London, that took its name from her 1977 book The Fields Beneath.Photograph: Richard LansdownGillian’s father, Dennis Tindall, came from a line of medical publishers, and her mother wasthe novelist Ursula Orange. Born in London, Gillian was evacuated to Forest Row, East Sussex, and attended a nearby village school.An unconventional education at what she called a “dotty” progressive school was followed by a stint in a girls’ boarding school of “deadening intellectual mediocrity”, where she was punished for writing a novel during prep.Her mother’s suicide when Gillian was in her late teens and her father’s hasty remarriage drew her protectively towards her younger brother, Nicholas, to whom she remained close. After several months living independently in Paris, where she acquired “both French and assorted adult experiences”, Gillian arrived at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to study English literature, which she regarded as a “rest-cure and haven”, resulting in a first-class degree (1959).This was followed shortly after by her first novel, and she then conducted research for the Stepney Welfare Association,interviewing widows in their East End front rooms. Many faced relocation as their neighbourhoods were sacrificed to what Gillian called the “blinkered enthusiasm” of postwar planners. The destruction of these communities engaged her lifelong interest in urban conservation.In 1963 she married Richard Lansdown, a child psychologist, andthey settled in Kentish Town, the area of north London that would become central to her writing. Their late Georgian terrace house, with its antique showman’s caravan at the end of the garden, features fleetingly in The Fields Beneath. She wrote opinion pieces for the Guardian, Observer and the Times and was a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 3 arts programme Critics’ Forum.Gillian renewed her connection withFrancein 1973 when she and her husband bought a modest house in the rural village of Chassignolles, Indre, with no electricity and unconnected to the mains, which they gradually made more comfortable. More than a rural retreat, it provided inspiration and materials for her writing. She was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to French culture.Hercommitment to public history and conservationremained strong. In 1970 she was a founding member of theCamden History Society, and remained active on its board and those of other historical and conservation bodies. With her encyclopedic knowledge of local planning and incisive thinking, Gillian had little patience for developers who had not done their research or failed to appreciate the history or needs of an area they intended to use. Her principal concern was that London should remain a city where families could continue to go about their everyday lives as they had done for centuries.She frequently entertained friends at dinner and, as I found, always had time to discuss a historical question or local planning issue over a cup of tea.Casting aside the manner of the Oxford don that she might easily have been, she was a warm advocate of anyone with an interest in history. She continued to work with characteristic energy, writing and reviewing until the final months before her death from breast cancer.She is survived by Richard, their son, Harry, and grandsons, James and Bruno. Nicholas predeceased her.Gillian Elizabeth Tindall, novelist, biographer and historian of place, born 4 May 1938; died 1 October 2025Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionBiography booksLondonHistory booksSocial historyFranceobituariesShareReuse this content"

Alvy asks if she took the photographs displayed inside. “They’re wonderful,” he says. “They have a … quality.”She dabbles, but would like to take a proper course, replies Annie. Alvy starts waffling about “the aesthetic criteria” of a “new art form” (photography has been around for 150 years at this point). Meanwhile, his inner monologue is presented in subtitles:I don’t know what I’m saying.“Aesthetic criteria?” Annie says. “You mean, whether it’s a good photo or not?”Later in the film, during the lobster set piece, Annie snaps Alvy in the kitchen with aNikon F2 Photomic. As with many aspects of her character (her style, for example), a love of photography was cribbed from the real-life Keaton. And though for Annie photography is an amateur pursuit, Keaton published multiple pictorial books in her lifetime.In the 1970s, travelling from coast to coast, Keaton shot a series of classic American hotel interiors (she was an avid fan of architecture and design) for Rolling Stone. These pictures formed the basis of the monograph Reservations, her first book, published by Knopf in 1980. Theblurbintroduced the actor as “a strong, direct photographer with a cool and deadly eye”.View image in fullscreen‘I shoot the pictures, but I’m not doing it any big way. I just like images’… Diane Keaton on her photography, alongside one of her Hollywood portraits.Photograph: Diane Keaton/Rizzoli/Guardian compositeThe images, monochrome and square and taken on her beloved Rolleiflex, show typical hotel lobbies of the era; their tension between minimalism and maximalism. The ostentatious banquettes and the baroque wallpaper; the solitary Windsor chair in the corner of an otherwise empty space.Textures abound: the upholstery of a velvet cocktail sofa; the grain of wood-panelled walls; the reflected sheen of a plastic lamp or rubber plants. The compositions are idiosyncratic, reminiscent of that other Diane – Arbus.A waiter is cut off at the torso; just half of a painting hanging on a wall is allowed into frame; there’s a decapitated statue. If the photographic benchmark for atmospheric, cinematic interiors is the stunning output ofTodd Hido,Sally MannandWilliam Eggleston, then Reservations deserves to be among them.View image in fullscreenIdiosyncratic… Keaton’s first monograph was of classic hotel interiorsPhotograph: Diane Keaton/KnopfKeaton’s passion for the visual went back to childhood. She was inspired by her mother, Dorothy Deanne Keaton Hall,a keen collagistand photographer herself. For Dorothy, looking was “a dedicated endeavour”. In the foreword for one book, her daughter writes: “The simple, sturdy, and reliable Brownie Hawkeye camera manufactured by Kodak documented our family from 1949 through 1956.”Young Diane cut out pictures of Cary Grant from magazines to make collages. In her 20s, the actor would make large-scale photomontages –up to seven feet wide– and though she spent a life constantly creating, she characterised herself only “as a person who cuts out paper, throws it up on the wall, or finds old photographs that I see at the swap meet [flea market]”, and wielded her camera unassumingly.Annie Hall describes heraesthetic criteriato Alvy thus: “To me it’s all instinctive. I just try to feel it and get a sense of it; to not think about it so much.”Keaton too: “I shoot the pictures, but I’m not doing them in any big way. I just like it. I like images. If I see a tree that looks unusual, I’ll just take a picture of it.”View image in fullscreenStriking … woman attacked by pigeons, Trafalgar Square, London, 1981, by Diane KeatonPhotograph: Diane Keaton/Rizzoli“I’m addicted to photographs and photography books,” she toldthe Hollywood Reporterin 2023. She had more than60 scrapbooksof disparate accumulated images and kept Sophie Calle’sBlindon her nightstand, to remind her of the magic of sight; thatlooking is a dedicated endeavour.In anessayfor New York Review of Books, Larry McMurtry once described his first meeting with Keaton: “I found her, one morning, sitting in the flower bed outside the Madison Hotel in Washington DC. She was rummaging in a bag big enough to hold a caribou, which contained a camera heavy enough to stun the caribou with, should that be necessary.”In addition to Reservations, Keaton released several other art books: collections of her own work behind the lens; edited volumes of pictures by arcane or wholly anonymous names; found images from adverts, newspaper archives, auction job lots and the damp basements of production companies. And, often, a mishmash of all of the above. Many of these tomes she put together with her creative partner, writer and curator Marvin Heiferman.View image in fullscreenDolores Gray and her poodle companions, from Still Life, published in 1983Photograph: Callaway EditionsStill Life: Hollywood Tableaux Photographs(1983), is a study of Technicolor Hollywood comprising a plethora of studio stills, diorama-like on-set formation posing and publicity shots for magazine profiles. Fred Astaire eating soup; Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman sunbathing;Dolores Gray in a pink Silverline convertiblewith two poodles and a matching haircut. Gregory Peck was so annoyed about a portrait of his that was included that he wrote Keaton a bad-tempered letter.Keaton described the staged photos as “sad puzzles that filled me with curiosity … the most believable thing about the photographs is the absence of these people’s inner presence. I was seduced by what wasn’t being told.” Or, as Philip Larkinwould put it, the record of “hold-it smiles as frauds”. Or, as Instagram would put it: yes.InMr Salesman(1993) Keaton and Heifermann collated stills from mid-century sales-training videos. Instead of the cheesy, saturated photos of overtly grinning reps that one might expect, there is a noir-like, Lynchian feel to the book. The subjects of the photographs might be the most conformist cogs of capitalism, and the door-to-door grind utterly prosaic, but the black and white images are frequently surreal and unnerving. A silhouette of a man standing half in shadow, power stance, hat held by his side, the patterns of light and shade bring to mindAlexander Rodchenkoor Garry Winogrand. There is Brylcreem and there are brogues, but there’s also an insidious creepiness, a subtle menacing.View image in fullscreenPages from Twin Palms Publishers book of Diane KeatonPhotograph: Twin Palms PublishersIn 1999, the pair publishedLocal News, a compendium of 92 photographs from the archives of the defunct tabloidLos Angeles Herald Express. “These portraits are a stockpile of neglected treasures,” Keaton wrote in the book’s introduction. “This book honours them; it honours the pretty, the hopeful, the ordinary, the murdered, the ugly, the tortured, the smug, the guilty, the lost and found … Each human face is a compelling mystery, that looks back at us like a mirror reflecting the absolute fact that we live, we die, we are forgotten.”While much of Keaton’s own work was monochrome, 2002’sClown Paintings, a collaboration with gallerist Robert Berman– with written contributions by Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd, Whoopi Goldberg and more – was a bomb in a paint factory. A collection of 66 clown portraits by amateur artists, some of which Keaton owned (and had once loaned to the Warhol Museum), these clowns refused to be neglected, refused to be ordinary. Keaton was as “mesmerised by their mute eloquence as she was by their bad taste”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: RizzoliKeaton returned to including her own work inSaved: My Picture World(2022), sold as a “visual autobiography”. Pigeons were the subject of some striking shots taken in London’s Trafalgar Square, 1981. (If someone were to make a list of the best pigeon photographs,this oneby John Speirs must surely be top, but one of Keaton’s could easily take second place; although perhaps we must also consider the photographstaken by actual pigeons).Keatondescribedhow the birds took her mind off filming a demanding part inReds(for which she later earned an Academy Award nomination). “I’m not sure why I began taking pictures of the pigeons,” she wrote. “It might have been due to their constant manic swooping down on hundreds of tourists who seemed to enjoy the outrageously close proximity of our so-called feathered friends.” Upon her death the animal rights charity PETA released astatementpraising Keaton’s lifelong love for animals (she adored her golden retriever, Reggie) but which specifically mentioned her fondness for pigeons.Another segment in Saved has Keaton turning her camera on Hollywood Boulevard to capture its lower-key denizens: Z-listers, street performers, studio greeters. “Instead of choosing to capture fabulous movie stars I was in search of the so-called ‘toss aways’. I thought of them much in the same manner I think of myself … just one more lost soul searching for some kind of redemption,” she said.Keaton was never recognised as the actor she was when taking the pictures, but not everyone approved of the side hustle: “I remember taking shots of a particularly dapper older gentleman who spotted my flash, ran after me and threw a bag of french fries at my head.”View image in fullscreenOverlooked … street portraits from Saved, published in 2022.Photograph: Diane Keaton/RizzoliKeaton’s unnamed portraits of Tinseltown were another facet of her obsession with the overlooked, the understudied, the forgotten. But really, she was interested in everything. One chapter in Saved is devoted to “Clinical Diagnoses of Diseases of the Mouth”, with images from a particularly gruesome flea-market find.Keaton’s other image-led books (she also wrote two memoirs) are testament to those wide range of interests and predilections. There isFashion First(2024) with a foreword by Ralph Lauren; a personal exploration of her fashion and clothing choices. Her love of architecture and design is reflected inCalifornia Romantica(2008),an assortment of photos which celebrate the stucco walls, clay tile roofs and prominent arches of the California Mission andSpanish Colonial Revivalstyles (introduced by DJ Waldie).House(2012) details neglected farmhouses and crumbling warehouses, whereasThe House That Pinterest Built(2017) evaluated how she planned her entire home using the online image board, as well as offering interiors tips for readers.Keaton was also a champion of the unsung talents of others. When she acquired a 40-year-old box of 20,000 negatives which turned out to be the work of a commercial photographer in Fort Worth – Bill Wood – Keaton curated them into a book (Bill Wood’s Business, published in 2008) and an accompanying exhibition to safeguard the quirks and minutiae of American social and cultural life. Afterwards, she donated the lot to the International Center of Photography.InDead of Night(2021), Keaton and photographer Nick Reid edited a book of eerie pictures of car crashes taken by a county coroner called Robert H Boltz (Keaton had bought his archive).Chiaroscuro images with an eldritch quality, they are an unsettling combination of violence and silence.View image in fullscreenUnsettling … Robert H Boltz’s Dead of Night, a book edited by Keaton.Photograph: Robert H. Boltz/Twin Palms PublishersAnd Keaton supplied aforewordfor a collection of Ron Galella’s – the notorious pioneer of US paparazzi culture – prints. “Every person featured in this book had a relationship with Ron Galella,” she wrote. “Some denied it.”She was a zealous and steadfast preservationist of artistic and cultural achievement, whether that be her troubled brother’s writing and photographs (published inBrother & Sister, 2020), or when sitting for two decades on the board of theLA Conservancy. (Keaton helped to savetwo Frank Lloyd Wright homes, one of which she lived in; and attempted to protect the Los AngelesAmbassador Hotel, one of her subjects in Reservations, and the location of Robert F Kennedy’s assassination).View image in fullscreenEnnis House by Frank Lloyd Wright, one of many properties Keaton campaigned to save.Since her death last week, the entertainment industry has paid homage to Keaton as a brilliant actor and fashion icon – correct – but her legacy should also include her influence in the domains of visual art, design and architecture. Especially, as the New Yorker critic and Keaton’s friend Janet Malcolm once described it, the“mordant melancholy”of the Rolleiflex images Keaton produced. In 2008, whenpresented with the Trustee awardby the International Center of Photography, Keaton explained her raison d’être for documenting, collecting, curating: “So much is forgotten and destroyed in our culture. We all long to be remembered.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyDiane KeatonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her sister, who has an MBA, took care of the administrative tasks. It was the first time the family had all lived together since Katrina was in high school. The lockdown was a “very challenging, wonderful” time, she says.At first, the division of responsibilities between the two sisters worked well. But slowly, Katrina started to feel there was “scope creep”. Instead of staying in her administrative lane, her sister started weighing in more and more on Katrina’s management of medical matters.“I got to see a side of my sister that I don’t particularly like,” Katrina says. “It’s probably the same for her.”When their parents died soon after, it was “next level stress on top of grief on top of exhaustion”, Katrina recalls. Although she feels that she and her sister did an excellent job of caring for their parents, her relationship with her sister has never fully recovered. “We never did a debrief, and there’s a lot hanging out there,” she says.As older generations live longer, more adults find themselves providing some or most of the care for their ageing parents. According to 2023 data from theUS Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 37.1 million people, or roughly 14% of the population, provide unpaid eldercare in the United States. In the UK, 3.3 million adults, age 40-60, currently care for or support at least one ageing parent, per the charityAge UK.Adults must often coordinate their parents’ care with adult siblings, and it can be complicated. Twenty-seven Guardian readers shared their stories of caring for parents with their adult siblings. For some, like Katrina, family relationships fractured.Laura Russell, 60, has three older brothers. Single, with no children, she has been entirely responsible for her parents’ care for years, a commitment that has required her to shift her education and career goals. “I didn’t have much choice,” Russell says of the situation.Two of her brothers didn’t visit at all when her mother was ill and dying of Alzheimer’s, and since then, she has been alone in taking care of her 84-year-old father, with whom she has a difficult relationship.Her brothers, all of whom lived far from her and her parents, “were not willing to change their lives”, Russell says. “My choices were to care for [my parents] myself, or walk away and let them live in a care facility.”Russell makes all the care decisions. And while her brothers don’t question her judgment, she resents that they haven’t helped more.In the US, not even $11,000 a month can buy you dignity at the end of your lifeRead moreOther families have been able to emerge stronger than before.Dom Sutton, 63, from Oklahoma, says he feels closer to his two younger brothers since they began managing their parents’ medical care and finances together. Dom’s youngest brother is the primary point person because he lives closest to their mom and dad, and Dom says, “he keeps the whole family aware of any issues, and reaches out to us if he needs help.”How families respond to this upheaval depends on their shared history and how they have navigated difficult situations in the past.“When you have to start caretaking for an ageing parent, it triggers all the old family dynamics,” says Dr Yasmine Saad, founder of Madison Park Psychological Services.Saad says families and siblings often come to her hoping for advice on navigating the logistical difficulties of caretaking. But generally, logistics are just the surface of the problem.“They want our help figuring out tasks, and who is going to do what, and how we can coordinate better,” says Saad. “But what they quickly discover is that really, the issue is about who was always the favorite child, who was perceived to be more loved than the other, and who was the one who always had more responsibilities and felt others were not carrying their weight.”Because family caretaking can trigger old wounds, it is also an opportunity to address and heal those wounds, Saad says.Healing old woundsTessa H, 52 (last name withheld for privacy) said that in caring for her ageing father as an adult, she realized she was no longer OK with her father’s bullying and scapegoating.Confronting this old, well-established family dynamic created a serious rift with her father, she says, and made him unwilling to accept her care.Her brother had his own health troubles. But Tessa says that as he healed and was able to take on a bigger role, he saw how challenging Tessa’s relationship with their father had become and offered to manage most of the caretaking duties.The experience has made Tessa feel closer to and more supported by her brother: “When my brother told me that I didn’t have to keep trying to force care on my father, I felt relieved and very seen.”One way to reduce conflict is to be proactive and have difficult conversations early. First, with the parents, so they can express what they would like to have happen as they age. But Saad also suggests that when parents begin to need care, or ideally before, siblings get together and have each person share what a fair division of responsibility might look like to them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given everyone’s different and occasionally conflicting feelings, how can the group come to a solution that feels relatively fair for everyone?For example, if one sibling lives closer to the parents, they often end up being the ones doing most of the caretaking – a situation that can lead to burnout and resentment. But there are ways for other siblings to lighten their load, says Crystal Thorpe, a mediator and conflict coach at the adult family mediation group Elder Decisions. This is significantly easier now because many services can be managed online.Thorpe says she’s seen geographically distant family members provide care by visiting parents and offering respite to the primary caregiver, ordering grocery deliveries, scheduling appointments, managing bills and finances, and “managing a family website where everyone can share information and stay informed”.Unfortunately, Saad says, the families who would most benefit from having conversations about fairness are often those who have the most difficult time doing so.“In some families, the wounds are so deep that they really need a psychologist to help facilitate” this kind of conversation, says Saad. Professional family mediators can also be helpful, says Thorpe.Preparing for the futureIf emotional conversations are not a family’s strong suit, they can still fend off future squabbles by getting the necessary paperwork in order.Key documents that parents should have in place for when they do need greater assistance are the power of attorney for legal and financial matters, and an advanced medical directive where they can specify who they want to make healthcare decisions for them if they cannot make their own, says Justine Sennott, senior attorney and estate planning department lead at PJI Law.Too often, Sennott says, people think of estate planning as primarily about the division and distribution of a relative’s assets after they have died.“The truth is, some people really need assistance while they’re still living,” she says.This also allows the parents to have a greater say in how their care is conducted. “Sometimes the parents don’t want [the caretaker] to be the kids,” Sennott says.I’m an expert on ageing. Here’s what I know about thriving in later life | Kerry BurnightRead moreIn even the most prepared families, the deterioration of a parent’s health is difficult for everyone. Thorpe says one of the keys to successful caregiving with siblings is not forgetting to maintain a relationship outside of your responsibilities.“Be present with your family members,” she says. “Show interest in what they are interested in and take time to listen to them.”Don’t forget to express respect and appreciation to each other either. And if things feel awkward and tense, try expressing that.“Even acknowledging and naming this can help relieve some of the underlying tension,” Thorpe says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how it can damage careers and relationships – even before prejudice takes its tollLucy KnightWed 15 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 04.20 EDTShareThere are times when Jay Spring believes he is “the greatest person on planet Earth”. The 22-year-old from Los Angeles is a diagnosed narcissist, and in his most grandiose moments, “it can get really delusional”, he says. “You are on cloud nine and you’re like, ‘Everyone’s going to know that I’m better than them … I’ll do great things for the world’.”For Spring, these periods of self-aggrandisement are generally followed by a “crash”, when he feels emotional and embarrassed by his behaviour, and is particularly vulnerable to criticism from others. He came to suspect that he may have narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) after researching his symptoms online – and was eventually diagnosed by a professional. But he doesn’t think he would have accepted the diagnosis had he not already come to the conclusion on his own. “If you try to tell somebody that they have this disorder, they’ll probably deny it,” he says – especially if they experience feelings of superiority, as he does. “They’re in a delusional world that they made for themselves. And that world is like, I’m the greatest and nobody can question me.”Though people have been labelled as narcissists for more than a century, it’s not always clear what is meant by the term. “Everyone calls everybody a narcissist,” says W Keith Campbell, psychology professor at the University of Georgia and a narcissism expert. The word is “used more than it should be” – but when it comes to a formal diagnosis, he believes many people hide it, as there is so much stigma around the disorder. A narcissist will tend to have “an inflated view of oneself”, “a lack of empathy”, and “a strategy of using people to bolster one’s self-esteem or social status through things like seeking admiration, displaying material goods, seeking power,” says Campbell. Those with NPD may be “extremely narcissistic”, to the point that “they’re not able to hold down stable relationships, it damages their jobs”, and they have a “distorted view of reality”, he says.Thoughup to 75%of people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are men, research from the University of London published last year suggests this figure does not mean there are fewer narcissistic women, but thatfemale narcissism is more often presented in the covert form(also defined as vulnerable narcissism), which is less commonly diagnosed. “Men’s narcissism tends to be a bit more accepted, just kind of like everything in society,” says Atlanta-based Kaelah Oberdorf, 23, who posts about her NPD and borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnoses onTikTok. It is not uncommon to see the two disorders co-occur.I’ve never cared about anyone really, so I’ve never taken relationships seriously“I really struggle with handling criticism and rejection,” says Oberdorf , “because if I hear that the problem is me, I either go into defence mode or I completely shut down.” Despite having this response – which is sometimes referred to as “narcissistic injury”, she has been trying to overcome it and take advice from her loved ones, as she doesn’t want to slip into the harmful behaviour of her past. “I was very emotionally abusive to my partners as a teenager,” she says. Through dialectical behavioural therapy, she has been able to mitigate her NPD symptoms, and she says she and her current boyfriend “have a dynamic where I told him, ‘If I say something messed up, if I say something manipulative, call it out right then and there’.”Oberdorf grew up primarily in the care of her fatherand says she lackedpositive role models as a child.“I’ve been learning all this timewhat isand is not appropriate to say during a fight because I never had that growing up,” she says. “Nothing was off-limits when my family members were insulting me when I was growing up.”View image in fullscreenKaelah Oberdorf: ‘Nothing was off-limits when family members were insulting me when I was growing up.’Personality disorders tend to be associated with difficulties as a child. “There is a genetic component,” says Tennyson Lee, an NHS consultant psychiatrist who works at the DeanCross personality disorder service in London. But, when someone develops narcissistic traits, it is often “linked to that individual’s particular early environment”. Those traits were “their strategy in some ways to survive at a very early age”, he adds, when they may have been neglected, or only shown love that was conditional on meeting certain expectations. They then “continue to use those same mechanisms as adults”.Like several of the NPD-diagnosed people I speak to, John (not his real name) thinks his parents “may be narcissists themselves”. The 38-year-old from Leeds says when he was a child, “everything was all about them and their work and their social life. So it was like, stay out of our way.” When their focus was on him, it came in the form of “a great amount of pressure” to achieve good grades and career success, he says, which made him feel that if he didn’t meet their standards, he wasn’t “good enough”.When he became an adult, none of his relationships ever worked out. “I’ve never cared about anyone really,” he says. “So I’ve never taken relationships seriously.” He didn’t think he was capable of loving someone, until he met his current partner of three years, who is diagnosed with BPD, so, like him, struggles with emotional regulation. She is “really understanding of the stuff that goes on in my head”, he says – it was actually she who first suspected he might have NPD.After a visit to his GP, John was referred to a clinical psychologistfor an assessment and was told his diagnosis. He has been referred for talking therapy on the NHS (a long period of therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to help NPD patients, says Lee), but has been on the waiting list for a year and a half: “They said it is probably going to be maybe February or March next year.”John has only told a handful of people about his NPD diagnosis, because “there’s a big stigma that all narcissists are abusers”, but, privately, he has accepted it. “It helps me to understand myself better, which is always a good thing,” he says. All of the people I speak to have accepted their narcissism and are seeking help for it – hence being willing to talk about it – which is probably not representative of all people with the disorder. But the existence of NPD content creators such as Oberdorf andLee Hammock, and the growth of online support communities, suggest that more narcissists are openly acknowledging the issues they face – and the ones they may be causing for others.“Seeing that you’re not alone in what you’re struggling with, being able to talk to other people who relate to you and maybe hearing coping mechanisms” are reasons why reddit userPhteven_j(who would like to remain anonymous) started joining in conversations about NPD online. Now a moderator of ther/NPDsubreddit, the 37-year-old software engineer thinks he and his co-moderators are “pretty good about not encouraging disordered behaviour” and ensuring “it’s not a breeding ground for any sort of negative or disorder behaviour and more of a place where you can try to improve”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Pete Reynolds/The GuardianAlthough, in volunteering as a moderator, “I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t seeking out some kind of position of authority” – which arguably stems from NPD symptoms – Phteven_j believes the subreddit is largely a force for good. However, the slew of reddit users wanting to complain about narcissists (and sometimes even the existence of a subreddit that acts as a support group for them) “is constant” he says. Across the internet, narcissists are often “painted as almost like supervillains” and the stories shared are often from the perspective of those who have been abused by someone they believe to be a narcissist. “The advice is, typically, the same: run away, you’ve got to leave them, don’t ever talk to them again,” the moderator says.Oberdorf is also critical of the way narcissism is discussed online.Social mediausers have accused her of “bragging” about her personality disorders because she lists them on her profiles and discusses them in her content. “I’m not bragging about the fact that I have debilitating mental illness,” she says. “I am proud of the fact that I have survived with mental illnesses that statistically could have taken my life.” She is keen to open up more conversations about NPD – “stigma is the number one worst thing for any illness ever”.View image in fullscreenJay Spring: ‘A narcissist wanting to believe they are the best is coping with the feeling they are the worst.’In this age of selfies and thirst traps, it can feel that narcissism must be on the rise. But just because there are now more outlets for narcissistic behaviour, prevalence of the clinical condition doesn’t seem to be increasing, says Lee. It’s worth noting, Campbell adds, that “social media is making people feel worse about themselves”, and, for most people, “it doesn’t make them feel positive about themselves or think they’re awesome”.The way NPD diagnoses are made is “suboptimal”, however, according to Lee. Most of the research on NPD has been done in the US, where a paperpublished by the American Psychiatric Associationestimates the disorder is found in 1%–2% of the population. “If you make the diagnosis, then it’s made on the [American Psychiatric Association’s] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) guidelines, where it only captures an aspect of narcissism, which is the more overt, sort of aggressive type of narcissism, but it doesn’t capture the more covert or sensitive form,” says Lee.There are two most commonly talked about types of narcissism. The first is the “grandiose” or “overt” form, which manifests in stereotypically narcissistic behaviours such as aggression and attention-seeking. The second is a “vulnerable” or “covert” narcissist, which is “the kind of individual the clinician might miss, because they often come across as far more contained, even self-effacing at times”, Lee says. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism “are different sides of the same coin”, he says. Both types will have an inflated sense of their own importance, but for a covert narcissist that may mean a hypersensitivity to criticism or a victim mentality rather than a desire to put themselves in the spotlight.Campbell points out that there is a risk of narcissists “using social media to maintain their narcissism”, as it can be a tool “to get favourable attention or positive feedback”, but does see the benefit of positive role models and support for people with NPD. When a celebrity, such as the American comedianNick Cannon in 2024, “comes out with NPD and says it’s causing me problems, that’s a great message,” says Campbell, “that’s a great message”.Lee, too, is wary of social media being used to educate or as a support system for people with NPD, “because there’s so much misinformation”. But he believes “more structured” information is missing, particularly in the NHS. “The service for narcissistic individuals is very uneven throughout the UK” and “many clinicians don’t make the diagnosis of narcissism”, Lee says, partly because they aren’t primed to notice it, and partly out of reluctance to make a diagnosis that is perceived so negatively. The symptoms of NPD also mean that “if a narcissist is successfully leading their life, even though they might have quite a strong level of narcissism, they’re not going to seek treatment”. When a patient with NPD does seek help, it is often because they have suffered negative consequences of their narcissistic behaviour, or a partner or family member has encouraged them.Spring wishes people would reframe the way they think about narcissists. “A narcissist is attempting to believe that they are the best because that is the coping mechanism for feeling like: ‘I am the worst,’” he says. “There’s something missing with me and I need to be in this fantasy world where I’m the hero because maybe in my childhood I was the villain and now I need to overcompensate for that.”NPD is clearly a condition that requires psychological help, but Oberdorf can understand why narcissists don’t seek it: “If you have a problem, and you are constantly being told that people with your type of specific problem are unworthy, or they’re evil, or they’re horrible people because of this problem, why would you want to admit that you have that problem?”Explore more on these topicsMental healthRelationshipsHealthSocial mediaDigital mediaHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often relegated to less exciting regions of the fruit bowl, they actually come in a dizzying array of varieties – sharp, sweet, floral, crisp – and each with their own quirks. And now is the time to celebrate apples, so this week I’m giving them the attention they deserve in a no-bake toffee apple pie (banoffee’s autumn cousin) and a soft, cinnamon-spiced crumb cake.Toffee apple pie (pictured top)You will need a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin.Prep10 minCook1 hr 10 minChill2 hr+Serves8-10For the case275g digestive biscuits¼ tsp fine sea salt1 tsp ground cinnamon140g unsalted butter,meltedFor the caramelised apples500g apples, I used braeburn, but pink lady work well, too70gcaster sugar30gbutter1 tsp lemon juiceFor the sour cream whip50g sour cream250ml double cream25g caster sugarTo assemble397g tindulce de leche(I used Carnation)25g roasted hazelnuts,roughly choppedFor the biscuit base, blitz or bash the digestives into fine crumbs. Mix in the salt and cinnamon, then pour in the melted butter and mix well until it has the texture of very wet sand and clumps together when you give it a gentle squeeze. Press evenly into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin (put a disc of baking paper on the base for an easier release later), starting with the edges and working your way into the base. Put the tin in the fridge to firm up.Meanwhile, peel and core the apples, then cut them into even slices, about 1cm wide (you should have about 400g). In a low, wide frying pan, add the caster sugar and heat over a medium-high heat until it starts to melt, caramelise, and even burn in places – three to four minutes. Add the butter and apples, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture come to a bubble. Lower the heat, then simmer the apples in the juices for about 10 minutes, or until tender. (Depending on the variety, you might get a mixture of mushier and firmer pieces.) Stir in the lemon juice, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.To assemble, beat the dulce de leche until smooth, then spread evenly over the biscuit base. Arrange the apple slices (avoiding the juices) on top in slightly overlapping concentric circles and in a single layer. Reserve the apple caramel juices for finishing the tart.Whip all the ingredients for the sour cream whip together until you get soft peaks. Pile the cream on top of the apples, giving it a pleasing swoop. Arrange the hazelnuts on top, then finish with drizzles of the caramelised apple juices. Chill for two to three hours before serving.Apple crumb loafView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s apple crumb loaf.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 minServes6-8You will need a 21.5cm x 11.5cm x 6cm loaf pan.For the cake2medium-sized eating apples1½tspcinnamon150gunsalted butter75gcaster sugar100glight brown sugar2eggs,about 100g1 tsp vanilla extract150gplain flour50gwholemeal flour1 tspbicarbonate of soda (6g)¼ tsp fine saltFor the crumb40g light brown sugar60gplain flourA pinch of salt30goats40gbutter,meltedHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Halve and core one apple (no need to peel), then cut it into 2mm slices (you should get about 120-130g). Toss with the cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Grate the other apple on the coarse side of a box grater – you need about 100g.For the cake, cream the butter and sugars for about two minutes until slightly pale and about one and a half times their original volume. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition, followed by the grated apple and vanilla extract. Stir through the dry ingredients to form a batter.Line the loaf tin with baking paper, then spoon in about 80% of the mixture. Arrange the thinly sliced cinnamon apples on top in overlapping layers, then top with the remaining mixture, smoothing the top. Bake for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the crumb. Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl (you can use the cinnamon apple bowl for less washing up!), then pour in the melted butter and mix again until a crumb forms.Carefully remove the cake from the oven and sprinkle the oat crumb all over the top. Return to the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the tin before serving.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.

Read the terms and conditions very carefully to make sure you are not caught out.Amazon Prime has a 30-day free trial, allowing you to check out shows such as The Girlfriend. Apple TV+ is running a free seven-day trial – maybe enough time to work your way through The Morning Show or Severance – as is Hayu (“the home of reality TV”). Netflix does not currently offer free trials.Often you can only sign up once, but depending on the rules, if there are several people in the household, one person signing up after another may enable you to enjoy multiple trials with the same service.Toggle betweenservicesMany people are forking out for multipleTV streamingservices then not watching much (or anything) on one of them every month.You’re never going to get value for money if you are trying to watch three or four services at the same timeAndy Webb of Be Clever With Your CashIf that sounds like you, rotate your services to save cash. If you are on a rolling monthly contract, which most people are, you can bail out at any time, sign up again when there is a series you really do not want to miss, then jump ship once you have watched it.Andy Webb at the websiteBe Clever With Your Cashsays: “You’re never going to get value for money if you are trying to watch three or four services at the same time. So pick one, binge it, then move on to the next.”Quite a few TV shows and films are duplicated across two or more services – for example, at the time of writing, the Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis was on Netflix and Amazon Prime. TheJustWatchapp and website can help you find where the content you want to watch is available.Watch more adsSome TV streaming services charge less for plans with adverts. Disney+ now costs £5.99 a month with ads, while you will pay £9.99 for the ad-free option. Netflix’s with-ads plan is also £5.99.Some plans charge more for “better” picture and sound quality and the number of screens your household can watch at the same time. But are you paying for more than you need?Get it free with something elseLloyds Bank’s Club Lloyds current account lets you choose a different free perk every year, one of which is a 12-month “standard with ads” Disney+ subscription. This account has a £5 monthly fee that is refunded as long as you pay in £2,000 or more each month, so for many paying in their salary, that means their Disney+ is free. Barclays has just launched a similar offer where you get an Apple TV+ subscription.View image in fullscreenSome streaming services, such as Disney+, charge less for plans with adverts.Photograph: Chesnot/Getty ImagesMany mobile phone networks throw in cheap or free TV streaming. For example, if you are joining O2 or upgrading, you can get up to six months of Disney+ or Amazon Prime as your included “Extra”. EE has a number of offers where you can get at least three months of Apple TV+ thrown in.Apple TV+ is included free for three months when you buy an Apple deviceMeanwhile, Uber One, the ride-hailing app’s subscription service that usually costs £4.99 a month or £49.99 a year, sometimes throws in a free Disney+ subscription.Of course, many people buy Amazon Prime for fast-track delivery and exclusive shopping deals and then get the TV and movies, too. It costs £8.99 a month or £95 a year.Share subscriptionsYou can share your services – if the platform allows this, of course.“The biggest savings come from using multiuser plans, in my opinion,” says Hugo Cannon atCompareRock, a financial comparison platform.He highlights howNetflixPremium (£18.99 amonth) allows a household to watch four devices at the same time, and you can add up to two extra users who do not live with you for £4.99 each a month with ads or £5.99 without.Disney+ lets you add extra members for either £4.99 or £5.99 a month.Meanwhile, Apple TV+ lets you share your subscription with up to five family members.Pick Now instead ofSky“If you’re only interested in, for example, watching Premier League football on Sky, you can save money by getting a Now subscription instead of a full Sky package,” says Alex King at the finance platformGeneration Money.“With Now, you can get a subscription to a sports package via their app which gives you access to Sky’s Premier League football coverage without having a dish or box installed, and without being packaged up with other channels you don’t want,” he adds.View image in fullscreenIf want to watch Premier League football you can save money by getting a Now subscription instead of a full Sky package.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersPay annuallyIf you are committed to a particular streaming service, paying for a year upfront (where available) can save you money. However, the saving is not always great, and you need to be very sure you are going to make full use of it.As of 30 September, the Disney+ standard plan costs £9.99 a month or £99.90 for a year, so committing to a year results in a fairly decent saving of £19.98.

I mean, there are a thousand and one ways to tie a scarf or curate your necklaces or layer your knitwear – and I fully intend to bend your ear about all of them over the coming months – but at a pinch you could follow this single dictum, ignore absolutely all of the rest of it and be good to go.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Your coat needs to be long. That’s it, that’s the big news. If your coat reaches almost to your ankles, you will look as if you know your stuff style-wise. Like your hairstyle or the width of your jeans, the length of your coat is one of those details that is a fashion tell. It does not lie. It gives you away, for better or for worse. Someone walking towards you will register it, and it will place you on the style spectrum before they are close enough to see your face.I know, I know, we’re supposed to be over trends these days. But this is one of those big-picture shifts that is more than just a fad. What looks right has always changed over time, this is true of everything: architecture, clothes, the lettering and layout of a restaurant menu. All of it. So just because you don’t sweat the small stuff any more, fashion-wise, doesn’t mean you can’t take an interest in which way the winds of change are blowing, right?The plain, dark wool long coats that me and everyone else wore last winter are now joined by bold checks, full-length faux furs and long leather coatsSo it’s bye bye to knee-length coats, for now. Jackets are still fine, because that’s a totally different set of rules. But if you are wearing a Proper Coat, it should be well below your knees. The dapper, sharp, Crombie-esque knee length coat is to be relegated to the attic for now. Your outerwear should either end at your waist, hip or upper thigh, or continue down to your calves.As always with coats, the change in shape is partly about the clothes we are wearing underneath. Straight cut, knee-length coats were a logical top layer when our trousers were snug. But now trousers have got a little looser, a neat, snug fitting coat has the wrong proportions – so coats have got looser and longer in lockstep.View image in fullscreenRichard E Grant modelling for Burberry.Photograph: Estrop/WireImageI spent most of last winter in my beloved & Other Stories black coat – oversized wool with soft shoulders, full sleeves, a self-tie belt and a shin-grazing hemline – which I will be dragging down from its attic box shortly for a shakeout and some judicious ironing. This is an easy option, but the fashion news this season is that the long coat is growing in confidence and attitude.

So when both of them go big on a trend, we can be fairly confident of the fashion forecast. At MaxMara in Milan, cosy shearlings had dramatic, sumptuous collars and floor-sweeping hems. There was even a double layer of long, in a floor-length furry gilet worn open over a belted quilted ankle-length coat. In London, on the Burberry catwalk at Tate Britain, all the celebrity models – the images the brand knew would get the most eyeballs – featured long coats. Richard E Grant was swaddled in a giant’s dressing gown, the belt knotted, while Lesley Manville disproved the adage that you have to be tall to wear a long coat. Manville, a petite 1.57m (5ft 2in), wore an inky, devoré-flocked, tightly belted trenchcoat which stopped just a few inches above her ankles.It might feel a bit early to be talking winter coats, but it’s not. It would be good to start mulling this over, because it will shape your look this season. When we get into the coldest months of the year, your coat is pretty much all most people see.

I’ve been waiting months for the reformulation of Nars’The Multiple(£33) creamy lip, eye and cheek stick and it has overdelivered, even improving on the beloved original.

Forget the old symbols: swastikas, nooses, Confederate flags, skinheads’ shaved heads and combat boots. Extremism has a new look, and it is asfashionableas ever.Today’s extremist styles are more diverse and more subtle. Beyond T-shirts that advertise blatant racism, polo shirts with coded symbols create a shared in-group identity and signal support of violence to other believers. Tradwife-style prairie dresses and beauty regimens promote conservative visions of family. Clothing is a powerful tool to spread fascist ideas to promote authoritarianism and recruit new members to this cause.The far right’s weaponization of fashion to advance hateful ideas is not new. Fascist movements have long understood the power of aesthetics. In 1920s Italy, Benito Mussolini harnessed black shirts and the ancient Roman symbol of thefasces(a bundle of sticks with an axe, which stands for power and authority) to build his power and his brand. German clothier Hugo Boss, a card-carrying Nazi, produced the uniforms of the Schutzstaffel(SS) paramilitary and the Hitler Youth. Hate came with a slick, tailored look. In the US, the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan and burning crosses have long been trademarks of white supremacy. In the 1980s, the original fascists’ skinhead successors appropriated and repurposed bomber jackets, shaved heads and combat boots as their distinct form of military-ish chic.View image in fullscreenItalian dictator Benito Mussolini crafted a distinct, tailored, look for his forces. Their dark button-downs gave his much-feared volunteer militia and security detail its  ‘Blackshirt’ moniker.Photograph: BIPS/Getty ImagesNow, welcome to fascist fashion 3.0. The aesthetics of modern-day extremists are far reaching and mainstream. Even more so since 2017 and the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, fascist fashion – or fascion (an amalgam of “fashion” and “fascism”) – is now at your fingertips. Right-wing groups have their own labels, co-opt pre-existing fashion brands and hawk their wares online via TikTok and eBay.Much of this ideological apparel can evade notice – if you are not in the know. Instead of blunt hate-filled slogans, the far right uses language like “my favorite color is white” and “defending our culture” – vague messages that could be interpreted in different ways and offer plausible deniability (however tenuously, because who is the “we” and what “culture” is under siege and in need of protection? And nationalist rhetoric has long been a favorite tool of the right).From Nazi Germany to Trump’s America: why strongmen rely on women at homeRead moreCoded visual elements and references are instrumental to conveying the message, to those who know how to read it. Use of specific fonts associated with the Nazi regime or those that look faintly Germanic – with dark, peaked letters – help groups to embed their ideology in what seems like innocent slogans or visual cues.Sometimes, the references come from other cultures or subcultures; today’s reactionaries referenceNordic symbolsand imagery of “Valhalla”, as a nod to an imaginary past of white, hypermasculine Europe (FBI director Kash Patel’srecent promise to see slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Valhallaraised eyebrows). Gaming memes such as “Pepe the Frog”, which the alt-right has appropriated to convey antisemitic sentiments, also find their way into clothing.Sometimes the messages are even more coded. A T-shirt at aNationalsgame with the number 88 and the word “nationalist” above it might not draw attention, but the combination is a celebration of a neo-Nazi sentiment (88 is a well-known white supremacist numerical code for “Heil Hitler”; the letter “h” is the eighth letter of the English alphabet, and repeating it twice references the infamous salute).This new fashion no longer seeks to shock or to antagonize, but to appeal to a sense of identity and belonging, said Monica Sklar, associate professor of textiles, merchandising and interiors and curator of the Anne Barge Historic Clothing and Textiles Collection at the University of Georgia. “The idea is not being quite a subculture but to be embedded in the power structure. Instead of coding things to move away from the masses, this fashion is coding things to move into the masses,” and this is a purposeful shift.View image in fullscreenEnrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader, carries a megaphone at a Miami gathering. His clothing echoes group and fascist symbols such as a wreath, a common fascist symbol and a red, white, and blue shoutout to his organization.Photograph: Miami Herald/TNSTake, for example, a black polo shirt with white stripes at the hems of the sleeves and collar from the activewear brand Will2Rise. It is sold under the name “3.0 Perry Polo”, a reference to the famous British brand Fred Perry, whose black and yellow design was “hijacked” by the far-right groupProud Boyssince its founding in 2016. (In 2020, Fred Perrydiscontinuedthe model as a result). In the Will2Rise version, Fred Perry’s logo of golden laurels is replaced with a modern design of the white supremacistPatriot Frontlogo, which depicts an upright fasces surrounded by a circle.While valorization of masculine power and fitness is an important part of this new aesthetics, women – who are traditionally associated with fashion and adornment – also have a role in shaping the look. Adhering to traditional ideas of gender, the newRepublican lookof extreme plastic surgery and heavy makeup combines with tradwives’ 1950s dress silhouettes of cinched waists and flowery patterns to celebrate hyperfemininity.These styles not only allow their wearers to blend in, but they also play a role in normalizing an aesthetics of radicalism and violence. Sociologist and American University professor Cynthia Miller-Idriss, who studies extremism and polarization,has writtenthat “it is simply much harder to recognize ideas as hateful when they come in an aesthetic package that doesn’t fit the image people hold in their heads about what white supremacists look like”. When the radical right looks like the mythical boy and girl next door, it’s hard to know who can be a threat.View image in fullscreenIt’s a sea of floaty dresses at the Turning Point USA young women’s leadership summit in Grapevine, Texas, on 14 June. Tradwife style emphasizes the ultra-feminine.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesBut it is exactly this quality that enables extremist fashion to glide into the mainstream. Slogans like “White Life Matters” and other iconography found today on clothing and bumper stickers are reflecting sentiments that started much further to the right. Some of the symbols we see, like an image of a US flag where the stripes are made of machine guns, originated in the militia movement. By the time these items are circulating in the market, the message has been repackaged and toned down by a hair, but the ideas behind the symbols are the same.This is all part of the fashion cycle.To be sure, not every conservative or offensive outfit is fascist. Indeed, the lines between hate speech and hyperpatriotism can be blurry. As Sklar points out, “in the US, subcultural dress is much subdued, much more piecemeal,” and thus harder to define or recognize. Moreover, the wearer of these more mainstream, watered-down versions of fascist messages is not always aware of their extreme origins. However, sometimes, this fashionable choice is deliberate, and the decision of whether to expose it as such can entail great risks.To make things more complicated, as more extreme fashions migrate into the mainstream, we are becoming more desensitized to the ideas they represent. Fascism becomes a selling point with a commercial value. The Florida GOP is selling “Alligator Alcatraz” merchwithout fear of censure. If only a few years ago appealing to racist sentiments might have brought serious public backlash, today campaigns such asSydney Sweeney’s American Eagle jeanspromotion only bring more attention to the company. Even Charlie Kirk’s death became an opportunity; some companies are branding his assassin’s T-shirt as the “Charlie Kirk Land of the Free T-Shirt.”View image in fullscreen‘While in 2020, a Maga hat or a tradwife aesthetics would not be registered as fascist, by 2025, with Trump’s actions and statements becoming increasingly more authoritarian, those styles gain new meaning.’Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty ImagesFashion is not static. It changes all the time. What used to be in the margins a few years ago are now on trend. Brand identity can also shift. While in 2020, a Maga hat or a tradwife aesthetics would not be registered as fascist, by 2025, with Trump’s actions and statements becoming increasingly more authoritarian, those styles gain new meaning.Moreover, the Trump administration’s adoption of not only the Maga styles but those of the far right, aids in the shifting of the brand. Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, wearstattoosthat are associated with white supremacy. When Ice agents storm the streets of big cities with their ski masks, bullet-proof vests, and khakis, they often look more like the Patriot Front or the Three Percenters militia than representatives of the government.View image in fullscreenKristi Noem’s coiffed appearance has earned her the nickname ‘Ice Barbie’ among some opponents.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesBut this new visibility also makes it easier to expose the fascism and contradictions behind all the freedom talk. Kristi Noem’s impeccable curly hair extensions and heavy makeup has earned the homeland security secretary the nickname “Ice Barbie”. Her appearance came to define the cruelty of the administration’s immigration policies. As more people associate certain fashions and symbols with actions and policies they oppose, the less appealing they become.Like we learned to recognize the more traditional fascist symbols, we are now learning to identify the new visual language of the right. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis warned in his novel, It Can’t Happen Here, that when fascism comes to the US it won’t look like the European brand. Instead, it would be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. In 2025, we also know that it wears a Maga hat and an Ice vest.This article was amended on 15 October 2025. An earlier version said that Hugo Boss designed the uniforms of the Schutzstaffel paramilitary and the Hitler Youth. In fact, the company produced the uniforms, not designed them. Also an earlier version incorrectly said that the font Fraktur was associated with the Nazi regime.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sitting on the rocks is a man with five raffish dogs that immediately start prowling around me and my partner, Sophie. A wet nose touches my bare calf.Every long-distance trek has these decisive moments. TheSouth West Coast Pathhas plenty. Should we stay on the beach, or take to the cliff? What’s the tide doing? And, more immediately, are these dogs going to bite my bum? It has happened to me once before.Map of south east Cornwall showing places mentioned on the walk“Nice dogs.”The man shrugs. “They’re all right.”That’s that sorted then.“Is there a way up the cliff, off that beach?”“See the rock?” He points into the far distance where a headland juts out. “Just before that, look for the blue rope. It’s a scramble.” He looks at us, like the director of Poldark assessing extras for a gruelling fight scene with Aidan Turner. “You should manage. Tide’s going out.” He gives a sly grin. “Lovely day for it.”View image in fullscreenRed sandstone rock at ‘pretty’ Cawsand.Photograph: Kevin Britland/AlamyWe thank him and set off. Every journey has its turning points, I reflect, especially when you push off from the safe haven of the guidebook and OS map into the uncharted waters of local knowledge. Boots crunching into shingle, I wonder why he grinned like that. Have we been duped?I first came to the South West Coast Path as a teenager in 1978 when I heard on the radio that the entire 630-mile route was open. The statistics were what captured my imagination: climb four times the height of Everest, embark on 13 ferries, scale 436 stiles and pass 4,000 signs. That averaged out at one sign every 250 metres, on a path where the sea is always on one side. It was, I told my sceptical parents, impossible to get lost.With a schoolmate, I hitchhiked to Plymouth where we immediately got lost and spent a miserable night in a concrete underpass. Next day, having hitched to Penzance, we began walking west and made it to Land’s End. It was less than heroic, but over subsequent years I’ve done a lot more of the path, perhaps even most of it. I did not, however, go back to Plymouth. Bad memories. Now I discover that the path west of the city is considered the “forgotten” section, the bit least visited. That intrigues me.The plant life is a never-ending joy, from the tiny details of delicate ferns to the huge columns of giant viper’s buglossA glance at the map shows how modern road and rail links into Cornwall from Plymouth bypass a sizeable peninsula of land, theRame, formed by the English Channel, Plymouth Sound, and the rivers Lynher and Tamar. Before those car and train routes were built, travellers bound for Cornwall would usually cross the Rame. They would go down to the city docks and get themselves rowed across the Hamoaze, as this stretch of the Tamar is known, no doubt weaving through a chaotic throng of smacks, sloops, gigs and galleons. In 1811, one such traveller was the artist JMW Turner, who had himself ferried across, then set off walking around the coast, carrying six blank sketchbooks, lots of pencils and a fishing rod. He had been commissioned to contribute to one of the first tourist guides,Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England. We are walking the same route, but in the opposite direction.Back on the beach at Downderry, having checked the tide times on my phone, we decide to trust in the blue rope. At a point where the cliff leaves only a few feet of shingle to pass, we discover why the helpful dog-owner had grinned. There is a naked man standing in the shallows.British naturism often seems to feature pot-bellied middle-aged men staring out to sea like goose-pimpled Gormley statues. Battern Cliffs, I discover later, is an informal naturist beach.View image in fullscreenThe folly at Mount Edgcumbe Country Park.Photograph: Dual Aspect Photography/AlamyFurther down the strand, past a couple more quasi-Gormleys, we find the blue rope and scramble up through a beautiful cool forest of holm oaks. The plant life on this walk is a never-ending joy: from the tiny details of delicate ferns and spleenworts to the huge columns of giant viper’s bugloss and this sepulchral forest. Buried within the shade, we find the ruins of a Victorian folly, St Germans Hut, and connect back to the coastal path, strolling in sunshine along the tops all the way to Portwrinkle.When Turner came here, Cornwall was not the tourist honeypot of today. Just a few years before he arrived, the oracle of what was “picturesque”, the Rev William Gilpin, had denounced the county as being “without a single beauty to recommend it”. Other grandees were equally scathing: “brooding evil” and “hideous and wicked” were among the kinder comments. Turner, however, led the vanguard in reassessment, filling his notebooks with quick-fire sketches that deftly captured the spirit of the land.Wet and wild: the magic of Cornwall in winterRead moreAfter a night in a friendly B&B in Sheviock (the owners take us to their favourite pub, the defiantly quirkyRod and Linein Tideford), we rejoin the path at Whitsand golf course. Soon after that, we encounter the biggest irritation of the South West Coast Path, one Turner never had to contend with: the Ministry of Defence. Red flags are flying over Tregantle Down and we’re forced to use the road. I know the Russians are about to invade and we should get ready, but surely they will be repulsed when they see our coastal Gormleys?Despite the MoD, the next section up to and around Rame Head is one of the best, skirting secret little sandy coves and finishing along Plymouth Sound into the pretty village of Cawsand. This place has a fine seafood restaurant,The Bay, and some good pubs. (There is also afoot passenger summer ferryto Plymouth if you want to skip ahead.)We stay the night nearby, then walk through the shady 865-acreMount Edgcumbecountry park. The gardens are filled withcamellia varieties, but I’ve just missed the flowers, sadly.

The sun is shining and there are warships manoeuvring out in the Sound. We stroll around to theHoewhere, during the summer of 1815, huge crowds gathered to watch a pot-bellied middle-aged man stare out to sea from the deck of another warship, the 74-gun Battle of Trafalgar veteran, HMS Bellerophon. Her cargo was the captured Emperor Napoleon, held here before being shipped to Saint Helena. The crowds cheered, causing outrage in some quarters.We wander down to therefurbished lidoand spot a set of steps and terraces.

I knew little about dachshunds, that odd-shaped breed with short legs and suspicious eyes. But during pandemic lockdowns I began scrolling PetRescue the way friends were swiping Tinder, and with just as little luck.So when I spotted her, I prepared for disappointment. I had recently been ghosted by an elderly chap with a heart condition. I had visions of giving him his golden senior years; he had better prospects.Yet, somehow, McKenzie was suddenly mine. My first dog. I’d never lived with one before and worried I had romanticised dog ownership. I read all the books and watched all the YouTube videos, but how would I really fare with the training, the barking, the poo?It wasn’t love at first sight. On the drive home, McKenzie and I were both stressed and baffled. I was resolute about only one thing: she wouldn’t sleep in my bed. I placed her new bed beside mine.My heart exploded into a million pieces and reassembled into the shape of a sausage dogMcKenzie had other ideas. She kept plopping on to my bed in the dark until, too tired to fight her, I gave in. Tomorrow’s problem.The next morning, I woke to find her lying on her back under the covers, her little paws poking out, her ears splayed like wings. My heart exploded into a million pieces and reassembled into the shape of a sausage dog.Before I adopted McKenzie, I thought I wanted a happy lapdog. A best friend. I named my imaginary dog Mr Cookie – a scruffy, cheerful, ball-chasing dog. Maybe not the brightest banana, but so smiley.Instead I got this mournful-looking hound whose eyes speak of existential crisis. McKenzie doesn’t chase balls. Despite being one-foot tall, she hunts cats, cars, skateboarders and drones indiscriminately. In the dog park she shouts at dogs 10 times her size like a short, angry German personal trainer.VIP appearances, books and beer: what Valerie the dachshund is up to after her Kangaroo Island adventureRead moreMcKenzie’s separation anxiety causes her to pace, howl and scratch at the door whenever I leave her. For a long time she was my constant sidekick while we figured things out, which bothered me less that it should have. By now I’m too in love with this ridiculous, beautiful animal.My home has filled with dog ramps and dachshund paraphernalia. I’ve been given long-dog coasters, blankets, doormats, brooches, mugs and paperclips. Paperclips! The best bit is I don’t even mind.A lifelong city girl, I moved to the mountains because I longed for a garden my solar-powered dog could sunbathe and snoot about in.Watching McKenzie gambol off-lead at our local dog park, I’m joyfully in the moment. There’s nothing like the strut of a satisfied dachshund butt to lift the spirits and calm an anxious mind.View image in fullscreen‘No one warned me dachshunds are like tattoos; it’s hard to stop at one.’ McKenzie and Elodie having some quiet time together.Photograph: Debbie ElkindShe’s a happy constant through injury, depression and grief – a reason to get out in the sunshine, her soft furry weight by my side, her nose nudging me back to hope. In one particularly dark moment, she licked tears from my face and collapsed into my side in a full body hug that reminded me we’ll be OK, and that I’m not alone.No one warned me dachshunds are like tattoos; it’s hard to stop at one. Two years later I adopted another, this one with even greater psychological damage. Number two, Elodie, was impulsively acquired because I’m a sucker for her sad story. The product of a back yard breeder, she is equal parts adorable and broken. She howls at everyone and everything in a jarringly high-pitched yelp. A friend nicknamed her Psycho Muppet. She’s more of a slow burn to love but in time my heart expanded again, reconfiguring to fit two needy sausages. I love watching them spooning in our bed, a dachshund croissant. My found family on eight legs.I didn’t plan on one sausage dog, let alone two.

On TikTok and Instagram, living intentionally means operating on the highest plane of existence: each moment is the product of heartfelt planning, part of the careful pursuit of a life flawlessly lived. Perhaps you intentionally spend half an hour after work decompressing, then put on your carefully curated playlist while you intentionally work out, intentionally choosing exercises that center your mind and body while also giving you huge forearms, before intentionally preparing dinner using locally sourced ingredients.As Marie Solis wrote inthe New York Timesrecently: “You can just do all of these things. Or you can do them ‘intentionally’.” The fear, it seems, is that a failure to act with purpose means letting life happen to you.Intentionality has become inescapable – along with daily activities, the word is used to describe therapy and dating, and of course has been co-opted by brands, such as Rhode’s “intentional skin care”. That is not to be confused, I guess, with accidental skincare, which may mean stumbling into CVS and grabbing blindly at the shelf without spending hours reading reviews first. At its best, intentionality means taking care and avoiding rash decisions. At a time when it feels like the world has descended into chaos, it makes complete sense that we would prioritize a sense of agency in our routines and projects. Uncertainty drives anxiety, and making purposeful choices offers a way to exert control over our own lives.If we get used to living highly regimented lives, we become less able to adjust in moments of spontaneitySheila LimingBut what do we lose when we give up on spontaneity? Is it possible to strike a balance – to live thoughtfully but not rigidly, ensuring we make space for improvisation? The psychologist Barry Schwartz urges us to “choose when to choose”; another way to put it might be the pursuit of intentional unintentionality.Intentionality has its downsides. “We hear a lot about intentionality as being a perspective that we’re supposed to infuse our life with,” so we’re not doing things “without thought or hastily. We’re doing them with a lot of planning and forethought,” says Sheila Liming, author ofHanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time. “I can understand that need. But I also think that the idea of intentionality serves a highly scheduled life, and a highly scheduled life is also something that does not necessarily serve us all the time” – neither emotionally nor socially.What is ‘executive dysfunction’ and how do you overcome it?Read moreAs the title of her book suggests, Liming champions hanging out: “daring to do very little and daring to do it in the company of others”. She is an advocate for including unstructured time in our lives, especially when that time is spent with others. Highly intentional living might offer a sense of control, “but control can’t be maintained all the time”, Liming says.Her own natural inclination is to plan everything. But in recent years, she realized that “if I started to let go of that impulse – sometimes very intentionally – really bad things wouldn’t really happen. There might be minor discomfort, there might be temporary discomfort, but it would be passing.” Alternatively, “if we get used to living highly regimented lives,” she says, “we become less able to adjust in moments of spontaneity.”And those moments can be rewarding. A2022 studyby researchers in the US and Spain suggested that talking to strangers could make you a happier person, because we are better off with more “relational diversity” – spending time with people both close to us and unfamiliar. On a much smaller scale, Liming has lately embraced listening to the radio rather than streaming playlists, ceding control of her soundtrack to DJs. You might not enjoy every song, but there is value in learning what you don’t like. “What’s the worst thing that happens? You sit through it for three minutes and then it’s over,” Liming says. “I think that experience even teaches us a little bit of patience.”Allowing the DJ to take over, so to speak, also relieves us of a significant burden: the weight of choice. It can be exhausting to constantly make decisions about the best way to spend our time, says Schwartz, a psychologist and the Dorwin Cartwright emeritus professor of social theory and social action at Swarthmore College.In the service of being very intentional ... you end up spending your time thinking about how to spend your timeBarry SchwartzFor Americans, celebrating limitless choice is almost encoded in our liberty-obsessed DNA, dating back to the Declaration of Independence. It’s one of the most “fundamental assumptions of economics”, Schwartz says, that more options are a good thing: “The more choice people have, the more freedom they have.”But Schwartz says: “It’s a trap.” We are constantly having to make decisions, from whom to date to which dishwasher to buy, “and when they’re important, of course, you want to be intentional about it”, he says.However, “you can’t devote this kind of intellectual and emotional effort to everything,” he notes. “In the service of being very intentional about how you spend your time, you end up spending your time thinking about how to spend your time.”In fact, it can backfire. Take relationships: you might want to be very intentional about choosing a partner, taking your time to be sure you have found the right person. But “the more inclined you are to keep looking, the less inclined you will be to put the work into development” of the relationship, which Schwartz – who consulted on Aziz Ansari’s 2015 exploration of dating, Modern Romance – argues is the real challenge. And then there is the question of how you define intentionality: if you make a decision to stick with a partner for ever, is that living intentionally? Or would true intentionality mean waking up every day and reconsidering whether to stay?Daylight saving haters rejoice: scientists confirm it’s bad for healthRead moreNone of this means that we should not be thoughtful about our decisions; it just means we should be judicious about when to flex our intentionality muscles. Sometimes, Schwartz notes, it is better to be driven by the force of habit – you may not need to be intentional about brushing your teeth – and other times, we might just follow the wisdom of friends and family. Maybe you don’t want to devote energy tomulling Netflix optionsorresearching which appliances to buy; just ask your cinephile friend or your tech-obsessed sibling which option to go with. On the other hand, you might want to devote significant bandwidth to deciding whether to move, or where to work, or how to spend your summer evenings.In other words: sometimes, opting for spontaneity – being intentionally unintentional – is your best bet. As Schwartz puts it in his 2004 bookThe Paradox of Choice: “We must decide which choices in our lives really matter and focus our time and energy there.” Liming, similarly, advocates for making “time in our schedules to improvise”. Of course, deciding when to be intentional is not always an easy process, Schwartz says. “But that seems to me to be the way to live a decent and productive and satisfying life in a world that has gotten hopelessly complex and confusing.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleTime managementfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When faced with a muddy swamp, or a lawn that needs mowing (again), the most nihilistic among us may dream of concreting over the whole garden – and some turn that dream into reality. Arecent report by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), which represents garden centres and suppliers, has warned that within the next five years, nearly a quarter of UK householders plan to pave or deck over at least part of their garden, and of those, nearly a third plan to cover more than half of the area. The HTA estimates this could mean a loss of about 8% of the UK’s total private green space, or 409 sq km.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Paving over gardens with impermeable surfaces has and will continue to undermine urban resilience,” says Prof Alistair Griffiths, the director of science and collections at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). Water can’t get through concrete, asphalt and paving, which contributes to surface flooding and overwhelms the sewer system, leading to pollution runoff. Loss of vegetation also contributes to global heating. “We’ve got these increased extremes of heat and if you lose green space, you lose that cooling effect,” he adds. Then there’s the loss of biodiversity that comes from paving over green space – not to mention the impact of a dead, grey landscape on people’s mental health.One RHS studyshowed that people who nurtured a couple of containers of flowers and a small tree in an urban street lowered their stress hormones as much as if they’d attended eight weekly mindfulness sessions.So how do you build a low-maintenance garden without decking or paving? Experts reveal their top tips.Remember paving needs workGriffiths points out that many people don’t realise you need planning permission to lay an impermeable surface over an area larger than 5 sq metres. He acknowledges that stretched councils are not great at enforcing this, but is that a chance you want to take as you survey your newly laid, neat, lifeless concrete expanse?That’s not the only possible pitfall. Especially in shaded areas, says Jack Wallington, a landscape designer and the author ofA Greener Life, paving slabs get slimed with algae and become slippery. To keep them from becoming a hazard, owners must clean them regularly with a brush and jet washer (or worse, chemical cleaners).At the house of a friend of mine, a giant colony of rats has moved in underneath the decking, using the space as their headquarters from which to make forays into the house. And my neighbour’s deck houses foxes – wildlife, yes, but perhaps not the kind you want.Wooden decking also needs to be treated every other year or so, points out Wallington, “to make sure it stays as long-lasting as possible”.Less is moreIt’s not that all paving or decking is bad, says Wallington. “It’s about getting the balance right.” Griffiths points out that paved areas are essential for accessibility. But for most people, says Wallington, “paving an entire driveway or garden is overkill, because they’re never going to use that whole area”. He suggests starting with a 3m by 3m seating area, big enough for a table and chairs, and scaling up or down depending on the size of your garden and how many people will be using it. For an average-sized urban garden, he says, leaving at least 75% as green space is ideal. “It’s good that people have seating areas in gardens, but start off with thinking: could it be on a lawn, or on gravel or bark chips?”View image in fullscreenThe gaps between pavers can become home to a wide variety of low-growing plants.Photograph: Ingrid Balabanova/AlamyConsider lifting a few pavers or cobblestones here and there, and planting something in the space. “That is usually enough to give you access and livability, while encouraging a bit of life there too,” says Ross Cameron, a professor of environmental horticulture at the University of Sheffield. In a front garden, you could lift the edges of a paved area and plant it up, or leave it “a bit rough at the edges and then nature comes in, things like small growing daisies and clovers and things that will just find their own niche. You could encourage that at the edges and still have a nice clean path up to the front door.”Or grow upwards. “You could have archways over the drive with an evergreen climber, like a clematis,” says Griffiths. “During frost periods, when you get ice on the car windscreen, a climber could actually help to reduce that by having a bit of a warming effect.”Re-green your drivewayWhile resin driveways have become fashionable in recent years, they are essentially made from plastic. There’s no reason why you can’t grow on a driveway, says Griffiths, pointing out that you only need enough paving for four tyres. “You could incorporate low-growing plants that you can drive over and they will still grow.” He suggests trying ivy, thyme or creeping jenny.Grow a meadowView image in fullscreenA meadow garden requires little work, but can look spectacular.Photograph: David Burton/Alamy“A meadow is a really low-maintenance option,” says Kate Bradbury, a garden writer and the author ofOne Garden Against the World. “You could let your grass grow long and leave it wild and cut it once or twice a year, instead of weekly in summer. It will become a really biodiverse place. Very quickly, you’ll get loads of insects using it – small mammals, birds.” Her tiny front garden is “a mini meadow. I have sparrows stripping seeds off my grasses, and it’s really nice to see. We’ve lost 97% of our meadows since the second world war, and this habit of locking away life is really sad.”Rethink your lawnPeople may go to the drastic step of paving over their garden if the lawn becomes a quagmire. “For most people, in smaller or urban gardens that are heavily used by kids or dogs, the number one rule with lawns is: if it’s really wet, try not to use it, because that’s when it starts to fall apart,” says Wallington. “In the winter, when it’s really sodden and you start treading on it, it compacts the mud and can damage plant roots in the lawn. Perhaps take the kids to the park, rather than using the lawn, in those wettest weeks.”Ensure you’ve chosen the ideal grass – special mixes for shadier spots, for instance. “Tough grasses are used for sports pitches, which might be good for heavily used lawns.” Don’t weed the lawn, Wallington adds, because things like dandelion, yarrow and other wild plants make it much more resilient. “Some of these plants are really drought-tolerant. In summer, when the grass dies back, you’ll find that they’ll be the ones that stay green.”View image in fullscreenFlowering thyme looks beautiful as well as providing a refuge for insects.Photograph: AlamyIf you prefer a neat and lush look, rather than a meadow, you will need to mow weekly in early summer, says Wallington. “That allows the sun to get down to all of the plants, which keeps it tightly knit.” But it needn’t be too arduous – get a mulching blade for your mower and you won’t need to collect the clippings. “It whizzes all the grass up into small bits and puts it back on to the ground, adding nutrients.”If you have a sunny garden, consider replacing traditional grass altogether, says Bradbury. “You can turn your lawn into a thyme or chamomile lawn, but only if you don’t tread on it very often, so I would say don’t do this if you’ve got kids.” She recommendsChamaemelum nobile“Treneague”. “It grows to about 10cm in height, and it has a spreading habit. Creeping thyme needs a very well-draining soil and sunshine, but doesn’t grow very tall, and does flower, so it looks pretty.”Lawns as we know them, Bradbury points out, are less eco-friendly in the long term. “With our dry summers, they just go brown and look horrible, and then people water them, and that’s not sustainable.”Or get rid of it altogether“There’s so many more interesting things to do,” says Bradbury, than tend to your lawn. Gravel gardens are easy to look after, she points out. You’ll need a weed-suppressing water-permeable membrane, but you can get ones made from natural fibres such as jute, rather than plastic. “Cut holes in the liner, plant into it, and then surround everything with gravel. You can grow lots of plants that are pollinator-friendly, and drought-tolerant plants. That is really low maintenance, because you don’t have to water the plants as the gravelly mulch holds moisture. In winter, the gravel actually can help protect plants that don’t like waterlogged soil.”The fashion for large borders is another reason to encroach on the lawn. “There’s loads of advice, either online or in books, on how to plant lower-maintenance big, deep planting areas, which are beautiful throughout the whole year,” says Wallington. “It breaks my heart when you see an entirely paved garden with no planting for wildlife and people.”Choose robust plantsThese are key elements to a low-maintenance garden, says Griffiths. Plant shrubs and trees, “and maybe add in some herbaceous perennials that provide different things”. Consider big ornamental grasses. “They’re still looking beautiful, particularly when you get to autumn and winter, and you get the frost on them.”Roses are brilliant, he adds. Buy cheaper bare root roses and plant them now. “All you do once a year, with shrub roses, is give them a bit of prune and then every year they come back with beautiful flowers. I’m looking at some now – they’re still flowering.”Add containers and plantersView image in fullscreenEven difficult areas can be re-greened.Photograph: Tomasz Zajda/AlamyWhere ripping out paving would be impossible, plants in containers will help provide shade, absorb water and encourage biodiversity. “They’ll provide opportunities for pollinators, and insects will get into the containers, and birds can use that,” says Cameron. He adds that there’s a downside: pots can require lots of watering, especially in times of drought. Choose planters that have inbuilt reservoirs to conserve rainwater, or can be attached to downpipes.Ask why a garden needs to be low-maintenanceYes, you are swamped with work and the cost of living and caring responsibilities, and it would be useful to have a garden that looks after itself – but perhaps a mindset shift is in order. “Why can’t we invest in our spaces and improve habitats and improve our mental and physical health at the same time?” asks Bradbury.Embrace autumn! 20 reasons to be cheerful – from red wine to sensational star-gazingRead moreDiscover what you like to do. Mowing the lawn is tedious, she says. “So do something else. If you create a gravel garden and you’ve got lots of lovely flowers, and sometimes those flowers outgrow their space, you go out with your secateurs, and you trim them back. That takes five minutes. You can deadhead things and keep everything looking beautiful, while also having a space that works in harmony with the wider environment.“Realise how wonderful it is maintaining a garden, and creating these beautiful spaces that nourish our souls, as well as wildlife.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The accident taught me to live now, rather than in the futureMichael SegalovWed 15 Oct 2025 01.55 EDTShareIused to have a drawer where the “nice things” lived: posh candles and fancy bubble bath; two flagons of Greek extra virgin olive oil;thatAesop handwash, to bring out for visitors. A bottle of fizz gathered dust on the kitchen side and, in the bathroom, an expensive moisturiser remained unopened. Life’s little luxuries, I believed, weren’t for enjoying now, but were to be saved for some unspecified “special” time in the future.Then I was hit by a car. It happened in May last year, while I was walking down a quiet street soon after lunchtime in Bermuda, where I’d been sent on an assignment for work.I’ve still no recollection of the minutes before or hours after. I was on a bus, then off a bus; I crossed the road. Nothingness follows. I have a vague visual vignette of being sprawled out on grass, staring up, faces peering down from a height. Next, I’m in an ambulance with no specific sensory memory attached, save wanting to speak to my boyfriend, only my brain was unable to ascertain who or where he was, or if we were even still together. Then, I was in a hospital bed, with a uniformed stranger pottering around me.“You’ve been in an accident,” said Shea, one of the nurses. “We’ve had this conversation a few times already – and we can have it more. You’re lucky to be alive,” she said.A moment that changed me: I’m a chef who joined the Ukrainian army – and it transformed how I live and cookRead moreIt wasn’t until months later, after the police had finished gathering evidence, that the details of what had happened were shared with me. I’d been walking along the side of the quiet, pavement-less street when an octogenarian driver ploughed into me from behind. He then drove away, apparently unaware of the body-on-bonnet contact, despite the human-shaped dent I’d left on his car. I’d been propelled forwards and sideways, over a stone wall that sliced off a layer of skin, and then fell around 12ft, thudding into a playing field. It was assumed that I had landed left foot first, from the concentration of broken bones. My legs, back and diaphragm swiftly followed, all battered and bruised. Based on the lump on the back of my head, I must have hit that, too, which knocked me unconscious.Best not to think too much, I’ve found, about all the variables that worked in my favour. My injuries were serious, but it was a lucky escape: my bones have healed and the internal bruising has cleared. There’s no lasting damage to my brain. The scars that run up and down my legs may fade, although I’ve grown fond of them.Over the months that followed, I’d love to say I re-evaluated what counts; renounced materialistic concerns and discovered whatreallymatters. Only, that’s not at all how I felt. For months after, I was immobile and in pain; shaken at first, then fed up and irritable. Yes, it was heartwarming seeing my nearest and dearest pull together. Yes, the healing human body really is a remarkable sight to behold. Yes, I know, I’m so very, very lucky. Only, by the time I’d graduated from wheelchair to crutches to my own two feet, I felt as though the time had passed for revelations. I feared I’d missed the moment.View image in fullscreenSegalov during his recovery, with a friend.Photograph: Courtesy of Michael SegalovIn fact, the only change I could identify was a shift that, at first, felt entirely superficial: I well and truly ransacked the “nice things” drawer. Off to the shops? I’d douse myself in Bleu de Chanel. At night, toothbrushing by the light of a scented candle (Cos’s Cabane de Bois – divine!) became a daily affair. Making dinner? Pop open the bougie balsamic!But more than a year on from the accident, I’ve started to see it differently. Allowing myself these little rituals has boosted my sense of self-worth; small delights no longer feel wasted, especially when shared with others. Otherwise un-noteworthy catch-ups are injected with a sense of occasion when some light indulgence is involved – a way of showing how much I cherish those around me. It’s not extravagance or nihilism, but the actions of an aspiring bon vivant on a budget. Plus, I smell better now, and my salad dressings have improved dramatically.When my grandparents died, I went to their Liverpool home, and opened their “nice things” cupboard (one was a wartime child and the other a refugee from eastern Europe – they were, honestly, low-level hoarders). They too had bottles of champagne and posh chocolates, all waiting for that nextsimcha. But the corks had disintegrated and the perishables were years past their best.When eventually someone comes to clear out my “nice things” drawer, I want it to be found empty, its contents relished and enjoyed with the people I love. I’ve still not yet opened my one posh bottle of fizz, but it lives in the fridge now, ready and waiting.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsA moment that changed meA&EfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The African Union on Wednesday told AFP it was suspending Madagascar “with immediate effect”, while the UN said it was “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power”.France said in a statement that it was “essential that democracy, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law be scrupulously upheld”.A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said all actors needed to “act with caution in this currently somewhat confusing situation”, while Russia called for “exercising restraint and preventing bloodshed”.The security body of regional SADC grouping – of which Rajoelina was holding the rotating presidency – also expressed concern.The capital, Antananarivo, remained calm late on Wednesday, though uncertainty lingered over what might happen next.A concert was held on the symbolic Place du 13 Mai square, in front of the city hall, where thousands of protesters and armed vehicles had clashed days earlier.The youth-led Gen Z movement that initiated the protests on 25 September over lack of water and energy before they later swelled into broader anger at the political elite have welcomed the intervention of Randrianirina.The colonel had said he was “ready to talk to the youth and we are ready to answer the call”, Gen Z said in a post on Facebook, reiterating its calls for “systemic change”.“We’re worried about what comes next, but we’re savouring this first victory that gave us hope,” 26-year-old Fenitra Razafindramanga, captain of Madagascar’s national rugby team, told AFP.In the northern city of Antsiranana, an entrepreneur who identified herself only as Muriella was relieved that Rajoelina was no longer in power.“It feels like we’ve just been released from prison,” she told AFP, adding: “This is also a message to his successor: learn from this and don’t make the same mistakes.”Explore more on these topicsMadagascarAfricaAfrican UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Press Trust of India news agencyreportedthat he had a cardiac arrest during a morning walk.In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Kenya’s president, William Ruto, described Odinga as “a once-in-a-generation leader”, “a giant of democracy” and “a tireless warrior of good governance”.He said: “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage, a pan-Africanist, a unifier who sought peace and unity above power and self-gain, an unceasing servant of the people who gave his all for the promise of a better Kenya.”Ruto declared seven national days of mourning and said Odinga would be accorded a state funeral.An enduring opposition figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga became an MP in 2002 and his most recent run for the presidency was in 2022.View image in fullscreenMourners in Nairobi on Wednesday following news of Odinga’s death.Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty ImagesHis narrow loss to Mwai Kibaki in the disputed 2007 election triggered unrest that killed about 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. He became prime minister in 2008 in a national unity government headed by Kibaki as part of a deal to end the bloodshed.In 1982, Odinga, a son of Kenya’s first vice-president, Oginga Odinga, was charged with treason in connection with a coup against the then president, Daniel arap Moi, and detained without trial for six years.An ardent political activist, he was arrested many times during Moi’s administration for fighting against his one-party rule.His fight for democracy helped the country achieve two milestone political reforms: changing to a multiparty democracy in 1991, and enacting a new constitution in 2010.Ruto said in his address: “For decades, Raila dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, equity, and freedom. He endured detention and persecution so that this nation might know and enjoy democracy.”A hugely popular figure, Odinga was able to mobilise massive crowds to attend his rallies, and supporters called him Baba – “father” in Swahili. As news of his death reached the streets, hundreds of supporters from the Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera, where he was MP, made their way in a procession to his home in the Karen neighbourhood.In reaction toyouth-led anti-government protestslast year, he entered an agreement with the president, William Ruto, under which his Orange Democratic Movement party became part of a “broad-based government” and gained a role in policymaking.View image in fullscreenA mourner outside the official residence of Raila Odinga in Nairobi.Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty ImagesTributes have poured in for the former prime minister. The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyattasaid: “We have lost a father to the nation, a steadfast champion for the people, and a true son of Kenya. His legacy is not just in the political battles he fought, but in the peace he helped build. It is etched in the very fabric of our nation.”The former chief justice and current presidential aspirant David Maraga said he was shocked by news of Odinga’s death. He described him as “a patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa”.“Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country. Africa has lost a leading voice in pushing for peace, security and development. The world has lost a great leader,” hesaid.Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission, said Odinga was “a steadfast champion of democracy, good governance, and people-centred development”. Hesaid: “His decades-long commitment to justice, pluralism, and democratic reform left an indelible mark not only on Kenya but across the African continent.”The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi,saidOdinga was a “towering statesman”. Condolences were also offered byEthiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, andthe Tanzanian president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who described Odinga’s death as a tragedy “not just for Kenya, but for all of us”.Explore more on these topicsKenyaIndiaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A quarter of households had experienced a death within the previous three months.Health screenings on those who reached the town of Al Dabbah, Northern State, after walking for days from El Fasher, found acute and widespread levels of malnutrition. Three-quarters of escapers said they “never or rarely” had food because of the siege. Half revealed that they “never or rarely” had access to water.MedGlobal’s executive director, Joseph Belliveau, said: “The 500-day siege of El Fasher has pushed its inhabitants to the edge of survival.“Some of those who recently arrived to Northern State shared what life was like in El Fasher: ubiquitous violence, destroyed homes, severe shortages of food and water, and almost no access to healthcare.“As one woman put it: ‘In El Fasher I smell death rather than life and hope.’”El Fasher is facing intensifying RSF artillery and drone attacks with one salvolast weekendstriking a displacement shelter, killing at least 57 people, including 22 women and 17 children.Three-quarters of residents told MedGlobal they had been forced to move home at least three times while 81% said they “never felt safe” moving around the city.“The destruction of homes and health infrastructure has made El Fasher uninhabitable,” said MedGlobal.Before and after satellite imagery of the ground scarring at the main market Zamzam IDP camp in El FasherBefore and after satellite imagery of the ground scarring at the main market Zamzam IDP camp in El Fasher. Satellite image © 2022 Maxar Technologies/DigitalGlobe/Getty ImagesHope that the siege might end grew last month when US president Donald Trump’s senior adviser for African affairs,Massad Boulos, claimed he and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – which has been repeatedly accused of supporting the RSF – had secured an agreement to allow aid into the city.Those efforts appear to have collapsed, with the RSF instead tightening its siege. El Fasher is nowfully encircledby huge earthen berms (raised embankments), making it even harder for civilians to escape.However, in a recent unexpected twist – and with the city believed to be on the brink of collapse – airdrops by the Sudanese military have temporarily resupplied those defending the city.Yet food remains scarce, with MedGlobal’s screenings finding one in five children under five was acutely malnourished. Children under 18 months old were most affected, with 27.5% acutely malnourished.In addition, 38% of pregnant and lactating women were malnourished, undermining maternal health and increasing the risk of infants being born prematurely or underweight. The highest rates were recorded among adolescent girls with 60% of those aged 15 to 19 experiencing what MedGlobal described as “wasting”.‘We will never, ever escape’: inside the ever-tightening siege of the Sudanese city of El FasherRead moreAlthough El Fasher is cut off from the outside world by communications blackouts – 86% reported “no or rare access” to phones or internet – the Guardian has maintained contact with a number of people in the city.Abdessalam Kitir, 50, described using milk from his surviving goat – the other was killed in a drone attack last month – to keep alive a newborn whose entire family died after an RSF shell flattened their home.“The baby lost his mother and father and three brothers and sisters. He was evacuated to the hospital,” said Kitir.But even El Fasher’s last remaining hospital – al Saudi – is being routinely targeted with 13 people killed last week when the RSF shelled it.Indiscriminate shelling means many families spend days in trenches or underground bunkers. Half said they had been victims of violence while 71% had witnessed violence against neighbours and others in the city.View image in fullscreenPeople gather to wait for food aid in El Fasher, the last city in the western Darfur region still held by the Sudanese army, and under constant attack from the RSF.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk,condemnedthe continued killing of people in El Fasher last week.The Sudanese military is also accused of myriad war crimes, most recently when at least 16 people died in one of its drone attacks on a town to the east of El Fasher several days ago.On Tuesday, theRaoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rightsdescribed Sudan’s conflict as a “war on children”.Lawyers at the centre said children were subject to mass starvation, forced displacement and deliberate attacks.They added that states such as the UAE – which denies supporting the RSF – are in violation of their obligations under thegenocide conventionfor their role in the war.In areport published on Wednesdayby the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), the UK government was praised for making the Sudan crisis a priority and doubling aid to more than £230m last year.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanConflict and armsHuman rightsAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

An error in the contract mistakenly awarded the businessperson an aircraft that was far more valuable than the one agreed upon.Laprade was accused of “diverting” it toQuebecand fended off efforts to recover the plane by two aviation companies. A 2021 decision by the Paris international arbitration chamber ordered him to pay C$2.7m for the aircraft, which has been sitting at the Sherbrooke airport under a seizure order since 2019.In his defense, Laprade submitted several pieces of information to the court that had been fabricated by artificial intelligence, including “eight instances of non-existent citations, decisions not rendered, references without purpose and inconsistent conclusions”.Morin noted in his decision that the courts had previously warned the legal community in 2023 about the use of artificial intelligence, issuing a notice that information generated by AI must be subject to “rigorous human control”.Canada lawyer under fire for submitting fake cases created by AI chatbotRead moreLaprade’s attempt to “mislead the opposing party and the Tribunal by producing fictitious extracts” of case law represented a “serious breach”, Morin wrote. “It should be remembered that the filing of a procedure remains a solemn act that can never be taken lightly.”Laprade apologized and admitted his submissions were “probably not perfect” but said the use of artificial intelligence was key in his defense.Morin noted that Laprade, who is 74 and “who has clearly lived a very interesting life”, faced a challenge in defending himself without legal counsel.“While the court is sensitive to the fact that Mr Laprade’s intention was to defend himself to the best of his abilities using artificial intelligence, his conduct remains highly reprehensible,” wrote the judge. “He must bear alone all the opprobrium resulting from quotations ‘hallucinated’ by artificial intelligence on which he relied to generate his contestation.”Morin also acknowledged both the power and lure of artificial intelligence, which he said could soon transform the courts.“Although its intoxicating promises are matched only by the fears associated with its inappropriate use, artificial intelligence will seriously test the vigilance of the courts for years to come.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaArtificial intelligence (AI)AmericasComputingQuebecnewsShareReuse this content"

A recent 40-day rosary period dedicated to Saint Michael ended with a4am eventattended in person by 37,000 people in Cachoeira Paulista, and also livestreamed.YouTube did not release viewing figures but a spokesperson said that, particularly since 2024, “we have seen a real boom in live prayer broadcasts” in Brazil, which have experienced “exponential growth”.Evangelical leaders, such as Pastor Vinicius Iracet, 38, who has more than 11 million subscribers onhis YouTube channel, have also embraced the trendIracet said he has more Catholic than evangelical viewers, something relatively surprising given that some Brazilian Catholics are reluctant to consume Protestant content.“I don’t talk about religion, but about Christ and his word,” said Iracet, who also insisted he does not discuss politics: “I have my political views, but I don’t share them because I think it would create more problems than help those who follow me.”Frei Gilson was associated with the former president Jair Bolsonaro after beingbriefly mentionedin the police inquiry into the far-right leader’sattempted coup. The friar was allegedly the recipient of a “coup prayer” sent by one of those under investigation, but no link between him and the case was ever established.For researcher Magali Cunha of the NGOInstitute for the Study of Religion, the apolitical character of most prayer livestreamers also explains their growth, after years of polarisation during which priests andpastors took increasingly outspoken political stances– usually in support of rightwing or far-right candidates.“Political disputes have divided families and churches … so many of the people joining the livestreams see these digital spaces as a chance to disconnect from this polarised world,” she said.Both Cunha and Toniol agree that the livestream prayers phenomenon, although amplified by social media, is in many ways an update of longstanding habits such as listening to sermons on the radio or spending the night in prayer.“AsCatholicismloses some of its appeal and people no longer practice as much as before, the logic of these influencers is to ritualise people’s daily lives with a prayer, a hymn, a devotion,” said Toniol, who recently returned from a postdoctoral fellowship in Rome, where he attended a Vatican meeting for digital missionaries.“The Catholic church, this powerful 2,000-year-old institution, is a master at transforming itself to overcome crises … Phenomena such as that of Frei Gilson show that Brazil remains predominantly Catholic, and that Catholicism, far from dying, is reinventing itself,” he added.Explore more on these topicsBrazilCatholicismAmericasReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the exemption had been criticised for enabling the rapid growth of cheap imports from China via Shein and Temu.Income tax paid by the group remained steady at about $188m, although that included $6.1m deferred and adjusted tax relating to prior years.Shein’s UK arm has beenaccused of transferring the “vast bulk of income”to its Singaporean parent to cut its British tax bill.The company paid £9.6m in corporation tax in the UK despite making £2bn in sales last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The amendment has redesignated Hong Kong as a non-treaty state, bringing it into line with other countries (including China) for extraditions assessed on a case-by-case basis.The security minister, Dan Jarvis, has said London will “never allow” extraditions for political purposes. All requests are assessed by courts, and subjects have the right to appeal.“This government is uncompromising in its commitment to human rights, the rule of law, and the protection of all individuals who reside in the United Kingdom, including the many Hongkongers who have chosen to make their lives here,” a Home Office spokesperson said.But dissidents and advocates say they fear Hong Kong authorities could exploit the ad hoc process to target political figures.About 220,000 Hongkongers with British national overseas status have fled to the UK, seeking residency. More have escaped to the US, Australia, Canada, and other countries, some as refugees. But Hong Kong has vowed to pursue overseas activists “to the end”, issuing arrest warrants and bounties for 38.“Even if the current government does not intend to hand us over, we need binding commitments that this will never happen under any future government,” said Chloe Cheung, of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation.Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician now living in exile in London, said UK assurances that requests must be “non-political” were easily undermined. “When you are the subject of an international arrest warrant and a bounty – a clear act of hostile state behaviour on UK soil – a statement of commitment is simply not enough.”Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have a track record for laying non-political charges against dissidents, sometimes to then switch out the allegation. Supporters of Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong media tycoon and leading pro-democracy activist, have labelled his lease fraud convictions as politically motivated and trumped up. Lai is on trial for national security offences.“The idea, after watching the Jimmy Lai show trial, that we should be sending anybody back to China is an absurdity,” said the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith.Luke de Pulford, a co-founder of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, called for the government to offer a “dedicated and concrete appeal mechanism to ensure nothing slips through the cracks”.In 2021 the UK government reportedlywarned activists against travelling to countries with extraditions agreements with Hong Kong.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Feng is wanted in Hong Kong for allegedly supporting a “subversive” organisation. “Making such amendments is a clear indication that the UK government is willing to compromise and cooperate with Beijing,” he said.The amendment’s timing has also drawn suspicion, tabled amid continuing efforts by the UK to negotiate a trade deal with China, and a softer UK government approach towards Beijing.In 2020 Keir Starmer, then opposition leader, welcomed Boris Johnson’s suspension of the extradition treaty, labelling it “a step in the right direction”.Emily Lau, a veteran pro-democracy politician and former legislator who remains in Hong Kong, said there was “no doubt” the UK government needed to seek trade deals to address the state of its economy. “I have no problem with countries doing business, but the UK must not sacrifice the rights of the Hong Kong people,” she said.The Home Office said extraditions were governed “by strict legal safeguards and operates entirely independently of any trade negotiations or economic considerations”.Explore more on these topicsExtraditionHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

In the past 30 years, the Chinese president said, maternal mortality rates had dropped by nearly 80%, and women were now participating in the project of national governance with “unprecedented confidence and vigour”.Xi was speaking at the global women’s summit, an event on Monday and Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of thehistoric UN’s world conference on women, which took place in Beijing. It was there in 1995 that Hillary Clinton, the then US first lady, delivered her “women’s rights are human rights” speech, lines now often quoted by people in China advocating for women’s rights.‘We had all this energy’: the landmark gathering of women that unnerved the Chinese governmentRead moreThis year, Chinese officials used Xi’s speech to highlight the contributions that China has made to women’s advancements. Xi announced a $10m (£7.5m) donation to UNWomen, the organisation’s gender-equality agency, as well as a $100m fund for global south countries.But while Xi hailed a “glorious chapter of women’s progress”, in recent years, Chinese feminists have found it increasingly difficult to advocate for, or even speak about, women’s rights.“Today, countless people, primarily young women, identify as feminists and practice feminist choices in their personal lives,” said Lü Pin, an activist based in New Jersey who founded an influential feminist organisation inChinathat was forced to close in 2018.“However, feminist activities beyond personal life are severely limited, including public discussion, let alone policy advocacy, accountability and collective action,” said Lü, who has been based in the US since 2015, when several of her associates, known as the “feminist five”, were detained in China after a protest they staged about sexual harassment on public transport.As leader, Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society and led a patriarchal turn in politics. In 2022 he unveiled a new politburo, the executive body of the Chinese Communist party,which for the first time since 1997 included no women.Although social attitudes towards divorce and workplace equality have become more liberal, the government routinely exhorts women to fulfil what it says are traditional responsibilities of marriage and child-bearing, especially to help the country tackle itsfalling birthrate. In 2023, Xi said that China should “cultivate a new marriage and child-bearing culture”.View image in fullscreenChina’s president,Xi Jinping (centre left), and his wife, Peng Liyuan (centre right) with national leaders and delegates at the global women’s summit.Photograph: Ken Ishii/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile organised feminist groups have mostly been squashed, there are still independent bloggers and commentators who focus on women’s issues. However, even these are under increasing pressure.Last month, the official WeChat account of feminist blogger Jiang Chan, whose articles regularly garnered more than 100,000 views, according toChina Digital Times, was deleted.It came a few weeks after more than 1,300 accounts on Weibo, a separate social media platform with nearly 600 million monthly active users, were given temporary or permanent bans for inciting “gender antagonism”. One account was temporarily banned for posting “extreme anti-marriage” rhetoric.In June, the platform launched adedicated complaints categoryfor reporting content that “promotes gender antagonism”.Wang Huiling, a vlogger from rural Anhui province, shot to fame during the Covid-19 pandemic with her forthright videos about marriage, family and women’s independence. Her experience of coming from a village, where social norms are more conservative, stood in contrast to the more middle-class feminist discourse from China’s cities. “When I started posting videos online in 2019, I hadn’t heard of feminism,” she said. She just wanted to share the real-life struggles that she and the women around her faced in Chinese society. “It was only later that I realised I was part of the feminist community and that women fighting for their human rights were feminists.”At her peak, she had more than 4 million followers on Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, and, according to Wang, more than 6 million fans across different platforms.But Wang’s precise reach in China is now hard to gauge because, in January, all of her social media accounts were deleted without explanation. In April, she was informed that her 2021 memoir, Grassroots Women, had been banned from being reprinted (although it is still available for sale on e-commerce platforms). “I don’t know the specific reason for the ban, but it was probably because they were afraid of my awakening of independence in some women,” Wang said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaFeminismXi JinpingWomenHuman rightsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This includes a 30% discount to take into account Carmichael’s lower-quality coal.Instead, Adani’s customers paid an average of $A102 a tonne, according to Campbell’s analysis.The calculations are based on Adani’s own customer revenue figures as well as coalmine production figures published by the Queensland government to ascertain a price per tonne.The figures are an approximation given there is a three-month misalignment between the Indian and Australian financial years. Adani does not publish its price per tonne figures.The coal, which is burned to produce electricity, is primarily exported to buyers in India and south-east Asia.Adani’s Australian operation, BravusMiningand Resources, lists its customers as a mix of related parties and third parties – including Adani entities and other energy producers.In addition to mining, the sprawling Adani Group’s businesses include sea and airport management, electricity generation and transmission, natural gas, food, weapons and infrastructure.The Adani spokesperson said that the mine had paid all coal royalties owed.“We’re proud to operate in regional Queensland and provide secure jobs and opportunities for local businesses that drive economic and social prosperity in the communities our people call home,” the spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The details are confidential.While a deferment deal might result in Adani paying lower royalties than expected, it would not change the prices it sells its coal.The director of Climate Energy Finance, Tim Buckley, said the Australia Institute modelling was as “accurate as possible” for an external third party to conduct and that it should prompt the Queensland and federal governments to investigate.Buckley is a former investment banker who has previously provided expert evidence in a court case involving Adani.The Australia Institute findings follow research by Guardian Australia that found the Indian conglomeratepaid zero corporate taxfrom its Carmichael operations since opening in the 2021-22 financial year, raising questions over how beneficial the project is to the national economy.Adani pledged just over a decade ago toplough $22bn in taxes and royaltiesinto the Australian economy, although the mine is smaller than once anticipated.Adani’s Queensland operations, whereby coal is sent through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, is among the most politically divisive projects in Australia.It started assembling coal for export shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, which sent prices surging amid concerns global energy supplies would be disrupted.Explore more on these topicsAdani GroupBusinessCoalQueenslandMiningFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is exactly what I am doing.”About 22,000 people were smuggled through the western Balkans by organised gangs last year, according to the Home Office.Frontex data shows irregular crossings on the route fell by 78% in 2024, though UK officials say it continues to serve as a major transit route for both migrant smuggling and cross-border drug trafficking.The UK and Frontex signed a formal working arrangement in February 2024 to strengthen cooperation on intelligence sharing, joint operations, training and technical support.The UK border security commander, Martin Hewitt, said Britain would provide drones and night-vision goggles to support police forces in the region in dismantling smuggling operations.He made the announcement after chairing the Balkans Border Police Chiefs’ Forum in Sarajevo last week.Since July 2024, the UK government has entered into several joint operational agreements with Albania, Kosovo,North Macedoniaand Serbia specifically aimed at disrupting organised crime groups operating across the western Balkans.Next week, Keir Starmer is expected to host a leaders’ summit with western Balkan nations to agree further measures to reduce the number of people entering the UK illegally.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaKosovoMontenegroNorth MacedoniaSerbianewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities said at the time they had identified eight victims of “White Tiger”, aged between 11 and 15 and from Germany, England, Canada and the US.The case has prompted questions about whether German authorities could have acted sooner and prevented some of the abuse.The Zeit newspaper reported that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US had alerted German authorities in 2021 to an apparently Hamburg-based predator using the name “White Tiger”.According to Zeit, NCMEC provided a roughly 40-page document containing chat transcripts from the online platform Discord in which “White Tiger” demanded photos from two young girls, urging them to harm themselves and suggesting they take their own lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also dismissed Russian concerns that supplying US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine would be unnecessarily provocative.The move by Russia had involved 21 drones in a seven-hour incursion in early September, forcing the closure of airports in the east and centre of the country. “We think the preponderance of evidence suggests that it was deliberate,” Sikorski said.Ukraine war briefing: Poland minister shows Shahed drone and warns of ‘deep’ Russian threatRead more“They were launched from a single location, and they were all unarmed. If this was an accidental offshoot of that night’s attack on Ukraine, you would expect the mix of drones to be the same, some armed, some unarmed. All the ones that crossed intoPolandwere unarmed,” he said.The drones, understood to be Russian-made Gerbera decoys, were launched from Russia, in an incursion that was “seemingly coordinated with Belarus”, he said. It was, he added, partly a test of Poland and Nato’s air defences, forcing Poland and Nato allies to respond by scrambling fighter jets and other air defences.Sikorski was speaking before a planned meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, at which the defence of Europe’s eastern flank and supply of drones to Ukraine will be discussed. After the Polish incursion, Nato allies agreed to supply further jets for air policing as part of an operation called Eastern Sentry.According to a leaked defence paper to be published on Thursday, the European Commission will also call for European drone defences to be “fully functional by the end of 2027” as part of a project previously known as the “drone wall”.The Polish drone incident is one of several incursions into Nato airspace by Russia in September, with Russian drones also sighted in the Baltic states, Romania and Norway, and potentially elsewhere in Scandinavia.Sikorski said the incursions were a reminder that Putin believed he was “at war with us” – a situation that he argued dated back in the Russian president’s mind to the2006 Alexander Litvinenko poisoningand his combative speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference.“He’s been at war with us, but we didn’t acknowledge it because it seemed too preposterous and too strange,” Sikorski said. The incursion into Poland was part of a “spectrum of provocations”, he said, including poisonings, sabotage and arson attacks, such as incendiary bombs at parcel sites in Poland, Germany and the UK.View image in fullscreenThe roof of a house damaged after Russian drones violated Polish airspace and were shot down.Photograph: Kacper Pempel/ReutersThough Putin was “probing”, Sikorski said, the incursions and other hybrid threats had been “tactically stupid and counterproductive for him. What is he achieving? He is achieving the consolidation of public support for a policy of deterrence against Russia.”Donald Trump is expected to discuss whether to supply Ukraine with US Tomahawks, which have a range of more than 1,000 miles, in a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that the issue was of “extreme concern” to Russia.But Sikorski said concerns about the conflict spreading were exaggerated. “Every time we intended to give Ukraine new missiles, new types of weapons, somebody said: ‘Don’t do it, it’s escalatory. Don’t send them tanks. Don’t send them MiG fighters. Don’t send them F-16s. Don’t give them Himars [rockets] don’t give them Atacms [missiles].’ And every time Russia has had to adjust.”The Tomahawks, Sikorski said, could be used to target Russian oil refineries, the subject of recent Ukrainian drone strikes. “Russia’s vastness means that you don’t have enough anti-aircraft assets to protect all the targets,” he said, noting Ukraine was having success in reducing Russia’s capacity to produce oil. “When you achieve success you should reinforce it.”Sikorski said that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, had been “whispering into Trump’s ear that Russia always wins”. However, the Polish minister said that Russia had been defeated in Crimea in the 19th century, in the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, in the first world war, against Poland in 1920 and more recently in Afghanistan.“Only when Russia loses a war are there any reforms,” Sikorski said. “If Russia lost the war it would be good for Ukraine, it would be good for Europe, but it would also be good for Russia.”The Polish minister was in the UK for routine meetings, including with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, and Jonathan Powell, Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. He also visited parliament, where he helped unveil a decommissioned Shahed-136 drone at an event organised by United Against Nuclear Iran.The UK on Wednesday announced fresh sanctions against Russia, targeting its two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, and 51 “shadow fleet” oil tankers, in what it described as a new attempt to tighten energy sanctions and choke off the Kremlin’s revenues. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Washington would be willing to work with European countries on steeper sanctions.Thedrone wall idea, proposed by the EU executive, envisaged a system of “anti-drone capabilities for detection, tracking, and neutralisation, as well as capabilities to hit ground targets leveraging drone technology for precision strikes” according to a draft defence roadmap seen by the Guardian.However, EU sources said the name “drone wall” would be dropped to help the initiative win broader support. EU leaders will be asked to endorse the defence roadmap at a Brussels summit on 23 October as part of a drive to ensure the continentcan defend itself from foreign invasion by 2030.The idea originated in the Baltic states, but has met scepticism farther west. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said something “a little more sophisticated and complex was needed”. In Germany, where the word “wall” has an unhappy historical resonance, senior politicians have cast doubt on the idea, while endorsing drone defence.To help win broader geographical support, EU officials argue drone defences could help protecting borders and infrastructure, combating organised crime.Explore more on these topicsPolandRussiaDrones (military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereJon Henley, Europe correspondentWed 15 Oct 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 15.16 EDTShareIn October 2022, whenRishi Sunak moved into 10 Downing St, he became the fifth British prime minister to take up the office in six years.Unleashed on the UK by Brexit, this was unprecedented political turmoil. So how might we describe what ishappening in France, now on its fifth (or sixth, depending how you count) premier in two years – three of them in the past 10 months?The latest prime minister, the recently reappointed Sébastien Lecornu, may havebought himself a stay of execution on Tuesday, sacrificing Emmanuel Macron’s flagship pensions overhaul in exchange for opposition Socialist votes as the price for his government’s survival.But it is, at best, a temporary fix. The EU’s second-largest economy is locked in a political permacrisis, the likes of which it has not seen for decades – perhaps not since the start of its Fifth Republic in 1958 – and from which there appears no easy escape.We’ll look at the reasons for that, as well as what might follow over the coming weeks and years, shortly. First, let’s recap.Minority ruleEssential context: ever since Macron called an ill-advised snap general election in 2024,Francehas had a hung parliament divided into three warring blocs – left, far right and his own centre-right alliance – none with anything close to a majority.At the same time, the country faces dualdebt and deficit crises: its debt-to-GDP ratio and budget shortfall are now almost twice the EU limit, and hard constitutional deadlines to pass a 2026 budget that at least begins to rein in spending are nigh.Against that unforgiving backdrop, both Lecornu’s immediate predecessors as French prime minister – Michel Barnier, who lasted from September to December 2024, and François Bayrou, who took office from December 2024 to September 2025 – wereousted by parliament.In mid-September,the president appointed his close ally Lecornu as his latest PM. But when, a little over two weeks ago, Lecornuunveiled his new cabinet– which turned out to be much the same as the old one –hefaced fury from allies and opponents alike.So much so that the next day,he resigned. After just 27 days in office, Lecornu became theshortest-lived premier in modern French history. In a dignified speech, he blamed political intransigence, saying “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” would make his job all but impossible.View image in fullscreenAnother twist in the tale … Sébastien Lecornu delivers a statement after his resignation.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/AFP/Getty ImagesThen, another twist in the tale:just hours after Lecornu’s resignation,Macron asked him to stay on for another 48 hoursin a last-ditch effort to salvage cross-party backing – a task, to put it mildly, not without complications.Next,two of Macron’s former PMs publicly turned on the embattled president. Meanwhile, the far-right National Rally (RN) and radical left France Unbowed (LFI) refused to meet Lecornu, promising to vote down any and every new government unless there were snap elections.Lecornu stuck at his job, talking to everyone who was prepared to hear him out. At the end of his 48 hours, he wenton TVto say he believed “a path still existed” to avoid elections.Macron’s office confirmedthe president would appoint a new prime minister two days later.Macron kept his promise – and on Friday appointed …Sébastien Lecornu, again. So this week – withMacron helpfully sniping from the sidelinesthat the country’s rival political parties were “fuelling division” and “solely responsible for this chaos” – was Lecornu’s moment of truth. Could he survive – and can he pass that vital budget?In a high-stakes speech, the 39-year-old PM spelled out his budget priorities, giving the centre-left Socialist party (PS), who detest Macron’s unpopular pension overhaul, what they were waiting for: Macron’s flagship reform would be frozen until 2027.With the conservative Les Républicains (LR) already on board, the Socialists said they would not back no-confidence motions tabled against Lecornu by the far right and radical left – meaning the government should survive those votes, due on Thursday.It is, however, by no means certain to be able to pass its planned €30bn budget squeeze: the PS explicitly warned that it would be seeking more concessions. “This,” said its leader, Olivier Faure, “is just the start.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA cultural shiftThe problem is, the more Lecornu cedes to the centre-left, the more he will meet resistance from the centre-right. And, like the PS, the conservatives are themselves divided over how to handle the new government – some are still itching to topple it.A glance at the parliamentary arithmetic shows how tough Lecornu’s task – and longer-term survival – will be. A total of 264 deputies from the far-right RN, radical-left LFI, Greens, Communists and hardline-right UDR want him out.To achieve that, they need a majority of 288 votes in parliament – so if they can persuade just 24 of the PS’s 69 deputies or the LR’s 47 (or both) to vote with them, Macron’s fifth precarious prime minister in two years is, like his predecessors, toast.Few would bet against that happening sooner rather than later. Even if, by some miracle, the dysfunctional assembly summons up the collective responsibility to pass a budget by year-end, the prospects for the government beyond that look bleak.So is there a way out? Snap elections would be unlikely to solve the problem: polls suggest pretty much every party bar the RN would lose seats, but there would still be no clear majority. A new prime minister would face the same intractable arithmetic.View image in fullscreenUncertain future … polls suggest Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella to be the next occupant of the Élysée Palace.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersAnother possibility might be for Macron himself to resign. After winning the presidential election, his successor would dissolve parliament and hope to secure a parliamentary majority in the ensuing legislative vote. But that, too, is uncertain.Polls suggest the next occupant of the Elysée Palace will be Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella. There is at least an odds-on chance that France’s voters, having elected a far-right president, might think twice about handing them control of parliament.Ultimately, France may not emerge from its quagmire until its politicians accept the new political reality, which is that clear majorities are a thing of the past, winner-takes-all no longer applies, and compromise is not synonymous with failure.Many think that cultural shift will not be possible under the country’s current constitution. “This is no conventional parliamentary crisis, but acrise de régime”that will prove anything but temporary,wrote historian Pierre Purseigle.“The regime … was never designed to facilitate – and even disincentivises – the emergence of governing coalitions common in the rest ofEurope,” Purseigle says.“The Fifth Republic may well have entered its terminal phase.”To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeFranceEuropean UnionUkraineEmmanuel MacronnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Any truck that breaks down is likely to be instantly looted.Zikim, the main entry point to the north of the territory, devastated by two years of war with Israel, has been closed for several weeks, and Israeli officials have told NGOs in Gaza that there are no immediate plans to open the crossing, aid workers said.Israel urged to open more Gaza border crossings to allow surge of aidRead moreGaza City was thetarget of a major Israeli offensivelaunched in August that was still under way when the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was signed a week ago.“Any opening of a crossing into Gaza is welcome, but we need to make sure we can reach people where they are,” said Katy Crosby, senior director of policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps, an NGO.“If we don’t see more access, we will just be maintaining the status quo at best. We won’t see a reduction in looting and we will see more displacement as people move to where there is more aid.”Destruction in the north has been massive, with entire towns including Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in ruins as well as many of the outlying areas of Gaza City.Witnesses said many of the estimated 300,000 people who have returned to the north from the overcrowded coastal zone in the south where they had been sheltering during the Israeli offensive were now “camping” among the ruins of their homes, often without any shelter and with limited food or water.Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for Unicef, said the destruction in northern Gaza was “shocking”.“It is street after street, building after building … there is massive desperation for water. It’s pretty harrowing. We need all the crossings open,” Ingram, who was in Gaza City earlier this week, said.Amjad al-Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network and based in Gaza City, said the needs in what used to be the territory’s bustling commercial and cultural hub were “immense”.“People have this optimism and hope but there needs to be quick improvement on the crossings. We didn’t witness any significant change on the ground yet,” al-Shawa said.“We are still getting a very limited amount of aid [and] we are just beginning now to understand the level of destruction. So many streets are just full of rubble … there is almost no home that is safe. There is damage and unexploded bombs everywhere.”View image in fullscreenSome humanitarian aid has reached Palestinians in Khan Younis since the ceasefire.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn Saturday, aid agencies said small quantities of vital cooking gas entered Gaza for the first time in seven months, along with consignments of flour, rice and fresh vegetables. The new supplies sent prices in markets tumbling.Under the20-point planproposed by Donald Trump and currently under further negotiation after the successful conclusion of its first phase, Gaza should receive “full aid” at the same level as during the short-lived ceasefire in January when 600 trucks entered the territory daily.In the central town of Deir al-Balah, Najla Jundiya, 36, said there had been some improvement since the ceasefire.“The markets are full of food, vegetables, and fruits, although the prices are still high and not affordable for everyone,” Jundiya said.“Our most important needs now, especially with the approach of winter, are to have a tent to protect us from the cold and winter clothes because the markets do not have enough clothes for us or, if they exist, they are very few and very expensive.”NineUN-supported bakeriesin central and southern Gaza have restarted operations since the ceasefire.Trucks were reported to have entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel to Gaza during Wednesday, though exact numbers were unclear.Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday’s aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure.“Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” an Israeli security official said.But counting the number of trucks could be misleading, warned Crosby, of Mercy Corps. “We need to know what is in the trucks and how full they are for it to be a really meaningful metric,” she said.View image in fullscreenTrucks carrying food aid and fuel, accompanied by a UN team, pass through the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesCommercial operators are sending convoys of trucks loaded with chocolate, fizzy drinks and snacks, which have little nutritional value, while emergency treatments for children or others who have gone without adequate food for two years are scarce.In Gaza City, only seven nutritional outpatient clinics are functioning, compared with 45 in July.Many agencies have millions of dollars worth of supplies stockpiled around Gaza waiting to go in. Unrwa, the UN agency working with Palestinians across the region for decades, has three months’ worth of food for everyone in Gaza in place ready to be transported.“We have the supplies, the tools and the skills … we just need the access,” said one aid worker, recently returned from Gaza.Trump’s proposed plan specifies that “full” aid should enter Gaza and be distributed through the UN and the Red Crescent, without interference from either Hamas or Israel.This appears to exclude the controversial Israel-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began operations in May, leading to chaotic scenes and hundreds of deaths as crowds of aid-seekers gathered around its distribution sites.Aid officials in Gaza told the Guardian that three of the GHF’s sites were no longer operative and two others were in the process of being dismantled.A GHF spokesperson denied the reports, saying that only one site had been dismantled and that the organisation was committed to its mission “to deliver aid consistently and directly to as many families in Gaza as possible, for however long it takes.”Additional reporting by Seham Tantesh in Gaza CityExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warAidGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Palestinian leader has been held in solitary confinement since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, which ignited the Gaza war. Barghouti is a member of the Fatah party, a bitter rival of Hamas.TheAsra Media Office, which covers Palestinian prisoner issues, said Barghouti “lost consciousness and suffered fractures in four ribs as a result of the beating”.The alleged beating followed a prison visit to Marwan Barghouti by the Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir in August. Ben Gvir, a member of an extreme right party who has past convictions from Israeli courts for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist organisation, taunted Barghouti in a video clip published at the time.According to Arab Barghouti, Ben Gvir also showed the 66-year-old prisoner a picture of an electric chair, and told him he deserved to be executed.In a statement quoted in Maariv newspaper on Wednesday, Ben Gvir denied the assault allegations, but added that he was “proud that [Barghouti’s] situation has changed radically during my tenure – play time is over, holiday camps are over.“The murderer Barghouti knows that terrorists like him are treated harshly today, so he invents fake news to incite his despicable terrorist comrades who left him behind as part of the [ceasefire] deal,” Ben Gvir said, adding he gave his full support to the “fighters of the prison service”, who he said were performing “sacred work”.Barghouti consistently tops polls as the most popular leader among Palestinians. He has been in prison for more than 20 years after being convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed, and sentenced to five life sentences plus 40 years. The trial wascriticised as deeply flawedby the Inter-Parliamentary Union.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal that took effect over the weekend, 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences were released, and most of them deported to Egypt. The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu vetoed Barghouti’s inclusion on the list of prisoners to be freed as part of the deal.“My father represents the voice of reason,” Arab Barghouti said. “He is the most popular Palestinian leader, but at the same time, he has a political vision that is accepted by the international community that can contribute to the stability of the region, which is a two-state solution.“He’s been a vocal supporter of the two-state solution for more than three decades. I think the fact that the Israeli government insisted that he’s not part of the deal is a clear declaration that they’re not looking for a credible, legitimate Palestinian leader. They want us to stay divided.”Additional reporting by Quique Kierszenbaum in JerusalemExplore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said.Aid agencies say thousands of tonnes of aid, including food and medical supplies, has been loaded on to trucks waiting in Egypt or stockpiled elsewhere in the region.“We have the supplies, the tools and the skills … We just need the access,” said one international aid worker, recently returned from Gaza.The fragile ceasefire in Gaza hadfaced its first test when Israelon Tuesday accused Hamas of failing to comply with the deal signed last week by delaying the return the bodies of hostages. In retaliation, Israel said it would cut the number of trucks it would allow into Gaza to 300, half the total agreed in the ceasefire deal, and postpone indefinitely the opening of the Rafah crossing.Hours later, Hamas handed over the remains of three more hostages to the Red Cross, bringing to eight the number of bodies transferred since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold, and leaving 21 to be accounted for.View image in fullscreenVehicles transporting the bodies of four hostages arrive at the national forensic medicine centre in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/GettyThe militant Islamist organisation said the delays were due to difficulties locating burial sites amid the swaths of rubble left by the two-year conflict. A fourth body transferred by Hamas was found not to be that of a hostage.Body handed over by Hamas is not hostage, says Israel, as Palestinian dead ‘arrive back in cuffs’Read moreIsrael’s public broadcaster Kan reported that heavy equipment needed for repairing damaged infrastructure would be permitted to enter Gaza and Palestinians who had left the territory during the war would be allowed back for the first time. Others would be allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing, subject to Israel’s security approval.Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation said they had not yet received notification from the World Health Organization to prepare for travel.View image in fullscreenPalestinians walk past destroyed buildings in Gaza City on 15 October.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersRafah has been shut since it was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024, limiting entry into Gaza from Israel. Israel has repeatedly blocked aid from entering Gaza during the conflict, prompting accusations it has usedstarvation as a weapon of war. A famine was declared in parts of the territory in August.The EU said on Wednesday it was on standby to deploy a longstanding humanitarian mission, known as a EUBam (EU Border Assistance Missions), at the Rafah crossing if conditions on the ground improved.Humanitarian officials in Gaza City said on Wednesday assistance was desperately needed, with hundreds of thousands of people without clean water, food and other essentials and many more suffering greatly.Though aid was supposed to start flowing over the weekend, on Monday crossings from Israel were closed to allow the hostage transfer and Palestinian prisoners to reach Gaza and then for national holidays.View image in fullscreenPalestinians collect water from a broken pipe in Gaza City on 12 October.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APTess Ingram of Unicef, speaking from southern Gaza, said: “We had heard that Sunday would be the first day of a big scale-up of aid coming in but what we’ve seen so far is in very sharp contrast to how high and desperate the needs are.“People are not sure when they are next going to get any water. There is not enough food. We had 45 outpatient nutrition clinics open in August, now there are just seven.”Trump’s proposed plan calls for “full aid” to enter Gaza. Later phases of the plan call for Hamas to disarm and give up all power, which it has so far refused to do, instead launching a security crackdown to reassert its authority in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans.Longer-term elements include how Gaza will be governed and the makeup of an international stabilisation force but are yet to be fully discussed.mapOn Monday, Israelis celebrated thereturn of the last 20 living hostagesin Gaza and Palestinians rejoiced at Israel’s release of about 2,000 prisoners and detainees as part of the ceasefire’s first phase. Negotiations are under way on a second phase, which will have to resolve multiple thorny issues.In a demonstration of the political challenges facing the truce, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister and an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace”.“Nazi terrorism understands only force and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages’ bodies.The Hostages Family Forum, a group representing many of the hostages’ families, said the three dead hostages whose remains were identified on Tuesday night were Uriel Baruch, Tamir Nimrodi and Eitan Levi.View image in fullscreenThe bodies of (from left) Uriel Baruch, Eitan Levy and Tamir Nimrodi have been identified as three of the four hostages released on Tuesday.Photograph: SuppliedBaruch was abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza. Nimrodi, who had been serving with the Israeli defence ministry body that controls entry points into Gaza, was taken by militants from the Erez border crossing. The forum said Levi was abducted while driving a friend to a kibbutz during the Hamas attack.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is overseeing the transfer of remains, said on Monday that the retrieval was a “massive challenge” given the difficulties of finding bodies in Gaza’s rubble, and could take days or weeks.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warEgyptPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Pakistan’s military said the Afghan Taliban had carried out “unprovoked fire” on major border posts close to the Kurram district and the crossing between the Chaman and Spin Boldak districts on Tuesday evening. It said it had retaliated with mortar fire and drone strikes, killing 20 Taliban fighters.Pakistani security sources confirmed that the air force had also carried out strikes on headquarters ofTalibanforces in Kandahar province, where the cross-firing reportedly began, and on targets in Kabul.View image in fullscreenTaliban fighters with an anti-aircraft gun wait near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in Spin Boldak, Kandahar province, on Wednesday.Photograph: ReutersImages showed the “friendship gate” at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing had sustained significant damage in the attacks, and it remained closed for the day. Hundreds of people fled Pakistani border villages overnight and local residents reported cross-border firing, strikes and drone deployment that lasted into the evening. In Kandahar province, residents said many people along the border areas had also been fleeing.The Afghan Taliban claimed Pakistan had “once again” launched the attacks, killing more than a dozen civilians, and they said they had killed several Pakistani soldiers and seized several border posts. Pakistan rebuffed the claim as “outrageous and blatant lies”.The heaviest casualties on Pakistan’s side were reported around the city of Chaman, which is just a few miles from the border and bore the brunt of heavy shelling from the Afghan side.Naqeeb Ullah, a resident in Chaman living just over a mile from the border, said the sky had been lit up with shelling and gunfire until the morning. “The sounds were so loud that it felt like it was happening in front of our house; all our doors and windows were shaking from the impact,” he said.Ullah said heavy firing had destroyed a local school close to the border and that he knew of several civilian fatalities. “I know a family of two or three people who were killed in attacks and a 11-year-old was badly injured in the attack,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople fled their homes in Pakistani border villages last night, with many waiting for transportation in Chaman on Wednesday.Photograph: H Achakzai/AP‘An environment of terror’: deadly resurgence of Pakistan Taliban gathers paceRead moreThe resumption of the deadly clashes and airstrikes has pushed the two once-amicable neighbours the closest to conflict with each other in years and has sparked fears of wider regional instability.Pakistan has maintained a longstanding relationship with the Afghan Taliban, sheltering many of the Islamist militant group’s leaders after the US invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan was among those backing the Taliban when they retook power in 2021.However, ties between the two have severely deteriorated as Islamabad has accused Kabul of giving sanctuary to the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP has been behind a rising number of deadly attacks in Pakistan in recent years. Pakistan has accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering TTP leadership and ignoring TTP training camps in Afghanistan, as well as giving finance and arms to the group, a claim Kabul denies.View image in fullscreenAfghan men inspect a damaged house in Spin Boldak, Kandahar province, after a Pakistani airstrike.Photograph: Sanaullah Seiam/AFP/Getty ImagesLast week, Pakistan was accused of carrying out two strikes on Afghan soil, including in Kabul, which were believed to be targeting TTP camps and leadership. Pakistan has neither denied or confirmed it was behind the strikes.In response, Taliban forces retaliated over the weekend with extensive firing at Pakistani troops stationed at border posts, prompting a heavy-handed response from Pakistan. Dozens of casualties were reported on both sides.The violence flared up again on Tuesday night, starting in Kurram district, when the Afghan Taliban were accused of cross-border shelling.Javed Ali, a nearby resident, said: “The firings and border clashes erupted at 8pm and kept ongoing from both sides for around two to three hours. We stayed inside our houses as it was terrifying.”View image in fullscreenTaliban security personnel on a Soviet-era tank are followed by motorcyclists as they ride towards the border on Wednesday.Photograph: Sanaullah Seiam/AFP/Getty ImagesDawood Achakzai, a Chaman resident, said he had been woken at 3am by the sounds of heaving shelling and mortar fire. “The firing and shelling shook the city, people here have been terrified,” he said.He said those living in villages close to the border had evacuated. “Villages on the Pakistani side were hit by mortar shells and heavy firing. Hundreds of families have left the villages. We are trying to help people to vacate and shift to safer places,” he said. “Since the 2021 Taliban captured power, we have not witnessed such heavy border clashes.”By Wednesday night, both sides had agreed to a temporary 48-hour ceasefire, effective from 6pm. A statement by the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said both sides would engage in dialogue to find “a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue”.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanPakistanTalibanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The Washington state-based firm, which suspended operations after the catastrophic implosion, was unaware of the submersible’s true durability, the report said.The victims, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, died instantly in the North Atlantic during the descent to the remains of the Titanic.The implosion also killed French underwater explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, known as “Mr Titanic”; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.The Titan’s defective engineering “resulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements”, the NTSB said.The safety board also said OceanGate had not followed standard guidance for emergency responses, and that the Titan could have been found sooner if it had. If the company had abided by expected protocols, it would have saved “time and resources”, the report said, while noting “rescue was not possible in this case”.The report was also critical of the culture at the company, quoting a former operations technician who had raised alarms about potential coast guard regulations prior to the implosion. That technician had questioned the company’s choice to call paying passengers “mission specialists”, prompting the CEO to respond that “if the Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away”, the report said, citing the technician.The NTSB report dovetails with a coast guard report released in August that described the Titan implosion as preventable. The coast guard determined that safety procedures at OceanGate were “critically flawed” and found “glaring disparities” between safety protocols and actual practices.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Wednesday.In August, after the coast guard report was released, a company spokesperson offered condolences to the families of those who died.The Titan’s implosion led to lawsuits and to calls for tighter regulation of private deep-sea expeditions.The NTSB report suggested current regulations for small passenger vessels such as the Titan were inadequate and had “enabled OceanGate’s operation of the Titan in an unsafe manner”. The safety board recommended the coast guard establish a panel of experts to study submersibles and implement updated regulations.The report also called on the coast guard to “disseminate findings of the study to the industry”, which has grown in recent years as privately financed exploration has grown.The vessel had been making voyages to the Titanic site since 2021. Its final dive came on the morning of 18 June 2023. The submersible lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later and was reported overdue that afternoon.A multiday search for survivors off Canada made international headlines. It soon became clear there would be no survivors, and the coast guard and other authorities began lengthy investigations into what had happened.The sub disaster was thesubject of a Netflix documentaryreleased earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsTitanic sub incidentThe TitanicnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, 39% of those who sawdistressing contentdescribed themselves as very or extremely upset and worried by it.More than two-thirds of children are getting news from social media apps including TikTok andInstagram, but 40% do not follow news-focused accounts and are instead coming across stories through recommendation algorithms. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of those who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the past month.Instagram restricts what teenagers can see weeks before Australia’s under-16s social media ban beginsRead moreOne 14-year-old girl told researchers: “OnTikTokyou can see stabbings and kidnappings, which are just not nice to see, especially when you are a bit younger, it makes you feel uncomfortable.”Another girl, 17, said: “On Instagram, before videos get taken down, I think there’s quite a lot of stabbing videos or gruesome videos like that. When Liam Payne died [the One Direction star fell from a hotel balcony] there was video of him circulating and I thought it wasn’t very nice. I would have wanted a trigger warning.”Of news that pops up in his feed, a 13-year-old boy said: “You don’t want to see it sometimes and don’t want to think about it.”The survey findings reflect a wider trend in social media use: the proportion of time users spend viewing content posted by their friends is falling on several platforms. Meta said incourt filingsthis April that only 8% of an Instagram user’s time is now spent viewing friend posts, down by over a third since 2023, with algorithmically recommended posts instead increasingly dominating users’ feeds, contributing to the supposed phenomenon of “brain rot”.View image in fullscreenResearch has found 61% of children who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the last month.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPThe vast majority of children (86%) do not know how to reset the explore algorithm on their social accounts, which serves the upsetting material, according to the research which involved a survey and focus groups with more than 1,000 11- to 17-year-olds.“The shift away from established news channels is radically changing how children and young people consume news, and it is having worrying consequences,” said Rachel Huggins, co-chief executive of Internet Matters, which provides advice to parents and is part-supported by tech companies including TikTok.“The algorithmic design of social media platforms is enabling children to see negative and upsetting content [and it is delivering it] to millions of children and young people who are not seeking it out.”Instagram to bring in version of PG-13 system to protect children, says MetaRead moreChi Onwurah MP, the Labour chair of the commons science and technology committee, said the findings reinforced its conclusion that the Online Safety Act “isn’t up to scratch to protect users”. She called for a stronger regime “that discourages the viral spread of misinformation, regulates generative AI and places much-needed standards on to social media companies”.Under the Online Safety Act, codes to protect childrenrequiresocial media companies to give children age-appropriate access to content that depicts or encourages serious violence or injury. Younger children are seeing news relating to war and conflict, and violence and crime, less than older children but Internet Matters said: “It is still concerning that 11- to 12-year-olds are seeing this content at all given many social media platforms have a minimum age of 13+ outlined in their terms of service.”According to TikTok, human blood and extreme physical fighting cannot be included in its “for you” feed and the platform does not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing or extremely violent content. It said it uses independent factcheckers and allows parents to block their teens from using the app during times they control and to filter content.Instagram has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsChildrenInternet safetySocial mediaDigital mediaInstagramTikTokYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Despiteearlier reportsthat education, health and care plans (EHCPs) that detail support for each child would be scrapped as part of the overhaul, sources have told the Guardian that the plans will now survive the reforms.The report by the Sutton Trust found that 65% of working-class families interviewed spent nothing on their child’s EHCP application, while only 29% of middle-class families did the same. In contrast, one in 10 of the middle-class families interviewed had spent more than £5,000 on the application process, including medical assessments, consultants and legal advice.Third of UK parents have sought special needs assessment for their child, survey findsRead moreEHCPs were introduced in 2014, as a legal agreement between local authorities and parents for the additional support required based on a child’s needs. But the Sutton Trust report shows that parents able to spend thousands of pounds on their child’s applications were more likely to obtain sought-after special school places.The research found that 12% of parents with children in special schools had spent £5,000 or more on their EHCP application, compared with just 1% of those attending mainstream schools.Affluent parents were also more likely tocontest local authority decisions at tribunals, the vast majority of which result in the successful award of an EHCP. Overall, middle-class parents were eight percentage points more likely to obtain an EHCP for their child than working-class parents.Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which campaigns for improving social mobility, said: “It’s unacceptable that a child’s background can dictate whether they get the help they need to thrive and be happy at school. This is a major barrier to their opportunities and can profoundly impact their long-term prospects.“Right now, disadvantaged kids with Send are being failed by a system beset with inconsistency and mind-boggling bureaucracy. Getting the right support for a child shouldn’t be about a parent’s ability to pay. We need urgent action to make the system work better for everyone.”Margaret Mulholland, the Association of School and College Leaders’ Send and inclusion specialist, said: “Schools and colleges work tirelessly to support these students but they are critically under-resourced and face wider problems of delays to assessments for EHCPs, and shortages of specialist staff such as speech and language therapists.“Desperate families often pay for assessments themselves and fight for the level of care they want for their child through tribunals. But such measures are often more difficult for disadvantaged families and this means that we effectively have a two-tier system.”The report found that children with special needs from poor backgrounds were “doubly disadvantaged”, likely to receive less support at school and end up with worse exam results than their better-off peers.While 26% of schoolchildren in England qualify for free school meals, they account for 44% of children with EHCPs, while a further 39% receive additional support without an EHCP.What are EHCPs and why is Labour bracing for a backlash over its overhaul plans?Read moreA Guardianinvestigation into the costs of Sendfound the highest-spending local authorities were concentrated in large, wealthy county areas in the south-east and east of England with higher prevalence of affluent parents.Of the 10 English councils with the largest accumulated Send deficits, four were in the wealthiest fifth of council areas and a further five in the wealthiest two-fifths.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Support should be based on children’s needs, not where in the country they happen to live, the ability of their parents to make the case, or whether or not they have an EHCP – which given shortages of funding and specialist staff is far from a silver bullet to ensure pupils get all the help they need.”Georgia Gould, the minister for school standards in England, said: “This report lays bare how badly children with Send have been let down and denied the opportunities and support they deserve. Our mission is to break down barriers to opportunity so every child, not just the privileged few, can achieve and thrive.“I’ve met parents who’ve had to fight every step of the way and we will not stand by whilst they continue to face a system that has failed them for far too long. That’s why we’re building a system with improved training for teachers, £740m to help create more specialist school places and earlier intervention for speech and language needs – reassuring parents that support will be available for, as routine at the earliest stage.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsChildrenSchool fundingEducation policyLocal governmentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The industry standard is to allow leeway of two months to publish receipts.A spokesperson for Tussell said: “This gap in publication is deeply concerning and highlights that the government is failing to meet its own transparency standards.“Such delays undermine visibility over public spending at a time when accountability and scrutiny are more critical than ever.”Between June 2022 and May 2023 – the most recent 12-month period for which the MoJ has published its receipts – the department’s spending receipts amounted to £5bn.Tussell has calculatedthe missing spending by dividing this figure by 12 and multiplying it by the number of months when the department has failed to file receipts, which is 26. The estimated total came to £10.8bn, Tussell said.This calculation includes all Ministry of Justice arm’s length bodies, except for the family court advisers Cafcass and the Legal Services Board, which are both more up to date in their publishing.Crown court backlog in England and Wales hits new record of almost 80,000 casesRead moreTom Brake, the director of the transparency organisation Unlock Democracy, condemned the MoJ’s failure to publish.“With government finances painfully tight, spending receipts must be published promptly,” he said. “They help detect and prevent the misuse and waste of precious resources. Delaying their publication damages the government’s ability to control its expenditure.”According to government-wide calculations, the Ministry of Justice is by far the worst performing department when it comes to missing spending data.The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero is 13 months behind on disclosing its spending receipts, worth an estimated £3.7bn. The third-worst department is the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which has a 10-month lag on publication of spending estimated at £880m.The MoJ received a real-term 1.8% spending increase in June, according to the spending review announced by the chancellor.Day-to-day MoJ spending is set to reach £13.2bn by 2028-29, while capital spending will rise to £2.3bn annually for 2026-27 and 2028-29, before returning to £2bn in 2029-30. This will support the initiative to create 14,000 new prison places by 2031.The Institute for Fiscal Studies noted in February that MoJ spending was cut by 70% over the early 2010s and, within this, capital funding for HM Courts and Tribunals Service and HM Prison and Probation Service was cut by more than 90%.The government aims to create 14,000 additional prison places by 2031 by spending £4.7bn – with about 2,500 of these having already been built since July 2024.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that all spending had been accounted for.“We need to review a substantial amount of data to ensure we do not release anything that could cause any risk, particularly to individuals,” they said.“All departmental spend is accounted for in our annual accounts and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPublic financePrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet by Tuesday evening the Crown Prosecution Service had changed its mind.Now senior government figures are hopeful the evidence will help to draw a line under what is a complex legal controversy, and one which they argue could have been avoided had the Tories fixed flaws in the Official Secrets Act when in power.Downing Street is attempting to turn the tables, accusing Kemi Badenoch of “overreach”. One insider said: “Far from this being the fault of the Labour party, the main evidence was provided under theConservativesin 2023.”View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch. Downing Street is attempting to turn the tables on Tory criticism, accusing Kemi Badenoch of ‘overreach’.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA“Now the question is for the Tories: did they have access to the evidence at the time?” The answer is “yes”, according to sources in Rishi Sunak’s No 10 operation.Much has been made by the Tories of a meeting between national security adviserJonathan Powelland Olly Robbins, the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, on 1 September this year. Yet the third and final piece of evidence from Collins was submitted weeks earlier and – crucially – the CPS had made no further requests for evidence to support their case before abandoning it.Jonathan Powell: the trusted aide Starmer is shielding from China spy rowRead moreDowning Street sources say the meeting was held to discuss broader bilateral issues, including how the government should handle the trial which, at that point, was going ahead. “Unless Jonathan Powell had a time machine, he couldn’t have known that it was going to collapse,” one said. They insist they didn’t get into the evidence.Starmer was first told the case was in danger of collapsing a couple of days before it actually did on 15 September, his spokesperson has confirmed.Sources maintain it would have been inappropriate for the prime minister to intervene in a legal process. The Guardian also understands that Collins was told by the CPS that once charges had been laid, he couldn’t share his evidence further.The Tories, however, have suggested that given the allegations involved spying on MPs, special circumstances should have applied. On social media, Badenoch accused Starmer of being “too weak” to stand up for national security, a criticism flatly rejected by No 10.But what of the CPS? Legal experts are generally divided in their response to the collapsed trial. Many – including some government lawyers – believe the reliance on the term “enemy” in the Official Secrets Act meant there was never any chance of a successful prosecution. Others feel that given the precedent set by previous espionage cases and Collins’ evidence, prosecutors should just have cracked on.Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, also faces questions after he told some of parliament’s most senior MPs on Wednesday night that the CPS dropped the case as the evidence provided by Collins was “5% less” than the threshold required for prosecution. He will now face calls to make crystal clear exactly how it fell short,‘Did two Brits spy for China?’ is one question. ‘Can any UK PM really stand up to China?’ is an even bigger one | Gaby HinsliffRead moreespecially as Collins repeatedly referred to China as a “threat”.While Starmer, as a former director of prosecutions, is in his comfort zone when it comes to the law, there are regular rumblings on his own side about whether he is able to spot political landmines. Despite that, his team are hoping he has dodged this particular trap.And yet questions remain. Could Collins have offered more evidence within the constraints of the Official Secrets Act? What did the attorney general do when told by Parkinson the spying case was on the brink of collapse? Is there more that Starmer could have done?In the Commons, former security minister Tom Tugendhat, asked Starmer: “The real question is, what political direction did this government give to their officials before they went to give evidence?”“Absolutely none,” he replied. “I was the chief prosecutor for five years, and I can say … not once was I subjected to political pressure of any sort from anyone. That is the tradition in this country; it is a proud tradition; it is one I uphold as prime minister.”Yet if any evidence should emerge to the contrary – especially given the third piece of evidence appears to reflect Labour party policy – then the domestic political fallout from the China spy trial will be very far from over.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaConservativesLabourJonathan PowellEspionageanalysisShareReuse this content"

The cover letter describing the compact contemplates funding research on criteria other than the soundness and likely impact of research, which would ultimately damage the health and prosperity of Americans.”Her remarks mirror those of MIT’s president, Sally Kornbluth, who said the compact undermines merit-based processes for awarding research grants and signing it would “restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution” when shepublicly declinedthe offer last week.Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), said in a statement: “By declining to compromise its core mission, Brown University has affirmed that no amount of federal inducement is worth surrendering the freedom to question, explore and dissent. In rejecting the compact, Brown stands as a bulwark for higher education’s sacred commitment to academic freedom and institutional self-governance.”The compact was first introduced to nine universities at the start of October. The remaining schools – the University of Virginia, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University and Dartmouth College – have not yet announced their decisions.Earlier this week, the Trump administrationexpandedthe invitation to all US colleges and universities. Higher-education leaders and faculty havesharply criticizedthe proposal, describing it as a political attempt to undermine university autonomy.Trump has warned that institutions refusing to participate may face federal investigations into compliance with existing laws. However, it is still unclear whether research funding or student aid eligibility will depend on whether a school signs the agreement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I did get elected for crime, but I didn’t get elected for what we’re doing.”Trump, flanked by the FBI director, Kash Patel; the US attorney general, Pam Bondi; and the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, touted the federal takeover of policing in Washington DC and the amassing of arrests by federal agents in “Operation Summer Heat”.Operation Summer Heat, as described by Patel, was a three-month initiative to surge arrests of wanted fugitives across the country. The initiative is similar to seasonal surges by the US Marshals Service and other agencies in previous years, though its scope appears to be much broader.Oregon judge extends order preventing Trump from deploying national guardRead more“As a result of these efforts, violent crime declined nearly 20% nationwide compared to the same period last year,” Trump said. “And it was the safest and most peaceful summer in the last two decades.”Crime began falling precipitously in major cities in 2022 and 2023. On the day Trump was inaugurated in January, crime had fallen to nearly 60-year lows. Nonetheless, the president has used the threat of crime in major cities as justification for extraordinary intervention by federal law enforcement personnel, including the deployment of national guard troops inMemphis, Tennessee, last week.“In a little while, you’re going to see some numbers that you’re not going to believe,” Trump said. I think you’re probably start with Memphis because I’m hearing the numbers are much quicker than we even thought possible.”Violent crime has been falling in Memphis for the last year. The Memphis police department released anoteon 9 September – before the Memphis Safe Task Force of federal law enforcement agents and national guard personnel had been fully deployed – that overall crime there was at a 25-year low, with robbery, burglary and larceny also reaching 25-year lows. Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault at a five-year low and sexual assault at a 20-year low.Operation Summer Heat, an initiative to arrest violent criminals, as described by Patel, reflects “the best numbers for fighting crime in US history”.Patel offered arrests of 28,600 people over the first nine months of Trump’s presidency as evidence for the claim, with 8,700 arrests of “violent criminals” during the summer push, along with 2,200 firearms seized as well as 421kg of fentanyl – “enough to kill 55 million Americans, alone”, he claimed without providing a basis for that figure.Reporters present at the White House presentation did not ask Patel, Bondi or Trump about the quality of those arrests – that is, whether those arrests would hold up to historical conviction rates in which more than 99% of arrests result in a conviction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Trump also said the shutdown is working out for his interests, with programs Republicans wanted to cut being terminated permanently – a prospect of questionable legality, given the appropriation power afforded to Congress by the constitution.“We have the people we want paid, paid, OK,” Trump said. “We want the FBI paid, we want the military paid.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS crimeUS policingUS militaryPam BondiMemphisBostonnewsShareReuse this content"

The flag was displayed on what appears to be a cubicle wall behind Angelo Elia, one of Taylor’s staff members, during a virtual meeting.Other items pinned nearby include a pocket constitution and a congressional calendar. It remains unclear whether Elia had any connection to the display.“I am aware of an image that appears to depict a vile and deeply inappropriate symbol near an employee in my office,” Taylor said in a statement to theCincinnati Enquirer.“The content of that image does not reflect the values or standards of this office, my staff, or myself, and I condemn it in the strongest terms. Upon learning of this matter, I immediately directed a thorough investigation alongside Capitol Police, which remains ongoing. No further comment will be provided until it has been completed.”According to his office, the flag was discovered on Tuesday afternoon inside Taylor’s suite in the Cannon building on Capitol Hill, Politico reported. The congressman suspects the act was “foul play or vandalism”, his spokesperson said.When contacted by the Guardian for comment, an automatic response from the US Capitol police public information office was sent that said the office is “closed for routine business” during the funding-related federal government shutdown that began on 1 October. “The office will reopen when the federal government is funded,” the response said.The discovery followsa reportfrom Politico published on Tuesday detailing a Telegram chat in which Young Republican leaders exchanged racist comments and slurs, mocked the Holocaust, and expressed admiration for Nazi rulerAdolf Hitler.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No prior government shutdown has resulted in mass layoffs of federal workers before.“In [the] AFGE’s 93 years of existence under several presidential administrations – including during Trump’s first term – no president has ever decided to fire thousands of furloughed workers during a government shutdown,” said Everett Kelley, president of the AFGE, in a statement on the firings.“The AFGE is currentlychallengingPresident Trump’s illegal, unprecedented abuse of power and we will not stop fighting until every reduction-in-force notice is rescinded.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US unionsUS politicsCaliforniaUS federal government shutdownsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The driverless taxi that could also get you a job – or a dateRead moreThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I’m delighted that Waymo intends to bring their services to London next year, under our proposed piloting scheme.“Boosting the AV [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment and opportunities to the UK. Cutting-edge investment like this will help us deliver our mission to be world leaders in new technology and spearhead national renewal.”A fuller rollout of self-driving taxis is expected in the UK after the Automated Vehicles Act fully takes effect in late 2027.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents black-cab drivers, known in the city as “cabbies”, said: “It’s a fairground ride.“It’s a tourist attraction in San Francisco. Quite frequently one of them will lock up in the middle of a junction because it gets confused and the police have to come and park, wait for the Waymo man to get his laptop out and get it going again.”He said London would pose a bigger challenge for Waymo, due to its irregular road system. He added that he did not believe there was public appetite for the technology.“If there was demand for it, Nigel Farage would be saying get rid of immigrants, have driverless cars instead. But there’s no demand for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also launching services in Tokyo using Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles, its only other current venture outside the US.Its co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana said the technology was “making roads safer and transportation more accessible”, adding: “We’ve demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing, and we can’t wait to expand the benefits of our technology to the United Kingdom.”Waymo launched its autonomous taxis in 2020 and has amassed a fleet of more than 2,000 driverless vehicles. It says it has taken more than 10 million passengers in the US, offering services in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Atlanta.London would become the only European city in which the company is operational, pending approval from central government and Transport for London.Despite somealarming incidents, Waymo said the data showed that cars driven by humans were involved in incidents that injured pedestrians 12 times more often than its autonomous vehicles.Its cars use cameras, artificial intelligence, radar and lidar – sensors that use lasers to measure distance in three dimensions – to create a map of objects around the vehicle, including in darkness and weather conditions such as rain.Explore more on these topicsWaymoSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryTechnology sectorLondonEuropeTfLnewsShareReuse this content"

Phoenix has one of the nation’s largest concentrations of datacenters, which keeps expanding, encouraged by tax incentives and local business leaders; localoppositionand ordinances around noise pollution and water use are also on the rise. High-profile projects have been postponed or cancelled due to local pushback in recent months in northern Virginia, the nation’s biggest datacenter hub; inSt Charles, Missouri; andin several towns in Indiana.But in even more locations, datacenters are moving forward, oftenunder a cloud of secrecy.Quest for AI computing powerThe project in Tucson is one of many emerging in the quest for AI computing power and to serve data-intensive companies.The project envisions a vast warehouse full of computers in the Sonoran desert, including $2.4bn worth of equipment. Community outrage over the project grew soon after the city council’s 17 June vote, and much of it centered around the issue of water.Datacenters use water in two ways: to maintain a steady humidity, and to cool off the hot computers, which is often accomplished by running cold water past the machines, consuming water in the form of steam.Communities throughout the US have seen groundwater depletion and contamination after datacenters crept up. Tucson has long embraced water conservation, and this protective ethos is more salient there than many other communities, said Ed Hendel, president ofSky Island AI, a Tucson-based company. As one example, the city treats wastewater and releases it to the Santa Cruz River, home to wildlife such as endangered fish.Hendel’s daily work relies on datacenters, but he said they should be built where they make sense. Placing water-guzzling warehouses of computers “in a hot desert is not a good starting point”, he said. “Putting them in a hot desert in the midst of a drought is even more absurd, because that water is precious.”View image in fullscreenA community meeting in Tucson to discuss the pros and cons of Project Blue.Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty ImagesBeale did not detail exactly how much water it would use and from where in the weeks after the June vote, even though it claimed the project would be “water positive”. In the absence of details, Bogan set out to analyze how the project would be water positive, projecting it would be most likely to use treated water that now flows into the Santa Cruz. But even if the company went that route, Bogan wrote in a white paper on 11 July, it could dry up significant portions of the river, harming the many plants and animals that live there.The city manager, Tim Thomure, acting as an intermediary between Beale and the public, released thefirst concrete detailsabout the project’s planned water use in mid-July after Bogan’s white paper came out: Project Blue would not affect the Santa Cruz River, he said. It would use three sources of water, including from two locations where treated wastewater is currently stored underground for future use, as well as the Tucson airport remediation plant, which treats contaminated groundwater that currently stays on site. And it gave an estimate of water use: over 1,900 acre-feet, or 620m gallons, enough to supply more than four typical 18-hole Pima county golf courses, according to Thomure.Beale also pledged to invest $100m in a pipeline to transport and use treated wastewater, and create 180 jobs.But this is not “water positive”, and it would rather cause “net depletion of our groundwater resources to supply Project Blue”, said Bogan, the aquatic ecologist. He pointed to a city document which notes that if Project Blue were to use more groundwater than it could replenish, it could make payments, or “water positivity rates” to make up for it.Lisa Shipek, executive director of southern Arizona’sWatershed Management Group, agreed with Bogan’s assessment. By possibly paying for using up groundwater, Project Blue, Shipek said, would potentially “replace wet water with ‘paper water’”. The tactic – paying for consuming wet water, or offsetting it in another way, whether in the form of water conservation or education measures – has been used to deplete groundwater throughout the world.Water not the only concernWater wasn’t community members’ only concern. Beale Infrastructure is not a typical developer, but rather a subsidiary of the asset management company Blue Owl. On 21 July, the local news site Arizona Luminariapublished a storyrevealing that Pima county staff possessed a memo stating that Project Blue would be financed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The story prompted fresh outcry from community members frustrated with Amazon’santi-unionactions, and overtures by its owner, Jeff Bezos, to the Trump administration.An AWS spokesperson said: “AWS has previously engaged in standard due diligence processes in Arizona, like we do in any geographic location we consider building and operating our infrastructure. We do not have any commitments or agreements in place to develop this project.”But the company declined to answer a question about whether AWS was affiliated with Project Blue in the past, or, potentially, in the future.A Beale spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on our tenants until a more advanced stage of the project.”Another wrinkle that added to the uproar was anews release from Tucson Electric Power(TEP) put out hours after the county vote on 17 June, announcing it was requesting a 14% rate increase to offset grid investments and inflation. With datacenters driving up electricity demand across the country, many community members assumed the rate hike was related to Project Blue, said the county supervisor, Matt Heinz.It wasn’t. The timing was coincidental, and a huge mistake, he said. “It’s unfortunately really plagued this whole project.”A TEP spokesperson, Joseph Barrios, said that the rate increase had nothing to do with Project Blue, but was based on costs already incurred in 2024 and before.View image in fullscreenA banner held up at the convention center.Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty Images“We understand that any rate increase could have an impact on our customers and it’s not something we take lightly,” he said.Outrage over Project Blue grew rapidly over the summer. Eliseo Gomez, a local high school teacher and organizer, convened with a small group at the base of Tucson’s “A” mountain shortly after the 17 June vote. “We were like: what can we do?” They decided to target the annexation vote. The group started a website and social media channels namedNo Desert Data Center, encouraging people to express their concerns with the mayor and city council.In response, the city arranged for two public meetings with presentations from Beale Infrastructure, as well as Tucson Water and TEP. The majority of attenders at both meetings were clearly opposed, most wearing red shirts saying “no to Project Blue” or holding protest signs. Union members, enticed by promises of construction jobs, made up a supportive minority at the events. Attenders grew increasingly upset, Gomez said, as they felt their concerns and queries were dodged or ignored. By the second meeting, on 4 August, many locals appeared fed up. Beale executives gave similar speeches, without providing much further detail, incensing the crowd, whose boos and shouts made it difficult for presenters to continue.Many citizens presented their own research. “I feel like I learned more about Project Blue from the public than the city,” said city councilman Rocque Perez.On 6 August, in an unscheduled vote, council members unanimously decided to discontinue discussions with Beale, each sharing short speeches revealing sharp opposition to Project Blue. Tucsonans packing the council chambers cheered and celebrated; Beale executives, appearing stunned, were booed as they left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In mid-September, the company proposed moving forwardwith an air-cooled systemthat uses less water than the original design. Beale co-filed a state application with the TEP, to be supplied with up to 286 megawatts – enough to power to up to 250,000 homes.In a statement, Beale has described the new design as a closed-loop system that “uses minimal amounts of water that are continuously recirculated, thereby eliminating water loss”.Several local leaders said the Republican-led Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees electricity use in the state, is likely to approve the project’s electricity request. That would mean Beale’s main remaining hurdle is finding a water source. The company has not said how it would obtain any such water, however, and given the city council’s vote, they cannot be supplied by the city’s public utility.Meanwhile, the controversy has had a profound impact on Tucson politics. Even supporters acknowledge the Project Blue process started poorly, partly because non-disclosure agreements between Beale and city staff dating back to 2022 meant that most elected leaders knew little to nothing about it until some time this year.Supervisor Jennifer Allen said the first meeting between Beale and the board in late May was short on details, including water use, and her requests for more information turned up nothing concrete. It was “a lot of greenwashing”, she said. She voted no on 17 June, as did her colleague Andrés Cano.Heinz, a longtime Democrat, said he voted for the rezoning and sale because the project had long been championed by city staff, including city manager Thomure, and because the tens of thousands of hi-tech jobs in the area will need access to nearby datacenters.Though there weren’t detailed water use estimates at first, Heinz said he wasn’t worried as Beale would be working with Tucson Water and the city would be “putting in those guardrails”.View image in fullscreenThe north-eastern edge of the Tucson Mountains. .Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty ImagesThe new design, he said, “will be an even better fit for southern Arizona”.“I frankly wish they’d approached us with this air-cooled design to begin with.”Heinz, as well as supervisors Rex Scott and Steve Christy, have come under withering scrutiny from constituents, who have implored the board to revisit the sale agreement. Heinz said that wasn’t going to happen. “There’s no vote before the board,” Heinz said. “It’s done. And I don’t want to reverse it.”Scott acknowledged that NDAs played a negative role in the affair and noted that both the county and city had already implemented new guidelines for handling them, which should grant more transparency to the process, Scott said.The city council has also since passed new rules to give more transparency and oversight over big water users, and they are developing specific guidelines and guard-rails to govern any future proposed data centers.‘Cities across the country are being sold the same story’While Beale’s air-cooled system may use less water, it has highlighted the other enormous costs of datacenters: electricity. Air-cooled systems use huge amounts of energy and are less energy efficient – especially in a desert where the daily average high is 29C (84F).It’s now a national issue – a 2024report to Congressco-authored by Oak Ridge National Laboratory researcherAB Siddikestimates that datacenters consumed 4.4% of the nation’s total electricity as of 2023, which could rise to as much as 12% by 2028.TEP’s involvement has brought scrutiny to the private utility; locals have recently been protesting at their headquarters. On 23 September, the mayor and council announced they plan to intervene in the utility’s request to the state for the rate hike, saying ina statementsuch an increase “will strain families and small businesses and slow the transition to clean, affordable energy”.View image in fullscreenCommunity members hold up signs at the Tucson convention center.Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty ImagesThe saga has also raised the possibility that the Tucsonans or their leaders could consider pursuing a public utility to replace TEP when its contract is due for review in 2025, though that could be an enormous effort, Perez said.“I’m disappointed that Tucson Electric Power is partnering with Beale despite strong community concerns,” said councilman Kevin Dahl. “It certainly makes an argument for public power.”TEP spokesperson Joseph Barrios said that the utility’s involvement with Project Blue would not raise customers’ rates or affect their service.“We have an obligation to serve, and that includes all customers within our service area,” Barrios said.As far as the possibility of public power, “we feel our community is better served by continuing to work together”, he added.Council member and vice-mayor Lane Santa Cruz said this wasn’t just about Tucson, though.“What’s happening here isn’t unique to us: cities across the country are being sold the same story, with promises of jobs, innovation and progress,” she said. “But what’s not being talked about is who really benefits and what it costs us.”Too often, she added, these projects are extractive, using a community’s water, electricity, and labor – while providing only a small number of jobs – instead of being a sustainable partner.“We need to be the city that draws the line,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArizonaUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the exemption had been criticised for enabling the rapid growth of cheap imports from China via Shein and Temu.Income tax paid by the group remained steady at about $188m, although that included $6.1m deferred and adjusted tax relating to prior years.Shein’s UK arm has beenaccused of transferring the “vast bulk of income”to its Singaporean parent to cut its British tax bill.The company paid £9.6m in corporation tax in the UK despite making £2bn in sales last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And then a Haji Wright goal in the 33rd minute on a lovely through ball by Cristian Roldan, poking a tidy finish past Maty Ryan. Some chippy late Australian tackles that failed to rattle the Americans. And then, in the 51st minute, Wright’s second goal – the Coventry City man’s 11th in 11 matches for club and country, bringing the game to its final: 2-1.In our family, there’s been zero doubt about Diego Luna’s USMNT identityRead moreThe US had chances to run up the score. Roldan had a few close efforts. Diego Luna was denied point-blank by Ryan. Aidan Morris had a late chance off a mazy dribble but rolled his finish wide.The gutsy turnaround combined all of the things Pochettino has been demanding to see. In beating an Australia side that had not lost in a dozen games, the US got tougher, nastier, feistier. They got into scuffles when they needed to assert their presence. They played their own game on their own terms.Call itPochismo, a term floated in a recent press conference, to the affable Argentine’s delight. Or call it Poch-ball if you hate fun. Call it culture, which Pochettino has been talking about a lot in the last few days, and how it eats strategy for breakfast – an aphorism coined by management guru Peter Drucker, because modern soccer managers love few things as much as borrowing corporatese.It was fitting, then, that the introduction of Luna for Pulisic should coincide with the turning of the tide – without meaning to suggest that correlation is causation here. Luna has become a poster boy forPochismo;A fiery sparkplug unafraid to take the game by the, well, let’s say scruff – although Pochettino might choose a different bit of anatomy in private.View image in fullscreenUS and Australia players nearly came to blows on a few occasions.Photograph: Andrew Wevers/USSF/Getty ImagesIn Wright and Roldan, erstwhile depth players stepped forward and will now make for uncomfortable crowding on the depth chart. That, too, was something Pochettino had hoped to see when he rotated six players out of his lineup after Friday’s 1-1 tie with Ecuador.“Players that can maybe tomorrow have the opportunity to perform and say, ‘Hey, be careful because I am knocking on the door and I can be there also in theWorld Cup,’” the head coach said of the changes before the game.Suddenly, the Americans have gone from a dearth of productive strikers to a glut of them. Folarin Balogunhas looked imperiousin recent games, with the England-raised Monaco man looking like he could grow into the best striker this nation has had in at least a decade, if not several of them. Now, on the back of Haji Wright’s brace, there are options.“That is what we expect when we give the opportunity to the player,” Pochettino added afterwards. “That is good news.”Roldan, likewise, has elevated himself from the consummate glue guy to a man who might be cast for a leading role. Aside from his two assists on the night, Roldan was imperious in the middle of the park, often at the center of important plays on both sides of the ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how, if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything.”Over the course of a team’s construction on the way to a World Cup, a loss can sometimes spark a kind of momentum. At the 2009 Confederations Cup, the US were hammered 3-1 by Italy and 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, yet stuck together and worked out how to mend themselves. The Yankssnuckinto the semi-finals andbeat a Spanish juggernautto advance to the final, where they held a 2-0 lead over Brazil,before giving it away. That laid the foundation for asuccessful tournamentin South Africa in 2010.During qualifying for the 2014 in edition, the Americans lost 2-1 in Honduras, whereupon a bombshell story in the Sporting News, wherein players tore into head coach Jürgen Klinsmann, threatened to derail their progress to Brazil. It didn’t. The Americans went on a long unbeaten run from there and then survived the group of death at the World Cup.This generation, meanwhile, suffered the shock of going through Concacaf World Cup qualifying for the first time in the late summer of 2021 with a scoreless tie in El Salvador, a home draw with Canada, and a half-time deficit in Honduras. Then, finally, they worked up the requisite intensity and unlocked a berth in Qatar without much more drama.A2-0 loss to South Koreain New Jersey on 6 September might have been just such a moment for the current USMNT.The turnaround was already apparent in the second half, when the US changed formation and outplayed their opponents, even if the scoreboard remained unchanged. Theybeat Japan 2-0 three days later, relieving some pressure at last.Against Ecuador on Friday,the US looked sharp, organized and creativein the absence of Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Tyler Adams and, for most of the game, Pulisic. The Yanks matched South America’s second-best team in World Cup qualifying for a 1-1 tie.“After one year, I am so, so, so happy that we don’t talk about other things like commitment, attitude or things like this that normally in the past we were talking [about],” Pochettino proclaimed then. “I think that is a massive step up. It’s a thing that we need to forget and always win or lose depend[ing] on our performance. [If we don’t win], it’s a soccer problem and not another problem.”There have been a lot of those steps up for the US in the last six weeks. While Pochettino continues to take the long view, carefully managing minutes and niggling injuries, trying out players, formations, and pairings, his team is amassing a tangible momentum.“Progression is progression,” Pochettino said this week. “It’s difficult to measure. If you feel the progression, I think it’s good.”At long last, with just two camps remaining before the US assembles for a second World Cup on home turf in May, the Americans are feeling something.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

For now, there’s no ice.With NHL playerspreparing to return to the Olympicsfor the first time in more than a decade, construction on the main hockey arena for the Milan-Cortina Games is going down to the wire.Local organizers confirmed to the Associated Press on Wednesday that the main test event for the 16,000-seat Santagiulia arena that was scheduled for December has been moved to a smaller arena – and that no new test event has been scheduled yet.One year to the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics: Twenty athletes from Team USA to watchRead moreThe issue raises the prospect that there might not be a game held in the main arena until the puck is dropped for the women’s preliminary round competition at the Olympics on 5 February – one day before the opening ceremony.“It’s going to be very close to the start of the games, the timeline is very tight. But we knew that,” Milan-Cortina local organizing committee CEO Andrea Varnier said recently.The event that was supposed to test the Santagiulia ice was part of the under-20 world championship from 8-14 December. That event has been moved to the Rho Fiera hockey venue, which is being set up inside a giant convention center on Milan’s outskirts and will host secondary matches during the games.Usually, new Olympic venues are tested at least the year before hosting medal events. And with a large hockey arena, it’s not just about the ice and making sure that the playing surface is ready and safe. It’s also about testing concession stands, bathrooms and everything else inside a brand-new modern arena.The Santagiulia venue, which is being built by a private company, is slated to become Italy’s largest indoor arena. For after the Olympics, it’s being eyed as a possible future host of the ATP Finals tennis event.Despite the delays and concerns, high-priced tickets are already being sold for events at the Santagiulia arena. Seats for the men’s gold medal game on 22 February – the closing day of the games – are going for as much as €1,400 (more than $1,600). That’s more than for any other sports event at the Milan-Cortina Games. Only tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies cost more.The return ofNHLplayers at the Olympics was announced last February, with the world’s top hockey league allowing its players to participate in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014 in Sochi.The men’s Olympic hockey tournament is scheduled to run from 11-22 February.

The facts behind his threatsDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed he could take World Cup matches away from US cities he deems “unsafe”. Here’s what he said – and what powers he does and doesn’t haveAlexander AbnosWed 15 Oct 2025 14.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 18.44 EDTShareWhat exactly did Trump say?Which time? Tuesdaywas the second timeTrump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it’s important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games.On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump’s use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues.“I guess, but we’re going to make sure they’re safe,” Trumpsaid. “They’re run by radical left lunatics and that don’t know what they’re doing.”Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city.“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won’t allow it to go to it. We’ll move it around a little bit,” Trump said.Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day’s press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year’s expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue.“We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She’s radical left, and they’re taking over parts of Boston. That’s a pretty big statement, right?”Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees.“If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let’s move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it. Very easily, he’d do it.”Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well.“If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I’d probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.”Does the US president have any power over the World Cup or Olympics?In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup’s case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer’s global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own.That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president’s return to office.Could Fifa actually move World Cup games from places like Boston or Seattle?Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities.Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle’s status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It’s hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It’s hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams’ travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It’s easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well.What role does the US government actually play in these events?So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.”The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won’t have visas approved in time for the games themselves.There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police.View image in fullscreenBoston mayor Michelle Wu has dismissed Trump’s threat of removing World Cup games from Foxborough.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty ImagesHow has Fifa responded?So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump’s threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports.Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October,responding to Trump’s commentsabout Seattle and San Francisco.“It’s Fifa’s tournament, Fifa’s jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That’s the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”A Fifa spokesperson told Politico: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all Fifa events worldwide and it is ultimately the government’s responsibility to decide what’s in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfil all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”Outside of Fifa, Wuresponded to Trump’s threatby pointing out that much of Fifa’s host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it.“We’re in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.”Have events ever been moved before?Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women’s World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year’s Sars outbreak.Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country’s government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year’s U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting.The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London.Why is Trump tying “safety” to these events?Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration.What would happen if Washington tried to intervene?That’ll be the real test, won’t it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.Explore more on these topicsSport politicsWorld Cup 2026LA Olympic Games 2028World CupDonald TrumpBostonInternational Olympic CommitteeexplainersShareReuse this content"

The 2017 MVP joins the Kings ahead of his 18th NBA season, giving Sacramento an experienced option in a backcourt that lacked depth a year ago.Westbrook, who turns 37 in November, spent last season with the Denver Nuggets, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 75 games while shooting 44.9% from the field. He remained unsigned through the summer as he weighed options before finalizing terms with the Kings this week. He’s expected to join the team later this week.The Kings ranked 28th in bench scoring and 29th in assists per game last season, areas where Westbrook’s playmaking and energy could make an immediate impact. Perry has emphasized building a team that plays with effort and urgency, traits that have defined Westbrook’s career.Westbrook is the NBA’s all-time leader in triple-doubles (203) and ranks eighth in assists. He enters the season 506 points shy of surpassing Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard in league history. Sacramento will be his seventhNBAteam, following stints with Oklahoma City, Houston, Washington, the Lakers, Clippers and Denver.Explore more on these topicsSacramento KingsNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The event will feature three teams of eight players facing off in a round-robin tournament, with the top two advancing to a championship game. It will air live on FOX Sports and Tubi, with actor and comedian Kevin Hart serving as host.Garrett, one of the NFL’s premier defensive players, said his decision to participate stems from a desire to help expand the game’s reach.“Just like every other sport has grown worldwide, we want to make [American football] the world’s game,” Garrett told the Guardian. “We’re proud to be ambassadors for this beautiful game that we love.”The NFL’s move comes as Saudi Arabia continues to expand its influence in global sports, investing billions of dollars to bring major events and athletes to the kingdom. Its push has included the launch of LIV Golf in 2022, lucrative deals to attract some of the world’s top soccer players, and high-profile boxing matches – all part of a broader effort to reshape its global image through sports.View image in fullscreenThe Guardian’s Rob Booth tries out flag football in London last year.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThere was hesitation by many athletes then to participate, and Saudi Arabia faced intense criticism in 2022 when it launched LIV Golf, a rival league to the PGA Tour backed by its sovereign wealth fund. Now the PGA and LIV have a working agreement.Garrett said there are always challenges when starting something new.“That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it,” he said. “You should take that into account and find a way to make yourself different and still appealing. We’re trying to do that. We still love the game here, but we want to see it grow and find new areas of talent.”For Garrett, it’s another chance to showcase his sport on a global stage. But for critics, it’s part of a much bigger debate about what role Saudi Arabia – and its billions – should play in the world of sports.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Riyadh showcase isn’t just about one night of football in the desert; it’s part of a long-term push to transform a uniquely American game into a truly global sport.And with flag football poised to enter the Olympics, the stakes are far larger than a single exhibition. For the league, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic could mark the start of a new chapter – one where flag football becomes a global phenomenon and the NFL’s future is no longer confined to American shores and a handful of international games during the regular season.“This will be the ultimate celebration for football fans everywhere and introduce a whole new audience to America’s most popular game,” said Michael D Ratner, OBB Media Founder and CEO, in a press release. “Flag football is the fastest-growing sport in the world, and with [Olympics 2028] on the horizon, the timing couldn’t be better to showcase it on a global stage.”The NFL did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsFlag footballNFLSaudi Arabia and sportUS sportsTom BradyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yamamoto’s gem in Game 2 came one night after two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell allowed one hit over eight shutout inningsfor a 2-1 victory.“We said before this postseason started, our starting pitching was going to be what carried us,” said Max Muncy, who set a Dodgers record by hitting his 14th career postseason homer. “And so far it’s been exactly that.”It’s a dramatically different approach than the one the Dodgers took last year, when starting pitchers worked six innings in only two of their 16 postseason games. They have seven quality starts in eight playoff games this year, and their starters own a 1.54 postseason ERA.That stellar pitching has the Dodgers closing in on another World Series berth even with the bullpen struggling and three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani going 2 for 25 at the plate over his last six games.After winning nine of their last 11 regular-season games, the Dodgers are 7-1 in the postseason.“Our entire team is playing the best baseball we’ve played all year,” manager Dave Roberts said. “The focus, the concentration level is at the highest, and we’re peaking at the right time.”Teoscar Hernández also homered to help the Dodgers leave Milwaukee with a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday. Yamamoto allowed a home run to Jackson Chourio on the first of his 111 pitches – 81 strikes – but shut down the Brewers the rest of the way.The $325m right-hander struck out seven and walked one during his first complete game in two major league seasons.“I reset my mind [after Chourio’s homer] and then I just focused on executing my own pitches,” Yamamoto said through an interpreter.The previous postseason starter to go the distance was Justin Verlander when he tossed a five-hitter with 13 strikeouts for Houston against the New York Yankees in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS on 14 October 2017 – eight years ago to the day.Yamamoto’s complete game was the first for Los Angeles since Gavin Stone’s gem on 26 June last year. The last Dodgers pitcher to throw a complete game in the postseason was Jose Lima against St Louis in Game 3 of their 2004 NL Division Series.“I established my rhythm and then I dictated the tempo based off the game,” Yamamoto said. “So that was great.”This is the first time since 1970 that both LCS road teams started 2-0. The Seattle Mariners own a 2-0 lead over Toronto in the ALCS heading into Game 3 on Wednesday in Seattle.Twenty-four of the previous 27 teams that took the first two games on the road in a best-of-seven series with a 2-3-2 format have gone on to win. The three teams to come back after losing Games 1 and 2 at home all came in World Series: the 1985 Kansas City Royals against the St. Louis Cardinals, the 1986 New York Mets against the Boston Red Sox, and the 1996 New York Yankees against the Atlanta Braves.“You guys might have us counted out,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “And I understand that 90% of the teams that have been in this situation don’t win the series. But this team has been counted out a lot this year. And I think there’s some fight left in them.”The Brewers pulled out all the stops Tuesday as they tried to avoid that 2-0 deficit. Former slugger Eric Thames got on the field to exhort fans just before the game and popped open his jersey to reveal his bare chest.Chourio then delighted a sellout crowd with his fourth career postseason homer, tying Orlando Arcia and Prince Fielder for the Brewers record. It was the fifth leadoff homer of this postseason, tying anMLBmark originally set in 2007.That seemed like a foreboding start for Yamamoto, who lasted just two-thirds of an inning in a 9-1 loss the previous time he pitched in Milwaukee. But he bounced back and silenced the Brewers the rest of the way.The NL Central champions, who led the majors with 97 wins during the regular season, have five hits in the series.“We’ve just got to play better,” said slugger Christian Yelich, who is 0 for 13 in his last four games. “It’s not an ideal start to the series, by any means. Just have to continue to battle and find a way to get the offense going. I’ve got to be better. We’ve got to be better. It’s just facts.”Los Angeles became the first team to have consecutive postseason starts of at least eight innings in the same series since San Francisco’s Madison Bumgarner and Tim Lincecum did it in Games 4 and 5 of the 2010 World Series against Texas.After Chourio’s homer, the Dodgers wasted no time coming back against Brewers ace Freddy Peralta.Hernández, whose baserunning mistake contributed to the Brewers’ unusual 8-6-2 double play in Game 1, sent a 3-2 curve over the left-field wall for his fourth homer of this postseason. One out later, Kiké Hernández singled and scored on Andy Pages’ double.Pages had been 1 for 27 in the postseason before delivering his shot into the right-field corner.Muncy extended the lead to 3-1 with his two-out homer in the sixth, which came on Peralta’s 97th and final pitch. The Dodgers added two more runs on RBI singles by Shohei Ohtani in the seventh and Tommy Edman in the eighth.Explore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles DodgersMilwaukee BrewersBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old British driver has five wins in eight seasons in F1, including victory in Singapore, helping propel Mercedes into a fight for second in the world championship with Ferrari and Red Bull.Norris as Senna and Piastri as Prost?

It has been such a long and successful partnership so far and I can’t wait to see what lies ahead, particularly as we embark on one of the largest regulation changes in the sport’s history next year.”It is understood his desire to reduce his marketing and PR commit­ments was part of the deal but the length of the contract is likely to have played a significant part. This year the ­Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, madeno secret of his desireto lure the four-time world champion ­Verstappen away from Red Bull.However, before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen confirmed he wouldremain with Red Bull for 2026, so Mercedes were expected to stick with their drivers for the new season.The team’s announcement, made before the US Grand Prix this weekend, makes no mention of the duration of the new deals. A two-year arrangement is standard but both drivers could be on a 1+1 deal which enables either party to exercise an opt‑out after the first year.View image in fullscreenKimi Antonelli has also signed a new deal with Mercedes.Photograph: Jayce Illman/Getty ImagesWith a complete reset of the regulations next season the form book could change radically and ­Mercedes will be looking to be flexible come mid-season when it becomes clear who has come out on top, leaving the door open for another pursuit of Verstappen.

The Bayern Munich striker lost three of them with his previous club, Tottenham, including the Champions League final in 2019.Kane’s response to the failure against France was to work at introducing greater variation to his penalty-taking technique, principally a stutter run where he waits for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball. The results have been spectacular.Kane went on a run of 31 successful conversions for club and country after France, the sequence broken at the start of this season when he missed for Bayern in the German Cup against Wehen Wiesbaden. Since then, he has scored six in a row, the latest coming inEngland’s 5-0 win against Latviain Riga on Tuesday. The result secured qualification for the World Cup finals, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.“I always try to learn from those moments,” Kane said. “After that penalty, I went 31 without missing. I changed my technique a little bit. I improved in that sense, which I was proud of. In terms of that being my last memory of a World Cup … yeah, I’m looking forward to the next World Cup to try to put that right, to try to go further, to try to lift the trophy as we all dream of doing. Those moments only shape you as a person, as a player and it’s definitely helped me to become a better player.”It was striking to hear Kane open up about the miss against France. “I’d say that was probably the worst that I felt in any moment,” he said. “Obviously I’ve lost finals before. To have that responsibility, you almost feel like it fell on my shoulders and I guess not being able to execute something that I’ve been able to execute many a time in my career … I think that was the hardest part to process and take.“Always as a sportsman, putting yourself in that situation … there’s going to be moments where it doesn’t quite go your way. But [it’s] the way I learned from that … the way that motivated me to get even better and improve – not just from the penalty side in terms of improving my technique but as an all-round player. To know I want to be back there at the World Cup, to help England get back there.”Kane scored twice in the victory against Latvia to move to 76 England goals. If Wayne Rooney’s previous record for the nation of 53 is fast becoming a speck in the rearview mirror, the prospect of Kane reaching an astonishing century feels increasingly feasible.View image in fullscreenKane is overcome with disappointment after missing from 12 yards against France in Qatar.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think it’s there,” the 32‑year‑old captain said. “The way I’m feeling right now, I’m not slowing down any time soon. I want to stay at this level for as long as I can. I’m on 76 now so that leaves 24 and we have a few more games between now and the World Cup … and then try to edge closer to that 100.”Kane has scored 18 goals for Bayern this season plus three for England. He feels he is in the form of his life. “I think so. The goals are there and the numbers speak for themselves. The way I feel on the pitch, the way I am seeing the game, physically and without the ball, pressing … I feel in a really good place. I feel like I have stepped up another level this season.”The England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, who signed Kane at Bayern in the summer of 2023, paid tribute to his professionalism. “For me, he never misses a penalty,” Tuchel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sandy Baltimore opened the scoring from the penalty spot while Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert also got on the scoresheet.It was a memorable night for Thompson who added the hosts’ third immediately after the break. The 20-year-old has enjoyed a bright start to her Chelsea career since making a high-profile £1.1m move from Angel City this summer. She played an integral role in getting Chelsea this Champions League win at Stamford Bridge and Bompastor was delighted with her progression.Chelsea 4-0 Paris FC: Women’s Champions League – live reactionRead more“I’m glad for her because I think she’s been working hard and the fact that she was able to score her first goal is really important for her confidence,” she said.“She’s really quick and she has an engine.

We scored really good goals from different players and we could have had more.”The recent lack of attacking cohesion has not been helped by Bompastor’s rotation. There were just two changes on this occasion with Baltimore and Sjoeke Nüsken coming in.Paris FC had suffered an equally underwhelming start, surrendering a 2-0 lead to the newcomers OH Leuven. Sandrine Soubeyrand welcomed back the goalkeeper Mylène Chavas while Maëlle Garbino and Anaële Le Moguédec also came in.It promised to be an intriguing contest between two managers who are very well acquainted. Bompastor and Soubeyrand played for France together for over a decade while also meeting often as managers in the Première Ligue.Chelsea dominated proceedings from the start. The urgency to score early was clear and led to a series of snatched opportunities when patience was needed. Nüsken and Cuthbert had efforts from distance while Aggie Beever-Jones scuffed two gilt-edged opportunities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After thrashing Bayern Munich 7-1 in their opener, Barça broke through after just two minutes in the Italian capital, Esmee Brugts scrambling the ball in from close range.Barcelona won a penalty early in the second half, only for Putellas to send her attempted Panenka over the bar. Just before the hour, Kika Nazareth volleyed into the far corner to double the visitors' lead, and Putellas made amends with her second spot-kick. Caroline Graham Hansen's late tap-in completed the rout.Twentecould not follow up last week's draw with Chelsea as they lost 2-1 atOH Leuvendespite taking a first-half lead through Jaimy Ravensbergen. The Dutch side held on until the 82nd minute before conceding a penalty, converted by Linde Veefkind. In the sixth minute of stoppage time, Sara Pusztai struck a spectacular winner for Leuven, smashing the ball into the top corner.Earlier, a much-changedOL Lyonnesside eased to a 3-0 home win over St Pölten. Jule Brand opened the scoring with her first goal for the club, and Ada Hegerberg headed the hosts' second just before half-time as the Austrian visitors paid for missed chances. Teenage midfielder Lily Yohannes completed the scoring soon after the restart with a brilliant lob from close to the halfway line.Wolfsburggrabbed a late victory atVålerengathanks to Janina Minge's penalty. The midfielder converted from the spot with the last kick of the game after Naina Inauen's foul in the area. Wolfsburg took the lead through Lineth Beerensteyn in the 57th minute, but Sara Hørte headed home just three minutes later to level for the hosts in Oslo.Guardian sportPhotograph: Matteo Ciambelli/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their pressure eventually told, however, when Nüsken went down in the box with half an hour played. The offence from Le Moguédec was not initially spotted by the referee, Michalina Diakow, but after a brief trip to the VAR monitor, she duly pointed to the spot. Baltimore stepped up to convert for the second week in a row.Chelsea consolidated their advantage just before the break when Thompson broke forward at pace. A clever turn gave her space to stand up a cross for Rytting Kaneryd to loop a header home. The winger looked slightly bemused that it had ended up in the back of the net, celebrating with an expression that said she is not accustomed to scoring with her head.Chelsea did not let their foot off the gas and extended their lead immediately after the break with Thompson’s close-range finish. They soon had a fourth when Cuthbert touched home a Sam Kerr header on the line.There was still time for the Cobham academy product and England youth international Lexi Potter to make her debut as Chelsea saw out a comfortable victory. It was an important three points on the board ahead of a trip to Austria to face St Pölten next month.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenParis FCWomen's footballUS sportsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The messiness of this situation is unlikely to placate an already angry fanbase. There was, however, an increased confidence from Rangers sources on Wednesday that Muscat could be delivered.Russell Martin was sackedas the Rangers manager last Sunday, his spell lasting just 123 days amid constant negativity from supporters. The Ibrox hierarchy only turned attention towards Muscat, who spent a brief time as a Rangers player, earlier this week. Yet appointing the Australian will not be completely straightforward; he is under contract with Shanghai Port for another year, with the club leading the Chinese Super League title race with four games to go.Shanghai Port’s season will not end until 22 November, before which time Rangers have eight games at home and abroad. Muscat would almost certainly have to take a pay cut to move to Glasgow. He is, though, known to be keen on managing in Britain after prior spells at Melbourne Victory, Belgium’s Sint-Truiden and Yokohama F. Marinos. The 52-year-old has maintained an affiliation with Rangers despite leaving in 2003.View image in fullscreenDanny Röhl has joined Steven Gerrard in withdrawing from the process to find a new Rangers manager.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThere was awareness within Ibrox that Röhl, 36, was likely to meet with a lukewarm reception in the stands if appointed. This caused unease among Rangers’ decision-makers. The German’s only experience as a first-team manager came at Wednesday. Muscat is considerably more popular among Rangers fans, partly because of a prior connection to the club but also because of his supposed no-nonsense approach to management.Muscat was previously in the running for the Rangers post in 2023, when Philippe Clement was instead appointed. Rangers are expected to at least clarify their short-term management plans by Friday. Dundee United visit Ibrox on Scottish Premiership business on Saturday afternoon.Rangers are eighth in the table and currently trail the leaders, Hearts, by 11 points. Celtic are nine points ahead of their Old Firm rivals after just seven fixtures, while Rangers have also lost their opening two Europa League group games this term.Explore more on these topicsRangersAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

She was awarded an MBE for services to women’s football and the LGBTQ+ community in 2018. She became Wales’s first footballer to reach a century of caps in 2017.Fishlock cemented her place in the Cymru history books when she scored Wales’s first goal at a major women’s international tournament in July,finding the net against Francein St Gallen, Switzerland, during a group-stage defeat at Euro 2025.“The Euros was the pinnacle of my football career; seeing the dragon on the world stage for the first time will be a memory that will stay with me for a lifetime,” Fishlock posted on social media. “To all the players and staff, past and present, diolch [thank you]. It has been an incre­dible journey.”After starting with Cardiff City, she has spent most of her career overseas, predominantly with the NWSL club Seattle Reign, whom she joined in 2013. She has helped Reign to win three NWSL shields and was named as the NWSL’s MVP in 2021, making the NWSL’s “best XI” five times.Fishlock won the Champions League with Lyon in 2019 during a loan spell, and has also had successful loans with clubs including Melbourne City and Reading. Her club career continues, with the NWSL end‑of‑season playoffs approaching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I’m losing her.”Trinity Rodman bursts into tears after stoppage time winner in injury returnRead moreLike most women’s soccer players of her generation, Press enjoyed a meandering professional club career that started in Florida with MagicJack in Women’s Professional Soccer (WPS). When that league folded, Press moved to Sweden with Kopparbergs/Göteborg FC and Tyresö before returning stateside in the newly launchedNWSLwith the Utah Royals and Chicago Red Stars. She made 14 appearances for Manchester United in the 2020-21 WSL season, but returned to her home town of Los Angeles for the launch of Angel City in 2022.Press will be remembered most for her national team career, which saw her play a key role in the United States’ triumphs in the 2015 and 2019 Women’s World Cups. Whether as a starter or an effective substitute, Press’ speed, finishing and ability with the ball at her feet was a key component of those teams. In total, Press scored 64 goals for the US national team – one more than teammate Megan Rapinoe and good for ninth on the all-time scoring charts for the US.Press’s later playing career was unfortunately marked by a extended injury struggles and a sudden absence from the USWNT picture. Shortly before making that move to LA, Press took a break from the US national team for mental health reasons, and then-head coach Vlatko Andonovski left her off his US rosters after she said she was available to return in 2022.Press tore her ACL in June of 2022 – an injury that ended up requiring multiple surgeries to fully repair. In total, the injury kept Press out of action until the 2024 season and effectively ended her national team career, though her comeback with Angel City has been hailed as inspiring by many across the world of women’s soccer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heath, Press’ teammate with the US, retired earlier in 2025.“She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot,” she said of whether Heath’s decision contributed to her own retirement. “I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we’re going to be a part of this game forever, but it’s time for it to look different for us.”Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamAngel City FCNWSLManchester United WomenUS sportsWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueShareReuse this content"

Sadly, there were no such comedy wildlife incursions, so as England piled the hurt (and goals) on their hosts, their travelling fans chose instead to amuse themselves byrelentlessly ribbingThomas Tuchel, who had been extremely critical of thelibrary-level silenceduring England’s dismantling of Wales at Wembley. “I got a bit of stick and I found it quite creative,” parped Tuchel, having spent the evening being serenaded by fans insisting they would sing when they want, among other pertinent ditties containing effing and jeffing that has no place in a family football email. “It made me smile. It’s British humour and I can take it. No harm done.”While you wouldn’t think there had been no harm done going by some of the pearl-clutching and pulpit-thumping which greeted this fan mockery in a few write-ups of the match, such has been the ease with which England have qualified for the Geopolitics World Cup that it is no surprise selected commentators felt compelled to confect outrage and hysteria out of nowt rather than just focus on a job being well done, albeit against extremely limited opposition. While the good news is that England have qualified with two games to spare, having won six out of six without conceding a goal in Group K, there’s no getting away from the fact that they have done so against three nations and a ski resort with a combined world ranking of 411. An undeniably promising side whose sole defeat under Tuchel came in the only match they’ve played against reasonablyfancied opposition in Senegal, we don’t yet know how good this work in process could be. Worryingly, their next matches of any major importance could be played in conditions so hot that the incessant parping of that effing brass band will be drowned out by the sound of Anthony Gordon’s skin crackling in the early afternoon sun.With the draw for the GWC not taking place until December, handwringing over the potentially devastating and thus far overlooked effects of the American heat on England’s chances will have to wait, so for now the likely passenger manifest of The Plane has come under the microscope. In his three camps to date, Tinkering Tom has picked 37 different players, which means no fewer than 11 are going to be left gutted upon discovering there’s no place for them in his plans. And that’s before you get to the in-form Jack Grealish and Adam Wharton, who have yet to get a look-in. “That should have been Adam Wharton,” tooted the former of the latter upon being presented with the player-of-the-match awardwhen Everton beat Crystal Palacebefore the international break. With just two more of those to go before Tuchel picks his squad, it looks increasingly likely that both players could miss out next summer. It is a measure of just how much talent there is at England’s disposal that the duo may not even be the most conspicuous absentees.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Taha Hashim from 8pm BST for updates on Chelsea 3-1 Paris FC in Women’s Bigger Cup.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I’m actually in Sweden right now, in my house in Sweden.

He is keen to maintain the momentum in the final ­qualifiers against Serbia at Wembley and ­Albania in Tirana and will lean once more towards continuity; faith in those who have delivered across two impressive camps.But Tuchel intends to stay connected to those presently on the outside, to ensure they remain hungry for involvement, saying: “Maybe we have the chance to invite more ­players [in November] or share some minutes.” It is a delicate balance and the situation with Bellingham is surely the most delicate owing to his status in the game.Tuchel tried to make clear that the Real Madrid midfielder was only one player, albeit an excellent one; he is not a special case. Asked whether he would speak to Bellingham before the next camp, he said: “I guess so, why not? Of course, he’s an important player, he’s a big player.“I will speak to a lot of players … to the guys who were not in camp, they will get texts from me – especially them. The guys who are now here have the reward, they feel the reward and it’s now necessary also I stay in touch with the other guys.“No one has done anything wrong, it’s not a punishment or whatever, and I feel when I text them or I speak to them everyone is eager to come back. This is how it has to be and I have trust in more players than [those] here. We always speak about the same names [outside the squad] but we have Conor Gallagher, we have Trevoh Chalobah, we have Cole Palmer injured and a lot of other guys out there who deserve to be with us and are hungry and determined to be with us.”Tuchel has only the November and March camps before he names his squad for the finals and he has worked to streamline his options, to bring clarity in each position, defining the pecking order. Would November be a chance to make changes, given the ties are essentially meaningless in terms of results?View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel applauds the travelling England fans in Latvia.Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images“Maybe, but not too much,” Tuchel said. “It needs to be deserved, first of all, and it needs to make sense. We’ll have a review of the camp and then ask also my assistant coaches who are more experienced in World Cup qualifiers than me. We will get our heads around it and take the decision when it’s decision time.”Once again, Tuchel made plain that any player coming back in had to buy into his standards, which begin with putting the team first. “If we invite them we are sure they will buy in, or we will not invite them. Why would we? This is, how do you say, a non-negotiable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is fortified by the performance levels of the past two camps after feeling his way into the job in his first two across the ­second half of last season, which were a little underwhelming.“It’s a possibility, yes,” he said of winning the World Cup. “We will get there. I cannot promise that we will win it but I feel that we will get there with a strong team, a strong cohesion and the right spirit. It’s building. You can see it on the pitch. This is the basis for all of it.“We will start analysing the favourites very early. There’s a huge amount of support in the FA, everybody is on that, there’s a machine running behind it. We will analyse right now Brazil, Argentina, Spain, France, Portugal.“It’s a special feeling to qualify. You don’t qualify every day for a World Cup. It’s all our childhood dream to be part of that and I cannot be more proud to arrive as anEnglandcoach. I was a bit more nervous than normal before the Latvia game because I really wanted to get it over the line. It’s such a good feeling around the last two camps and it’s just nice to have the proof.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026newsShareReuse this content"

Only further rain saved England’s blushes.“Pakistan bowled brilliantly and made it really hard for us to get into the game at all,” the England captain, Sciver-Brunt, told Sky Sports. “We weren’t good enough and we’ll hold our hands up. Everyone’s practising really well and I guess it’s about finding a way to do that in games.”The no-result means that England remain on course to progress to the semi-finals if they win one of their final three group-stage games against India, Australia and New Zealand.This tournament has so far been a spinner’s paradise, but here it was prodigious swing that caused the England top-order problems, after massive rainfall 24 hours earlier which washed out the second half of Sri Lanka’s match against New Zealand. Pakistan’s young captain, Fatima Sana, sent down a remarkable spell of 5-1-19-3, including a wicket maiden first up, bowling Amy Jones through the gate with an inswinger.Knight once again saved herself with a timely DRS review against Sana which was missing leg stump, only for the Pakistan captain to strike twice in the next over with two further hooping deliveries – one which Sciver-Brunt chopped on to her stumps, and a second which struck Knight plumb in front.Earlier, Tammy Beaumont had shouldered arms to Diana Baig and was bowled by a nip-backer which clipped the top of her off-stump, while it was the left-arm spin of Sadia Iqbal which did for Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lumb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president,Gianni Infantino, if Boston did not “clean up its act”.Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threatsRead more“Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We’re in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.“We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston’s values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down forBoston.”Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week.

He wouldn’t love to do it. But he would do it very easily.” Trump also directly criticised Wu, saying: “Their mayor is not good … she’s radical left, and they’re taking over parts of Boston. That’s a pretty big statement, right?”Trump has made previous comments suggesting he would take up the same conversation with Infantino about moving games from Seattle and San Francisco, which are among the 16 host cities across North America.In a statement released to Politico and other news outlets on Wednesday, Fifa said: “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all Fifa events worldwide and it is ultimately the government’s responsibility to decide what’s in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfil all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.”The United States are joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, alongside Mexico and Canada.

The decision still needs to be ratified by a general assembly in Glasgow on 26 November, but multiple sources described that process a formality.MPs warned over ‘shameful’ lack of funding for GB athletes at DeaflympicsRead moreThe Commonwealth Sport chief executive, Katie Sadleir, said: “Today’s recommendation is strategically important for the future of the Commonwealth Sport movement. It builds on the platform that Glasgow 2026 will provide and sets a clear direction for the years ahead.“The Centenary Games in 2030 offer an opportunity not just to celebrate 100 years of history, but to demonstrate how the Commonwealth Games can continue to evolve, creating meaningful impact for athletes, communities and nations across the Commonwealth.”The announcement has far wider implications as Ahmedabad is also whereIndiaintends to stage the 2036 Olympics. But its bid for the biggest event in global sport has faced a number of bumps in recent months that have put other contenders – including Qatar, Istanbul and Hungary – on high alert.View image in fullscreenA light show before the 2023 men’s Cricket World Cup final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty ImagesGermany and Saudi Arabia are also keen on staging a future Games, although their focus is more on 2040. A British bid for either 2036 or 2040 is highly unlikely, with UK Sport more interested in the possibility of hosting in 2044.The lack of a heavyweight rival for 2036 has led many insiders to anoint Ahmedabad favourites, especially as Nita Ambani, whose family is the richest in India, is a prominent IOC member.However, one source said that the Indian bid was given a “wake-up call” by the International Olympic Committee when it visited Lausanne in the summer, withconcerns raised about mismanagement and governanceissues at the Indian Olympic Association, the lack of detail in the bid and the country’s dismal performance at the Games. Last year in Paris, India’s athletes finished 71st in the medal table with six medals.India’s doping problemsare also a concern to the IOC as it continues to be high on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s watch list, with 260 positive cases of national and international athletes last year. Another setback came when the new IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, paused the host city bidding process in July in response to members’ request to have more involvement in the process.It had been thought that Ahmedabad would benefit from the same secretive selection policy that led toBrisbane being handed the 2032 Gameswithout a thorough bidding process. However, Coventry has indicated that members will now have a far greater say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Masters champion’s wife washit by a beer thrown from the galleriesat one point, with McIlroy himself subjected to abuse throughout.McIlroy’s return to the competitive fold, this week at the India Championship, has led him to try to change the topic of conversation. “I’ve been following the narrative coming out of theRyder Cupjust like everyone else,” said the Northern Irishman. “Unfortunately, I think it takes away from what we focused on, which was what an incredible performance it was by the European team.“As I’m playing my matches, I’m focused on trying to win my point. You see that the other guys are winning their matches or they are doing well but you don’t realise how well they are playing.“So just over the last two weeks, being able to watch the highlights and just see, especially those first two days, in the foursomes and the fourballs how good the European team were. The Americans would hit it close, we hit it closer. The Americans hole a putt and we hole a putt on top. It happened every single time.View image in fullscreenTeam Europe’s Rory McIlroy celebrates with the trophy during the presentation after winning the Ryder Cup.Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters“The unfortunate thing is people aren’t remembering that and they are remembering the week for the wrong reason. I would like to shift the narrative and focus on how good the European team were and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.”In the immediate aftermath of Europe’s win, McIlroy insisted golf should be proud to seek high standards from competitors and spectators. Some believe this presents the sport with a dilemma as it looks to engage youngsters.“You don’t want your sport to be unwelcoming to newcomers,” McIlroy added. “I absolutely get that. But you also don’t want newcomers coming into the game and ruining centuries of traditions and values of what this game represents or what it upholds. I think there has to be a balance.“I certainly think that golf can grow but it can grow in a way where the people that are coming into the game still respect and acknowledge that this is a little bit different than maybe other sports. I say it in America all the time, golf doesn’t need to be the NFL. It doesn’t need to be these other sports.Golfis golf, and that’s fine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donald is also in the field, with the Englishman yet to decide whether he wants to captain Europe for what would be a third time, at Adare Manor in 2027.“I think what Luke Donald has done the last two Ryder Cups has revolutionised the captaincy within Europe,” said McIlroy. “The effort and the dedication that Luke Donald has put into the last four years, it’s been absolutely amazing.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyRyder Cup 2025US sportsGolfRyder CupnewsShareReuse this content"

And yet, it was the visiting side that struck first.Rising star Bos, who was recently awarded player of the month in the Dutch Eredivisie, justified his starting spot in the 19th minute after his own throw-in near the USA box was shanked clear, allowing the Feyenoord defender to charge through three scrambling white shirts before rifling a half volley into the far corner.It was the only bright attacking spark for Australia in the opening half as the USA, like Canada on Saturday, controlled most of the ball and created the more convincing chances as under-pressure manager Mauricio Pochettino continues to prepare his young squad for next year’s tournament.Pulisic was the primary outlet for the hosts’ attack, and almost orchestrated an equaliser on the following play, charging into Australia’s box down the centre-left channel before his cut-back was hoofed away.But the captain’s influence was cut short when a yellow-card challenge from Socceroos defender Jason Geria saw him tumble into the grass clutching his lower leg, forcing Pochettino to substitute his star player prematurely.His replacement, Diego Luna, provided the spark the USA needed to claw a goal back minutes later. As he occupied Australia’s central players, a slicing through-ball from midfielder Cristian Roldan found striker Haji Wright, who poked the ball into the top corner to make it 1-1.The hosts grew in confidence and control from there, pressing further into Australia’s final third and finding more pockets around the box. Wright and Rodan had efforts sail over the crossbar as the half drew to a close, but not before tensions flared after James Sands was repeatedly crashed into by some frustrated Socceroos.View image in fullscreenReferee Kwinsi Williams separates Cameron Burgess and Chris Richards as things get heated in the first half.Photograph: Andrew Wevers/USSF/Getty ImagesNick D’Agostino, who had spent the half chasing shadows, lunged into a challenge, while Aiden O’Neill’s slide tackle left Sands sprawling, resulting in a scuffle between the two teams around the centre referee, who ended the half early to calm things down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A rare free kick for Australia just outside the area ricocheted off the hosts’ defensive wall, while some dallying from USA keeper Matt Freese was almost punished by the lightning D’Agostino.But the Socceroos’ momentum ground to a halt minutes later after a quick USA free kick sailed over the whole field and into the stride of Wright, who cut neatly inside the scrambling Cam Burgess and curled an effort past Mat Ryan.Popovic, sticking to his pre-game commitment to rotate his players, made a quadruple change on the hour to freshen up Australia’s attack, bringing on Mo Toure and Nestory Irankundo for D’Agostino and Martin Boyle.But it was Bos who continued to shine, barrelling down the channels on the left and right, trying to force his own luck. It almost came off in the 75th minute before the ball got stuck under his own feet, while at the other end, Ryan made a fine rushing save to deny a one-on-one with Luna, who’d ghosted through Australia’s backline.A heavy aerial collision between Bos and Alex Freeman in the 80th minute, followed by an incident involving Balogun off the ball, took the wind out of the game. But Irankunda needed one more chance, making a charging final run to try to find an equaliser, only for his tame shot to be scooped up by Freese.The USA managed out the rest of the match to secure their first win in some time, handing Popovic his first loss as Socceroos boss and denying Australia the opportunity to potentially land an easier group at next year’s World Cup.Explore more on these topicsAustraliaUSAAustralia sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The driverless taxi that could also get you a job – or a dateRead moreThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I’m delighted that Waymo intends to bring their services to London next year, under our proposed piloting scheme.“Boosting the AV [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment and opportunities to the UK. Cutting-edge investment like this will help us deliver our mission to be world leaders in new technology and spearhead national renewal.”A fuller rollout of self-driving taxis is expected in the UK after the Automated Vehicles Act fully takes effect in late 2027.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents black-cab drivers, known in the city as “cabbies”, said: “It’s a fairground ride.“It’s a tourist attraction in San Francisco. Quite frequently one of them will lock up in the middle of a junction because it gets confused and the police have to come and park, wait for the Waymo man to get his laptop out and get it going again.”He said London would pose a bigger challenge for Waymo, due to its irregular road system. He added that he did not believe there was public appetite for the technology.“If there was demand for it, Nigel Farage would be saying get rid of immigrants, have driverless cars instead. But there’s no demand for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also launching services in Tokyo using Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles, its only other current venture outside the US.Its co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana said the technology was “making roads safer and transportation more accessible”, adding: “We’ve demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing, and we can’t wait to expand the benefits of our technology to the United Kingdom.”Waymo launched its autonomous taxis in 2020 and has amassed a fleet of more than 2,000 driverless vehicles. It says it has taken more than 10 million passengers in the US, offering services in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Atlanta.London would become the only European city in which the company is operational, pending approval from central government and Transport for London.Despite somealarming incidents, Waymo said the data showed that cars driven by humans were involved in incidents that injured pedestrians 12 times more often than its autonomous vehicles.Its cars use cameras, artificial intelligence, radar and lidar – sensors that use lasers to measure distance in three dimensions – to create a map of objects around the vehicle, including in darkness and weather conditions such as rain.Explore more on these topicsWaymoSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryTechnology sectorLondonEuropeTfLnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body.Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass.Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the£1,099 17 Pro models.View image in fullscreenThe Air’s slim lines are slightly betrayed by the plateau and camera lens that protrude from the back, doubling the phone’s thickness to about 11.3mm, reminiscent ofGoogle’s Pixel bar.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianPhotos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17.The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic.The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. Itruns iOS 26with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely oneSim. In the US Apple has only supported eSims since theiPhone 14, but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air.View image in fullscreenThe sides of the phone are only a little thicker than the buttons.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMost of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere.SpecificationsScreen:6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi)Processor:AppleA19 Pro (5-core GPU)RAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:iOS 26Camera:48MP rear; 18MP front-facingConnectivity:5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)Dimensions:156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mmWeight:165gA19 Pro chipView image in fullscreenThe Air takes about 105 minutes to fully charge, hitting 60% in 35 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to theiPhone 17 Pro, but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs.Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges.View image in fullscreenQi2 or MagSafe magnetic wireless chargers, such as theTwelve South PowerBug, are likely to make living with the Air easier for quick top-ups during the day.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOn heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe slender frame still contains a fairly easy-to-replace battery, which may be needed after about 1,000 charge cycles.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batterywill last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can bereplaced for £109. Out-of-warrantyscreen repairs cost £349. Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air aseven out of 10 for repairability.It contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera behaves the same as most iPhones, but the lack of ultrawide and telephoto options simplifies things a bit.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front.The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the17 Pro, but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects.View image in fullscreenThe iPhone Air’s zoom is pretty good in brighter scenes but loses detail on more distant subjects.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower costiPhone 16e.The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window.PriceThe iPhone Air costs from£999(€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, theiPhone 16ecosts£599, iPhone 17 is£799,iPhone 17 Prois£1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs£1,199, theGoogle Pixel 10costs£799, theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeis£899and the Fairphone 6 sells for£499.VerdictThe iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera.The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thinGalaxy S25 Edge, the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down.The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case.The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories.But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere.Pros:super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID.Cons:no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.View image in fullscreenThe iPhone Air is impressive, looking and feeling different to the rest of the iPhone line.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsiPhoneAppleSmartphonesMobile phonesTelecomsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Phoenix has one of the nation’s largest concentrations of datacenters, which keeps expanding, encouraged by tax incentives and local business leaders; localoppositionand ordinances around noise pollution and water use are also on the rise. High-profile projects have been postponed or cancelled due to local pushback in recent months in northern Virginia, the nation’s biggest datacenter hub; inSt Charles, Missouri; andin several towns in Indiana.But in even more locations, datacenters are moving forward, oftenunder a cloud of secrecy.Quest for AI computing powerThe project in Tucson is one of many emerging in the quest for AI computing power and to serve data-intensive companies.The project envisions a vast warehouse full of computers in the Sonoran desert, including $2.4bn worth of equipment. Community outrage over the project grew soon after the city council’s 17 June vote, and much of it centered around the issue of water.Datacenters use water in two ways: to maintain a steady humidity, and to cool off the hot computers, which is often accomplished by running cold water past the machines, consuming water in the form of steam.Communities throughout the US have seen groundwater depletion and contamination after datacenters crept up. Tucson has long embraced water conservation, and this protective ethos is more salient there than many other communities, said Ed Hendel, president ofSky Island AI, a Tucson-based company. As one example, the city treats wastewater and releases it to the Santa Cruz River, home to wildlife such as endangered fish.Hendel’s daily work relies on datacenters, but he said they should be built where they make sense. Placing water-guzzling warehouses of computers “in a hot desert is not a good starting point”, he said. “Putting them in a hot desert in the midst of a drought is even more absurd, because that water is precious.”View image in fullscreenA community meeting in Tucson to discuss the pros and cons of Project Blue.Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty ImagesBeale did not detail exactly how much water it would use and from where in the weeks after the June vote, even though it claimed the project would be “water positive”. In the absence of details, Bogan set out to analyze how the project would be water positive, projecting it would be most likely to use treated water that now flows into the Santa Cruz. But even if the company went that route, Bogan wrote in a white paper on 11 July, it could dry up significant portions of the river, harming the many plants and animals that live there.The city manager, Tim Thomure, acting as an intermediary between Beale and the public, released thefirst concrete detailsabout the project’s planned water use in mid-July after Bogan’s white paper came out: Project Blue would not affect the Santa Cruz River, he said. It would use three sources of water, including from two locations where treated wastewater is currently stored underground for future use, as well as the Tucson airport remediation plant, which treats contaminated groundwater that currently stays on site. And it gave an estimate of water use: over 1,900 acre-feet, or 620m gallons, enough to supply more than four typical 18-hole Pima county golf courses, according to Thomure.Beale also pledged to invest $100m in a pipeline to transport and use treated wastewater, and create 180 jobs.But this is not “water positive”, and it would rather cause “net depletion of our groundwater resources to supply Project Blue”, said Bogan, the aquatic ecologist. He pointed to a city document which notes that if Project Blue were to use more groundwater than it could replenish, it could make payments, or “water positivity rates” to make up for it.Lisa Shipek, executive director of southern Arizona’sWatershed Management Group, agreed with Bogan’s assessment. By possibly paying for using up groundwater, Project Blue, Shipek said, would potentially “replace wet water with ‘paper water’”. The tactic – paying for consuming wet water, or offsetting it in another way, whether in the form of water conservation or education measures – has been used to deplete groundwater throughout the world.Water not the only concernWater wasn’t community members’ only concern. Beale Infrastructure is not a typical developer, but rather a subsidiary of the asset management company Blue Owl. On 21 July, the local news site Arizona Luminariapublished a storyrevealing that Pima county staff possessed a memo stating that Project Blue would be financed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The story prompted fresh outcry from community members frustrated with Amazon’santi-unionactions, and overtures by its owner, Jeff Bezos, to the Trump administration.An AWS spokesperson said: “AWS has previously engaged in standard due diligence processes in Arizona, like we do in any geographic location we consider building and operating our infrastructure. We do not have any commitments or agreements in place to develop this project.”But the company declined to answer a question about whether AWS was affiliated with Project Blue in the past, or, potentially, in the future.A Beale spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on our tenants until a more advanced stage of the project.”Another wrinkle that added to the uproar was anews release from Tucson Electric Power(TEP) put out hours after the county vote on 17 June, announcing it was requesting a 14% rate increase to offset grid investments and inflation. With datacenters driving up electricity demand across the country, many community members assumed the rate hike was related to Project Blue, said the county supervisor, Matt Heinz.It wasn’t. The timing was coincidental, and a huge mistake, he said. “It’s unfortunately really plagued this whole project.”A TEP spokesperson, Joseph Barrios, said that the rate increase had nothing to do with Project Blue, but was based on costs already incurred in 2024 and before.View image in fullscreenA banner held up at the convention center.Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty Images“We understand that any rate increase could have an impact on our customers and it’s not something we take lightly,” he said.Outrage over Project Blue grew rapidly over the summer. Eliseo Gomez, a local high school teacher and organizer, convened with a small group at the base of Tucson’s “A” mountain shortly after the 17 June vote. “We were like: what can we do?” They decided to target the annexation vote. The group started a website and social media channels namedNo Desert Data Center, encouraging people to express their concerns with the mayor and city council.In response, the city arranged for two public meetings with presentations from Beale Infrastructure, as well as Tucson Water and TEP. The majority of attenders at both meetings were clearly opposed, most wearing red shirts saying “no to Project Blue” or holding protest signs. Union members, enticed by promises of construction jobs, made up a supportive minority at the events. Attenders grew increasingly upset, Gomez said, as they felt their concerns and queries were dodged or ignored. By the second meeting, on 4 August, many locals appeared fed up. Beale executives gave similar speeches, without providing much further detail, incensing the crowd, whose boos and shouts made it difficult for presenters to continue.Many citizens presented their own research. “I feel like I learned more about Project Blue from the public than the city,” said city councilman Rocque Perez.On 6 August, in an unscheduled vote, council members unanimously decided to discontinue discussions with Beale, each sharing short speeches revealing sharp opposition to Project Blue. Tucsonans packing the council chambers cheered and celebrated; Beale executives, appearing stunned, were booed as they left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In mid-September, the company proposed moving forwardwith an air-cooled systemthat uses less water than the original design. Beale co-filed a state application with the TEP, to be supplied with up to 286 megawatts – enough to power to up to 250,000 homes.In a statement, Beale has described the new design as a closed-loop system that “uses minimal amounts of water that are continuously recirculated, thereby eliminating water loss”.Several local leaders said the Republican-led Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees electricity use in the state, is likely to approve the project’s electricity request. That would mean Beale’s main remaining hurdle is finding a water source. The company has not said how it would obtain any such water, however, and given the city council’s vote, they cannot be supplied by the city’s public utility.Meanwhile, the controversy has had a profound impact on Tucson politics. Even supporters acknowledge the Project Blue process started poorly, partly because non-disclosure agreements between Beale and city staff dating back to 2022 meant that most elected leaders knew little to nothing about it until some time this year.Supervisor Jennifer Allen said the first meeting between Beale and the board in late May was short on details, including water use, and her requests for more information turned up nothing concrete. It was “a lot of greenwashing”, she said. She voted no on 17 June, as did her colleague Andrés Cano.Heinz, a longtime Democrat, said he voted for the rezoning and sale because the project had long been championed by city staff, including city manager Thomure, and because the tens of thousands of hi-tech jobs in the area will need access to nearby datacenters.Though there weren’t detailed water use estimates at first, Heinz said he wasn’t worried as Beale would be working with Tucson Water and the city would be “putting in those guardrails”.View image in fullscreenThe north-eastern edge of the Tucson Mountains. .Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty ImagesThe new design, he said, “will be an even better fit for southern Arizona”.“I frankly wish they’d approached us with this air-cooled design to begin with.”Heinz, as well as supervisors Rex Scott and Steve Christy, have come under withering scrutiny from constituents, who have implored the board to revisit the sale agreement. Heinz said that wasn’t going to happen. “There’s no vote before the board,” Heinz said. “It’s done. And I don’t want to reverse it.”Scott acknowledged that NDAs played a negative role in the affair and noted that both the county and city had already implemented new guidelines for handling them, which should grant more transparency to the process, Scott said.The city council has also since passed new rules to give more transparency and oversight over big water users, and they are developing specific guidelines and guard-rails to govern any future proposed data centers.‘Cities across the country are being sold the same story’While Beale’s air-cooled system may use less water, it has highlighted the other enormous costs of datacenters: electricity. Air-cooled systems use huge amounts of energy and are less energy efficient – especially in a desert where the daily average high is 29C (84F).It’s now a national issue – a 2024report to Congressco-authored by Oak Ridge National Laboratory researcherAB Siddikestimates that datacenters consumed 4.4% of the nation’s total electricity as of 2023, which could rise to as much as 12% by 2028.TEP’s involvement has brought scrutiny to the private utility; locals have recently been protesting at their headquarters. On 23 September, the mayor and council announced they plan to intervene in the utility’s request to the state for the rate hike, saying ina statementsuch an increase “will strain families and small businesses and slow the transition to clean, affordable energy”.View image in fullscreenCommunity members hold up signs at the Tucson convention center.Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty ImagesThe saga has also raised the possibility that the Tucsonans or their leaders could consider pursuing a public utility to replace TEP when its contract is due for review in 2025, though that could be an enormous effort, Perez said.“I’m disappointed that Tucson Electric Power is partnering with Beale despite strong community concerns,” said councilman Kevin Dahl. “It certainly makes an argument for public power.”TEP spokesperson Joseph Barrios said that the utility’s involvement with Project Blue would not raise customers’ rates or affect their service.“We have an obligation to serve, and that includes all customers within our service area,” Barrios said.As far as the possibility of public power, “we feel our community is better served by continuing to work together”, he added.Council member and vice-mayor Lane Santa Cruz said this wasn’t just about Tucson, though.“What’s happening here isn’t unique to us: cities across the country are being sold the same story, with promises of jobs, innovation and progress,” she said. “But what’s not being talked about is who really benefits and what it costs us.”Too often, she added, these projects are extractive, using a community’s water, electricity, and labor – while providing only a small number of jobs – instead of being a sustainable partner.“We need to be the city that draws the line,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArizonaUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

But even though it’s hard to watch for long, it’s a humbling reminder of who we areStuart HeritageWed 15 Oct 2025 07.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 07.30 EDTShareIrealise that, at this point, there are already far too many shows. Every channel, every streaming service is teeming with content demanding your attention, and there are simply too few hours in the day to watch them all. However, with that in mind, may I recommend a new show calledSpaceLive? There’s only one episode. The only potential downside is that the episode literally lasts for ever.Actually, that’s inaccurate. Space Live isn’t a show, it’s a channel. It launched on Wednesday morning, tucked away on ITVX, and consists only of live footage of Earth broadcast from theInternational Space Station. It’s beguiling to watch, especially for anyone who didn’t realise that a person can be awestruck and bored simultaneously.It’s billed as a world first. ITV has partnered with British space media company Sen to use live 4K footage from its proprietary SpaceTV-1 video camera system, mounted on the International Space Station, giving us three camera views: one of the station’s docking ports, a horizon view able to show sunrises and storms, and a camera pointing straight down as the ISS passes across the planet. A tracker in the corner of the screen shows the live location of the ISS, while a real-time AI information feed provides facts about our geography and weather systems.View image in fullscreenSpace Live’s footage is a significant improvement on Nasa’s.Photograph: ITVOf course, if you wanted to be picky, you could argue it isn’t exactly new. Nasa’s YouTube channel has been streaming live footage from the ISS for years, and uniformly draws an audience of a few thousand. But Space Live is, if nothing else, slightly snazzier. The footage is certainly nicer: at 8.30am on Wednesday, Space Live showed gorgeous images of the sun’s glare bouncing off the sea around the Bay of Biscay, while allNasacould offer was a piece of cloth with the word “Flap” written on it. There’s even a soundtrack, a constant, soothing kind of hold music that loops and loops without ever becoming fully annoying. It’s an improvement, in other words.And, at least for the first orbit, it is absolutely spellbinding. While not quite offering the overview effect – the cognitive shift felt by those who see Earth from space, leading to new perspectives about humanity and its place in the universe – it is still extremely humbling to see just how small the planet is. The time it took for the ISS to pass from south-east England (where I am) to war-ravaged Ukraine could be counted in seconds. And then on, over Asia towards Australia. There really is very little separating us at all.Inevitably, as the station crosses the Earth, drifting endlessly between sunrise and sunset, your thoughts shift towards people you know from wherever it happens to be. There’s something palpably comforting about that.However, God knows you can’t be awestruck for ever. And so it is with Space Live. Eventually the magic of the technology and the perspective and the beauty of our planet starts to wear off, and the experience becomes something akin to the map you end up staring at on a flight when you’ve run out of films to watch. Your attention starts to stray, and you realise that ITVX has other live channels to watch. One of them just shows Love Island. Another just shows Christmas films. And then you realise, with a slump, that the majesty of the only home we’ll ever know spinning silently in space has become just another content option, along with whichever ITV channel shows American Ninja Warrior Junior.View image in fullscreenThe views are simultaneously awe-inspiring and comforting.Photograph: ITVBut even though you won’t watch it all the time, it’s nice to know that Space Live is there. It isn’t the sort of thing you’d imagine they’d stick on the big screen in pubs – not unless people really start getting into going “Weeeeeey” every time they see the Ural River – but as something to have on in the background, it’s undeniably soothing. My guess is, for a dedicated few, the channel will be something they’ll keep on silently as they go about their day.And, sure, that might not be why humanity first chose to embark upon the miraculous achievement of escaping the surly bonds of Earth – you’ll remember that Neil Armstrong pointedly did not say, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for the screensaver industry” – but, as an idea, Space Live can’t be faulted. I might not have it on all the time but, whenever I need to be reminded of who we are and how little separates us, I guarantee it will be my first port of call.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionInternational Space StationSpaceLivestreamingNasafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, 97% of the Danish population aged 15 and over is enrolled inMitIDand only 5% of Danes have opted out of digital post.Why does the UK need digital IDs and what data will they include?Read moreThe British government, which recently announced plans tointroduce a digital ID schemein the UK by 2029, said it would “take the best aspects” of suchsystems around the world, including those in Denmark and Estonia.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister,has saidthe new ID would be an app-based system rather than a physical card and hold information on residency status, name, nationality, date of birth and a photo. It would be compulsory to have one to work in the UK.In Denmark, it has taken time to get people accustomed to using digital ID. Enabling people to use it for key apps such as banking was crucial to making it a success, said Adam Lebech, the deputy director general of Denmark’sagency for digital government, and the introduction of digital post had also helped drive take-up.To try to improve access among older generations, volunteers have been trained to show elderly people how to use it. “Up until about 85 years of age the numbers [of those using digital ID] are very high and then it drops after that,” said Lebech.View image in fullscreenNumbers of Danish people using digital ID and digital post are said to be ‘very high’ up to the age of 85.Photograph: Aleksandar Nakic/Getty ImagesLike Britain,Denmarkhas never had a physical national ID card, but it has been developing its digital ID scheme since 2001. In 2022 it completed the move over to its third iteration, MitID, which Lebech said was more secure than its predecessor. It is usually used as an app on a smartphone or tablet but can also take the form of a code display or audio code reader for those who are not able to use an app.Digital ID plan for UK risks creating ‘an enormous hacking target’, expert warnsRead morePeter Christian Bech-Nielsen, the tech correspondent at the Danish newspaper Ingeniøren (the Engineer), said the digital ID scheme worked well and, so far at least, had come up against little friction from citizens. “Because we are a country where most people trust politicians and the public sector to a high degree, this has been pretty uncontroversial,” he said.But, he added, attitudes to surveillance were changing – in part because of increased awareness of online tracking and public discussion around the subject. “In Denmark in the last 20 years it has been going in one direction only, which is more surveillance, more control. At some point that’s bound to have some repercussions.”At a time of increased instability and heightened threat of sabotage and hybrid warfare acrossEurope, digitisation also comes with considerable risk if the system goes down.“In the old days you could pretty much walk into a municipal office. You cannot really do that any more,” said Bech-Nielsen. “You have to book an appointment online. So that would be very hard [in the event of a digital system failure], which definitely makes us a less resilient society in terms of hybrid warfare.”Lebech said the digital security threat level was constantly high, an “enormous challenge.” There were, he added, “constantly threats against it” – mainly fromsocial engineering. “It requires constant development and constant battles against criminals,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea started to gain traction in the 1990s after Estonia redeclared its independence from the Soviet Union and needed to rebuild its institutions.“With limited resources but strong technical talent, the government saw digitalisation as a way to deliver public services efficiently and transparently,” said Kristiina Kriisa, a spokesperson for thee-Estonia Briefing Centre. “The goal was to streamline paperwork, reduce bureaucracy, and enable citizens to interact with the state from anywhere.”When Estonia first introduced its national digital ID card in 2002, it became one of the first countries in the world to connect a physical ID document to secure online authentication and legally binding digital signatures. Now citizens can use it to vote digitally, file their taxes and use online banking; an analogue option is maintained. The country also invested heavily in digital literacy in schools.Kriisa said most Estonians were open to new ideas but there were some fears over privacy and security. “The government addressed this by building a legal and technical framework based on trust: citizens own their own data, can see who has accessed it, and are protected by strong data protection laws,” she said. “Due to this transparency, opposition was limited and never became a significant political obstacle. People could see the system worked and saved them time.”As well as using strong encryption and a public key infrastructure (PKI) – which means every card or mobile ID contains unique cryptographic keys – access to sensitive data is logged. Citizens can view their logs themselves, and a national cybersecurity team is constantly on the lookout for threats.Leif Kalev, a political studies professor at Tallinn University, said on the whole, Estonians had “generally been quite willing to accept some reduction in personal freedoms in exchange for technological innovation and new opportunities”. But, he said, the growing body of digital data about individual citizens had prompted worries among some.“The biggest questions have arisen around the fact that the accumulation of digital data about individuals allows for increasingly extensive analysis and knowledge about a person, raising the issue of what the reasonable limits of this should be – from banks and stores to the police and tax authorities,” he said.There are also concerns about the vote-counting system for e-voting. “Certainly, the growing computing power, such as with quantum computers, also poses challenges –the nature of which will become clear in time,” Kalev said.Explore more on these topicsIdentity cardsDenmarkEstoniaData protectionAppsEuropeCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The long-running military shooter series, which specialises in gigantic online multiplayer conflicts involving dozens of ground troops, tanks and aircraft, has returned for its sixth main instalment – andit’s thrilling, epic and compulsive.Apart from the single-player campaign mode, which I absolutely hated. It’s another oh-so-familiar tale of preternaturally talented soldiers just doing their jobs to defend the free world in the face of evil private military companies, terror organisations or double-crossing CIA operatives. It could be almost any military shooter of the last decade or any straight-to-streaming war film starring one of the Hemsworths. But it’s not. It’s a seven-hour cliche bombardment that you have to take an active part in.The thing is, nobody buysBattlefieldfor the campaign mode. In fact, most games in the series haven’t had one. So this was a chance for the developers to experiment a little, try something new or even subversive. The mainstream movie biz may have been equally guilty of dressing up jingoistic celebrations of the military-industrial complex as thrilling action flicks, but it has also produced Paths of Glory, M*A*S*H and The Deer Hunter. While Battlefield 6 does make the occasional nod towards the less-than-ideal circumstances of modern hybrid warfare, you don’t care much because the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no backstories who speak in nonstop military jargon.There have been a few big games that have challenged the narrative of the moral warrior acting in the world’s best interests on behalf of largely benign military divisions. Metal Gear Solid is clearly a pacifist text on the horror of nuclear war, while Ubisoft’s Valiant Hearts is a beautiful meditation on war and love. The key example, though, remains Yager Development’s fascinating 2012 adventure Spec Ops: The Line, in which you play the commander of a covert delta team sent into a disaster-hit Dubai to discover the whereabouts of a rogue US military unit.As the narrative progresses, your character descends into exhaustion and trauma, experiencing increasingly nightmarish hallucinations. The aim was to show the damaging psychological impact of war, while also providing a gripping and exciting experience. The mission was successful.View image in fullscreenWar stories … Spec Ops: The Line is the rare military game with meaning.Photograph: YagerIn the rapidly consolidating games industry, where gigantic mega-corps are willing to invest the equivalent of a small country’s GDP into capturing tens of millions of players, it seems that narrative innovation is unlikely. As is making any kind of political statement. But contemporary audiences are spoiled for choice when it comes to shooters – as the success of oddities such as Atomfall and Megabonk have shown – there’s money to be made in straying off piste.Could the Battlefield 6 campaign have been a tense claustrophobic single-set thriller like Alex Garland’s Warfare? Could it have plunged our hero into a series of survival dramas like Until Dawn? Could it have been a sandbox adventure with various tasks, items and enemy units to discover?Over the past two years we’ve seen several multimillion dollar projects axed and staff made redundant because the “pick-me” approach of green-lighting only titles that will compete directly with the always on nature of Fortnite, Call of Duty or Marvel Rivals is a zero sum game – you win or you die. Call me naive, but that doesn’t seem sustainable (not even forthose mega-titles) – and considering the human cost of mass layoffs, it’s also repugnant. Games cannot live on cliche alone. The modern world, with its shifting allegiances, its climate instability and its displaced populations, is a horrifyingly fascinating place for brand-new war narratives that actually mean something.

What do you recommend?”There are lots of options here. The children’s electronic toy manufacturer Leap Frog has a range ofLeapsterhandhelds, which can be picked up second hand for around £20-30 usually with a couple of cartridges. They’re chunky and safe, and the games are OK. However, I’d rather go for aNintendo DSor the newer and more hardy2DS, both of which go on eBay for around £10-£50 depending on condition.There are hundreds of children’s games available for these systems (original DS games can be played on both systems, but the 2DS will also play newer 3DS games – though not in 3D) and games can be picked up for as little as 50p in charity shops or at your localCeX store. With the original DS, the hinge that connects the two screens is the most vulnerable point, but it depends on how rough your daughter is with it. Also, both systems come with a stylus, which is a potential choke hazard so you need to be around when she uses it. Also, my sons lost dozens of them. Luckily a lot of games don’t need them. As for games, anything withMario,WarioorKirby, and anyAnimal Crossing,PokémonorLegotitle will be go down well.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterAction gamesBattlefieldShooting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can be nice or mean, bland or snide, accurate or wildly off-base. But none of what you write as a journalist matters much in comparison with the photo that runs alongside it. That’s the main determinant of how bitterly a subject will complain about a piece, or whether they will tip from mildly annoyed to actively raging. In this regard, Donald Trump,who went afterTime magazine this week for using a photo of him on the cover he has called “super bad” and “the Worst of All Time”, has acted in a way that, unusually for the president, is in line with how other people act.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump boarding Air Force One at Beijing airport, 10 November 2017.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesEven more unusually, he’s not wrong. The Time cover, shot from below to give readers an unrestricted view up Trump’s nose, is extremely unflattering. His turkey wattle neck looks like a ski run after the snow has melted. His eye is reptilian. His hair is the flyaway gauze of a newborn. Or, as Trump put it in the Truth Social rant he published in the early hours of Tuesday morning: “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one.” (He can’t stay normal for long – the “crown” is just flare from the sun behind his head.) In these circumstances, it doesn’t matter to Trump that the headline is fawning (“His Triumph”), or the piece positive, praising the ceasefire in Gaza as “the deal [that] could become a signature achievement”. He only has eyes for the photo.For anyone else in this situation, we might feel some sympathy; we’re all vulnerable where our appearance is concerned. But it’s Trump, a man who once mocked the movements of a disabled reporter, so we’ll take what schadenfreude we can get. Meanwhile, the question put in front of the world’s picture editors this week was (cue Anthony Clare voice): what was Time magazinetrying to saywith this photo? You have to laugh. Rival picture desks jumped to defend their profession by speculating that the photo was obviously designed to show the president as a commanding, magisterial presence. But to anyone with eyes in their head it was clearly a troll-based decision. “Look!” screamed the subtext of the Time magazine cover. “We may seem like forelock-tugging losers for coming up with that headline, but at least he looks like a tit in the photo.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, 17 June 2015.Photograph: Dominick Reuter/ReutersAnd, of course, it’s an age-old, passive aggressive, customarily tabloid tactic to run a hit photo then deny you’ve done any such thing. Weird expressions, closed eyes, any kind of off-the-cuff movement that breaks the seal on boring stock photos or airbrushed banality makes for a more interesting visual. The Guardian doesn’t use pap shots, but it isn’t above making the occasional, less flattering choice. Decades ago, I interviewed a woman in entertainment who is both famous and famously appalling – I would honestly rather have spent time with a war criminal. At a glance, the photo used of her looked fine, but on closer inspection you could see the skin had bunched up around her armpits to give it a crepe-like consistency, a small, ageing detail that triggered a Trump-like conniption after the story came out. Unlike Trump, no one ever mentions their vanity has been wounded – they fixate on the headline, or a pull quote, or a misapprehension in the text. But from the pitch of the anger, you always know when it’s the photo that’s done it.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, 2016.Photograph: The Tonight Show with Jimmy FallonAnd as a weapon, it’s inconsistently used. I’ve seen at least one prominent male figure lose the plot because of an unflattering photo (the picture editor failed to airbrush out his nose hair LOL), but women are more often the targets. The actor Olivia Colman has talked about how awful it feels: “You’re on the red carpet and they’re always trying to get photos up under your chin and everyone comments on it and says awful things and you think FUCK OFF, I wasn’t born a supermodel and I’ve had three children and my body’s stretched and bits have drooped and it’s not fair.”She’s right, it’s not fair. It’s a low blow, using a photo to make a point you wouldn’t want to put in words, and Trump understands low blows better than anyone. Looking at what he correctly described as a “really weird” photo this week, I’m inclined to shrug and say some people deserve it.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionCelebrityMagazinesNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

But while the IMF reports Trump’s impact on the global economy is yet to be fully realised, Australian holidaymakers have already made their judgment and are deserting the US in droves.The IMF always likes to be polite. It titled the October 2025 world economic outlook“Global Economy in Flux, Prospects Remain Dim”rather than as I would have: “Trump remains dim, so who the hell knows what will happen”.Perhaps the worst aspect of Trump is how his actions, whether political, economic or social, are regarded with initial concern, but then many in the media, and even our government, desperately try to suggest nothing has changed.But things are not normal. Whether it be calling for the jailing of theChicago mayor and Illinois governororboasting of extrajudicial killings, or suggesting to US generals that they should use US cities“as training grounds for our military”, things in the US are very far from normal.World economy resilient amid Trump tariffs but outlook looks ‘dim’, says IMFRead moreYou would think our government, which is now spending billions on Aukus, might reflect that the US is quickly being run by an increasingly authoritarian regime and ponder this disconnect from normality. But no.The IMF notes that the world economy is not immune to this disconnect.The initial Trump tariffs announcements in April caused great consternation across the global economy and share markets. And yet largely the impact has been muted. Investors mostly have carried on, ignoring that while the tariffs may not be what Trump initially announced, they remain massively higher than they have been for decades:If the graph does not display click hereIn April the IMF estimated that the US economy would grow just 1.8%; now it has revised that up to 2.0%. Similarly in April the IMF thought Australia would be hurt in the crossfire between the US and China and downgraded its estimate for Australia’s economic growth to 1.6%. Now it has been revised up to 1.8%:If the graph does not display click hereBut we are not back to normal, and no one should think we are. The IMF notes that while trade uncertainty is less than it was in April, compared to any other time, chaos reigns.Yes, US trade policy is about half as uncertain as it was in April, but remains roughly 3,860% more uncertain than it was a year ago:If the graph does not display click hereThe main reason neither the US nor global economy have nose-dived due to the Trump administration’s policies is that he telegraphed them so obviously that everyone brought forward orders to get them in place before the tariffs came into effect. The IMF notes that “this gave a temporary boost to global activity in early 2025”.Some investors and our government may be treating the Trump situation as “normal” but it is clear Australians themselves have not been fooled.This week, theoverseas arrivals and departures figuresfor August showed we are back travelling overseas in record numbers, while the figure for tourists coming to Australia continues to slowly recover from Covid:If the graph does not display click hereWhile you may have been observing your friends’ Instagram posts from their holidays in the northern hemisphere, chances are a lot fewer are from the US than once was the case:If the graph does not display click hereGenerally, Australians’ travelling habits since the pandemic have moved away from the US. In the past year, 28% fewer travelled to the US than we did in the year before the pandemic. The only other places with a bigger drop are Russia, Israeland New Caledonia– three countries currently involved in war or civil unrest.The latest figures, however, also show the huge Trump effect. Ten per cent fewer Australians travelled to the US in August this year than they did last year. That was the only drop among our 10 most common travel destinations.And it was not just a one-month abnormality. Travel to the US during June, July and August was also down 3% compared with last year:If the graph does not display click hereThe Trump effect is real.It is not just Australians who have discarded the US. Last yearTourism Economicsforecast that international arrivals to the US would rise 9% in 2025; now it forecasts an 8.2% fall.Across the global economy uncertainly abounds and the IMF suggests things remain “in flux”.But people around the world, including Australians, have no such confusion. They are certain Trump has made the US less attractive and, unlike investors and a government continuing to hold tight to Aukus, they are not regarding his authoritarian rhetoric and policies as normal.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

That is not how the free press worksWed 15 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 10.39 EDTShareTom Bowman of National Public Radio recalls one of the many times in his decades covering the Pentagon when therealstory wasn’t the officially approved story.The then defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, was “ecstatic” after the fall of Baghdad in 2003, insisting publicly that it showed the resounding success of the US invasion of Iraq, Bowman wrote in an NPR opinion piece this week. But through informal conversations with officers, Bowman soon found out that the truth was much more complicated – that more American troops would have to be deployed to Iraq to guard the supply lines that were under attack from Saddam Hussein’s supporters.“Did I as a reporter solicit information?” Bowmanwrote. “Of course. It’s called journalism. Finding out what’s really going on behind the scenes and not accepting wholesale what any government or administration says.”Bowman is one of many Pentagon reporters about to lose official access to the Pentagon rather than accept defense chief Pete Hegseth’s draconian new policy, which would require reporters to sign an agreement stating they will publish only information “explicitly authorized” by the defense department (or as Donald Trump’s officials now call it, the Department of War).But signing would transform reporters “from watchdogs into state functionaries”, according to Dan Perry, the former chairman of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem and the former Europe/Africa editor of the Associated Press. Thus, his article is titled “Why I’m handing in my Pentagon press pass”.He’s in good company. News organizations including the Guardian, the Associated Press, the New York Times, Reuters, Politico, the Washington Post, the Atlantic and many others – even right-leaning Newsmax and the Washington Times – are rejecting the demand.Unsurprisingly, One America News – essentially a propaganda outfit – has agreed to sign.The major TV networks, even including the Trump-friendly Fox News – Hegseth’s former employer – joined the movement in a joint statement on Tuesday afternoon.“The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections,” that statement said. “We will continue to cover the US military as each of our organizations has done for many decades upholding the principles of a free and independent press.”That vast majority is right – and it’s heartening to see that near unanimity. That kind of solidarity in the press is powerful – and we could use a lot more of it, given how often journalists are under siege in Trump world.No matter how much Hegseth and Trump might wish it, journalism is not stenography, and the officially approved story is often only a starting point for deeper reporting that gets at the truth.Perrywrotethat the policy was a “war on truth” that clearly imperils the intent of the first amendment and undermines the public’s right to know what their government is doing.Hegseth responded to this near-universal rejection with his usual level of sophistication and maturity, sending “bye-bye” hand-wave emojis as news organizations signaled, on social media, that they did not intend to comply.This latest effort amounts to an escalation. Not only does the Pentagon rarely hold press briefings these days but, in May, Hegseth banned journalists from most of the Pentagon unless they had an official escort. That was a departure from past practice – and a way that reporters like NPR’s Tom Bowman were able to gather nuanced information during their day-to-day interactions.Under the new policy, reporters could run the risk of being designated a security risk if they evenaskedPentagon employees for sensitive information.I feel certain that reporters and their news outlets will continue to cover the doings of the Pentagon, informing the public about what their government is up to.Access isn’t everything. In fact, the journalistic quest for access to powerful people and institutions – and the desire to protect one’s access – may impede truthful reporting.As Dan Perry, the former AP journalist, noted, reporters can continue to do their jobs through methods other than transmitting officially approved information to the public.“Coverage of the military can be pursued through leaks, freedom of information petitions, and other collaborative means harnessing the legal system’s protections,” Perry observed. And they can continue to do so, he added, “until this benighted regime sees out its days”.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsPete HegsethOpinionUS press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

Why are Republicans so clueless about women’s bodies?Wed 15 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 07.43 EDTShareRobert F Kennedy Jr is the father of six children. He’s also the US health secretary. Two facts that might lead a reasonable person to assume he possesses a basic understanding of how foetuses develop.In a shocking development, however, it seems that Kennedy – ananti-vaxxerwho says his brain was partly eaten by aparasitic worm– may not know what he’s talking about. During a cabinet meetinglast Thursday, Kennedy reasserted unproven claims that taking the common painkiller acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol, while pregnantcauses autism. Doubters of this theory, he said, were motivated by Trump derangement syndrome. To underscore his point, he referenced a TikTok video he’d seen of apregnant woman“gobbling Tylenol with her baby in her placenta”.Foetuses, of course, develop in the uterus, not the placenta. It’s possible, if we are being generous, that Kennedy misspoke. Then again, he would hardly be the first US politician to make it clear he knows nothing about the female bodies he is so keen to legislate, would he?In 2019, for example, 25 Republicans – all white men – voted for a near-total ban onabortion in Alabama. During the debate,Clyde Chambliss, one of the bill’s sponsors in the Senate,noted thatwhile he didn’t have medical training, “from what I’ve read, what I’ve been told, there’s some period of time before you can know that a woman is pregnant … It takes some time for all those chromosomes and all that.” Chamblisswent on to saythe generous bill allowed a woman to end her pregnancy “up until the point she is known to be pregnant”. Yeah, I don’t know what he means either.Then there’s the Ohio Republican John Becker, who once co-sponsored a bill prohibiting insurers from covering abortion services, except for a procedure “intended to reimplant” an ectopic pregnancy in a woman’s uterus. This ismedically impossible. After this was pointed out, Becker said he’dnever actually researchedthe issue.And there’s theIdaho lawmakerwho once asked if a woman could swallow a small camera so doctors could conduct a remote gynaecological exam. No, he was told by a doctor, because swallowed pills don’t end up in your vagina. “Fascinating,” he replied.I could go on; I’m afraid there areendless examples. But I’ll end with the late Todd Akin, a conservative Missouri Republican, who said in 2012 that “legitimate rape” rarelyresults in pregnancybecause “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down”. Yep, that same crafty female body that grows babies in its placenta.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Having replaced Angela Rayner as housing secretary, he bounded around Labour conference last month dishing out Maga-red caps stamped with his credo “Build Baby Build!”. Headgear and slogan have both been filched from that very rightwing guy in the White House – because, like Robert Jenrick, Steve Reed is what happens when self-identified centrists turn populist.Imagine Donald Trump had, years ago, swerved TV fame to become instead ward councillor for Brixton Hill. Imagine if Trump had no towers, but knew his way round a Travelodge. Most of all,imagine this scenefrom the conference fringe, recounted by Inside Housing magazine:“Steve Reed skipped into the room only once the well-orchestrated chanting by his party faithful was deemed loud enough to the tune of We Built This City by Starship. He then took to the stage and proceeded to throw more signed and branded merchandise into the crowd, before cracking open a bottle of alcohol because ‘all builders need a beer’.“One sector professional’s response to the proceedings was ‘dear God’.”Steve Reed: he built this city, he built this city on rock’n’roll.Except there is no building, baby. Labour was elected last yearon a pledge of 1.5mnew homes by the end of this parliament, yet in private, Reed’s officials already accept they will end up breaking that promise. Take London, where the government wants88,000 homes finishedbefore January. That goal was always a huge stretch but now it looks like a joke: so far this year ground has broken on just 3,248 new units. The figurecomes from the consultancy Molior, which says that one in every six major housing projects is frozen: “schemes are halted, with the gates padlocked”.The shortfall is so vast as to sow panic in government and to push No 10 into a war-room exercise over a recent weekend where a team worked on a rescue package. The results will be public as soon as next week, when Reed unveils an emergency scheme, billed as gettingLondonbuilding again.I have seen a private memo circulated within the Ministry ofHousingthat reveals the measures and the thinking behind the measures. While they may help the big property developers on whom ministers rely, they will almost certainly heighten the very crisis in affordable housing that Labour vowed to fix. London is already infamous around the world for its inability to house ordinary Londoners, and this plan will add to the chaos already inflicted on families and local authorities.Sent last week, the memo details extensive discussions with senior executives at Barratt, Vistry and Berkeley – among other major housebuilders – for whom government officials rehearsed their plans. This privileged access appears to have been reserved almost exclusively for the property industry, with representatives of housing associations invited in further down the road while groups representing ordinary tenants, and even London councils, do not seem to have been involved at all.That fits with the logic of the plan, which centres on watering down builders’ commitments to provide affordable and social housing. When he was first elected as the capital’s mayor in 2016, Labour’s Sadiq Khan promised he wouldbuild homes for Londoners, not “gold bricks for overseas investors”. As a first step, he introduced a threshold: if builders reserved 35% of a development for affordable homes, their application would be fast-tracked. Affordable was loosely defined (technically, any housing at up to 80% of market value counts as “affordable”). Neither a target nor an obligation, it had the hallmark of New Labour compromise – an incentive for the market to do its bit.Yet under Keir Starmer, even New Labour can seem dangerously statist, and Reed’s department is seriously considering slashing that thresholdto just 20%affordable homes, making building in London far more profitable. If that isn’t enough of a sweetener, half will be paid for out of public money, so the cash local authorities receive from the sale of council houses will now go into padding out developers’ profit margins.View image in fullscreenReed plans other sweeteners, such as suspending thecommunity levydevelopers have long paid for amenities such as a new GP surgery or a school. Looking at government calculations, that one giveaway alone could put around £1bn back in the pockets of wealthy developers. Not all these proposals may make it into final programme, but the direction is clear.“The key test is that developers welcome the package strongly on the day,” says the memo. The same industry that, as recently as the pandemic were raking in billions in profit, is now being ushered to the front of the queue by aLabourgovernment that just last year promised “the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation” – another promise for the dustbin.One former insider at the department recalls sustained pressure from No 10 and the Treasury to bin the emphasis on social housing, which was always successfully resisted by Angela Rayner – who wielded the combined authority of deputy prime minister and deputy leader – and her housing minister Matthew Pennycook. Until the government’s personnel changed abruptly last month, that is.So much for high politics; the ground reality is of a housing crisis that just keeps getting bigger. Over 13,000 people slept rough in London in 2024-25, four times the number before David Cameron’s austerity regime. At the start of this year, 73,000 households across the capitalwere in temporary accommodation, including 90,000 children – so that on average at least one child in every classroom in Londonis homeless. The capital’s councils pay out £5.5m every day just to put them up in rooms that are too often cramped, ridden with mould and worse.None of this will be improved by these measures, as laid out here. More than one source believes developers will halt projects already under way, arguing they should be allowed to divert into more profitable housing. A source at the Greater London Authority estimates that up to 20,000 affordable homes already planned, some even part-built, could rapidly disappear. Over the longer term, says Duncan Bowie, a key architect of theLondon Planunder Ken Livingstone, the memo will take Londoners back to the housing policies of Boris Johnson. Think infinity pools in the sky, while thanks to the housing-welfare cuts brought in by George Osborne and not reversed by Rachel Reeves, lower-income Londoners are exiled hundreds of miles away from family and friends.In response to my questions, the housing ministry issued a short statement that reads in part: “We do not comment on leaks. No decisions have been made.”Ministers will probably argue that 20% of something is better than 35% of nothing – except London’s housing problem today is not primarily about over-regulation – it’s about the lack of demand. Wages are barely rising, interest rates are way off their post-crisis lows and house prices remain untenably high. As Molior put it: “No buyers = no construction starts”.Just a few months before council elections in London and elsewhere, a Labour government is about to unveil a scheme that shows who it values most – and it doesn’t look like ordinary Londoners. As Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing at Wandsworth’s Labour council, puts it: “This is rolling over for developers.”It’s not just Steve Reed’s baseball caps that look Trumpian.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is consensus among all political parties that something needs to be done. On the efficiency side, stamp duty is the main culprit: as a lump sum tax on property wealth paid at point of purchase, it discourages people to move as frequently as they should. It prevents people from realising their full economic potential by finding the right job, in the right area, or moving into a home suitable for their household size.In combination with high interest rates and sluggish growth, tax is contributing to UK property transactions reachingnear record lows. Meanwhile,over a third of English householdslive in homesdefined by the governmentas “under-occupied”, with two or more spare bedrooms;90% of these are homeowners. Reforming stamp duty to free up some of these under-occupied properties – mainly concentrated in the baby-boomer generation now hitting retirement – could enhance growth, productivity and, potentially, the affordability crisis.I say “potentially” because it is well established that cuts to property taxesincrease the demand for homeownership– and in turn, house prices.Apparently oblivious to this fact, both the Conservatives and Reform have proposed major cuts to the overall burden of property taxation. Kemi Badenoch haspromised to abolish stamp dutyon primary residences. Reform UK has proposed smaller reductions in stamp duty but added in cuts to inheritance tax and the restoration of some landlord tax reliefs.These policies willincrease the demand for housingas a financial asset, and thus prices. Such reforms will most benefit those in London and the south-east with the most expensive homes and those who tend to move more often, while higher prices will largely cancel out the benefits for first-time buyers, just ashelp-to-buy subsidiesdid under the Conservatives. Rising prices will also weaken the incentives for empty-nesters to downsize.On the fairness side, council tax has become essentially a wealth tax on low- and middle-income earners. A tax based partly on locally provided public services and partly on property value, it is “band-based”, with those in higher bands paying more. The bands were introduced in 1991 and politicians have opted never to revalue them since then, despite house prices in certain areas of the country increasing sevenfold. As a result, households in the bottom 10% of property values pay,on average, over 0.7%of their property value annually, while those in the top 10% pay less than 0.1%. A multimillion pound mansion in Westminster can incur less tax than a modest home in the north of England.The property tax system also favours homeowners over renters and investment in property over other financial assets. Few people know it, but until 1963 there was a tax imposed on homeowners based on the rent they would have been paying had they been renting their homes: so called imputed rent, a tax still imposed in the Netherlands. Most importantly, given the explosive rise in house prices since the 1980s, homeowners enjoy 100% relief on capital gains tax on selling their primary residence. At£31.5bn in 2023-24, this was the single largest tax relief in the country, equivalent to 1.15% of GDP, roughly the equivalent to running the Home Office and Ministry of Justice combined.All of these flaws combine todrive investmentand lending in the UK towards property, rather than capital investment or equity in businesses. This is a major but largely neglected reason for theUK’s stagnant productivity and growth levelsas well as the affordability crisis.Effective property tax reform requires an approach that represses investment demand and overconsumption of UK housing and frees up the stock for those who really need it. Among economists of both the left and right, there is increasing consensus that the UK needs a “big bang” rather than incremental reform. Replacing stamp duty and reforming council tax with an annualproportional property tax(PPT) of around 0.5% on the market value of the home – or the value of the land underneath it – would deal with both the inefficiency and unfairness challenges within the existing system. Research by theFairer Share campaignshows it would benefit three quarters of the population, not least the “red wall” seats that Labour is haemorrhaging to Reform.Complications arise because council tax is also a vital source of funding for local public services; poorer areas could end up needing huge transfers from central government, resulting in even more fiscal centralisation. Arecent proposalby ex-government adviser Tim Leunig argued for councils to control the funds from a PPT on homes under £500,000, setting their own rate and with a minimum payment of £800, while central government would take funds from properties above this value at a 0.5% rate, with a 0.8% rate for homes above £1m.Rumours circulated that the Treasury wasseriously considering the scheme. The political risks would be high given the media is mostly hostile to any new tax on property. Labour needs to be bold and make the positive case for shifting the burden of tax off working peopleand on to unearned wealth. A radical reform of property taxation could help deliver three of its key policy goals: reducing rising wealth and regional inequalities, solving the housing crisis and stimulating economic growth.Josh Ryan-Collins is professor of economics and finance at theUCL Institute for Innovation and Public PurposeThis article was amended on 15 October 2025 to remove a reference that Switzerland still imposed imputed rent; the country voted to abolish it on 28 September this year.Explore more on these topicsHousingOpinionCommunitiesStamp dutyCouncil taxTaxcommentShareReuse this content"

We’ve heard that before – the result was more bloodshedJason BurkeIn 1982, Ronald Reagan picked up the phone to Menachem Begin to tell him to end a war. There are lessons from history and we need to learn themWed 15 Oct 2025 05.24 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 12.57 EDTShareSo, which year are we in? A US president, after months of tacit encouragement, has finally intervened to end an Israeli military offensive that has reduced swaths of a Middle Eastern city to rubble, leaving thousands dead and prompting global outrage. For months, the UN has looked on, impotent, as Israeli air raids and artillery shelling has pummelled apartment blocks and refugee camps beside the Mediterranean. The Israeli offensive’s target, according to its architect, is a “kingdom of terror”.The offensive has come after a series of attacks on Israel. Now, under pressure from the White House, the Israeli prime minister, a rightwinger with a gift for populist rhetoric and an intense sense of historic Zionist mission, has agreed to a ceasefire. So too have the Palestinian armed factions, which have faced the massive firepower of the Israeli military. These will now be forced to disarm and many will go into exile. A peacekeeping force is being organised by the US to stabilise the situation.The year is not 2025, but 1982. The city is not Gaza City, but Beirut. The president isRonald Reagan, not Donald Trump. The Israeli prime minister is Menachem Begin, not Benjamin Netanyahu, and the target of the Israeli offensive is Yasser Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), not Hamas.There are many differences betweenwhat happened in Lebanonmore than four decades ago and what has happened in Gaza in the past two years. The Hamas raid of October 2023, which killed 1,200 and saw 250 taken hostage, bears little comparison with the relatively paltry efforts of the PLO in the year or so preceding Israel’s invasion of Lebanon. Estimates vary but about 20,000 died in the earlier war, less than a third of thetoll in Gaza. But there are many striking parallels too.Some are uncanny. Reagan finally picked up the phone to Begin, telling the Israeli that what was happening in Beirut was “a holocaust” and saying the relations between their countries could be gravely damaged if the violence continued, after watching images of badly injured children on evening TV news. Accordingto the Atlantic, Trump’s sudden decision to pressure Netanyahu to agree the 20-point plan that has, for the moment, ended the carnage in Gaza, came about because the president was “moved especially by images of starving children and saw their airing on major international networks as a public-relations disaster for Israel”.In 1982, much as today, the conflict played out in real time on millions of screens. Hundreds of journalists flew into Beirut to cover for the first time an Arab–Israeli war without censorship by either side, and new satellite technology meant major television networks could broadcast scenes filmed just hours earlier to huge audiences.International reporters were banned from Gaza by Israel, but the combination of smartphones andsocial mediahas had just as visceral an impact.In 1982, Israeli officials cast doubt on casualty figures considered reliable by many others, claimed that the dead were mostly combatants, and accused the PLO of using Beirut’s population as a human shield. Israel’s supporters, then as now, pointed out that Arafat often worked from bunkers underneath civilian buildings, including apartment blocks, and so was responsible for the consequences.What happened after the call from Reagan and the ceasefire in Beirut is instructive. The PLO, its factions and officials were scattered across thousands of miles and a dozen countries. Washington then withdrew US-led peacekeepers – a breach of the agreement with Arafat. Bashir Gemayel, Lebanon’s newly elected president and Israel’s preferred proxy, was assassinated by Syrian security services, prompting Christian Maronite death squads to kill thousands of Palestinians in two poor southern neighbourhoods of Beirut with thenegligent complicityof Israeli commanders.The US then sent the marines back in, along with French and Italian troops. The Israelis were soon being targeted by vehicles packed with explosives, driven by young men who made no attempt to escape death. These were the work of extremist Lebanese Islamists inspired by the 1979 Iranian revolution. Soon it was the turn of the USto be targeted. Attacks on its embassy in Beirut and the marines’ barracks killed more than 300. Within a year, Reagan ended the US intervention inLebanon. The Islamist networks coalesced into Hezbollah, which would threaten Israel intermittently for the next four decades and more.In The Revolutionists, a book I spent 10 years researching that is published this month, I explore the stories of those involved in the political violence of the 1970s. One key question I sought to answer is how the decade could begin with spectacular terrorist attacks in the Middle East that rarely caused significant casualties and were organised by largely nationalist, broadly secular left-leaning groups but ended with something so very different: mass casualty suicide attacks executed by religious militants.What happened in Lebanon provided a partial answer. One reason that Hezbollah could emerge was that the years of civil war and the Israeli invasion had crippled so many other groups, factions and political parties, including those many committed to programmes of radical change that did not involve faith. Many more moderate individuals and groups had been wiped out.The same was true across the rest of the region. By the end of the 1970s, the more secular and progressive ideas and methods that had seemed to offer the promise of a new future in the Arab and Islamic worlds a decade or so earlier were discredited and their main advocates and activists dead, exiled or otherwise silenced. This left space for others who offered a different vision of how to overthrow the existing order and usher in a new era.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will that be enough for him to finish the job? | Kenneth RothRead moreThe results of this became very clear, very quickly: the Iranian revolution, the seizure by messianic Muslim radicals of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, a bloodily repressed uprising in Syria and theassassination of Anwar Sadatin Cairo by Islamic militants in 1981 all followed in quick succession. Across the region, Israel and the US now faced enemies who were considerably more intractable, lethal and effective than the leftists and nationalists of earlier years. The men (and sometimes women) of the PLO had held press conferences and handed out leaflets after attacks. After the bombings in Beirut in 1982, a brief claim of responsibility was issued in the name of Islamic Jihad and that was all.In the west, the consequencesof this were perverse. Through the 1970s, western analysts and officials had sought to understand what caused violent extremism. Intelligence services produced innumerable reports explaining the factors behind the violence of individuals or groups. Scholars received funding for huge studies into what would later be called “radicalisation”.Then, in the early 1980s, this stopped. Political leaders in the US, the UK and elsewhere were no longer interested in “root causes” of violence. Instead, the dominant view was that “terrorists” were merely mad, bad, misled or manipulated – usually by Moscow. Local circumstances were no longer of interest, nor the complex motivations of those using violence as a means to bring about change.Last week, Trump reportedly told Netanyahu that Israel could not fight all the world and acknowledged in his 20-point plan Palestinian aspirations for a state – though the word “legitimate” was reportedly removed after Israeli objections. This too was an echo of 1982.In the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Reagan told Israel that the strength of its armed forces alone could not “bring just and lasting peace” and acknowledged “the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people”. But a US-led regional peace plan supposed to answer those complaints went nowhere. From Tunis, Arafat looked on impotently. Reagan’s interest in the Middle East waned. Israel resisted any concessions. In 1987, there was thefirst intifada, and the founding of Hamas.Jason Burke is the international security correspondent of the Guardian and author ofThe RevolutionistsExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaRonald ReaganLebanoncommentShareReuse this content"

When I was a Yale undergraduate, I hated being asked what my major was. “Medieval studies? What will you do with that?”, was the inevitable question from non-students. When I went on to Oxford and studied Old and Middle English, the questioning continued. I usually answered, “I am opening a medieval shop,” to shut down further discussion.Anyone who studies the humanities, or “soft” degrees, will have faced the same judgmental, bewildered queries. The implication is that these subjects have no value. Indeed, we’ve become so narrow and utilitarian that unless a degree leads specifically to a specialised career, it’s considered by many to be a waste of time, money and resources. Kemi Badenoch has pledged to end“rip-off” degreessuch as English, anthropology and psychology because, in her view, they provide weak job prospects. (Let’s ignore for the moment the £125bn that the creative industries areworth annuallyto the UK, or the2.4 million people employed.)Years ago, my son’s secondary school counsellor told me that the biggest issue he faced was parents trying to force students to study Stem subjects and not humanities at A-level, in the belief this would inexorably lead to a better job. And yet no one knows what knowledge will be “useful” to them in their career. My own “rip-off” degree in Old and Middle English led to my writing 100 Horrid Henry stories, millions of books sold worldwide and countless kids becoming readers. (And I wrote them while on one of those “indefinite leave to remain” visas that Reform UK hasvowed to revoke.) Though I didn’t know it, I couldn’t have chosen a better subject to train me to become a children’s author.View image in fullscreenHorrid Henry: Prank Wars by Francesca Simon.Photograph: SuppliedMy love of alliteration comes from having read Anglo-Saxon poetry. Horrid Henry is peppered with alliterative sentences, which are not only great fun to read – and to write – but also help newly confident readers with their fluency. Creating Horrid Henry’s gang of characters with alliterative names (Moody Margaret, Anxious Andrew, Sour Susan, Lazy Linda), each with a unique characteristic, was directly inspired by the medieval concept of the four humours: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, melancholic. Old and Middle English also gave me a feel for the rhythms and textures of English – invaluable skills for a writer.Was I aware of this excellent job-training at the time? Of course not. I didn’t study Old and Middle English, and medieval art, literature and history because I thought a great job awaited me at the end. I did it because I love learning, and studying the middle ages enriched my life while connecting me to the fears and longings and delights of the past.It’s only looking back that you can trace influences on your writing. For instance, my lifelong love of fairytales, mythology, and folk music inspired both my novel The Monstrous Child,about Hel, the Norse goddess of the dead, and the opera I wrote with composer Gavin Higgins based on it, which premiered at the Royal Opera House. Our cantata, The Faerie Bride,about the Welsh legend of the lady of Llyn y Fan Fach, and my latest novel, Salka,have similar myth-based origins. Horrid Henry himself has a rather unexpected knowledge of Greek mythology – “Wasn’t there some old Greek … ”I’m obviously not suggesting that studying Old and Middle English leads directly to a successful writing career, though I do note that three greats – JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis and JK Rowling – were all medievalists. But unless you want to be a doctor, electrician, or another job for which specific knowledge is required, any “soft” arts subject such as history, English, theology, foreign languages and so on, teaches how to think critically, research effectively, and deepens your understanding of the world: vital skills in our time of disinformation, cults and AI.Do we want to live in a world where books and culture flourish? Or in a purely functional world where the value of education is solely measured in expected earnings? Did my friend Ed blow his first in physics to teach and play banjo? Perhaps Kemi would be a better leader if she’d dropped engineering for religious studies or psychology.The University of Chicago’s motto is: “Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched.”If you’ve learned how to think, critically and creatively, then universities have done their job. Since no one truly knows what will benefit them in the future, why not study the subjects you enjoy, and discover where they take you.Far gesund!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour is in danger of doing the sameWed 15 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 11.51 EDTShareBritain and France do not share a fixed quota of political stability such that reduced volatility on one side of the Channel causes chaos across the water. It was just a coincidence that Keir Starmer won a huge majorityat precisely the momentlast July when legislative elections made France ungovernable for Emmanuel Macron.It was a misfortune for both men, and forEurope, that their political trajectories were out of sync. Macron had dealt with four Tory prime ministers before finding a potential ally in the ascendant Labour leader. By then his presidency was in spiralling decline. Britain was rousing itself from Brexit delirium just as France was losing the plot.The two conditions are not comparable in scale. France’s parliamentary paralysis is a big mess. Britain leaving the EU was a monumental calamity. But they are alike, as harms that were self-inflicted at the ballot box by arrogant leaders with misplaced confidence in their powers of persuasion.David Cameron held a referendum in 2016 because he was sure he could charm voters into keeping EU membership. Theresa May incinerated the Tories’ parliamentary majority in 2017 because she was convinced the country would recoil from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party and give her a vast personal mandate to enact Brexit.Macron’s folly had elements of both errors. He dissolved the national assembly last summer because he imagined fresh elections would focus moderate French minds on the threat posed by the far-right National Rally (RN), which had recently triumphed in European elections. He was right, up to a point. Millions of voters did mobilise to deny RN a majority, but tothe benefit of leftwing partiesthat despise the president.Macron responded by trying to form governments froma depleted pool of loyal centrists, in denial of parliamentary arithmetic and defiance of the convention that presidents name prime ministers with some deference to the will of the electorate.The result has been months of paralysis, protest, polarisation, collapsing technocratic administrations, recriminations, demands for new parliamentary elections and calls for a presidential resignation. Macron has no intention of standing down before his term expires in 2027 andno obvious avenueto get much done in the meantime. The combination of frenzy and stasis – everything in turmoil, nothing changing – is reminiscent of the rolling Brexit crisis in parliament that ended in December 2019. By then, enough voters were sickened and demoralised by the whole spectacle that they gave Boris Johnson licence to finish the job however he wanted.In a French version of that story the denouement puts Marine Le Pen, the RN’s former leader and veteran presidential candidate, into the Élysée Palace. Or, if a court upholds aban on her standing for officeas the penalty for an embezzlement conviction, it would be Jordan Bardella, the party’sslick, business-friendly millennial leader.France is so unlike Britain in terms of constitution and political culture that analogies hardly stick. For neighbouring nations with intimately interwoven history, similarly sized populations and comparable economies, the lack of affinity between leaders is remarkable.Or maybe not. Proximity breeds rivalry. French presidents and UK prime ministers always find common ground eventually. The global imperative of cooperation trumps local competition, but solutions have to be reached through a cloud of mistrust formed by unsettled particles of centuries-old enmity.The transatlantic relationship has always been a more comfortable fit for UK prime ministers. There has never been a match of personalities and programmes across the Channel akin to the Thatcher-Reagan alliance of the 1980s or the spark that leapt from Bill Clinton’s New Democrats a decade later to jump start Tony Blair’s New Labour.If they hadn’t risen out of phase, Macron and Starmer might plausibly have achieved something close. They both see themselves as champions of pragmatic, liberal democratic centre-ground politics, unburdened by dogmas of left and right, on a mission to push back a rising tide of demagogy and nationalism.They both arrived at the pinnacle of their respective systems with relatively little experience of government or party politics. Macron became president at 39, having skipped the standard French apprenticeship of mayoral offices and senior ministries. Starmer was 61 when he became prime minister, but he had only been an MP for nine years, and never in government.With professional backgrounds in finance and the law, neither man can be called an outsider but nor were they typical political animals, indigenous to the jungles in which they arrived as top cat. They each neglected to learn some of the feral skills and pack behaviours required for survival.The French president’s arrogance is more spectacular than the British prime minister’s understated self-assurance, but both have made needless enemies by failing to cultivate alliances beyond their innermost cliques.Their personal relationship is said to be warm and open, although not exactly fizzing with chemistry. (Only intimate friends and family have access to that level of connection with the Labour leader.)Their styles are vastly different. At the peak of his powers, Macron had a magnetic eloquence that is not in Starmer’s repertoire. No one has ever accused the Labour prime minister of rhetoric that soars too high in lofty abstraction and geopolitical analysis of Europe’s future. That is Macron’s comfort zone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Critics may quibble about the detail of such agreements, but there is a clear dividend in enhanced trust.It helps that relations are no longer polluted by the hostile tabloid briefings and snarky historical allusion that were de rigueur whenever the Tories felt Paris was being uncooperative. It turns out that 21st-century diplomacy works better withoutjuvenile comments about Agincourt.Dropping pointless Brexit bluster can only move the dial so far. There are structural limits on bilateral cooperation between an EU member and a “third country”. It doesn’t help that Starmer has been unable to articulate a concept of Britain’s future relationship with its neighbours – a sense of destination and strategic purpose to engage Macron’s interest in what Brussels policymakers call the “variable geometry” of the European project.The UK prime minister came to power with timid and hazy pro-European ambitions. And by then the French president, who might have been excited by something bolder, was already haemorrhaging authority from his multiple domestic wounds. The hope of some Franco-British special relationship to bolster Europe belongs in the realm of counterfactual imagination.In the real world, the comparison of Macronism and Starmerism works only as a tragedy of missed opportunity; a tale of two missions that captured the centre ground, then failed to build anything durable there.The French president is besieged by radical forces of left and right, each naming the other as their mortal enemy, while harmonising in scorn for an incumbent who has run out of road. Macron leaves no legacy for an anointed successor to defend. His blessing would probably kill any candidacy.The cry to rally to the aid of a Republic under threat from the far right has beenissued and reissuedwith diminishing returns through successive elections. The wolf entered the mainstream long ago. It prowls freely in parliament, persuading increasing numbers of French voters and business leaders that it has domesticated itself, that it is no longer the predator of cautionary fable. It growls that the real threat to democracy and the economy comes from the left.Nigel Farage and his pack of British wolves are watching and learning. They see how resistance is worn down. They see support for the liberal centre drain away because it only ever finds its voice in a last-minute panic of self-defence. They see how to cast moderate, pragmatic government as feeble, corrupt advocacy for the status quo. That is the trap being set for Starmer. By studying Macron’s fate, he might learn not to walk right in.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionFranceEuropeFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Not me.”Hedda gives drinks to a recovering alcoholic – and a loaded pistol to an unstable former loverThis is a typical exchange from a director and actor partnership that’s now on its third film, and seemingly built on a healthy amount of negging and mickey-taking. The first outing was 2018’s Little Woods, which starred Thompson as a bar-brawling drug mule who contemplates “just one more job” –crossing the border from North Dakota into Canada to acquire opioids. Shot on a shoestring budget, it was a stylish and bracing calling card that set the director, now 35, on a meteoric rise.Since then, DaCosta has become an in-demand director who can turn her hand to just about anything. She brought horror classic Candyman back to life ina celebrated reboot, then teamed up with Thompson again on The Marvels,the $374m budget-blowingsequel to Captain Marvel, and her next outing will be the forthcoming zombie chomp-fest 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time’ ... DaCosta directing Thompson as Hedda.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/PrimeThe pair’s latest project, perhaps understandably, raised a few eyebrows – as they chose to film a play by the notoriously dour Scandinavian playwright Henrik Ibsen. DaCosta’s first exposure to the Norwegian was viaA Doll’s House, in which a seemingly devoted wife and mother called Nora Helmer suddenly bolts. The play, which was written in the 1870s, stunned the director. “How daring, to write about a woman who leaves her children because she feels as if she hasn’t fully realised her own life,” says DaCosta. “It would be controversial now. Then I read Hedda and thought, ‘Wow –thiswoman!’”Hedda is Hedda Gabler, the titular character in Ibsen’s later play. Hedda is a rare thing: a complicated, multi-faceted female lead in a classic drama. It’s a role that has tempted many, even if pulling it off is notoriously difficult. In the UK, over the last decade or so, we’ve had Sheridan Smith’sadmirable turn; a shocking denouement in Patrick Marber’s versionstarring Ruth Wilson; and, most recently, Lily Allen,who received mixed reviews.To construct her Hedda, who is the daughter of a general trapped in a stifling marriage to an academic, Thompson delved into theatre archives in New York and London, studying hours of performances with two rules: watch each one just once and don’t take notes. “It got to the pointthat I knew the play so well, I could watch productions in Norwegian without subtitles and know what was happening,” says the 42-year-old from Los Angeles.Another influence was Mae West, the movie star who once found herself in courtafter writing a play with a gay lead character. She so inspired Thompson that the actor uses Maeas her middle nameon some social media platforms. From that heady mix, Thompson created a Hedda as extreme as any seen on stage or screen. To describe her character as quite a piece of work is putting it mildly. She’s a sexy, sultry, machiavellian, vulnerable mess of a protagonist who, as DaCosta says, does “terrible, unforgivable things”. These include thrusting drinks into the hands of a recovering alcoholic and giving a loaded pistol to an emotionally unstable former lover. The fact that Thompson’s Hedda is a mixed-race, bisexual woman adds even more complexity.View image in fullscreenBrief cameo ... Thompson in The Marvels.Photograph: Marvel StudiosIn the film, rather than being overt, the question of race subtly lingers: we see Hedda having to deal with whispered comments about her skin tone from party guests. “Her father is white and her mother is black,” says DaCosta. “And you never hear her talk about her mother. That means a lot. But there’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time, because that’s not really what we’re focusing on. But it colours everything – no pun intended.”Hedda was shot in Flintham Hall, a Grade I-listed Italianate manor house near Newark in Nottinghamshire, with DaCosta setting proceedings in the 1950s, just as the postwar dust was settling in Britain. “After the second world war,” says DaCosta, whose father is British, “people were trying to figure out what the hell to do with themselves, asking who we are, how you heal. I think people were trying to pretend everything was OK, trying to get back to what was supposed to be the way society runs. These characters are trying to figure out what freedom looks like. I thought that decade would be a really great pressure-cooker to make everything more potent.”For a big, starry film that’s going to be on Amazon soon, the whole enterprise is exceptionally dark. It’s broody and low-lit, with tempers flaring and things falling apart. That’s a recurring theme in DaCosta’s work. “Growing up, I was like, ‘Why did that person just lie? Why did that person do something cruel?’ I think the darkness in my work is really my curiosity about the darkness in other people – and myself.”View image in fullscreenHemmed in … Thompson, Nina Hoss and Imogen Poots in Hedda.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/ PrimeAll the female characters – including Nina Hoss’s incredible turn as the volatile genius Dr Lovborg, a male lover of Hedda’s in Ibsen’s original – are hemmed in, trying to find breathing space in a patriarchal world. I wonder if DaCosta and Thompson see parallels in modern Hollywood, whereone study foundthat the number of female leads in Hollywood movies had hit a 10-year low.“There are limitations,” says DaCosta, who was born in New York but lives in London. “We need to change that. We’re all chipping away at that stuff.” She mentions the support she has had from Alana Mayo, president of Orion Pictures, which produced the film. Thompson jokes that DaCosta is a “refreshing, honest and candid” voice in Hollywood. After her breakout film Candyman, DaCosta discussed the “shocking way people have talked to me in my position as a director”. When she left The Marvels in post-production to work on Hedda after repeated delays, she responded toanonymous briefings against herby saying: “They knew the entire time that I had an obligation– a greenlit movie with people who were waiting for me.”Today, DaCosta is keen to downplay any idea of her being combative, saying: “There’s no ire in any of my energy. I was on the Avengers set a couple weeks ago because I still have relationships with these people.” She mentions Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios. “He wrote me a letter for my UK visa.”View image in fullscreen‘The math is different for me’ … DaCosta at the Zurich film festival earlier this month.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for ZFFBut, despite the smooth personal relationships with major players, DaCosta knows she and other black women in Hollywood face invisible barriers, just like Hedda and Dr Lovborg. “The math is different for me,” she says. “If I want to lead a film with a white actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I know that budget. And if I want to do that same movie with a black actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I get less money.”But for now, the actor she is most keen to work with is Thompson – and, despite the negging, there’s a clear affection between the two. Is it true DaCosta has a portrait ofThompson in her dining room? “What a very targeted and bizarre question,” says DaCosta, laughing. “Yes, I have a portrait from the movie that’s really beautiful of the character of Hedda portrayed by Tessa Thompson.”“It doesn’t look like me,” says Thompson. “It’s like an expressionist version of Hedda Gabler.”How does Thompson feel about all this? “She got the painting to give to me and then she took it home and said, ‘I will give it to you if you move to London.”DaCosta, suddenly sounding like Hedda the master manipulator, responds: “She knows what she has to do to get the painting. Until then, it’s in my dining room.”Hedda is in UK cinemas on 24 October and on Amazon Prime Video from 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmTessa ThompsonHenrik IbsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.”Inevitably, Shankly pops up inHome Ground,a punchy new exhibition on the architecture and social culture of football stadiums. The legendary manager is pictured savouring the acclaim of an adoring crowd, part of a tableau on the farewell to the Kop prior to its metamorphosis from churning tribal terrace into a more sedate, all-seater stand.In a bizarre optical illusion, when crowds surge down the corkscrew towers, they appear to be spirallingMarinaded in the romance and obsessiveness of the beautiful game, Liverpool is a serendipitous setting for a dive into the history and destiny of football grounds. Everton have justmigrated to a super sleek new home, the 52,000 capacity Hill Dickinson Stadium on the Mersey waterfront, neatly encapsulating the distance football and its venues have travelled from rain-lashed terraces, flat caps and leaden balls, to a high-end, multi-sensory experience, with those who can afford it cosseted in private boxes and plied with fine dining, not unlike a visit to the opera.View image in fullscreenSt James’ Park football stadium, Newcastle upon Tyne.Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA CollectionsIllustrated by a rich assortment of drawings, models, photographs and other ephemera, the exhibition’s chronological sweep opens with a 1906 plan of Anfield by Scottish architectArchibald Leitch. The towering terrace of 132 steps at the home end became known as the Kop, after the bloody hilltop battle of Spion Kop during the Boer war.Drawing on his early experience of designing factories and warehouses, Leitch went on to become the imperator of early football grounds. With daunting efficiency, he notched up more than 20 across the UK, including Stamford Bridge (Chelsea), Highbury (Arsenal) and Ibrox (Glasgow Rangers). Over a 29-year period he also designed Goodison Park, home of Liverpool’s great rivals Everton. Still used by its women’s team, it was the first ground in Britain to have seats and terracing on all four sides.England may have invented and formalised the game, but in the matter of stadium design, it was its European neighbours who really ran with the ball. In Florence, Fiorentina employed the renowned modernistPier Luigi Nervito devise a graceful exercise in reinforced concrete that brilliantly exploited the material’s potential to be shaped and sculpted. In Rotterdam, Feyenoord’s stadium of 1937 embodied the functionalist ideals of theDutchNieuwe Bouwen(New Building)movement, with a lightweight, skeletal steel frame used to suspend the upper tier above the lower, offering an unimpeded view of the pitch, revolutionary for its time.In a nice touch, the show’s thematic sections are denoted by custom designed football scarves in the zinging emerald green of grass under floodlights. In the part dedicated to Italia 90, graphic designerAlberto Burri’s definitive World Cup poster features a football pitch in Rome’s Colosseum, the ur-stadium and theoretical point of origin for all modern football grounds. Italy went large on its hosting duties, spending billions upgrading existing stadiums and constructing new ones, including a sunken bowl in Bari by the Genoese hi-tech architect Renzo Piano with structural ribs resembling a whale’s carcass.Dominating proceedings like a giant wedding cake is a model of theSan Siro in Milan. For Italia 90, an entirely new structure was built over the original 1926 stadium, incorporating red steel roof trusses supported by corkscrew-shaped circulation towers. Memorably, when crowds surge down the corkscrews, the towers appear to be spiralling, in a bizarre optical illusion. Though it remains the base of AC Milan and rivals Inter, after years of protracted wrangling, its days look to be numbered.View image in fullscreenAllianz Arena, Munich, Germany.Photograph: Herzog & de MeuronThere are some surprising heirs to Archie Leitch. Though you might not think it, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are huge football aficionados with their firm producing some of the most radically inventive contemporary stadium designs. Fabricated from nearly 3,000 inflatable foil cushions impregnated with LED lighting, Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena can instantly change the colour of its skin, like a colossal, glowing chameleon. And in Braga, in northern Portugal, Eduardo Souto de Moura set a stadium in a disused limestone quarry, a natural amphitheatre where a wayward shot on goal will rebound off a cliff face.View image in fullscreenGala Fairydean FC stadium on the Scottish Borders.Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA Collections“Spaceship” is an overused epithet, but football stadiums do have an otherworldly aura, as modern colossi looming above huddled neighbourhoods, evocative of Philip Larkin’s “ships up streets”. Yet size isn’t necessarily everything. In Galashiels in Scotland, Gala Fairydean’s bijoux stand for 750 supporters resembles a piece of concrete origami, designed byPeter Womersleyin 1965.A pivotal moment was legislation for the development of all-seater grounds following the catastrophe of Hillsborough, its impactstill resonatingafter nearly four decades. Before Hillsborough, 56 people died in the 1985Bradford City stadium fire, in which the dilapidated main stand became an inferno within 270 seconds. Such disasters marked a hideous low point in British football history, showing how supporters were seen in a demeaning and dehumanised light by the authorities and how ageing structures had become rickety death traps.Unimaginably removed from the era of seething crowds on acres of terraces, the future of football stadiums lies in being increasingly sustainable and flexible. After the retractable roof comes the retractable pitch, as at Tottenham Hotspur’s new ground by arena design specialists Populus, which can accommodate everything from concerts to American football.Currently managed by former bad boy Robbie Savage, Forest Green Rovers may be minnows playing in the English league’s fifth tier, but have been described by Fifa as “the greenest team in the world”, demonstrating that a club can prioritise sustainability and still achieve success. Its proposal to build the world’s first all-timber stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will form the centrepiece of a new ecology park for the local community.View image in fullscreenTottenham Hotspur Stadium.Photograph: (c) PopulousThe growth of the women’s game is also destined to shape the stadiums of the future. American club Kansas City Current are the first to play in a purpose-built venue for women’s professional soccer, incorporating subtle design changes such as modified seating and sight-lines, all calculated to appeal to a more family-oriented fanbase.The architectural historianNikolaus Pevsneronce said: “A bicycle shed is a building; Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture.” For much of their history, football stadiums used to be more bike shed than cathedral but their time has now spectacularly come.Home Ground: The Architecture of Football is at RIBA North, Liverpool andTate Liverpool, 15 October to 25 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArchitectureThe RIBALiverpoolTate LiverpoolDesignArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So a surrogate was used. Tragically, the foetus didn’t reach full termInterview byCharlotte JansenWed 15 Oct 2025 10.52 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 12.48 EDTShareThis photograph captures a moment of fragile hope: the world’s first IVF rhino pregnancy, a tiny foetus that reignited optimism among scientists fighting to save the northern white rhino from extinction. There are only two female northern white rhinos left on the planet – Najin and her daughter Fatu. Neither can carry a pregnancy due to health complications. The last male died in 2018 and that makes the species functionally extinct.For the past 15 years, theBioRescue Project– an international consortium dedicated to saving the species – has been collecting and preserving sperm from deceased males. Using this genetic material and egg cells from Fatu, they’ve created 38 embryos. It may sound like a lot, but it’s not. Since Najin and Fatu cannot carry a pregnancy, surrogate mothers are essential and it was decided to use southern white rhinos, a less endangered subspecies. The team also needed to prove that their technique would work with southern white rhino embryos before transferring any of the northern white rhino embryos into a surrogate.After 13 attempts to transfer an embryo they achieved the first viable IVF pregnancy in a southern white rhino. The foetus in this image is the result after transfer. Tragically, the pregnancy didn’t reach full term (16-18 months), as the surrogate mother died from a bacterial infection at 70 days. But the pregnancy demonstrated that the technique is viable – a critical milestone.This image goes beyond documentation. It's not showing a living animal but something much more fragileEthics are central to the project and a dedicated team of ethical scientists monitor every step to ensure no harm is done. The northern white rhinos live in a conservancy in Kenya, protected around the clock by devoted rangers and caretakers. I understand that some may feel uneasy about surrogacy and IVF in animals, but I’ve seen first-hand how carefully the team evaluates animal welfare. Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the project’s lead, says science cannot be an excuse to repeat the mistakes of the past; it cannot be the sole solution; conservation must go hand in hand with science to prevent extinction.Before becoming a photographer, I studied biology. I dreamed of being a scientist, but science felt too vast, and my applications to research institutes were clumsy and naive. It never happened.Photographybecame my way back in. Years ago, I met the press officer for the BioRescue Project, based in Berlin, where I live and in 2020 he invited me and my partner – a journalist – to document the first embryo transfers of southern white rhinos in Germany. I was blown away. As a frustrated biologist, I was thrilled to work alongside this extraordinary team. Since then, I’ve followed their work – first in German zoos, and since 2023, in Kenya.I remember being at the airport in Germany, about to fly to Kenya to document what we hoped would be the first successful surrogacy – the team were buzzing with excitement. But while we were still at the airport, we received the news that the surrogate had died. It was devastating. The emotions were hard to put into words. This photograph was taken when the scientists were performing DNA checks on the foetus.The project came heartbreakingly close to success – it’s only a matter of timeThe image feels very different to the others I have taken for the project. It goes beyond documentation – it’s not showing a living animal or a scientific procedure, but something much more fragile. For me, it represents success and loss. It proves that the science works, but it also reminds us how close we are to losing this species for ever. I think it captures the emotional essence of the whole story.Even though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we listen to scientists and support their efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place. Yes, bad news matters – but we also need stories of perseverance. There are incredible people working tirelessly, refusing to give up. The project came heartbreakingly close to success. It’s only a matter of time.But time is running out. The German government, which has funded the project since 2019, has yet to confirm continued support. The next funding decision is due at the end of November. Without it, progress could stall – not just for the northern white rhino, but for other endangered species, too. That’s deeply disheartening, especially when the goal is within reach. If we keep sidelining environmental issues, we risk crossing a point of no return.This image is the winner of the 61st Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition’s photojournalism category.

There are jokes. There is a handwritten text in watercolour, copied out again and again, freeing the writer from the injustices of their ancestors (I AM FREE, it concludes). There is work riffing on Marcel Duchamp’s moustachioed and goateed Mona Lisa, swapping his ribald but puzzling 1919 caption LHOOQ with LGBTQ+. There are book jackets about Palestine’s wrecked ecology and visual activism in Palestine post 7 October, each wrapped around blocks of stone, like messages to be sent crashing through somebody’s window.At the 2024 Venice Biennale, Claire Fontaine’s neon signs reading Foreigners Everywhere appeared and reappeared, written in dozens of languages, around the Giardini and the Arsenale, and also lent the biennale its overall title, turning a familiar kneejerk complaint into a celebration of difference. A new neon sign reading FATHERFUCKER, suspended and glowing behind the window of Mimosa House, opens their biggest London show to date.This image is completely anonymous. It is a description of the tortures prisoners were enduringSomeone walks by and catches the word in their peripheral vision. Taking a couple of steps backwards, they rewind to look again. Others lark about at the window, taking selfies. Someone else has already alerted the council to complain. “The word motherfucker probably comes from a place of a total lack of empathy. We’re at the point where we don’t have any sympathy any more,” Fulvia Carnevale tells me, as she and James Thornhill, collectively known as Claire Fontaine, are finishing the installation of their show, called Show Less, in the gallery. Fatherfucker reverses the insult. “These works are all about injustice,” Carnevale adds. “The show revolves around structural injustice and how we deal with that. You know, patriarchy is an injustice, but it’s an injustice for men too.”View image in fullscreenSwitched gender … Fatherfucker, in Show Less.Photograph: Christa HolkaClaire Fontaine call themselves a “ready-made artist”, their name borrowed from the famous French stationery brand. Claire Fontaine also means clear fountain, which can also be taken as a reference to Duchamp’s 1917 Fountain, his ready-made urinal. Not all their references are so obvious. The gallery floors and stairs are completely covered in newspaper, filleted from recent editions of the Guardian, donated by the staff. This is a distant reference to a group of 1949 photographs by Robert Capa, showing Henri Matisse working on his designs for the chapel he was designing in Vence, outside Nice. Matisse had covered the floor of a temporary studio with newspaper, to protect the tiles beneath. Here, it is a news floor, a constant background rumble of yesterday’s news, cycling beneath our feet.Currently, Thornhill and an assistant are mounting a big, backlit Venn diagram on the wall, three intersecting circles in blue, peach and yellow, the circles denoting witnesses, perpetrators and victims. Titled Intersections, Claire Fontaine sourced the diagram on the internet. It casts a blush of colour on the newspapers beneath. “It’s not about who’s innocent, who’s guilty, who’s the victim – it is about how do we deal with the violence of our daily life that is destroying every dignity, basically, for art, for making a symbolic action,” Carnevale says.View image in fullscreen‘It is about how do we deal with the violence of our daily life’ …’ Intersections by Claire Fontaine.Photograph: Christa HolkaTwo other light boxes, their proportions based on those of a mobile phone but vastly enlarged, like airport advertising, hang nearby. One contains a blown-up photo of a drawing smuggled out from a Yemeni prison and posted on the internet in 2018. Untitled (They Sexually Harass and Torture Then Photograph and Publish) is a sorry scrap of packaging foam on which a prisoner has urgently detailed their experience. The light boxes are overlain with a second image of a broken phone screen, the cracks becoming an integral part of the image beneath.“This image is completely anonymous,” Thornhill says. “It is a description of the tortures that the prisoners were enduring.” Carnevale points at the crude little drawings. “This is somebody getting ready to be raped and these two guards beating this guy have been depicted headless. It’s an incredibly brutal image of total darkness and the scribbled Arabic text is a description of what you see. The fact that we’re seeing through a broken screen reflects in some ways the reality of how we don’t understand.” One part of the image was censored at source. We don’t know what has been blocked out. What you don’t see here is probably the most frightening thing about it.Multiple lifesize copies of Gustave Courbet’s notorious 1866 oil painting L’Origine du Monde line one gallery: one closeup, spread-legged view after another of a woman’s pubis and vulva. Her breasts are partly swathed in a sheet. Having passed between multiple collectors, from an Ottoman diplomat who collected erotica to psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Courbet’s painting is now in the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. The copies, commissioned by Claire Fontaine, were all hand-painted in China, each one a subtly different transcription.View image in fullscreen‘You’re always nervous about making the first mark’ … James Thornhill and Fulvia Carnevale.Photograph: Christa Holka, Courtesy of Mimosa HousePreviously, they had been working over postcards, including a Modigliani, Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe and his Olympia, each of them iconic paintings with naked women who are also staring at you. “We have vandalised them in a kind of feminist key,” says Carnevale. “We asked to get 12 copies made of the Courbet. Everything was done by hand, without resorting to copying over projections of the original. The slight changes in position, the hair, the sex, the vagina and the colour are all different. When they arrived at our studio in Palermo we felt like they were an accumulation of dead bodies. It started feeling like a rape scene. So then we worked on them slightly differently, less brutally, than in our postcard version.”Sometimes, the spray painting leaves a mist or a bruise, a blush or a hint of gangrenous pallor. The spraying is horribly intimate. “You’re always kind of nervous about making the first mark, but then once you get into it, it decides itself. Painting is a kind of magical process,” says Thornhill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The postcard of Courbet’s painting is the second most popular in the Musée d’Orsay gift shop, after a Renoir.We start looking down, scrutinising the floor and picking up headlines. What you have to watch out for is people who spend all their time in here looking at the newspaper instead of the other work. You seem to have a sort of an ever-expanding repertoire of works, that you use and reuse and recombine, I say. Your work is about reconfiguring.“Foreigners Everywhere expanded in a way we never would have imagined,” says Carnevale. “Our work gets picked up and appropriated. Not worrying about being original frees you up. And it gives you a whole host of available material to work with.”At one point, Carnevale quotes some lines from Bertolt Brecht, written in 1939:In the dark timesWill there also be singing?Yes, there will also be singingAbout the dark times.It’s totally of our time, she says. “But now when you make songs about the dark times, they say you’re a sellout and a monster. In many moments, contemporary art has been a comfort to us in terms of being in a space where we are allowed to live and exist and do things that weren’t understood or valued elsewhere. Now, it looks like a space of privilege. And that’s bad for everybody. I think it’s about resonating with your present, and trying to keep a dignified position. People can say whatever they want, but I’m pretty sure that everybody needs to think that there is something out there that isn’t bullshit.”Claire Fontaine: Show Less is at Mimosa House, London, until 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a space designed for scale, flexibility and form-defying experimentation, all of which apply to performance artist Marina Abramović’s ambitious, uncompromising, sprawling new show, which takes over the whole of the venue’s vast warehouse space.The four-hour performance gives audiences a journey through the folklore and rites of the Balkans, gathering traditions from across the region. There’s dancing, singing and a variety of surprising uses of the human body, from fertility ceremonies to wedding preparations. These rituals are enacted through live performance and projected film, organised across 13 scenes designed to be experienced by freely roaming audience members. Some are durational tableaux, repeating and accumulating, while others build to a climax and then reset. And wandering through it all is Maria Stamenković Herranz as Abramović’s strict, buttoned-up mother, looking on with disapproval but curiosity.View image in fullscreenCompelling unpredictability … Balkan Erotic Epic at Aviva Studios.Photograph: Marco AnelliThe emphasis is as much on the Balkan as on the erotic. Yes, there are naked bodies and giant penis sculptures, but Abramović resists simple titillation. The nudity here is ritualistic, not pornographic. A chorus of roaring women bare their vaginas to the sky in a bid to scare the gods and stop the rain; naked figures dance with skeletons in an act of mourning for their dead husbands. Meanwhile, the more explicit traditions – a woman inserting fish in her vagina to create a love potion, or a groom penetrating holes in a bridge to ward off wedding night impotence – are represented through animations on a screen, narrated by a “scientist” character.There’s as much death as there is sex, intermingling ecstasy and grief. The performance opens with a funeral lament for communist Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito, who looms over several of the scenes. Elsewhere, corpses are raised on plinths and men and women in traditional costume perform a haunting funeral dance.View image in fullscreenIntense … Maisha Kungu and Lizzy Owen in Balkan Erotic Epic.Photograph: Marco AnelliThe erotic and the morbid collide most powerfully in the black wedding: a striking scene in which a young, unmarried dead man is symbolically joined with a young woman. In a way that’s characteristic of the intensity and commitment of the performances throughout, black-clad dancers violently fling themselves at one another and at the ground.Breast-kneaders, skeleton orgies and five-metre-high penises: Marina Abramović on her most daring show everRead moreLeft to meander through all these strange and forceful scenes, the experience can be overwhelming at times. Cries, moans and rhythmic chants ring out across the cavernous space, often wrenching attention away from what’s happening in front of you. But as the performance goes on Abramović and her team subtly direct the audience into specific areas, building to collective spectacles that give the evening a satisfying shape, as opposed to being simply a collection of randomly ordered curiosities.It’s rare and thrilling to see an artist working on this scale. Balkan Erotic Epic is a test of endurance for performers and spectators alike, but the compelling unpredictability makes it worth the long haul.AtAviva Studios, Manchester, until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageMarina AbramovićPerformance artTheatreArtDanceFolk dancingreviewsShareReuse this content"

What made Brown Sugar such a seismic jolt in the 1990s R&B landscape though was its smouldering sensuality laced with undercurrents of hip-hop’s don’t-give-a-damnedness; studious, devoted instrumentality; and an infectious commitment to the art of the infinite jam. Lady is the sister, so to speak, to the title track of D’Angelo’s audacious debut album. And whereas the latter introduced listeners to a hood Romeo on the make, Lady revels in the pleasures of a lover who’s already won the chase and whose twinned passion for intimacy and privacy takes the form of a thick, bass heavy, groove recitation. Behold the birth of neo-soul.Higher (1995)Leave it to D’Angelo, that rigorous forever-student of Black music history to close out his first album with a track that flaunts its sacred-meets-profane, pulpit-meets-the-juke-joint sensibilities. Higher fuses Sunday morning modern gospel iridescence with light bedroom innuendo (“‘Cause you take me higher / Further than the stars above / Send me in ecstasy, baby / With your love, with your love”). But its emphasis on the declaration of epic, cosmic love, Bowie-esque “Heroes” love, the kind in which you “put your hands into mine … and then we’ll take off to the skies above” – with the help of that soaring Hammond B3 organ – is proof that even on his earliest record, D’Angelo was interested in imagining Black love as not just a form of escape but as a kind of mobile shelter, monumental in scope and intensely divine. And like so many of Brown Sugar’s tracks, it reminded us of the precious and singular power of the soul falsetto. In the midst of an era ruled by hip-hop MCs and showmen producers, it doubled-down on the virtuosities of Black male vocality, treating it like the prodigal son, crown jewel star of pop we had always known it to be. Here, then, was the architect of Black Gen X sonic feeling and eloquence.Devil’s Pie (2000)From his first masterpiece, Voodoo, Devil’s Pie is, arguably, the dark and intricate sequel to Lauryn Hill’s Lost Ones, her hip-hop sermon-on-the-mount directed at ex-lovers and fellow MCs felled by the materialism of the game. In both form and content, Devil’s Pie swings even harder than Hill’s judgment jam with its sparse, pounding rhythm section, its haunting, gradually stacked vocals, and its horror film imagery. He plunges us into a Walking Dead universe of ravenous zombies, all clambering for a slice after slice of the whole “pie”, the whole racial capitalist laundry list of goods and vices: “greed and lust, jealousy, envious / Bread and dough, cheddar cheese / Flash and stash, cash and cream …” D’Angelo, himself, likened Devil’s Pie to “a blues song” with vocals inspired by the sound of a “chain gang … or like the feel of … the field slaves … picking whatever the fuck the master had us picking”. His indictment is stone-cold daring as it turns an eye towards the nightmares of systemic failure as well as our own. “Ain’t no justice,” D’Angelo declares, “it’s just us …”Untitled (How Does It Feel) (2000)Yes, it’s one of the greatest tributes ever to D’Angelo’s all-time hero Prince. Sonically and sexually, Untitled radiates with the Purple One’s masterful grammar of tenderness, his irresistible alchemy of masculine eros and feminine intimacy. But it also takes those elements of his majesty’s repertoire and turns them out, so to speak. Though its hotter-than-July accompanying video is the first thing you might remember about this song, the last thing you’ll hold on to is surely the way Untitled makes youfeel, how it seduces you into contemplating the wonder and the glory of a slow-burning, coital journey unfolding in real time, how it makes you believe in the possibility of being taken by a songandan artist who wants nothing more than for you to surrender to slow-rolling, woman-centred, orgasmic energy. One of the greatest works of pop music eroticism ever recorded.View image in fullscreenD’Angelo at Bonnaroo festival in 2012.Photograph: Mediapunch/ShutterstockAfrica (2000)Post-civil rights-era pop has its share of stirring lullabies and love songs to artists’ children. It’s a sub-genre that thrives on often weaving together some combination of historical, Biblical or geographical images that frame the conditions of a newborn’s arrival and the legacies that promise to supply this golden child with succour and survival. Think Stevie’s Isn’t She Lovely?, Lauryn Hill’s To Zion or Beyoncé’s Bigger, the latter of which seems to take direct inspiration from D’Angelo’s Africa. Born Michael Eugene Archer, D’Angelo shared a son, Michael Jr, with the equally formidable, powerhouse neo-soul singer Angie Stone who, in a sorrowful twist of fate, died earlier this year as a result of car crash injuries. Africa is a message from father to son, delicate like an ocean’s breeze, gently rolling like a river over Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s steady percussion. It is a love song born out of diasporic inheritance (“Africa is my descent”), a recognition of the scale of a people’s past (“from kings and queens becomes a prince”) and an embrace of fatherhood’s restorative humility (“I receive the love that radiates from your glow”).Ain’t That Easy (2014)The drought between one gamechanging record and the next for D’Angelo ended in the early weeks of winter 2014 when the album Black Messiah dropped. If the dawn of the Black Lives Matter era featured a cluster of brilliant and incisive works by artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Solange and Beyoncé, D’Angelo’s entry was its own astonishing revelation. Its opening track, Ain’t That Easy is signature D’Angelo with its neo-soul wall-of-sound bass and percussive density. We are swept into the world of lovers at odds with each other, dropped into a relationship on the verge of falling apart, but D wants us to lean into the struggle with him. “You can’t leave me / ain’t that easy …” At the end of a long year of Black folks taking to the streets and fighting for recognition of their full humanity, fighting to not be abandoned by their country, Ain’t That Easy bristles with metaphorical electricity as it recalls James Baldwin’s argument in The Fire Next Time: “If we – and now I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others – do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world …” No easy task.The Charade (2014)Black Messiah’s gut-punch of a track. Think George Benson’s cover of Leon Russell’s This Masquerade, sped up and drenched in political fire. If that 1976 classic emerged as a kind of ironic post-civil rights ballad for Black Americans living in the wake of freedom struggle advances and, likewise, witnessing gradual backlash (“are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?” croons Benson), The Charade turns up the volume on the shibboleths of racial equality in America. We are “crawling through a systematic maze” with D and his furiously tight ensemble, The Vanguard. Soaked in Prince, Hendrix and Sly sonic references, The Charade rips the Band-Aid off and thrives on second-person questioning, witnessing and confrontation (“Degradation so loud that you can’t hear the sound of our cries …”). With the murder of Michael Brown and countless others fresh on our minds and in our hearts, 2014 D’Angelo returned to the scene to call it like he saw it: “All we wanted was a chance to talk / ‘Stead we only got outlined in chalk”. A tornado of a song whose live rendition on Saturday Night Live rocked the foundations of late night TV, offering the fierce musical antidote to anti-blackness.Really Love (2014)He’ll always be a loveranda fighter. Black Messiah’s grand romance track, Really Love, wears its cinematic ambitions on its sleeves with spoken word opening verses delivered in Spanish by Boricua artist Gina Figueroa. Cue the swirling strings and let Figueroa do her thing with a short, biting monologue (“Yeah, you love me? I love you very much … I did not want to fight you. I only wanted to love you. But you are very jealous”). The greatest falsetto singer of his generation is all about the determined serenade here, taking the playful sensual route to win this woman back into his arms with Latin guitar licks creating a delicate tapestry for our suitor. With dashes of melodrama and romcom energy, Really Love conjures the spirit of Prince on any one of his please baby, baby, please, you’re-so-hard-to-get anthems, delighting in the act of supplication; D’Angelo, like his idol, knows how to turn tender passivity into blue flirtation.Prayer (2014)In an era when we were hungry for anthems (Alright, Freedom, Don’t Touch My Hair), D’Angelo turned the concept of the anthem on its head with Prayer, a swamp groove holy revival, a dense odyssey that takes us to the centre of our struggle to survive and persevere; a cathartic, slow-tempo P-Funk exorcism of our long, trans-generational fight to be free. D wills us forward like a lowdown preacher in call-and response mode with a “Lord have mercy” blues guitar lick as his foil. He sees “the devil on your feet” and knows “that he will … try to stop you / From seeing your days / But you got to pray all the way”. The time is now, and the ominous chimes on this track tell us so. This is Black exhortation from the pulpit delivered in the club, chanted on the front lines, crooned from the lip of the stage. It is prayer come to life in full force, percussive strength, beat out in hand claps and a stomping resolve. It’s a slow-moving step show for the movement, the church service, the party. It’s Black hope, faith and resistance made manifest in the form of sonic spiritual rebellion.Lauryn Hill – Nothing Even Matters (ft D’Angelo) (1998)How does one measure tenderness? Lauryn Hill and D’Angelo showed us the way on one of the great duets of the 1990s – great in its use of “quiet,” this expressive mode that the Black studies scholar Kevin Quashie defines as, in part, a sign of a potentially “dynamic and ravishing” interior. Hill and D’Angelo build a fortress of quiet as they take in one another and let everything around them fall away. “Your love makes me feel 10 feet tall / Without it I’d go through withdrawal / ’Cause nothing even matters at all”, sings D’Angelo while his shared warmth with Hill fills up the spare, intimate spaces in the song. Encircled by finger snaps, a poignant guitar, a gentle rhythm section that gives these two titans room to breathe, they take each other in. “These buildings could drift out to sea / Some natural catastrophe / Still there’s no place I’d rather be / ’Cause nothing even matters to me”, adds Hill. You want these two in a Barry Jenkins romance with the cameras spinning all around them. You want to lose yourself in this Black love that is salvation itself. Signature D’Angelo alongside his neo-soul genius peer: how we wish that we could hold this scene for ever.Bonus tracks: the D’Angelo cover versionsD’Angelo – Cruisin’ (Smokey Robinson cover)D’Angelo, Femi Kuti, Macy Gray, Roy Hargrove, the Soultronics and Positive Force – Water No Get Enemy (Fela Kuti cover)D’Angelo – Can’t Hide Love (Live at the Jazz Cafe, London, 1995) Earth Wind & Fire cover)D’Angelo – She’s Always in My Hair (Prince cover)D’Angelo with Princess (Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum) – Sometimes It Snows in April (Prince cover)D’Angelo and Erykah Badu – Your Precious Love (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell cover)And one more D’Angelo-related favouriteRoman GianArthur – OK Lady (EP with mashed-up covers of Radiohead and D’Angelo tracks)Explore more on these topicsMusicD'AngeloSoulR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here, he tells the story of his rollercoaster rideOobah ButlerWed 15 Oct 2025 09.23 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 11.26 EDTShareI’ve never met a billionaire before. And this isn’t how I imagined it would go. Don’t get me wrong: his brightly lit Manhattan office is pleasant, but not unusual. The pipes are scalding hot. As his assistant leads me through to the meeting room, I’m fairly sure I can spot discarded paper plates from pizza slices poking out of the kitchen bin. In other words, it is similar to most of the city’s workplaces.I’m here to meet Jim McKelvey, somebody Forbes will tell you has roughly £1.3bn to his name from co-founding the payment app Square. Jim is straight off a flight from Tokyo, I’m told. He enters the room and shakes my hand politely, but soon seems agitated. I’m not sure whether it’s his lack of sleep or if this is just how people who make more money during power naps than you earn annually deal with potentially having their time wasted. In other words, I’m going to have to ease my way in gently.“So, I Googled you on my way in,” I say, “and it turns out you’re a billionaire.” He agrees. “I worked it out,” I continue, “and it seems like £1m to you is the equivalent of £20 to me. So please can I have a million pounds?”It is over quite abruptly. Pretty much everything has been going this way for over a month, since I started this project to become a millionaire in 90 days. Today, money seems to be all people have room to care about. This makes sense: a huge number can no longer afford most things that provide stability or meaning. Simultaneously, if you look at anybody’s tailored social media algorithms, they’re being served a cultural diet of entrepreneurial slop. Business gurus in brightly lit rooms talk earnestly about meditation. Teenagers give crash courses in how to make it big in cryptocurrency. The rock stars of today seem to be founders, venture capitalists and money men.I cannot help but find this depressing. I didn’t grow up with money and have become accustomed to the idea of a life where it will be transient. However, as my savings dwindle, I find myself wondering if it has to be this way. Could there be something in society’s shift towards hustle and grift? Perhaps this could be my opportunity to make that elusive secure living. But I think there has to be some sort of pressure involved – which is why I have challenged myself to become a millionaire in 90 days.So I pitch the idea to Channel 4, keen to film my bid to bag £1m, even though I really haven’t thought things through. They seem sceptical but, before the mood sours, we make a deal.I lose my first few days to TikTok, observing the best minds of my generation – Steven Bartlett, host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, and Luke Belmar, a digital creator and investor in crypto – discuss things like whether humans actually need sleep or how the Bible tells us not to eat crisps. The consensus seems to be that I need a business. I come up with one based on my past, doing stunts like creating London’s premierfake restaurant in a garden shed.View image in fullscreen‘I need a business’ … Oobah Butler.Photograph: Chris Bethell/PR ImageAs a model, I will use the artist Banksy and the Brooklyn-based art collective/business agency MSCHF, who both manufacture headline-grabbing moments to sell expensive products and inflate the value of their brand. MSCHF sold 666 pairs of shoes in a collaboration with the rapper Lil Nas X, each containing a drop of blood, for $1,018 each. I would do similar to launch my new company, Drops. The plan is, after 90 days, to have made enough noise to sell the company for a million. But first, to fund my publicity stunts, I need investment.Even before Swoop Funding sees me out of its office in London’s Regent Street, I know they aren’t the ones for me. They want to see a business plan, disconcerted by the fact that Drops barely exists. Such old-world thinking! I need somewhere that embraces risk.Thank God for New York. On day 15 of my challenge, I arrive and immediately think: “This is going to be easy.” Ping-ponging from party to party, I realise everybody is a millionaire here. “You want to make a million?” I am asked. “Why not a billion?” Yes,why not?Iqram Magdon-Ismail is introduced to me as the co-founder of one of the US’s largest payment apps, Venmo. A company he’d sold in 2012 was valued at $38bn (£28bn) in 2020. A day or two later, I stop by his office and he explains his latest business venture, Jelly-My-Jelly, an app that seems to completely change every time we meet. He has forgotten the details of my challenge but, hearing it now, his eyes light up – he wants in.Iqram stands up, explaining how this is going to be big. He declares himself my co-founder and announces that our company is already worth $10m. In a year’s time, people will fill Madison Square Garden to hear how this business came together.A week later, I pitch my planned publicity stunts over coffee. “I want to create and sell a luxury piece of luggage that looks like a bomb.” Iqram stares blankly. I continue: “Let’s create the first legal child sweatshop in over a century!” Soon, Iqram makes it clear that positioning himself as co-founder was not legally binding. In the subsequent days, whenever I try to contact him, I am unsuccessful. Iqram doesn’t answer a text from me for a while. I am getting desperate, which means crossing one of my red lines: getting into crypto.Joining me on Zoom from inside a hyperbaric chamber, an oxygen-boosting device with contested health benefits used by many Silicon Valley loyalists, is Gunnar Lovelace. He is the founder of a crypto company named UNFK that aims to create, hype and inflate the value of its own meme coin. He wants viral ideas. I have always avoided crypto due to feeling uncomfortable about the ethics. Iqram even floated the idea of us doing a coin together, but I resisted.However, I am now running out of options. I agree to four or five viral stunts with Gunnar. Over the coming weeks, I film something about trying to trick bankers into committing crimes. I make people taste plastic burgers outside a McDonald’s to make a hazy point about chemicals in the food packaging of a Filet-O-Fish, and another poking again at Amazon like inmy last film for Channel 4. I end up making $18,000, which is a lot less than I’d hoped for.I pitch all the businesses I’ve created during the 90-day period, but claim them as winsI am now dangerously low on time. I commit to launching my headline-baiting Drops idea where unpaid kids design a £100 football shirt emblazoned with their own faux-religious cigarette brand, Holy Smokes.GQ write about therelease, whileinfluencers find it puzzling. When it comes out, we manage to sell £10,000 of shirts. It’s not enough. Drops is dead. I am forced to pivot.Inspired by how a lot of online entrepreneurs say they make millions through selling courses, I write a three-hour educational class about generating ideas that can make you rich andhave a platform built to sell it. The trailer for my class gets 2 million viewers. Only 0.5% of these people have to buy a course for £100 and I’ll be a millionaire. I am going to be rich!In the 24 hours after launching the course, I sell one.There is just over a week left. Things go from bad to worse. It turns out that Jelly-My-Jelly is no longer a podcast app or a TikTok competitor, but a meme coin. The same meme coin he tried to get me involved with is now the No 1 trending coin on popular crypto site Solana, with a $250m market cap. One trader bought $8,000 worth and in three hours made $2.4m.In spite of that, I hear from Iqram and he has an idea: I should auction off 10% of myself for £1m. This sounds frightening, but it could be the deal that gets me a million. Word of the proposal reaches Kavita Gupta, founder of crypto hedge fund Delta Blockchain. She seems genuinely interested. I leave New York and go to meet her in Miami and, in her snow-white apartment, we talk business. I pitch all the businesses I’ve created during the 90-day period, but claim them as wins. My Ethical Sweatshop fashion brand? A smashing success. My educational class? A stroke of genius! This actually works. Kavita wants to talk terms. She will own 10% of all my earnings and assets for the rest of my life. But she wants me to run all life decisions by her. In the next 12 months, I will create a crypto meme coin with her named OobahCoin.For the second time in 90 days, I am signing a contract without fully digesting it. Staring out at the Atlantic from Kavita’s balcony, I wonder if the tears filling my eyes are from the ocean air or exhaustion. I reach the end of my 90-day period, but truly this is just the beginning. Kavita and I make a deal that will make me a millionaire. Does it matter that this deal may encourage more desperate people to make bets on a cryptocurrency based on my word? Can I disregard any ethical red lines and become like the people who seemed so alien to me 90 days ago? Can I become a money-man? Perhaps I should head into a Wall Street bank and turn Kavita’s offer into even more money …How I Made £1 Million in 90 Days is on Channel 4 on 16 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDocumentaryCryptocurrenciesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The long-running military shooter series, which specialises in gigantic online multiplayer conflicts involving dozens of ground troops, tanks and aircraft, has returned for its sixth main instalment – andit’s thrilling, epic and compulsive.Apart from the single-player campaign mode, which I absolutely hated. It’s another oh-so-familiar tale of preternaturally talented soldiers just doing their jobs to defend the free world in the face of evil private military companies, terror organisations or double-crossing CIA operatives. It could be almost any military shooter of the last decade or any straight-to-streaming war film starring one of the Hemsworths. But it’s not. It’s a seven-hour cliche bombardment that you have to take an active part in.The thing is, nobody buysBattlefieldfor the campaign mode. In fact, most games in the series haven’t had one. So this was a chance for the developers to experiment a little, try something new or even subversive. The mainstream movie biz may have been equally guilty of dressing up jingoistic celebrations of the military-industrial complex as thrilling action flicks, but it has also produced Paths of Glory, M*A*S*H and The Deer Hunter. While Battlefield 6 does make the occasional nod towards the less-than-ideal circumstances of modern hybrid warfare, you don’t care much because the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no backstories who speak in nonstop military jargon.There have been a few big games that have challenged the narrative of the moral warrior acting in the world’s best interests on behalf of largely benign military divisions. Metal Gear Solid is clearly a pacifist text on the horror of nuclear war, while Ubisoft’s Valiant Hearts is a beautiful meditation on war and love. The key example, though, remains Yager Development’s fascinating 2012 adventure Spec Ops: The Line, in which you play the commander of a covert delta team sent into a disaster-hit Dubai to discover the whereabouts of a rogue US military unit.As the narrative progresses, your character descends into exhaustion and trauma, experiencing increasingly nightmarish hallucinations. The aim was to show the damaging psychological impact of war, while also providing a gripping and exciting experience. The mission was successful.View image in fullscreenWar stories … Spec Ops: The Line is the rare military game with meaning.Photograph: YagerIn the rapidly consolidating games industry, where gigantic mega-corps are willing to invest the equivalent of a small country’s GDP into capturing tens of millions of players, it seems that narrative innovation is unlikely. As is making any kind of political statement. But contemporary audiences are spoiled for choice when it comes to shooters – as the success of oddities such as Atomfall and Megabonk have shown – there’s money to be made in straying off piste.Could the Battlefield 6 campaign have been a tense claustrophobic single-set thriller like Alex Garland’s Warfare? Could it have plunged our hero into a series of survival dramas like Until Dawn? Could it have been a sandbox adventure with various tasks, items and enemy units to discover?Over the past two years we’ve seen several multimillion dollar projects axed and staff made redundant because the “pick-me” approach of green-lighting only titles that will compete directly with the always on nature of Fortnite, Call of Duty or Marvel Rivals is a zero sum game – you win or you die. Call me naive, but that doesn’t seem sustainable (not even forthose mega-titles) – and considering the human cost of mass layoffs, it’s also repugnant. Games cannot live on cliche alone. The modern world, with its shifting allegiances, its climate instability and its displaced populations, is a horrifyingly fascinating place for brand-new war narratives that actually mean something.

What do you recommend?”There are lots of options here. The children’s electronic toy manufacturer Leap Frog has a range ofLeapsterhandhelds, which can be picked up second hand for around £20-30 usually with a couple of cartridges. They’re chunky and safe, and the games are OK. However, I’d rather go for aNintendo DSor the newer and more hardy2DS, both of which go on eBay for around £10-£50 depending on condition.There are hundreds of children’s games available for these systems (original DS games can be played on both systems, but the 2DS will also play newer 3DS games – though not in 3D) and games can be picked up for as little as 50p in charity shops or at your localCeX store. With the original DS, the hinge that connects the two screens is the most vulnerable point, but it depends on how rough your daughter is with it. Also, both systems come with a stylus, which is a potential choke hazard so you need to be around when she uses it. Also, my sons lost dozens of them. Luckily a lot of games don’t need them. As for games, anything withMario,WarioorKirby, and anyAnimal Crossing,PokémonorLegotitle will be go down well.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterAction gamesBattlefieldShooting gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His drama training at the Bristol Old Vic school had encouraged in him the sense that theatre work was the goal. “Then there’s films: bit dodgy. Television: like, really? OK, you gotta pay the gas bill. That was the thinking.“There was no concession [in the training] to movies at all. But secretly, most of us [students] longed to make movies, because we’d been raised on movies, and movies seemed just so wonderful to us and magical.“Not that the theatre isn’t too, but the theatre in itself is an elite cultural form. There are of course exceptions, many wonderful theatre companies that manage to put on affordable performances for everybody. But the great thing about the cinema is that everyone could – maybe not so much these days – but everyone could buy a ticket.View image in fullscreenJudi Dench and Daniel Day-Lewis onstage in Hamlet (1989)Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“Theatre essentially relies on people having had the privilege of an education that allows them to believe that they’re entitled to go to the theatre. And that education has enabled them to understand perhaps the classics in a way that they make sense to them. It’s a relatively small group of people that is available to, and that is just quite wrong. It always bugged the hell out of me, much as I loved my time in the theatre, that we were essentially performing to a group of more or less privileged people.”On Tuesday night, Day-Lewis attended the UK premiere of his new film,Anemone, which as well as starring in, he has co-written with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis – who directs. The film is the three-time Oscar winner’s first movie in seven years, after his withdrawal from the profession in 2017.Following the release of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread, representatives for Day-Lewis released a statement saying he “will no longer be working as an actor … This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.”Daniel Day-Lewis says he ‘never intended to retire, really’Read moreSpeaking to Rolling Stone last month, however, Day-Lewis declared that he “never intended to retire” and “would have done well to just keep [his] mouth shut”.During the conversation in London on Wednesday, the actor again rejected what he perceived as misconceptions about method acting, saying that “recent commentary” about the technique for which he is famed “is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves. It’s almost as if it’s some specious science that we’re involved in or a cult.”“It is very easy to describe what I do as if I’m out of my mind and plenty of people have been happy to do that,” he said, adding that people often believed he was “mad as a March hare.”Rather, he said, method acting is “just a way of freeing yourself” in order to be spontaneous and “able to accept whatever passes through you” as another person. As an example, he cited one of Anemone’s key monologues, in which recounts to his brother (played by Sean Bean) how he exacted revenge on a clergyman who had abused him as a boy, with the help of Guinness, curry and a box of laxatives.“I don’t know why I found it so funny,” he said. “The idea of shitting on a priest. It’s not normal. But I just thought it was it hilarious and couldn’t stop laughing.”View image in fullscreenDay-Lewis as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, 1989.Photograph: Palace Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe also discussed the role for which he won his first Oscar: the artist Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, in Jim Sheridan’s My Left Foot. The sea-change in attitudes toward the portrayal of people with disabilities in the 36 years since that film was shot meant he would no longer be cast in the role, said Day-Lewis.“Quite obviously, I would not be able to make that now, and for good reason – at the time it was already questionable,” he said, adding that “a couple of the kids that helped me so much at the Sandymount Clinic [for people with cerebral palsy] made it clear to me that they didn’t think I should be doing it.”The actor prepared by spending two months in a house with a wheelchair and a set of paints. “If you’ve got the responsibility of portraying a life like Christy Brown – a huge and noble figure in Irish society – then you should to try to understand as far as you are humanly able what it feels like to be inside of that experience. And I thought: ‘I’m never not gonna work like this again.’”Day-Lewis reflected that before making My Left Foot he had been “clueless” about moviemaking. “I didn’t have a fucking clue what I was doing,” he said, recalling the exasperation of director Stephen Frears on the set of My Beautiful Laundrette when shooting a scene in which his character is cleaning the shop.“There’s something like a compulsive need to find something that feels real to me,” he said. “So I’m mopping the floor and he says: ‘Just keep doing that.’ I said: ‘That bit’s clean.’ Stephen is a very clever man but he has very low tolerance. So he sent me to the cutting room with the editor and I’m looking at [the footage] and I go: ‘Oh, I see. Right. Because you need to be in the frame … ’ I was that stupid.”View image in fullscreenDay-Lewis and Rebecca Miller in 2005.Photograph: Andrea Comas/REUTERSDay-Lewis, who also won best actor Oscars for 2007’s There Will Be Blood and 2012’s Lincoln, also discussed working with his wife, the writer-director Rebecca Miller, on 2005’s The Ballad of Jack and Rose. She had sent him the script 15 years earlier, he said, before they had met.“I was very fond of her mum [photographer Inge Morath] and dad [the playwright Arthur Miller] and I got to know them and would go and stay with them in the house that Rebecca grew up in. So I heard a lot about her. And she sounded all right.”Anemone review – Daniel Day-Lewis returns for a bleak and painfully serious misfireRead moreWorking with their son, Ronan, 27, on Anemone was a similarly happy experience, he said, propped up by a generous director with time for everyone. “You can’t guarantee you’re gonna get a great film out of it, but what you will get is an experience that people will always remember happily. That was true of Jack and Rose, and it was true of Anemone.”The film, set in the late 1980s, is about two brothers, Ray (Day-Lewis) and Jem (Bean), who both served as British paramilitaries in Northern Ireland years before. Day-Lewis said that while some of his previous films, including In the Name of the Father and The Boxer, had looked at the debate from the perspective of West Belfast Catholics, there was a sense in which it was “not really cool to show the British military experience because they were the bad guys when in that situation.“But that’s not how it was. It was like anywhere in any conflict. There were young working-class people pitched against each other usually for no good reason. It was a dirty, dirty conflict. And I’d only really examined it from one point of view.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis with his son, Ronan.Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images for BFIAnemone has met with mixed notices, with critics praising Day-Lewis’s performance and the film’s stylistic ambition, but less certain on whether it adds up to a coherent piece of cinema.The film’s reception did bother him, said Day-Lewis. “You sort of try and wear a cap of defiance but it doesn’t fit that well. ‘We made this film we were happy making, it is what it is, we did what we could, we did our best etc.’ And of course it matters hugely to us.“The critics to some extent do have the power to either encourage people to see it or discourage them from seeing it. They’re the middlemen and women between us and the public. But what of course we yearn for is that when our job is done, that it will be meaningful to people. And if it proves not to be, it’s a very, very bad feeling. It’ll bring you right down.”But both he and his son cautioned against attempting to cater to public taste. “If you are trying to second-guess what people will think and how they’ll react,” said Day-Lewis, shaking his head. “There’s an epidemic proportion disease in cinema of that: trying to figure out how to get the audience to laugh, get them to cry, get them to whoop and cheer.”View image in fullscreenGordon Warnecke and Daniel Day-Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette, 1985.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDay-Lewis also recalled interactions with his own heroes of acting, including Marlon Brando, who once proposed working together, and Alec Guinness, who wrote to him with praise after the release of My Beautiful Laundrette. “That just meant the world to me.”He added that the most powerful screen performance he had ever seen was that of the first-time child actor David Bradley in Ken Loach’s Kes, saying “I didn’t know it was possible to do something like that. A young boy who’d never acted before. And it is true and a little bit demoralising that some of the great performances over the years are from people who have never trained.”Day-Lewis reminisced about his years spent attending Saturday morning picture club screenings in south London: “You’d see cartoons and then the Lone Ranger and then something in a spaceship and they’d give you a badge and it was just fantastic.”He also named Mary Poppins as one of the greatest films ever made, singling out its star for particular praise, saying: “What a doll. I had a crush on Julie Andrews.”Reflecting on his career, Day-Lewis said that while “proud of a few things, a lot of things I’d start from scratch”. But in retrospect he was relieved, he concluded, that he’d possessed the “certain steadiness” which enabled him to turn down many more projects than he took on.“I’ve done very little over the years, but I knew from an early age that I wouldn’t try to dance to somebody else’s beat.”Explore more on these topicsDaniel Day-LewisLondon film festival 2025ActingnewsShareReuse this content"

With an advert for coatsStuart HeritageWed 15 Oct 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 10.12 EDTShareReaders of a certain age will remember the sheer nuclear impact of Michael Mann’s Heat on its release in 1995. Not only was it formally ambitious and wildly influential, but it also represented the first time that Al Pacino andRobert De Nirohad ever shared a screen.This, more than anything, was the film’s big draw. Two men, each justifiably thought of as the greatest actor to ever work in the medium, bristling against each other in real time. Their scene together in the diner was billed as the greatest spectacle in cinema since King Kong climbed the Empire State Building. Pacino v De Niro was Fischer v Spassky. It was Einstein v Bohr. It was Foreman v Ali. There was genuinely no way to overstate how momentous the pairing was.View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat.Photograph: Ronald GrantAnyway, they’re selling coats now.Yesterday the Hollywood Reporter announced that Robert De Niro andAl Pacinohave just combined forces for “their first-ever joint brand campaign” on behalf of upmarket outerwear brand Moncler.

Because a Moncler coat isn’t just a coat, it’s an “expression of friendship, connection and human warmth”.And signing both Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for the campaign is undeniably a big get; or at least it would have been, were this 1995 and Heat had been their only previous pair up. Because, since then, it’s fair to say that their quality control has drifted a little. The readers who were excited by Heat may also remember just how disorientating it was when they chose, of all the projects in the world, to team up once more for 2008’sRighteous Kill. That film, a generic cop thriller co-starring 50 Cent and directed by the man who made Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, immediately vapourised any sense of excitement about De Niro and Pacino ever sharing a screen together.Not even a third joint appearance on film, in the much more prestigious environs of Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, could salvage the wonder all that much. Now, that may have been because the pair of them spent a lot of their time onscreen swaddled in nightmarishly unconvincing CGI de-ageing technology, which meant that they were less De Niro and Pacino and more two plasticky androids, but that’s really beside the point.Robert De Niro and Al Pacino: ‘We’re not doing this ever again’Read moreAlso, it should probably be mentioned that the Moncler campaign would have had a lot more impact had this been their first forays into advertising. However, that is far from the case. Pacino has previously played golf on top of a grand pianoto advertise Sky Broadband(in his autobiography he blames this on an accountant who mismanaged his money and lost him $50m) while in 2019De Niro starred in a Warburtons advertwhere he got to deliver the immortal line “Bolton bakes best bagel? My butt” (he has offered no explanation for this; perhaps he just really likes bakeries).However, can you really begrudge them for this latest venture? Aside from the – presumably very large compensation – it’s important to remember that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now both in their 80s. Despite the creative missteps they may have made in the past, they remain two extremely beloved figures in the world of film. While it’s true that they’re both very good actors, the photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth. They’ve got decades of history behind them, and that’s perfectly evident.View image in fullscreen‘The photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth.’Photograph: Platon for MonclerPlus, even though the script for the YouTube video could be lifted and dropped wholesale into an advert for a building society that airs during Countdown, it’s worth pointing out that the pair of them sell the absolute hell out of it. There’s a chance that the wider campaign will be about two old friends in the winter of their lives, sincerely reminiscing about their years together. If that’s the case – and if the viewer is able to remove the cognitive dissonance that comes from knowing that this is all just to flog some coats – then it promises to be incredibly moving. All that, plus it’ll knock Righteous Kill from the podium of their best onscreen moments.

Graham will work with psychology lecturer Orly Klein to compile Letters to Our Sons, a book due to be published by Bloomsbury next October.“There is arguably an even bigger disconnect between fathers and sons than ever before,” Graham said. “We want to hear from men of all ages, first-time fathers, absent fathers, fathers who’ve been there but never truly been there, fathers who’ve lost and fathers who just want to find a way to say I love you, to tell their sons what they mean to them and to talk openly about what it means to be a man.”Fathers can submit their letters from Wednesday 15 October until 12 January 2026, via theproject’s website. Selected letters will appear alongside contributions from Graham and other well-known figures.The project follows the success of Adolescence, a limited TV series co-created by Graham. The show, which becameNetflix’s second most-watched English-language programme globally, examined modern masculinity and the pressures facing teenage boys in a digital world.“After Adolescence, I realised how little space there often is for fathers and sons to talk openly about what it means to be a man today,” Graham said.The series sparked widespread debate in the UK and beyond about the role of fathers, male role models and toxic online influences. MP Anneliese Midgley urged for it to be shown in parliament and in schools, arguing that it could help address violence against women and girls. Prime minister Keir Starmer supported the proposal, saying that watching the showwith his teenage children “hit home hard”. On 31 March, it was announced that the series would be made available for free to UK secondary schools.The idea for the book also grew out of Klein’s own experiment: when her son turned 13, she asked her male friends to write him letters offering advice about growing into adulthood. She talked about this with a mutual friend of Graham’s, who then put them in touch, knowing “there was an idea for a book there somewhere”.Klein, whose academic work focuses on marginalisation, identity and youth culture, has previously worked on projects such as Room to Rant, which uses rap as a therapeutic tool for young men.Campaigners and educators have warned of the growing influence of “manosphere” figures and extremist ideologies targeting vulnerable young men. Earlier this year,a study found that 69% of boys aged 11-14had encountered posts promoting misogyny. Meanwhile, research from theNSPCC found that 42% of parents reportedhearing their sons make inappropriate comments – including sexual, violent or degrading remarks – about women and girls, because of what they had seen online.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Jason Clarke – also currently excellent as a different kind of alpha male in The Last Frontier on Apple TV+ – is Richard Alexander “Alex” Murdaugh, a powerhouse personal injury attorney and member of a South Carolina dynasty whose men have been the biggest beasts in the courtroom for generations. Over the years, the Murdaughs – their name looks like “murder” but is pronounced “Murdoch” – have built up a network of acolytes who owe them a living or a favour. Their legal acumen and wealth, combined with a gangster-ish propensity for exploitation and bullying, give them a level of impunity that Alex blithely pushes to its limit.Patricia Arquetteis Alex’s wife Maggie, who worries that both his philandering and his opioid addiction have returned – and on the second point at least, she is correct.Edging out his more established co-stars to deliver the best characterisation of all is Johnny Berchtold as Alex and Maggie’s son, Paul, who is only just reaching the end of his teens but already looks irretrievable. An alcoholic whose beer-chugging has a desperate mania about it, Paul is infuriated by his father’s dismissive labelling of him as the family screw-up, an insult to which he habitually reacts by proving Pops right.View image in fullscreenCorroded by power and money … Johnny Berchtold as Paul Murdaugh.Photograph: Daniel Delgado Jr/DisneyPaul is almost catatonic with drunken self-hatred as, in 2019, he takes some friends out on a speedboat at night, ignoring their fearful screams as the craft goes faster. It hits a bridge, killing one of the group. As Alex tries to ensure Paul gets away with it, Maggie sees her son’s guilt slowly turn to psychosis, and local news reporter Mandy Matney (Brittany Snow, playing the real journalist whose podcast inspired this drama) kicks back against the media’s unwillingness to take on the Murdaughs, the clan’s fragile armour begins to fracture.As a psychoanalysis of a family where every relationship has been poisoned by the cruelty of the patriarch and further corroded by power and money, Death in the Family is thorough. Whether it’s a meeting with an impoverished immigrant family hoping for a life-changing compensation payout, a family dinner on a Bahamas holiday, or a staring match against the bathroom mirror, any interaction a Murdaugh participates in is a lie, a shakedown, or a display of dominance. The portrait of a certain stripe of white, southern capitalist, their folksy straight-talking barely concealing that every fight they’ve ever won has been rigged, is unsparing. As is the depiction of the American civil law system as a game where aggressive negotiating and dodgy insurance claims turn life, loss and happiness into commodities – all anyone cares about is the size of the settlement figure. It is obscene, even before Alex starts swindling his clients out of their cash.The issue for Death in the Family as a drama is why viewers would want to put themselves through it. Eight long episodes loom, promising a more extensive examination of, or speculation about, every aspect of the Murdaughs’ cursed lives than a documentary would offer. Alex and Maggie’s marriage is rotten, their parenting is rotten, their son’s soul is rotten. Their business empire is a rotten edifice of bribes and shady accounting. By the time the show starts hinting at a bad outcome for devout housekeeper Gloria (Kathleen Wilhoite), whose status as a beloved unofficial family member does not mean that the Murdaughs do anything to lift her out of exhausting poverty, you may wish to spiral downwards with them no further: the cocktail of disgust, schadenfreude and sadness becomes bitter.Arquette is the show’s heart, as much as it has one, as the woman who has married into all this and who can’t be the loving wife and fierce mother she wants to be because the Murdaugh menfolk can’t accommodate that. But it’s hard to place her: she’s too aware of her situation to be a tragically deluded victim, and too powerless to qualify as a co-conspirator we can despise. The Murdaughs are atrocious in so many different ways, it’s difficult to maintain a useful understanding of all of them at once. However well made and performed Death in the Family is, it prompts the same question as so much other true-crime telly: why am I making myself watch?Murdaugh: Death in the Family is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPatricia ArquetteTrue crime (Podcasts)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It conjures a fine sense of an isolated 19th-century village … but the murder investigation at its heart is risibleLucy ManganWed 15 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 15 Oct 2025 03.01 EDTShareAdebate recently went viral on social media, after someone posed the question to women: would you rather be lost in the woods with a man or a bear? Like all the best thought experiments, it exposed wildly different worldviews and experiences, illuminated chasms between the sexes, and was likely to induce an existential crisis if you thought about it for too long. There was also the almost inevitable coda in which men of a certain stripe came online to tell women how stupid they were for choosing the bear and proceeded to limn the punishments they deserved for it. This at least allowed the women who had been hesitating over their choice to make it with a new confidence.To Cook a Bear effectively dramatises this nifty little setup. The six-part drama is adapted from Swedish author Mikael Niemi’s 2018 novel of the same name (translated in 2020 for English readers by Deborah Bragan-Turner). It follows the tribulations of a pastor (Gustaf Skarsgård) and his family when they arrive to start a new ministry in Kengis, an isolated village in northern Sweden, in 1852. In a place with few pleasures, none of the inhabitants particularly warm to his puritanical approach to drinking and dancing, but it is his protection of the poor – especially the indigenous Sami, from which population comes the preacher’s adopted son Jussi (Emil Karlsen) – and his belief in social justice and equality that sets him on a collision course with the Kengis powers that be.Soon in cahoots against him are the sheriff Brahe (Magnus Krepper), the fearsome mill owner Madam Sjödahl (Pernilla August), seen early on dismissing a recently mangled worker with a month’s pay while he is still gibbering at the sight of his pulped hand, and anyone else who benefits from a populace who can be bought for a few bottles of the whisky sold by the creepy shopkeeper Lindmark (Jonas Karlsson). Although, to be fair, Lindmark’s creepiness pales once travelling artist Beronius appears on the scene (Simon J Berger, delivering a performance of rare discomfiting power). If they are – like the pastor himself – only a little more than caricatures, they are at least effective ones.View image in fullscreenLittle more than a caricature … Pernilla August as Madam Sjödahl the fearsom mill owner.Photograph: Sami Kuokkanen/DisneyWith the seeds of conflict sown, it is time to get down to narrative business. The maid from the doctor’s house, Hilda (Eleonoora Kauhanen), duly goes missing from the woods. Signs of her flight and bear markings on a tree are found but she is nowhere to be seen. Rumours and fears of a man/maid-eating bear roaming the woods spread, but the pastor has another theory that he and Jussi set out to prove.To Cook a Bear is a slightly odd beast. It conjures a fine sense of the bleakness that lets suspicion and prejudice and dark myths flourish from the native legend that bears can be controlled or possessed by the souls of men. And it doesn’t romanticise the hardscrabble life led by the villagers, in which violence, whether that of nature or mankind, lurks constantly at the periphery, waiting to erupt. But the characters rarely become more than ciphers – or perhaps, as the struggles between justice and vengeance, rationality and religion, good and evil intensify, emblematic figures in a fable – which stops the whole thing truly coming to life.And then there are the many tonally jarring moments in which the pastor’s ability to discover clues and discern Hilda’s fate becomes almost risible. He stands looking at broken milk pots and clumps of hair in hay barns like a combined Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes – with Jussi a particularly unfortunate Hastings-cum-Watson (neither of whom were required to lick a mixture of blood spatter and the boss’s spit to agree that, yes, it was definitely dried blood at the crime scene), before announcing his latest deduction and pulling a body from a bog.The village elite are bent on proving that Hilda was killed by a bear, perhaps to protect the peace, perhaps to protect one of their own. The pastor is bent on proving otherwise, and the evidence so quickly stacks up in his favour that again the drama’s plausibility and the viewer’s patience are tested. At its best, To Cook a Bear is reminiscent of the adaptation a few years ago of Sarah Perry’s The Essex Serpent, with its evocation of the competing attractions and terrors offered by science and religion. At its worst, it’s more like Law & Order: Special Ursine Unit. Still, it does seem to offer the answer to that debated question: “Ladies, take the bear.”To Cook a Bear is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Likely inspired by New Age theories, he urged expectant mothers to dip in the ice-cold water of the Black Sea, commune with dolphins, and give birth underwater. In the “very near future,” he claimed, “a newborn child would be able to live in the ocean with a pod of dolphins and feed on dolphin milk”.The oddest thing about Charkovsky was not so much his theory, but its remarkable resilience within both Soviet and western culture, as Justin Gregg sets out in his illuminating and lively new book. Gregg’s work is both a dissection and an ode to the irresistible allure of anthropomorphism, our tendency to apply human characteristics to non-humans, whether animals, objects, AI, or God. An expert on animal cognition who also teaches improv, Gregg deftly guides us through our alternately charming, destructive and wrong-headed fantasies about everything from marine mammals to our iPhones.A guiding spirit of this book is 17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon: “Human understanding,” he wrote, “is like a false mirror which receives light irregularly, then distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.” And how distorted and discoloured is this mirror, less faithful reflection of a dolphin, dog or computer, than a warped looking-glass at a carnival.Anthropomorphism has long been a dirty word amongst those who study animal behaviour, but Gregg sees it as a positive forceGregg introduces us to dog owners who insert “neuticles”, prosthetic testicular implants, into their neutered pet to relieve them of the shame of castration. This is a purely Freudian drama; the UK’s Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons’ line is that silicone implants offer no benefit to a dog whatsoever. I scoffed at these passages, until Gregg moved on to our assumptions about cats, where I have more skin in the game. So enmeshed is my own cat within my family’s psychodrama that Gregg’s gentle questioning of the realities of feline cognition left me unmoored. We are all, one way or another, clinging to the anthropomorphism game, imagining our pets’ inner thoughts, naming our cars, gendering God; if Charkovsky was deranged, it was only a question of degree.Anthropomorphism has long been a dirty word among those who study animal behaviour, but Gregg sees it as a positive force if used reflectively. The late primatologist Jane Goodall, for instance, urged its judicious use. “Just because you feel that an animal has a humanlike characteristic you cannot assume that is the case,” she argued. “Intuition alone is not enough – but it is a wonderful basis for further questioning, testing, and ultimately proving yourself right or wrong.”Some of Gregg’s case studies point in the other direction, showing how our projections cause catastrophe. In 1977, Nippon Animation released Rascal Racoon, an anime TV series that depicted a young boy’s idealised relationship with a raccoon in the American midwest. The series prompted the Japanese to import thousands of raccoons as pets, not knowing that adults can bite and, when bored, will easily tear up a small flat. Nearly 50 years on, there are few raccoon pets left, but many living in the countryside, feasting freely on native species like salamanders and crayfish.I valued this book most when it touched on Gregg’s area of expertise, non-human cognition. His stories repeatedly surprised and enlightened me, overturning my assumptions about other species, particularly reptiles. He cites research into crocodilians which demonstrates their capacity for play and social relationships; through subtle shifts in perspective and focus one could reimagine these staple villains of wildlife documentaries as playful, albeit from the safety of dry land.When in doubt as to whether a non-human animal possesses consciousness, Gregg urges a kind of Pascalian logic: better to assume a spider can feel suffering rather than deny it and risk harm. He draws a firm line between animals and the large language models that power tools like ChatGPT – the latter cannot be said to possess anything resembling consciousness, which is biologically rooted. (Given this position, I might gently question his repeated use of “hard wired” in relation to the human brain; as Siri Hustvedt has noted, such metaphors do not help us understand how our minds are different from machines.)It’s a strange irony that, as we discover more about the workings of other minds, our tendency to cast our dreams on to them does not diminish. For Gregg, anthropomorphism is a function of separation (it makes little sense, he argues, to invoke anthropomorphism in relation to some indigenous cultures where wild animals and humans are regarded as being of the same blood). If separation can be measured by the diminishment of wild species, or the hours we spend online and alone, then truly ours is the age of anthropomorphism. Charkovsky has not yet had his day in the sun.Humanish: How Anthropomorphism Makes Us Smart, Weird and Delusional by Justin Gregg is published by Oneworld (£18.99).

Screenwriter Rowan Joffe adapts the 2014 novel by Lawrence Osborne, whose title is ironic. He would not have these problems if he really was a small player. He is a big player and a big loser, although his smallness comes through in other ways.Colin Farrell plays a professional gambler who styles himself “Lord Doyle”, adrift in the Chinese gambling mecca of Macau, the Asian Vegas; he is a despised “gweilo” or foreign ghost. Farrell shows us a seedy guy with an outrageously spivvy moustache and a flop sweat, running up a massive bill at the kind of five-star establishment which tolerates this sort of thing on the tacit understanding that the guest will bet and lose massively at the hotel casino. Doyle never lets the staff in to clean his room so wakes up hungover every morning in an accumulating chaos.One night, while waiting for his unlucky streak to end at the baccarat table, Doyle encounters the coolly charismatic Dao Ming (Fala Chen), one of the unofficial “brokers” or moneylenders who haunt the tables. Their transaction is calamitous, and yet Doyle prevents Dao Ming from being beaten up by the widow of a gambler she has driven to suicide. They become friends, or even spiritual lovers, an affair between two phantoms – but in having a certain mysterious number, Doyle has – ambiguously – been given the means of his own redemption or destruction, forced to confront his own destiny as a “hungry ghost”, always gobbling and never sated.It is an elegant and intriguing contrivance, althoughTilda Swintonhas a frankly preposterous part as Betty, a cartoony woman who is pursuing Doyle and knows his terrible secret back in the UK; her character and plot-purpose are neither convincing in any realist sense or particularly funny. Perhaps it would have been better to develop Dao Ming’s persona instead.Berger and his cinematographer James Friend charge the screen with florid panoramas ofMacauand its hazy waterfront, and also with exotic, sinister interiors; the world of the hotels, with their synthesised grandeur and cavernous spaces where anonymity is liberating and oppressive. It’s a movie of big moods and grand gestures, undercut by the banal inevitability of losing.Ballad of a Small Player is in cinemas from 17 October and on Netflix from 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsColin FarrellTilda SwintonChinaMacaureviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s sunny, sweet and wholesome; a crafting bonanza packed with kitty catchphrases like “pawesome!” and “ab-so-cat-a-loutely”. The series’ super-likable star Laila Lockhart Kraner plays Gabby, a girl who shrinks down to become a tiny cartoon version of herself to play in her doll’s house.The movie comes just in time for Lockhart Kraner, who is 17 and won’t be able to pull off playing with doll’s houses for much longer. (The ending of the film gives a strong hint where the producers might be taking their franchise in the post-Lockhart Kraner future). It begins with Gabby visiting her grandma (Gloria Estefan), taking along her doll’s house and its inhabitants, including magical Kitty Fairy who cries sprinkles as tears.The film, like the TV show, does not really exist for adults; there are no winks in the script or clever one-liners. Though what it does have isKristen Wiigchannelling sad Cruella as the film’s cat lady villain Vera, the CEO of a cat litter empire. Vera is the ultimate cat lady, who dresses her grumpy hairless Siamese in mini-me matching outfits. She’s not evil as such: just a grownup who has forgotten how to use her imagination. Vera doesn’t want to play with Gabby’s doll’s house, she wants to display it as a collectible.The plot shamelessly dips into the world of Toy Story, which did not bother the two eight-year-olds I watched it with in the slightest. They shrieked with glee, and took it very seriously when Gabby broke the fourth wall to ask her friends in the audience to hold hands to help her.

The legendary singer Makeba was known as Mama Africa, and the Empress of African Song; but she also hung out in Greenwich Village with Miles Davis and Duke Ellington. She was a teenager sent out to work to support her family in Johannesburg who later became a diplomat for Ghana, then Guinea’s official delegate to the UN. An outspoken anti-apartheid activist, she was the wife of a Black Panther. And her rich life and legacy are the inspiration for choreographer Seutin’s latest work, Mimi’s Shebeen, about to get its UK premiere.Mimi’s Shebeen blends dance, live music and spoken word in a piece of theatre that’s no straightforward biodrama but draws on Makeba’s history, particularly her story of exile: after moving to New York in 1959 Makeba was barred from SouthAfricafor 30 years because of her anti-apartheid stance. She was later banned from the US after marrying the Black Panther activist Stokely Carmichael. The show comes across like a ritual of remembrance, a deconstructed funeral – part eulogy, part celebration, part provocation – with the fabulous South African singer Tutu Puoane at the centre bringing Makeba’s songs to vibrant life.View image in fullscreenPower and poise … Mimi’s Shebeen.Photograph: Danny WillemsIn South Africa, a shebeen is an under-the-radar gathering place for home-brewed liquor and lively conversation, usually presided over by a shebeen queen. Makeba’s mother Christina was a shebeen queen who was arrested for illegally brewing alcohol when Makeba was 18 days old. Unable to pay the fine, Christina went to prison for six months, taking her baby with her, which is how Miriam’s eventful life began – just one of the things Seutin discovered when she began researching Makeba’s life. “So many stories!” says Seutin, when we meet atKVS theatrein Brussels after a performance of the show. Seutin’s father is Belgian and she mainly grew up there before moving to study and work in the UK, where she founded her company Vocab Dance. Her South African mother would sing Makeba’s songs, such as Pata Pata and Malaika, when Seutin was a child, and dance to them in the living room.View image in fullscreenSongs of freedom … Miriam Makeba performs at Wembley Stadium in 1988.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsA decade ago, Seutin’s mother had cancer and was in hospital in London. “I stopped working for three months to take care of her and she was always requesting Miriam Makeba. She was so happy when we were singing together,” Seutin remembers. “I had so much time to kill at the hospital so I started researching.” As well as reading about Makeba’s triumphant return to South Africa in 1990, after the release of Nelson Mandela (whom she had met when he was a young lawyer in the 1950s), Seutin discovered that Makeba had been a breast cancer survivor in her teens, that Makeba’s daughter Bongi died in childbirth in 1985, and that because of her exile she hadn’t been able to attend her own mother’s funeral. “You see people and you look at their success and you forget that they are struggling like anyone else,” says Seutin.All these thoughts went into the creation of the show (first staged in Brussels in 2023). Thankfully, Seutin’s mother’s treatment was successful, but the idea for the piece was to celebrate “death, life and mourning”. Within that, Seutin pulls out threads of Makeba’s biography like flashbacks, and nods more broadly to the theme of displacement and dispossession today. Although it’s not overt in the show, Seutin had in mind a second protagonist, a modern-day Miriam who is a migrant. “And we gather as these alter egos of characters connected to Miriam Makeba to welcome this young migrant.”View image in fullscreenRhythms of exile … musicians in Mimi’s Shebeen.Photograph: Danny WillemsIn the performance, rather than being intoxicated by the shebeen’s home-brew, the multi-talented dancers appear possessed by rhythm, in synthesis with the musicians on stage. Seutin’s choreography includes multiple styles of movement she has absorbed over the years, including from Rwanda, South Africa and Senegal (from 2020-24, she was co-artistic director ofSenegal’s Ecole des Sables, the centre for traditional and contemporary African dance), plus the international cast’s own vocabularies, including street styles like krump.View image in fullscreenA celebration of resilience … Alesandra Seutin.Photograph: Mascha TielemansSeutin was surprised to find that some of the younger, non-South Africans in the cast didn’t already know about the singer. (Makebadied in 2008after having a heart attack on stage in Italy.) Why should younger generations learn about Mama Africa? “I think she would inspire young people to stand for what they are, speaking the truth,” says Seutin. “But she did it very gracefully. She’d say something poignant and then sing a beautiful song.” Seutin wanted to take the same approach in this work. “We see dancing and hear beautiful songs, an element of entertainment, but intertwined with strong messages and moments that hit. That’s what I admire about Miriam. Because if you are shouting too much, people won’t listen. They back away. But she did it in a way that you would receive it, and hear it, but still be graced by her talent.”Mimi’s Shebeen is atSadler’s Wells East, London, 22-24 OctoberLyndsey Winship’s trip to Belgium was provided by Sadler’s WellsExplore more on these topicsStageDanceTheatreSouth AfricaSadler's WellsAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

While that scorching drama stress-tested a secondary school’s sisterhood, Lifers concerns a similarly precarious brotherhood of older men navigating the corridors of their own institution. Lenny (Peter Wight), Baxter (Ricky Fearon) and Norton (Sam Cox) are long-term prisoners who we first meet playing cards. As their game progresses, it becomes clear that beneath the repartee each has their own strategy for survival and Lenny’s failing memory leaves him vulnerable to the other two.They form an intriguing trio, and are convincingly performed, although the play could dig deeper into Baxter and Norton’s contradictory behaviour to their friend as Lenny is exploited and ultimately betrayed. More compelling is the relationship between Lenny and a young prison officer, Mark (James Backway), who adopts the role of his carer. That’s not in his job description, warns his colleague Sonya (Mona Goodwin), who draws a distinction between “duty of care” and “duty to care”. Prisons are there to protect the public but how, the play asks, can their inmates and staff be better protected?Placey reveals a dysfunctional system where small kindnesses can be perceived not just as weakness but as professional transgression: witness Mark’s nervous glances to make sure no one is watching as he helps Lenny tie his shoes. The older man confuses him for his estranged son and Backway later doubles in that role, in a denouement exploring how violence, trauma and constraints of masculinity are passed down the generations. That scene is not quite acrid enough and the effects of Lenny and Mark’s own separation, too, need extra emotional charge but throughout Wight excels at swinging between affability and the anger caused by his confusion.View image in fullscreenAffability to anger … Peter Wight as Lenny in Lifers.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianTightly directed by Esther Baker forSynergy Theatre Project, which creates work in prisons and theatres, the production wears its thorough research lightly. Uncommonly, it is not didactic and neither patronises the audience nor tells us how to judge the characters, even when distressing actions are revealed.Katy McPhee’s spartan, greyscale set reinforces the notion of a Prison Service stripped of resources and dogged by logjams, perilous waiting times for medical attention and staff burnout as officers struggle to separate their private and professional lives.In dialogue peppered with colourful comedy, Placey has his characters retell the same stories. At first it conveys a sense of mundanity but as the distinction between memory and invention is blurred, there is a sense of stories clung to as personal comforts akin to the special pillow Baxter waits months to receive.Its flashpoints could be sharper but the play authentically captures its setting and asks knotty questions about therising number of older prisonersand about the state of the nation as well as its institutions.AtSouthwark Playhouse Borough, London, until 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePrisons and probationSouthwark PlayhouseMenreviewsShareReuse this content"

She had been abducted by the group months earlier and her court testimony told of how she was locked in a closet and raped during captivity.This memory play traces the fallout of such a case through a fictional encounter between heiress Holly (Abigail Cruttenden) and the attorney Robert (Nathaniel Parker) who lost her case.They meet many decades after the event. Robert has become a celebrity lawyer in California and his life has been upended by allegations of sexual misconduct. He invites Holly, now fully rehabilitated into high society, to his apartment in hope she might speak out on his behalf. The ironies could not be greater, given the doubt he cast back in 1978 over her account of rape. “How things change,” says Holly. “Forty years ago, it was sex. Now it’s rape.”It begins in 2017, a few months before the allegations of sexual assault made against Harvey Weinstein, though this is not spelled out. The toxic inheritance of the 1970s is revisited from our post #MeToo perspective. The subject matter is explored with gripping tension, although some of the complexities of Hearst’s case are flattened; there is no discussion of coercion or brainwashing, as there was around her trial. But all the issues are there, and the drama too, in abundance.View image in fullscreenArtful … The cast of Ragdoll at Jermyn Street theatre.Photograph: Natasha Ketel/Alex BrennerAt heart this is a two-hander played out as a four-hander, with younger versions of both characters (Katie Matsell as the heiress and Ben Lamb as the lawyer) enacting flashbacks. Under the artful direction of Josh Seymour, the older characters turn to their younger selves and begin interacting with them, as if the past has turned to flesh and blood. It gives the play an audacious theatricality which works with surprising subtlety.Neither Holly nor Robert are particularly likable: he is simply odious, she is self-regarding and entitled. But her privilege is part of the genius of this play: it still renders her powerless, despite her powerful family.The play is best in combative mode and does not quite know how to finish but that doesn’t matter. Moar’s dialogue is so deft and sparkling, you could listen on and on. Her debut play,Farm Hall, about Germany’s nuclear programme in 1945, premiered at this theatre and found greater life in a West End transfer. This deserves to do the same.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreJermyn Street Theatre#MeToo movementreviewsShareReuse this content"

The American artist’s first proper London exhibition is a splodgy, orgiastic celebration of her material, but there are some big messages smuggled through if you can scratch your way towards them.Schutz’s approach – which has seen her lauded as one of the most important figurative artists of her generation – is all about surface, brush strokes, colour and materiality. It’s painting for painters, real high-level art-nerd stuff. If you get your kicks losing yourself in layers of pigment and shadow, there’s enough here to keep you going for a while. But it’s Schutz’s grotesque, surreal, cartoony, metaphorical imagery that really makes the paintings tick.The works in the first gallery are full of giant-headed cyclopses and baying crowds. In one, a group of figures stomps senselessly towards something off canvas, brandishing fists and leaving a trail of trash in their wake. In another, a figure is given a huge mask in some bizarre initiation ritual in front of a horde of ugly supporters. It’s not hard to read any of this as political, as commentary on the state of the US, on how society is divided and angry, and mob mentality is turning everything to rubbish.View image in fullscreenThe Kiss by Dana Schutz.Photograph: Kerry McFate/© Dana Schutz. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery, David Zwirner and Contemporary Fine Arts, BerlinIn the other gallery space, Schutz seems to shift her focus to the people in power, rather than the crowds that follow them. Shadowy figures stuff their mouths with grapes and steak in a sombre dining room; a cardinal and a man in green recline in golden chairs – while in other works a couple console each other in a landscape filled with corpses, and a woman, maybe Schutz herself, lies naked, forlorn and powerless in bed.This is ultradense, thickly layered stuff, covered in allusions. There’s the dreamy surreal symbolism ofOdilon Redon, the fleshy pink cartoonishness ofPhilip Guston, the carnival grotesqueries ofJames Ensor, the big-headed weirdness ofPaul McCarthy. There are riffs on the history of painting, countless nods to pop culture (I am almost 100% sure that one painting is a portrait of Handsome Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants). You could spend hours spotting all the bits of Cézanne and David with which she’s littered the works.Painting this dense, complex and allegorical leaves itself open to interpretation. I feel as if I’m being quizzed on the symbolism of a Titian but, for my money, there are two relatively clear narratives: the people in power, and the crowds that they bait.View image in fullscreenThe Example by Dana Schutz.Photograph: Stephen Arnold/© Dana Schutz. Courtesy the artist, Thomas Dane Gallery, David Zwirner and Contemporary Fine Arts, BerlinAnd Schutz should know about that. Back in 2017, her painting Open Casket – a semi-abstracted depiction of the corpse of Emmett Till, a black teenager who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955 – caused untold controversy when it was shown at the Whitney Biennial in New York. She was accused of exploiting black death for her own gain. A protester picketed the painting daily, and others called for it to be destroyed. A white artist painting – arguably with great sympathy – a scene of black pain was the biggest story of the biennial. It was the peak of the late 2010s culture wars, a time that saw people turning on each other even if they were on the same side. Looking back now, in a world more divided, less nuanced and angrier than ever, it feels almost quaint that people had the time to get angry at this heartfelt, sorrowful painting.It could have ruined her career, and Schutz probably wants to move on. But everything she’s done since exists in its shadow. She inevitably came out of that experience a changed artist. But what hasn’t changed is how good she is, how she still engages in brilliant, sickly, gloopy and deeply political painting at the highest level.Dana Schutz: One Big Animal is at Thomas Dane, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

From world-renowned jersey royal new potatoes to scallops sweeter and more tender than I’ve tasted anywhere, Jersey’s bounty is second to none. What excites me most, though, is how local farmers and producers are embracing regenerative agriculture, and in doing so reimagining the island’s food future with creativity and care. At the heart of that movement isRegen Gathering, a visionary festival that brings together farmers, chefs and food lovers to explore what Jersey’s foodtopia could look like.Last month, I was lucky enough to host a talk at the event, and cook a welcome dinner for all the speakers, alongside Regen’s inspiring founder, India Hamilton. Of course, scallops had to be on my menu, because they’re Jersey at its finest: delicate, plump and singing of the sea.Scallops seem to me the ultimate symbol of Jersey’s food future: sweet, plump and regenerative by nature, filtering and cleaning the sea while helping to build coastal habitats. Both farmed and, importantly, diver-caught, they’re one of the most sustainable proteins we can eat. Yet even Hamilton, who was raised on the island from the age of five, doesn’t eat the roes – a common affliction, I fear. All the more reason to champion these coral-pink morsels, which are far too delicious to discard. Whipped into butter, they become pure luxury: melt over scallops, stirr into risotto or simply spread on warm bread.They can be a bit pricey, though, so I’ve devised this recipe to turn just one scallop into an impressive starter (or three into a satiating main course) and, by whipping their roe into smoky paprika butter and roasting them in their shells with cherry tomatoes and garlic, potential waste becomes a luxury.That same spirit of transformation is at the heart of Regen Gathering, which, in partnership withFarm Jersey, has launched theRegen Food System Prize, offering £20,000 to support food pioneers with brand support, mentorship and access to the Co-op marketplace. Judged by some of my food heroes,Abby Rose (Farmerama), Josiah Meldrum (Hodmedod’s) and Patrick Holden (Sustainable Food Trust), the prize will be awarded at theJersey Farming Conferencein November. It’s about backing ideas that will help our food systems thrive, from soil to sea, and I can’t think of a more exciting place for that conversation to begin than Jersey.Scallops roasted in roe butter with cherry tomatoes and garlicServes6 as a starter or 2 as a main6 roe-on scallops in the half-shell18 cherry tomatoes, halved6 garlic cloves, crushed3 fresh red chillies(eg, jalapeño), halved lengthways, or 1 pinch chilli flakes, or to taste (optional)50g unsalted butter1 tsp smoked or sweet paprikaSea salt andblack pepper, to tasteLemon wedges, to serveA little samphire, agretti or 6 small gherkin slices, to garnish (optional)Clean the scallops, removing the roe from each and leaving the rest of the scallop fixed to the half-shell (ask the fishmonger to do this for you, if need be).

Divide the butter between the half-shells, making sure each scallop is well covered in the butter.Heat the grill until it’s scorching hot, then put the scallops under the heat for six to eight minutes, until blistered and bubbling.

Often relegated to less exciting regions of the fruit bowl, they actually come in a dizzying array of varieties – sharp, sweet, floral, crisp – and each with their own quirks. And now is the time to celebrate apples, so this week I’m giving them the attention they deserve in a no-bake toffee apple pie (banoffee’s autumn cousin) and a soft, cinnamon-spiced crumb cake.Toffee apple pie (pictured top)You will need a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin.Prep10 minCook1 hr 10 minChill2 hr+Serves8-10For the case275g digestive biscuits¼ tsp fine sea salt1 tsp ground cinnamon140g unsalted butter,meltedFor the caramelised apples500g apples, I used braeburn, but pink lady work well, too70gcaster sugar30gbutter1 tsp lemon juiceFor the sour cream whip50g sour cream250ml double cream25g caster sugarTo assemble397g tindulce de leche(I used Carnation)25g roasted hazelnuts,roughly choppedFor the biscuit base, blitz or bash the digestives into fine crumbs. Mix in the salt and cinnamon, then pour in the melted butter and mix well until it has the texture of very wet sand and clumps together when you give it a gentle squeeze. Press evenly into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin (put a disc of baking paper on the base for an easier release later), starting with the edges and working your way into the base. Put the tin in the fridge to firm up.Meanwhile, peel and core the apples, then cut them into even slices, about 1cm wide (you should have about 400g). In a low, wide frying pan, add the caster sugar and heat over a medium-high heat until it starts to melt, caramelise, and even burn in places – three to four minutes. Add the butter and apples, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture come to a bubble. Lower the heat, then simmer the apples in the juices for about 10 minutes, or until tender. (Depending on the variety, you might get a mixture of mushier and firmer pieces.) Stir in the lemon juice, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.To assemble, beat the dulce de leche until smooth, then spread evenly over the biscuit base. Arrange the apple slices (avoiding the juices) on top in slightly overlapping concentric circles and in a single layer. Reserve the apple caramel juices for finishing the tart.Whip all the ingredients for the sour cream whip together until you get soft peaks. Pile the cream on top of the apples, giving it a pleasing swoop. Arrange the hazelnuts on top, then finish with drizzles of the caramelised apple juices. Chill for two to three hours before serving.Apple crumb loafView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s apple crumb loaf.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 minServes6-8You will need a 21.5cm x 11.5cm x 6cm loaf pan.For the cake2medium-sized eating apples1½tspcinnamon150gunsalted butter75gcaster sugar100glight brown sugar2eggs,about 100g1 tsp vanilla extract150gplain flour50gwholemeal flour1 tspbicarbonate of soda (6g)¼ tsp fine saltFor the crumb40g light brown sugar60gplain flourA pinch of salt30goats40gbutter,meltedHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Halve and core one apple (no need to peel), then cut it into 2mm slices (you should get about 120-130g). Toss with the cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Grate the other apple on the coarse side of a box grater – you need about 100g.For the cake, cream the butter and sugars for about two minutes until slightly pale and about one and a half times their original volume. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition, followed by the grated apple and vanilla extract. Stir through the dry ingredients to form a batter.Line the loaf tin with baking paper, then spoon in about 80% of the mixture. Arrange the thinly sliced cinnamon apples on top in overlapping layers, then top with the remaining mixture, smoothing the top. Bake for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the crumb. Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl (you can use the cinnamon apple bowl for less washing up!), then pour in the melted butter and mix again until a crumb forms.Carefully remove the cake from the oven and sprinkle the oat crumb all over the top. Return to the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the tin before serving.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.
