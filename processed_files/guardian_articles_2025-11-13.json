The next Dennis Potter might be out there somewhere … but they certainly aren’t hereRachel AroestiThu 13 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 19.14 ESTShareFantastic news! Channel 5 has revived the BBC’s wildly influential and much romanticised drama strand Play for Today. Well, it seemed like fantastic news until it became clear that the broadcaster has merely copied the name and necessarily broad premise – a collection of standalone dramas by different, often unestablished, writers and directors – and duly trumpeted a return for the trailblazing television format.Trading on this cherished cultural heritage with no connection to the original is a brazen move. Will the programmes themselves be as audacious? The BBC’s Play for Today, which concluded 41 years ago, had a radical spirit, pushing the boundaries of contemporary taste and confronting the viewer with topics rarely seen on TV at the time.When the reboot was announced, Channel 5’s chief content officer, Ben Frow, said the series would “reflect some of the thornier issues affecting our audience”. Perhaps that was the first sign that this would not be your mother’s – or indeed grandmother’s – Play for Today. The four new programmes do deal with thorny issues, as all dramas surely must, but they are common ones. These TV plays are relatable and largely run-of-the-mill. What they are not – and what the strand is always remembered as being – is fresh, inventive or shocking.The first instalment, Never Too Late, cleaves least tightly to the format’s legacy. It centres on Cynthia, whose daughter sends her to a retirement village after she has a second fall. Played with outsize energy by Anita Dobson, Cynthia plots her escape, but her feelings are complicated by her new neighbour: ex-boyfriend and former rock star Frank (Nigel Havers, effortlessly charming as always). What follows, unfortunately, is a banal pantomime – it even concludes with a big old singsong – that is maddeningly predictable in plot and naffly daytime soap-esque in presentation.Never Too Late has one redeeming quality: it gives its seventysomething protagonist full personhood. Cynthia is ill-tempered, vain and generally unlikable – but she is far from two-dimensional (other residents including the odd birdwatcher, the unsmiling morris dancer and daffy friend aren’t so lucky). This is important, especially once you realise who this series is aimed at. Three of the four instalments focus on retirees: rather than trying to upend the status quo, it’s clear this new Play for Today is determined to court the older viewer. It’s probably wise:according to a 2024 Ofcom report, the over-65s watch more live TV than everyone under 54 put together.Big Winners targets the same demographic – albeit with far greater dramatic heft. Written by Martha Watson Allpress, it stars Sue Johnston as Edith, a woman trapped in a stultifying marriage in suburbia with her emotionally unavailable husband Arthur, played by writer and actor Paul Copley (whose 1979 motorcycle mechanic drama Pillion has the dubious honour of being the only episode of Play for Today never broadcast). Moments after Arthur discovers he’s won the lottery, Edith asks for a divorce. What follows is a devastating autopsy of their relationship, bolstered by an exceptional performance from Copley and a scarily bleak ending.Coming down slightly in age is A Knock at the Door. Alan Davies is a hitherto household name comedian who lives handsomely off his prior success in a swish house – until a dishevelled man arrives on his doorstep claiming to have been mugged. This is where it becomes clear that Inside No 9 has spoiled us when it comes to one-off real-time thrillers. Unlike Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s horror-comedy anthology, this is not an exercise in ingenious wrongfooting: you can see the denouement coming a mile off.The only episode that doesn’t concern the over-50s is Special Measures, which sees Jessica Plummer (The Girl Before) play an overworked teacher who must shoulder responsibility for an entire department after her colleague quits on the day of an Ofsted inspection. The dialogue and direction is faultlessly naturalistic and Plummer is brilliant as a cool-headed, capable woman driven to despair. Yet, the chaos of this underfunded secondary school feels depressingly familiar.With my pragmatist’s hat on, I can appreciate that this is a clever, headline-grabbing pseudo-revival by a TV channel uninterested in culturally revolutionary material. I’m also aware that we should probably just be grateful for the arrival of four one-off dramas that aren’t about murders or the insalubrious affairs of the eye-wateringly wealthy. But what if we weren’t? What if we refused to lower our expectations and continued to search for the next Dennis Potter or Mike Leigh or Stephen Poliakoff, makers of distinctive, beautiful, thought-provoking, uncomfortable television? They are out there somewhere, but broadcasters will have to be willing to take far greater risks to get them on TV.Play for Today is on Channel 5 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

This feels like a government losing touch and escaping from dismal circumstances in the real world. The ricochets damaged the PM and Morgan McSweeney, whoever organised these orchestrated briefings. If the briefers are not “found” and fired, No 10 looks either weak or guilty.The health secretary shrugged it off with wit and agility in a host of interviews and left for Manchester to speak to the NHS Providers conference. There, he addressed grim-faced managers confronting the hardest of times. Resident (formerly junior) doctors go out on a five-day strike from 7am on Friday. Their timing aims at maximum disruption in what will be “one of thetoughest wintersour staff have ever faced” according to NHS England’s CEO, Jim Mackey. An exceptionally virulent flu strain has arrived early, with cases already several times higher than normal. Last month, flu hospitalisations were up74% week-on-week.The latestNHS figuresout this week show that in October 54,000 patients waited more than 12 hours for a bed in emergency departments, nearly 10% more than the same month last year. With the elective waiting list now at 7.39 million,Health Foundation analysishas suggested that on current trends, the government will fall just short of its headline pledge to restore the 18-week elective care standard by the end of this parliament. In the 49 days of strikes over the last two years,1.5m appointmentswere rescheduled across England.In their ballot, covering both their July action and this week’s, 90% of doctors voted in favour of striking, on a55% turnout. No one, including the health secretary, doubts they have deep grievances about their working lives in a system that damages the NHS and detaches young doctors from the hospitals where they briefly work. After hard student years, leading to debts of up to £100,000, they have to rotate between different specialist training posts around the country, never a part of the team where they work, always anxious about their next rapid placement, treated roughly, often goingwithout hot meals, chairs, beds or holidays.But Streeting has set about improvements. He has pledged toease the bottleneck by giving UK-trained doctors first choice of training places. The BMA resident doctors committee says some30,000 doctors apply for 10,000 places. But Streeting’s office says that now only 8% of UK-trained doctors who apply for a post fail to get one. That’s eight percentage points too many, but they’ve been promised that further reforms are on the way.Their pay claim is greeted with a lot less sympathy. As soon as he was appointed, Streeting settled generously with a22.3% riseover two years and anabove-inflation average of 5.4%this year, making an average increase of 28.9% across three years. The doctors got by far the most; nurses, midwives and physiotherapistsare offered 3.6%. The doctors ultimately wantanother 29%, to restore their pay to where it once was before the bankers’ crash. There is dispute over which measure of inflation should be used in the calculations, RPI or CPI, but either way the entire public sector has has had its pay ruinously diminished since 2008. Paul Nowak of the TUC says thatreal wages would be£217 a week morehad they kept rising at pre-2008 rates.The doctors have done better than others, which is why Streeting can’t and won’t give in. He’s no headbanger wanting to prove his worth fighting with unions; on the contrary, he has been eager to settle with them but has been snubbed by the BMA’s ungracious haste to strike. The committee hasrefused his requestto meet them.Under the Tory government, the public backed the striking doctors. Polls have nowswung the other way, with 51% against and 40% in support. Even so, 40% is still quite high, considering the widespread anxiety about waiting lists. But 51% currently say doctors shouldnever be allowed to strike, a contrast with attitudes to nurses,where 53% saythey should be permitted. But there is no general turning against trade unionism: attitudes towards trade unionsremain positive, by 33% to 28% negative.Slipping support for resident doctors may come fromhearing more about their pay, at £38,000 for beginners, rising to £109,000 as a first-year fully trained consultant, which reaches £145,000, with bonuses for some and private practice for others. Given these hard times, the cost of living and stagnant pay for most, these are not the most obvious candidates for public sympathy.I couldn’t find anyone to talk on the record, but I spoke to resident doctor “Martin” on Thursday between busy clinics. He will not be striking. He says he knows others who won’t either, because they’re worried about patient safety. He does think those starting out in training posts are badly treated, but that hospitals are now hurrying to improve conditions. Pay, he says, is less of an issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, after Squeeze’s 50th anniversary, they’re seeing the light of dayThu 13 Nov 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 13.00 ESTShareIn September 1974, when they were hopeful teenage unknowns in Deptford,Squeezecreated a concept album, Trixies, set in a fictional south London nightclub. Believing they had come up with a substantial work, they recorded the 10 tracks on a borrowed Revox tape machine and expected the world to fall at their feet. But nothing happened. “All our friends liked it,” says singer and lead guitarist Glenn Tilbrook, who turned 17 just before the recording. “But that was the only feedback we had.”The album was shelved, but less than five years later, the band began a run of classic hits, including Cool for Cats and Up the Junction, which had songwriting duo Tilbrook and fellow guitarist and vocalist Chris Difford hailed as heirs to Lennon and McCartney. Now, after recently celebrating 50 years as one of British pop’s best-loved bands, the pair have finally done their teenage vision justice. A fully rerecorded Trixies will be released next March. Taster track, Trixies Pt 1, arrives this week and suggests that all the Squeeze hallmarks of melody, romance and storytelling were there from the beginning, even if few people heard them.Difford, left, and Tilbrook at a festival in 1973.“When Chris and I met in 1973, he started giving me lyrics,” says Tilbrook. “We’d write eight or nine songs in a few days and just kept popping them out. We grew as songwriters at such a rate because we had nothing else to do. We weren’t getting gigs or getting signed. But somewhere in ourselves we had the ability to produce stuff of the highest quality from virtually the moment we met.”Back then, with Difford doing shifts at Ready Mixed Concrete and Tilbrook working in a hippy head shop, the sophistication of their songwriting wasn’t matched by their musicianship, which Tilbrook compares to “five-year-olds playing football”. Now, though, they can draw on years of experience to “get the best out of any song”. For Difford, revisiting their wide-eyed beginnings after the sort of success they always dreamed about has been emotional. “Extraordinary, really,” he says, “hearing the songs come back to life.”Much of Trixies was written in Tilbrook’s bedroom in his girlfriend Maxine Barker’s parents’ house. Difford, nearly three years his senior, also moved in downstairs. Difford remembers hearing his bandmate’s melodies “flowing down the staircase” after leaving lyrics for him on a breakfast tray.“One of the greatest things was the mystery of what was going to happen to my lyrics,” Difford says. “Then a cassette would arrive with maybe five, 10 songs.” Tilbrook remembers rehearsing Trixies with a lineup including his schoolfriend Jools Holland (who remained in the band until 1980) on keyboards, but the album never made it beyond a demo and the arrival of punk took them (now including drummer Gilson Lavis, who died last week aged 74) in a different direction.“We had to dumb ourselves down to fit in,” Tilbrook says, “which, admittedly, we did with relish.” Now, though, we can hear the band they were before: slightly softer and influenced by “all the great stuff that was happening”, such as David Bowie, Sparks and Stevie Wonder. “I hadn’t heard as much music then,” Tilbrook continues, “so we were picking from a much narrower field and processing it in our own way.”As a teenager, Difford had never been to clubs like Trixies, an establishment he created in his imagination. “Later, we did go to local pubs where villains were and felt the anxiety of that community,” he says. “But most of the songs came from dreaming and the excitement of being a young writer.”View image in fullscreenThe songwriting duo in 2025.Photograph: Dean ChalkleyTrixies is often darker than most of Squeeze’s output. In The Dancer, Difford writes with empathy about a nightclub performer who dances “with fists clenched down by her side”. The marvellous The Place We Call Mars opens with a bloody scene on a hospital floor.“I was influenced by Bowie performing the Jacques Brel songbook,” Difford says, “but I was probably feeling that darkness in my own life, as a young man.”Revisiting the songs after all these years, they have been amazed by how much the demos gave them to work with. However, producer Owen Biddle (also Squeeze bassist since 2020) brought new ears and suggested changing the order of the songs. “I thought: God, that’s it,” Tilbrook says.Squeeze review – slick pop perfection that refuses to show its ageRead moreSo far, only Hell on Earth and You Get the Feeling have been performed live, but – inspired by seeing Elton John perform his classic album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy from 1975 – they plan to tour the entire album.“I’m so proud of the little us that did the songs on Trixies,” Tilbrook says. “You can hear all our hopes and dreams.” Meanwhile, as prolific as they ever were, there’s another album of new Squeeze songs on the way. “Those little guys that wrote Trixies were on a journey,” says Difford. “The greatest thing is that we still are.”Trixies is released 6 March on BMG.

But are they actually good for you?In one study, researchersobservedthat 8.5% of Americans reported using massage for “overall health” in the 2022 National Health Interview Survey. However, definitions of health tend to vary widely, explains the study’s first author, Jeff Levin, an epidemiologist and distinguished professor at Baylor University. For instance, does it refer to physical health, mental health or both? That makes it tough to study, but may explain why it has such broad appeal, Levin explains.Research typically seeks to establish precise causal relationships. But the impact of massage seems to be holistic in nature, integrating physical, emotional and neurological effects, explains Niki Munk, licensed massage therapist, associate professor at Indiana University Indianapolis, and research director of the Massage Therapy Foundation.Do you grind your teeth at night? Here’s what to doRead moreWhile some perceive massage as a luxury, it hashistoricallybeen part of healthcare, notes Munk. It is increasingly embedded as a feature of hospital care because research and patient experiences corroborate its potential advantages.Experts say massage may benefit anyone regardless of their health status.Who can massage help?Dr Carla Kuon, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, was seeking an opioid-free way to ease patients’ pain. In 2017, inspired by UCSF’s pediatric bone marrow transplant massage program, she raised funds, then launched a similar service for adult patients the following year.A 2018studyon the adult service showed the massages were “quite beneficial for distress, pain, tension, anxiety, fatigue and improved sleep”, says Kuon, who is also a faculty member at the Osher Center for Integrative Health. Participants also reported an improved sense of wellness.According to Kuon, many studies show that pleasant touch creates a soothing effect, sending signals to the brain that you’re safe.“We all thrive on caring, compassionate touch,” says Kuon. “I think any person could benefit [from massage] because it releases natural endorphins that promote a sense of wellbeing and happiness.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’But, she also notes that those who might get the most out of it are “those who may not regularly experience healthy touch”. Examples include individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome or long Covid, who often experience reduced social interaction.Individuals “who have greater experiences of disability, pain and impairment are in a position to experience the larger effects”, agrees Munk.What are the physical benefits of massage?Massage is one of the techniques Rocco Caputo, a touch therapist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center, uses to help patients.“When patients come in, they’re always like: ‘You’re the massage guy, right?’” Caputo says. “Then you’re everybody’s favorite person.”Massage helps people re-establish a connection to their body, says Caputo. It puts people into aparasympathetic nervous state, which induces a state of calm. Recentresearchconducted in part at MSK found that massage helped advanced cancer patients with long-term pain reduction. One of the outcomes of this research is theImagine project, which aims to implement massage and acupuncture in cancer programs across the US.Some research shows benefits for those with chronic pain; in Munk’s newestpre-print paper, veterans who received massage therapy twice a week for 12 weeks experienced an improvement in pain severity compared with a control group. These benefits were maintained for a period of three months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study didn’t examine the mechanisms behind the improvement, but Munk suggests that factors such as loosening muscles, relaxation and improved sleep could explain the results.In anotherstudy, Munk found that after 10 massage sessions, patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in lower back pain. Participants aged 50 and older experienced the most significant change.Massage therapy can probably address many types of pain; early intervention might even prevent some cases from becoming chronic, Munk says. But some researchers, such as the authors of this 2024systematic review, argue there’s a need for more randomized controlled trials – viewed by some as the gold standard for measuring effectiveness – to assess how well it can treat pain.Causes for the physical effects of massage are still being explored. For example, Shane Phillips, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago,co-authored a paperdemonstrating that massage enhances blood flow and reduces muscle soreness after exercise. The study found that even people who had not exercised experienced improved vascular function, or the ability of blood vessels to regulate blood flow and pressure, after massage.One group of participants exercised with a leg press machine, then received leg massages. Testing shows that “blood flow in the arm was changed even though we were providing massage to the lower extremities,” says Phillips. This suggests massage may affect the entire body, not just a specific area.Were the results due to manual manipulation of the body or emotional responses to being touched? “That’s not really known – it may be some of both,” says Phillips.Are there emotional benefits to massage?It’s difficult to untangle the emotional and physical reactions people experience due to massage, says Kuon.Massage therapy can increase the release of endorphins, natural pain-relievers made by the body, she explains. A wealth ofresearchshows that positive, consensualtouchcan increase mental wellbeing and reduce anxiety and depression.Working as a massage therapist, Anne Weisman observed benefits for people living with HIV/Aids. In subsequentresearch, Weisman, who is an associate professor and director of Well-Being & Integrative Medicine at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, quantified these observations: participants self-reported a newfound awareness of their body that influenced motivation and resilience. One participant said “massage therapy reminded her of her human-ness”, recalls Weisman.You should act your age – at least when it comes to exercise. Here’s whyRead moreWeisman sees the effects of massage as “highly translatable” to different groups of people.How can you incorporate massage into your routine?The benefits of massage serve as a reminder of the power of touch overall, says Weisman. Massage is a simple yet effective intervention but is often overlooked, she explains.Professional massage may be inaccessible for some due to cost. But “some form of therapeutic touch” is essential, says Kuon. Even self-massage or afoot massagecan be beneficial.Caputo recommends incorporating massage techniques into self-care; he has created videos people can follow at home to help with ailments such asheadachesandhand pain. (The intended audience for the videos is children, but Caputo says anyone can use them.)Levin argues for framing massage as a mainstream health intervention. “When massage is described as an alternative medicine, whether it’s intended or not, there’s something kind of disparaging about it,” he says.Massage should be further embedded in the healthcare system, covered by health plans, says Munk. This way, massage can be “accessible to as many people as possible”, she says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It usually came at dawn, as the mosques sounded the first call to prayer. By the time he sat down for breakfast, it would fill the air around his home in Tadamon, a working-class district in the south-east of Damascus. The smell was hard to define. Whenever he noticed it, Abu Mohammed felt on edge. He had his suspicions about what it might be, but like so many Syrians who lived under the dictatorship ofBashar al-Assad, he knew to keep such thoughts to himself.Abu Mohammed, a retired engineer who asked to be identified only by his nickname, first noticed the smell in the winter of 2012, nearly two years after the start of the uprising against Assad. At the time, he was living in a modest flat in the heart of Tadamon with his wife and their five children. The house stood just off a busy road named Daboul Street. Before the fighting started, Abu Mohammed enjoyed sitting on his balcony after work, sipping his tea as he watched the yellow minicabs and honking motorbikes compete for space in the streets below.But by the time the smell became noticeable, these streets were largely deserted. The Assad regime had rolled out a network of checkpoints across the neighbourhood in an attempt to quell protests after the 2011 uprising. Hiding behind a curtain so he wouldn’t be seen, Abu Mohammed watched soldiers patrolling the streets. He also noticed white minibuses driving up and down Daboul Street. Whenever the minibuses passed by, he would hear gunfire later that day. Then, overnight, that same smell. One of his daughters, who was in her early teens at the time, remembers it, too. “It smelt like burning hair,” she recalled. “Or like a piece of meat that has been left in a pan until it melts.”Nearly a decade later, in April 2022,the Guardian published a videothat revealed the source of the smell. The footage carried a date tag from April 2013 and was geolocated to Tadamon. It showed two men in military fatigues next to a white minibus. One of the soldiers could be seen pulling a civilian, blindfolded, out of the van and dragging him towards a large pit filled with bodies and car tyres. The other stood by the edge of the pit with an assault rifle. Calmly, he pushed his victim into the pit and executed him as he fell on to the other victims. They did this time after time. When 41 people lay dead, the shooter took a jerrycan of fuel, poured it over the tyres and the bodies, and set the pit on fire with a burning rag attached to a wooden stick.The footage was part of a collection of videos leaked by a source inside Syria and obtained by two genocide scholars in Amsterdam, Annsar Shahhoud and Uğur Ümit Üngör. The researchers shared a selection of the material with the Guardian and submitted the rest to European war crime prosecutors. In total, the videos document the killing of 288 civilians by Assad’s forces,the academics concluded, including seven women and 12 children.One of the scholars, Shahhoud, managed to identify the main shooter seen in the video. His name is Amjad Youssef and he served as an officer in Branch 227 of the Assad regime’s military intelligence. Using a fake Facebook account in which she posed as a regime loyalist, Shahhoud sent him a friend request, gained his trust over several phone calls, and lured him into confessing his crimes. When she confronted him with the video, he replied: “I am proud of my deeds.”As long as Assad was still in power, no one in Tadamon dared to mention the video in public. According to Abu Mohammed, Youssef remained in the neighbourhood after the video was published, as if nothing had happened. “He would just drive up and down the street on his motorbike. No one would say anything.”But now that the dictator is gone, the people of Tadamon are breaking their silence. As they have begun to share their stories, it is becoming clear that the atrocities in the neighbourhood were far worse than initially reported – and involved many more perpetrators besides Youssef.Between March and August this year, I visited Tadamon multiple times and spoke with more than 20 residents. Abu Mohammed, a short elderly man with a soft smile, was one of the first people I met. As soon as he noticed me in the street, he grabbed my arm. “I stayed here throughout the war,” he said. “If you want to know what really happened here, follow me.”View image in fullscreenA military intelligence office later identified as Amjad Youssef.Photograph: Guardian VideoWe sat in the family living room, and Abu Mohammed’s wife served cardamom coffee and sweets as the father and daughter recalled the moment they first saw the video on social media. “We immediately made the connection,” the daughter said. “This was the gunfire we used to hear, and it explained the smell. We even recognised some of the victims. They were people we saw regularly on the streets.”The video captures only a fraction of the slaughter Assad’s forces unleashed upon Tadamon, Abu Mohammed said. To him and many other residents I spoke to, the killing of civilians in Tadamon was not a single event. For years, he said, he saw the minibuses drive up and down the street, sometimes as often as two or three times a week. The smell of burning bodies, he and his daughter recalled, kept returning, too, from the very end of 2012 until at least 2015. Random killings and arrests continued long after. Assad’s forces may have killed not hundreds of civilians in Tadamon, but thousands.Nearly a year after Assad’s fall, the people of Tadamon have seen very little justice for these crimes. While Youssef is widely rumoured to have fled the country, many other perpetrators are still in the neighbourhood. “We don’t feel safe,” an elderly man named Ghassan, who lost his brother in the massacres, told me. “I can walk down the street here and shake someone’s hand, and that same person might be the one who killed my brother.”Abu Mohammed took me on a tour of the neighbourhood. We started on Daboul Street, which divides the district into two parts. To its west is a labyrinth of narrow alleyways that still buzz with life. Here, children chase each other with toy guns, street vendors push wooden carts stacked with fresh fruit and neighbours argue with one another from their balconies. To its east lies a wasteland filled with piles of rubble and the ruins of bombed out apartment blocks.“This is where the smell came from,” Abu Mohammed said as he stepped into the ruined area. He took me to the spot near Daboul street where the executions were filmed. The children playing in the rubble began re-enacting the massacre as soon as they noticed me. “This is how he killed him!” one 10-year-old boy shouted, waving his imaginary rifle. “I saw it myself on YouTube.”“There are many more mass graves in this area,” Abu Mohammed said as he took me deeper into the wasteland, an area the size of more than 50 football fields. Inside one destroyed building, he showed me a shallow crater filled with human bones, including a skull, bits of a spine and smaller bones which may have belonged to children. As we stood there, some stray dogs howled in the distance. “Those dogs keep digging up bones,” the elderly man said. “That’s how many mass graves were found.”View image in fullscreenDestruction in Tadamon.Photograph: Ali Haj SuleimanOn the first floor of another building nearby, we saw a metal bar hanging from the ceiling of a room with pink walls covered in graffiti left by Assad’s forces. We spoke to a man holding his young son by the hand, who told us he used to live here until the regime took his house and turned it into a torture site. “They would hang people from that metal bar and cut their wrists,” he said. Many of the people killed here, Abu Mohammed said, were simply dumped in the wasteland below or stacked into empty buildings which were subsequently bombed. “That’s how they hid the evidence,” he said, pointing at the piles of rubble around him. Since there has been no effort yet to exhume this area, many relatives of the victims still have no idea what happened to their loved ones, let alone a grave to mourn them.As we returned to Daboul Street, Abu Mohammed showed me a last location which he said played a crucial part in the regime’s killing machine: a small mosque with a bullet-riddled minaret. The Othman bin Affan mosque stands on the border between the parts of Tadamon that are still intact and the rubble beyond. “This is where the minibuses drove to,” he said. “When I passed it one day in 2014 with my nine-year-old daughter, we saw piles of corpses lying outside.”The caretaker of the mosque is Naji, a slender elderly man with a long beard. He took me down to the basement, which he said was used as a torture site. Some bones still lay on the floor. “After the liberation we found a noose hanging from the ceiling,” the old man said, shaking his head. “How could they do such a thing in the house of God?”It was in front of this same mosque that Malek Moustafa first climbed on to the shoulders of his friend, on 25 April 2011, to demand the fall of the regime. The imam had called for a protest in solidarity with the people of Daraa, a city in the south ofSyria, where Assad’s security forces had tortured a group of young people for writing “freedom” and “down with the regime” on the walls of a school.“Something came out of me that day that never went back inside,” Moustafa, 43, told me in July, in a small one-room building in the heart of Tadamon, where he sat chain smoking red Gauloises. On that spring day in 2011, he had just turned 29. He was not particularly political nor religious. He spent many of his nights going out with his friends, who were not just Sunni Muslims like himself, but also Alawites, Christians, Druzes and Ismailis. “At the time, we didn’t care much what sect people belonged to,” he said.According to Moustafa, that sense of community across different sects was typical of the Tadamon of his childhood. Sometimes referred to as “little Syria”, the neighbourhood is home to practically all of Syria’s ethnic and religious groups. In Arabic, its name means “solidarity”, a reference to the welcome this district provided to Syrians displaced from the Golan Heights following Israel’s illegal occupation of the area in 1967.But that old solidarity was about to fracture. As Moustafa and other protesters gathered in front of the mosque in 2011, they were beaten up by a group of “shabiha”. This derogatory term, which literally translates as “ghosts”, refers to regime loyalists, mainly Alawites, who received money and favours from the intelligence services to crush dissent. One man who played a crucial role in mobilising the shabiha was a local Alawite, then in his mid-30s, who everyone in Tadamon still talks about. His real name is Fadi Ahmad, but he is better known as Fadi “Saqr” – Fadi the Falcon. According to Moustafa and other residents, Saqr set up so-called “popular committees”, groups of shabiha who were given weapons and salaries to attack the protesters. As the demonstrations continued, the activist was shocked to see some of his friends sign up.View image in fullscreenThe area near Daboul Street.Photograph: Hazar Yazji“These were the same people I used to play football with. One of them was one of my best friends, we even used to pray together,” said Moustafa. “But when I ran into him shortly after the revolution began, he asked me: ‘If we meet in battle one day, would you ever kill me?’ I answered: ‘Of course not.’ And then he said: ‘I would kill you.’”To organise themselves, Moustafa and his friends set up an activist network named the Tadamon Coordination Committee. After a regime sniper killed an 11-year-old boy at a demonstration, the activists also began to pick up arms, and were joined by defectors from the army and police. Street-to-street fighting followed, and by early 2012, much of Tadamon was under rebel control.The district was of key strategic importance. It is located next to crucial highways and serves as a gateway to Damascus’s southern countryside, where the rebels had become a serious force. To its west lies the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, another rebel stronghold. To prevent these fronts from linking up and halt the rebel advance from the south, the regime had to win Tadamon back. In the summer of 2012, it launched a major counteroffensive.Moustafa said he was not a fighter at the time, but was constantly with the rebels, helping provide them with weapons and medical supplies. In one heavy battle in early August, he was standing right behind his brother Bilal when a regime sniper killed him. Moustafa buried him close to the Othman bin Affan mosque, wrapped in a flag of the Syrian revolution which Bilal, a tailor, had sewn himself.Aside from the army, Assad also sent the shabiha into battle. From mid-2012, onwards, they were incorporated into a paramilitary force called the National Defence Force (NDF). Fadi Saqr helped set up the NDF in Tadamon and later became its commander in all of Damascus. He also joined the battlefield himself: in November 2012, he appeared in a regimepropaganda video on YouTube, surrounded by soldiers and a tank firing into Tadamon’s narrow alleyways.That same month, Moustafa was arrested. He and his friend Mohammed were on their way to Yarmouk, but ran into a checkpoint and were taken to Branch 235 of Assad’s military intelligence, one of the most notorious torture prisons in the country. “We were tortured there for eight months,” Moustafa said. “I could hear Mohammed’s screams echo through the building.”Moustafa was released in June 2013 as part of a prisoner swap. Since Tadamon was by now under regime control, he joined rebel forces south of the neighbourhood. He would remain there until 2018, when the rebels lost their territory and withdrew to the north-western province of Idlib.From a distance, Moustafa noticed black smoke rising above Tadamon and smelled something strange. “The men stationed on the frontline could even hear screaming and the sounds of bullets,” he said. “It didn’t make any sense to us, because the regime was in full control of that area. Only later it became clear to us that the regime was carrying out an ethnic cleansing against the Sunnis in the area.”Many civilians fled Tadamon, but Abu Mohammed decided to stay. Though a Sunni himself, he said his job as an engineer at a public utilities company and the ID that went with it gave him relative leeway at checkpoints. In any case, he had already had his share of displacement in life. “I was seven years old when Israel invaded my home on the Golan Heights,” he said. After that experience, he refused to become a refugee again.The neighbourhood was now ruled by a mix of NDF members, regular soldiers and members of Branch 227 of the military intelligence. Most of the NDF members, Abu Mohammed said, were the type of guys you would want to avoid even before the uprising. Some used to work as bouncers in casinos, others were drug dealers or had spent time in prison. To these men, the NDF was a route to the power they had long craved.During these years, Abu Mohammed’s family tried to stay at home as much as possible and the children were not allowed to play outside. But one of their teenage sons would sometimes go missing all day and only come back late in the evening. One time, his mother noticed a footprint on his back, as if he had been kicked. “He told me the NDF had taken him to build a dirt wall,” his mother told me in March. “He was very scared and didn’t dare to talk about it.”View image in fullscreenThe Damascus security directorate arrest three people responsible for the mass execution in Tadamon, February 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhen I returned to see Abu Mohammed’s family in late May, this son was visiting his family for Eid. He is now in his early 30s and it was his first time back in Tadamon since he fled Syria in 2015 and crossed the Mediterranean in a dinghy to reach Europe. Abu Mohammed and I were talking in the living room as he entered and sat down next to his father. When I explained the topic of our conversation, the young man looked nervous, but soon joined us and began to reveal his secret. To protect his identity, he asked to be identified as Ahmed.The paramilitaries of the NDF would take him in the morning, Ahmed said. Usually, they grabbed him at the bus stop on his way to high school. First, they would confiscate his phone and ID to make sure he couldn’t escape, take pictures or contact anyone. Then, they took him and other boys and young men they’d pulled off the streets to various parts of Tadamon and neighbouring districts, where they put them to work. Mostly, they were forced to fill sandbags at checkpoints or strip electricity cables from destroyed buildings so the copper inside could be sold. But on two occasions, the task was much more extreme.“We were forced to burn bodies,” Ahmed said softly. He paused and looked at his father, who kept his eyes fixed on his son. Ahmed took a slow breath and went on to describe exactly what happened.He was taken to the Othman bin Affan mosque just off Daboul Street, the one that was used as a torture facility. Outside on the street lay the bodies of at least 20 men and women. Many of them carried marks of severe beatings. “Our job,” Ahmed said, “was to take the bodies to the other side of the main street, where there were a lot of demolished buildings and rubble. There we would stack them inside an empty building, close it off, and set the place on fire. By the time I came home, I could smell the burning bodies.”As he listened to his son, Abu Mohammed nodded, as if things were finally falling into place. But when I asked him if he knew, he shook his head. “We would go crazy looking for him on those days,” he said, somewhat apologetically. “We understood something was going on, because he was extremely stressed when he came home, as if he was about to explode. But this is the first time I’ve heard all the details.”Ahmed looked uneasy. “I could not tell anyone,” he replied to his father. “The regime would have hurt us.” Even after escaping to Europe (he asked me not to name the country), he still didn’t dare to talk about his experiences. “People in Europe wouldn’t understand, anyway,” he said. “They helped us a lot, but to them, we are just refugees who fled some kind of war. They don’t know the details of what the regime did to Syrians.”When Assad was toppled on 8 December 2024, Malek Moustafa was on his way home. During his six years of displacement in Idlib, he said, he had spent much time fantasising about taking revenge against the shabiha who ruined his life. Now, the moment had come. “As a victorious man I thought to myself: I will kill the first shabih I see with my bare hands,” Moustafa said.But when he reached Tadamon the day after Assad’s fall, the opposite happened. As he walked through the bombed-out streets of his childhood, he bumped into a former regime fighter. “I first didn’t recognise him, but when I came closer, I saw it was someone who had joined the NDF from the start,” Moustafa said. “Before I could say anything, he said: Welcome, you hero, congratulations on winning the battle!”Moustafa froze for a moment. He knew that Ahmed al-Sharaa, the rebel commander and now Syria’s president, had ordered the rebels not to take revenge against any regime forces who surrendered. As he stood there considering what to do, something happened that he never believed was possible. “He hugged me, and I hugged him back,” the activist said with a smile. “We even kissed on the cheeks. I know it sounds strange, but in that moment, I just felt all the hatred and vengeance go away. I felt peace.”His story is no exception. By all accounts, no blood was shed in Tadamon in the wake of Assad’s fall. Former NDF members simply fled or put down their arms, and some were even seen tearing down Assad portraits. The rebels collected the former regime soldiers’ weapons, but stuck to Sharaa’s orders and refrained from revenge killings – to the surprise of many residents. “We expected them to storm our homes and slaughter us,” one 21-year-old Alawite shopkeeper named Hadi told me. “But that didn’t happen. Many people who used to be with the NDF even stayed in the neighbourhood. Nothing bad happened to them.”Shortly after the liberation, Moustafa and a few activist friends relaunched the work of the Tadamon Coordination Committee, the activist network founded in 2011. The small one-room building in which he received me serves as their office. On the wall hung a large banner with the group’s logo, a clutched fist in the colours of the Syrian revolution flag, today Syria’s official flag. “It hasn’t changed since 2011,” Moustafa said proudly. “I think 90% of our original members have been martyred, but our group has survived.”The activists distribute bread in the neighbourhood, run a Facebook group that is the go-to news source for many residents, and are working on a podcast series on the history and future of Tadamon. They also work closely with the local head of the new general security forces, who is an old friend from the early days of the revolution. When I visited the office, there was a pile of boxes with surveillance cameras lying on the floor which the group was about to install throughout the neighbourhood. “We are building a country now,” Moustafa said. “So we have to think with a government mentality rather than a revolution mentality.”So far, only a handful of people have been arrested for suspected involvement in the mass atrocities in Tadamon, media reports indicate. The local head of the general security forces did not provide me with an exact figure, but acknowledged “it’s a very small number in comparison to the crimes”. Moustafa argued this is understandable in a transitional period. “To achieve justice, we need to first get rid of the chaos,” he said. “These things take time.”But not everyone in Tadamon is so patient. Many residents find the apparent impunity of Assad’s former henchmen hard to stomach. Above all, their anger has become directed against one man: Fadi Saqr.Instead of facing trial for his role as an NDF commander, “the Falcon” has started working with Sharaa’s government. Last February, Saqr visited the neighbourhood under security escort, reportedly to help the government negotiate with other former regime loyalists about handing over weapons. The following day, hundreds of people in Tadamon took to the streets to protest at Saqr’s appearance and hung an effigy of him from a makeshift gallows. A week later, in what seemed an attempt to assuage public outrage,the authorities arrested three menaccused of involvement in atrocities in the neighbourhood.Following theanti-Alawite massacresalong the Syrian coast last March, the government established a so-called civil peace committee with the stated aim of “strengthening national unity”. Sources familiar with the committee’s activities told me Saqr has helped the government to disarm former regime affiliates, secured the release of government security personnel taken hostage along the Syrian coast, and used his contacts with former regime figures to strike deals on behalf of the new government.View image in fullscreenMalek Moustafa (centre) with fellow activists Ahmed al-Homsi (left) and Mohammed Katab (right) in the office of the Tadamon Coordination Committee.Photograph: Hazar YazjiLast June,it was reportedthat Saqr was involved in the release of previously detained former regime officers. In response to the public outrage that followed, the government gave apress conferencein which Hassan Soufan, a member of the civil peace committee, said the released officers did not commit violations against civilians and defended the committee’s collaboration with Saqr. “We understand the anger and the pain felt by the families of the martyrs and victims,” Soufan told reporters. “But in this phase of civil peace, we are sometimes forced to make decisions to avoid more violent explosions and to secure relative stability necessary for the coming stage.” Soufan hinted that the former NDF commander contributed to the liberation of Damascus by coordinating with Sharaa’s forces and he emphasised Saqr’s importance to “untangling knots, solving problems and facing dangers that the country is exposed to”. At the moment, Soufan indicated, there are no plans to prosecute Saqr or revoke his security protection.In a statement tothe New York Timesstraight after the press conference, Saqr himself denied responsibility for the Tadamon massacre, claiming he was appointed to lead the NDF only after the massacre seen in the April 2013 video. “If the ministry of interior had any evidence against me, I wouldn’t be working with them today,” he said. (The ministry of interior has been contacted for comment.)In Tadamon, the press conference and Saqr’s statement have only stoked public anger. “Whenever Fadi Saqr makes an appearance, it ignites this neighbourhood,” the local general security chief Abu Abdelrahman told me in his office last August. Though he made sure not to overtly criticise the government’s dealings with the former NDF boss, he also said that even if he was formally appointed to lead the militia after the April 2013 killings, “massacres happened after Fadi Saqr took charge”.After the relative calm in the wake of Assad’s fall, the security situation in Tadamon has deteriorated since Saqr made an appearance, Abdelrahman said. A few weeks after the press conference, a man accused of having worked as Saqr’s bodyguard was shot dead in the street, and several revenge killings against suspected former NDF members have followed. “We are in a hurry and are applying pressure on the government to punish the criminals,” he said. The longer the impunity lasts, he warned, the more difficult it becomes for him to dissuade locals from taking revenge. “Is it really natural for a person who sees his brother’s killer or sister’s rapist right in front of him not to act? He might be patient once, twice, multiple times. But in the end, he will act.”Today in Tadamon, there are simmering conflicts between neighbours that may still erupt into violence. In a dead end street close to Abu Mohammed’s house, I met one elderly couple who told me about their apprehensions. When the war started, they said, their four sons joined the NDF “out of fear”, but they were all killed by the regime’s own forces after conflicts with their superiors. “Now we have to take care of our grandchildren,” the woman said, as some of the young children ran around the living room.With Assad gone, the family has been receiving threats. On one occasion, a group of men stormed into the home and tore the portraits of the sons from the wall. “After that I burned all of my son’s portraits,” said the old woman, as she started to sob. “People used to be so nice to me. Before 8 December my neighbours kissed me on my forehead when they saw me. They called me the mother of the martyrs. But after 8 December, nobody talks to me.”Searching for the shadow man (Part 1)Read moreI told Abu Mohammed about my encounter with the woman. “The tears of a whore,” he said, bitterly. According to him and several other residents I interviewed, the old woman used to denounce her neighbours to the authorities and plundered the homes of those who got arrested or fled. “I would see her with a cart full of furniture when I left home in the morning,” said Abu Mohammed. “The family even ran a shop where they sold the booty. Nobody dared to ask where they got it from.”What will happen to this family now? Abu Mohammed showed me a Facebook post by a friend who lost his relatives in the massacres. “Why are they still in the neighbourhood?” the man had written. “Why are the security forces protecting them? If our martyrs are not considered part of the revolution […] we must act.” To leave no doubt as to what his aim is, the man included the family’s full address in his post.“People have vengeance in their hearts,” Abu Mohammed said as he put down his phone. “I personally still trust that President Sharaa will bring us justice, because he is one of us. But if he doesn’t, I’m sure that the men in the neighbourhood will take care of this.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer needs to raise his gameThu 13 Nov 2025 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 14.27 ESTShareSir Keir Starmer went to north Wales on Thursday to announce the building of a new nuclear power station. This is a significant policy event, with local and national implications. However, the prime minister did not spend much time in Wales promoting solutions to UK energy needs. Instead, he spent it trying to draw a line under the Labour leadershipbriefing row, telling reporters that No 10 had not, in fact, briefed against the health secretary’s ambitions earlier this week.As such, Sir Keir’s day was a microcosm of what his prime ministership has now become more generally. On the one hand, he wants his government to be doing, and to be seen to be doing, important things. On the other hand, he is unable to achieve this because of the way he – and to an extent the country more generally – now does politics and government.Sir Keir cannot change the culture of politics on his own, but he can do something about his own role in it. The plain fact is that he could run the centre of government far better than he does. If he did this, he might find that the country was in less despair about his government than it is, and that he was getting his messages across more successfully.Some of the problems in Downing Street are about individuals. The personal dynamics of any No 10 regime are hard to know well from outside. But it seems obvious that Sir Keir does not make good personnel choices, or stick with them. Perhaps he is too busy. Perhaps he is not really interested. But he needs to up his game, not do things slowly or by halves.He dithered about giving the key job of cabinet secretary to Chris Wormald. He made Sue Gray his chief of staff, then replaced her withMorgan McSweeney. He brought Darren Jones in from the Treasury as his chief secretary. His communications chiefs have chopped and changed. Political and policy advisers have come and gone. It is a mess.All premiers spend too much time abroad and on foreign affairs, where Sir Keir should delegate more, and too little talking to parliamentarians and listening to the public. Premiers also spend too much time doing media, which Sir Keir compounds by doing it poorly. But premiers cannot claim to be surprised when their political appointees, who tend to be party activists or politically ambitious, cross lines or become the story, as Mr McSweeney (likeDominic Cummingsbefore him) now has.The biggest issues, though, are structural. It would be good to think that Sir Keir read the Institute for Government’s March 2024reporton reforming the centre of government. His failure to grip these issues last July or since suggests he did not. The often abject experience of Labour’s time in office suggests IfG proposals like restructuring the roles of the Cabinet Office and No 10, and separating the jobs of cabinet secretary and civil service head, are now urgent.The political pre-eminence of prime ministers far outdistances the support available to them. As a result, everything currently suffers, and much is done badly or neglected. This is not Sir Keir’s fault alone. He is the victim of past failures as well as the author of present ones. But those who hoped Sir Keir might get a grip on the centre and take the machinery of government seriously have been disappointed. Sadly, the biggest loser from this failure is Sir Keir himself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”The BBC has been considering how to respond to the legal threat since Trump’s angry reaction to the editing of the programme.However, it is thought that the BBC has also been advised that it has a strong legal case. It remains to be seen how Trump will now respond.It comes after the BBC concluded there was no reason not to apologise more personally to President Trump, given Shah had already said sorry for the edit and described it as giving the impression “of a direct call for violent action”.The corporation is already reeling fromthe resignations of Davie and Turness, which followed thesplicing together of the Trump speech in an edition of Panoramalast year.The programme was broadcast a week before the US election. The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Concerns about the Panorama cut were raised in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in the summer. The memo drew on instances Prescott said showed a systemic bias at the BBC, which the corporation has denied.Some in the BBC argue the Panorama edit did not change the meaning of the speech significantly, but others disagree.Shah has since apologised, while Davie said responsibility had to be taken for errors revealed in the Prescott memo.It has been suggested Trump would file the case in a Florida court. Legal experts have questioned his chances of victory, given Florida’s liberal libel laws and the fact the Panorama episode was not available in the state.The broadcast was too long ago to take legal action in the UK. Trump would have to prove he was damaged by the programme.Since the Panorama edit was revealed, BBC’s Newsnightwas also accused of editing the same Trump speechin a way that made it appear he made a more explicit call for violent protest before the Capitol riots.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It did not appear that the edit alerted viewers to the cut.It spliced together a section of Trump’s speech on the day of the riots, in which he urged supporters to walk to the Capitol building, with a later segment of the address in which he urged them to “fight like hell”.A former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, criticised the BBC on air at the time for splicing together the footage. “Your video actually spliced together the presentation,” he said. “That line about ‘and we fight and fight like hell’ is actually later in the speech.”A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”On Thursday, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said his party had written to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, calling on him to demand that Trump “drop his ludicrous $1bn lawsuit against the BBC”. Trump has not yet filed a lawsuit, despite previous reports.In another post on X, Davey said Trump “wants to destroy the BBC” and urged people to join his campaign, calling on the corporation to “fairly balance its political news coverage all year round, not just at election time”.He also said the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who accused the BBC of being “infected with leftwing bias”, is “egging [Trump] on”.There have been reports that Reform has pulled out of a BBC documentary about the party because of the controversy over the edited speech.Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpTim DavienewsShareReuse this content"

They went on strike 11 times in 15 months between March 2023 and June 2024 but only once since, in July this year.Thousands of them will take part in what will be the 13th strike of their campaign, starting at 7am on Friday and running until 7am on Wednesday 19 November.Consultants now look likely to add to ministers’ already acute difficulties over NHS pay, the Guardian can reveal. The British Medical Association’s consultants committee has been in talks since September with the Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) about its demand for more than the 4% rise imposed on them for 2025/26. They believe their salaries should rise this year by 5.5% – a further 1.5% – given the importance of their work.But the consultants committee is frustrated at what BMA sources say is the lack of progress. They have given Wes Streeting, the health secretary, a deadline of 31 December to reach a deal for more money. Unless agreement is reached by then it plans to hold a ballot for industrial action in January and – if it gets the 50% turnout and 50% agreement required in law – start striking soon after.Strikes during the first half of 2026 by both the NHS’s main groups of medics in England would cause havoc and derail the government’s totemic pledge to “fix the NHS” by cutting treatment delays.One NHS leader warned that a potential series of walkouts by consultants – senior doctors – would be “a bitter pill” for already-embattled health service staff to swallow, especially during the winter.One BMA insider said: “The consultants committee has given its negotiators until 31 December to negotiate with Wes Streeting and his team for meaningful changes to consultant pay. I don’t think that’s going to be meaningful. So we’ll be balloting in the new year. We’ll be gearing up, potentially towards industrial action in the new year.”Two-thirds of consultantshave already indicated their willingness to strikein pursuit of better pay, although that was in a purely indicative ballot in which turnout was below 50%. They claim that the real terms value of their pay has been eroded by 26% since 2008/09 as a result of inflation and years of low annual pay settlements.Almost all the 69 voting members of the BMA’s resident doctors committee (RDC) back switching to the more hardline approach of monthly strikes, which may also involve longer walkouts – the previous longest was six days in January 2024 – union insiders say.The BMA’s ruling council has already approveda request from Dr Jack Fletcher, the RDC’s chair, for it to reballot its 60,000 resident members when its current mandate expires on 6 January. If successful, resident doctors could strike as often as they decide for six months.“Consultants voting to down tools would be a bitter pill to swallow for NHS staff who are working hard to recover performance and reform services. More strikes over winter would cause huge disruption to patient care during the busiest period of the year for the NHS,” said Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation.“Further strikes would jeopardise the good progress being made in cutting waiting lists and would divert more money from what are already very stretched budgets. We urge the BMA to avoid any further strike action, especially during the winter months.”Strikes since 2022 by doctors, nurses, ambulance crews, radiographers and other NHS staff have forced the NHS in England to rescheduleat least 1.7m outpatient appointments and operations.Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on health and social care, said: “This is hugely worrying for patients who are suffering historic waiting lists and deteriorating care – and now face yet more disruption.”A double whammy of doctor strikes would be a serious setback for Streeting.He this week bitterly attacked the union over the resident doctors’ strike campaign, accusing the BMA of acting like a “cartel”, being a threat to the NHS’s future and pushing unreasonable demands. More strikes would undermine his promise to ensure patients once again get planned hospital treatment within 18 weeks by the end of this parliament in 2029. The waiting-list fell slightly in September to 7.39m, involving 6.24m patients, NHS figures published on Thursday showed.He highlighted that resident doctors have seen their pay rise by 28.9% since 2022 and he came close to accusing them of being greedy in a speech to a gathering of NHS bosses.Consultants earn £127,540 on averagewhile resident doctors’ basic pay, before overtime, ranges from £38,831 to £73,992.The BMA made clear its view that all types of doctors, not just residents, deserve to have the value of their salaries restored. “The BMA is led by our 200,000-strong members who set policy and the council of elected members advises and supports the implementation of these policies.“Campaigning for full pay restoration for all doctors is such a policy,” a spokesperson said.Consultants will not go on strike, the DHSC said.“The BMA’s indicative ballot showed that the vast majority of their consultants aren’t prepared to go on strike, and rightly so,” a spokesperson said.“As a highly valued part of the NHS workforce, new full-time consultants have seen their basic pay increase by 24% over the past three years, with an average salary of £145,000 a year. For the first time in over a decade, the NHS is finally on the road to recovery. NHS doctors now have a government that values them and wants to work with them to enhance their working conditions and rebuild our NHS.”Explore more on these topicsNHSIndustrial actionDoctorsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

However, in about half of these donations after circulatory death (DCD) cases, the transplant ends up being cancelled.That is because the time between the removal of life support and death must not exceed 45 minutes. If the donor does not die within the timeframe needed to preserve organ quality, surgeons often reject the liver because of the increased risk of complications to the recipient.Now doctors, scientists and researchers at Stanford University have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a donor is likely to die within the timeframe during which their organs are viable for transplantation.The AI tool outperformed the judgment of top surgeons and reduced the rate of futile procurements – which occur when transplant preparations have begun but the donor dies too late – by 60%.“By identifying when an organ is likely to be useful before any preparations for surgery have started, this model could make the transplant process more efficient,” said Dr Kazunari Sasaki, a clinical professor of abdominal transplantation and senior author on the study.“It also has the potential to allow more candidates who need an organ transplant to receive one.”Details of the breakthrough werepublished in the Lancet Digital Health journal.The advance could reduce the number of instances in which healthcare workers prepare organs for recovery, only to determine they are unsuitable for recovery and transplantation, putting financial and operational strain on transplant centres.Hospitals primarily rely on surgeons’ judgment to estimate this critical timeframe, which can vary widely and lead to unnecessary costs and wasted resources.The new AI tool was trained on data from more than 2,000 donors across several US transplant centres. It uses neurological, respiratory and circulatory data to predict a potential donor’s progression to death with greater accuracy than previous models and human experts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Importantly, it maintains accuracy even when some donor information is missing, researchers said.A reliable, data-driven tool could help healthcare staff make better decisions, optimising organ use and reducing wasted efforts and costs.The approach could be a significant step forward in transplantation, the research team said, highlighting “the potential for advanced AI techniques to optimise organ utilisation from DCD donors”.Next, they plan to vary the AI tool to trial it with heart and lung transplants.Explore more on these topicsOrgan donationArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of ordinary people have given their time and money to build a real alternative to endless cuts and endless war.“A dedicated team of volunteers has been working on a shoestring budget to deliver a founding conference at the end of the month. Their efforts are heroic, but without funding Your Party’s capacity has been severely restricted. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were donated to the party by supporters in good faith, but have since remained beyond its reach. This has been extremely frustrating and disheartening.“A small portion of these funds was today transferred to Your Party. This is insufficient. We will continue to pursue the immediate transfer of all the money that was donated by supporters to get a new party off the ground, alongside a resolution to outstanding legal issues.“Building a democratic party from the ground up was never going to be smooth sailing. Some of the difficulties we have faced were inevitable, but others were deliberate acts.”The political infighting on Monday centred on thousands of pounds’ worth of donations and fees received by MOU Operations Ltd, a company set up earlier this year.Party officials were seeking a sum of about £800,000 from MOU Operations and had threatened to take legal action against the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She subsequently wrote him a letter explaining her history of sexual abuse and rape, and explaining that she could not change her mind on the petition.She later wrote in a social media post that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal.”Two other Republican representatives, the formerly fiercely reliable Trump loyalist and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, have signed the petition.The necessary 218 votes to pass it and allow a House of Representatives vote was achieved this week with the swearing-in of the Democratic member, Adelita Grijalva, more than two months after she won a special election in Arizona following the death of her father, who had been the sitting representative.Democrats have accused Mike Johnson, the House speaker, of deliberately delaying Grijalva’s oath-taking in an attempt to deny the petition enough votes to pass and stall the possibility of a vote. Trump has lobbied behind the scenes to stop a vote reaching the floor of the House.Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California,forecastthat between 40 and 50 Republicans could vote to release the files in a final vote, allying themselves with Democrats who will vote in favor. The legislation would still have to go to the Senate, where it is unlikely to pass. Trump, who was equivocal on whether he would release the files on the campaign trail last year, could veto a final bill even if it passed both houses.However, the very prospect of a vote in favor by the Republican-controlled House could spell serious political trouble for Trump, as it could fuel the clamor among his political base for the files to be unsealed and undermine their support for him.Politico quoted a Trump ally as saying that the latest email releases had taken “things that are already complicated for the president and [brought] them to the surface”.“It’s like adding salt to a dish – the flavors are already there, it just accentuates all of them,” the unnamed ally said.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, labelled the email releases as “a distraction campaign by the Democrats and the liberal media”.“It’s why I’m being asked questions about Epstein instead of the government reopening because ofRepublicansand President Trump,” she said.The renewed speculation over Epstein coincided with Trump signing into law a congressionally approved spending package that officially ended a federal government shutdown, which, lasting 43 days, was the longest in US history. It also comes after the supreme court has signaled that it may strike down his signature tariffs policy.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinUS CongressRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasremoved from officein 2015 and banned for five years from standing for mayor after an election commissioner found him guilty of electoral fraud.He was re-elected in 2022 under the banner of his Aspire party, which has a small majority of councillors on the authority.The planned meeting follows a letter to the council from Reed, who said he was appalled to learn that two Tower Hamlets councillors, one with Aspire and a former Aspire member who now sits as an independent, were seeking to become parliamentary candidates in Bangladesh.“I am appalled that any councillor elected by local people to serve their interests would even consider abandoning that commitment to campaign in another country,” he wrote in the letter, which the Guardian has seen.“I am particularly disappointed that Tower Hamlets councillors would consider doing so while the council, with the support from my envoys, is on a significant improvement journey that requires a dedicated and fully engaged leadership to grip and deliver the necessary change.”Aninitial progress reportby the three envoys published in July welcomed the steps the council was taking to improve its performance but also noted a perceived lack of cooperation from the mayor’s office.“We have not always felt that staff have prioritised making time for meetings with the envoys, and meeting some individuals has taken longer than it needs to,” they wrote. “We are particularly keen to meet the wider mayor’s office and advisors.”The team is expected to publish another report by the end of the year, before elections across all London councils next May. But Reed’s decision to call the envoys in now is seen as indicating the level of concern about a seeming lack of progress.Opposition councillors have raised a number of issues with the way the council has been run in recent weeks, not least the decision to allow the Aspire councillor Sabina Khan to stand for election in Bangladesh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bells rang out across the city as a remembrance ceremony began at a memorial garden in centralParisattended by relatives and survivors.“Everything will be done to prevent any new attack and to ruthlessly punish those who would dare to attempt it,” Macron said in a speech at the ceremony. “Eighty-five attacks have been foiled in 10 years, including six this year.”Arthur Dénouveaux, the president of the survivors’ group, Life for Paris, said: “One thing unites all victims of terrorism: the will for it to never happen again to anyone else.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside the Bataclan concert hall to mark the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.Photograph: Emma Da Silva/APIslamic State claimed responsibility for theattacks in and around Parison the night of 13 November 2015.

The charts that show who favours Farage’s partyBased on the largest poll of supporters yet, these charts and maps show five distinct groups that could hand Reform a majorityThe real Reform voters have been revealed – it’s a slapdash coalition Farage will struggle to hold togetherAna Lucía González PazandAshley KirkThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 12.43 ESTShareResearch based on a poll of 11,000Reform UKsupporters, the biggest survey of its kind, tells us more about who is intending to vote for the party than has been previously known.The in-depth polling analysis fromHope Not Hatereveals a voter coalition that stretches from struggling workers and frustrated graduates to wealthy retirees, in places from Hitchin to Runcorn.While immigration is often viewed as the defining issue for Reform supporters, the data shows a far more complex picture. This diverse coalition is deeply divided on big issues such as the economy, the climate crisis and the role of government.The charts below, which are based on polling of 11,342 Reform supporters, show how Reform’s following cuts across age, class and geography, and reveal five distinct voter groups with sharply contrasting priorities. Together, they capture a movement united by anger and distrust yet divided over identity, economics and Britain’s direction.View image in fullscreenWho are the Reform supporters?The research divides them into five groups, based on their attitudes towards different issues. These groups are the “working right”, “hardline conservatives”, “squeezed stewards”, “contrarian youth” and “reluctant reformers”. They differ in some key ways.Working right26% of people who intend to vote ReformView image in fullscreenEconomically insecure and angry, these older working-age voters mix pro-worker attitudes with hostility towards immigration. They feel betrayed by elites, see immigrants as competitors for scarce resources and are the most loyal to Reform’s populist message.Hardline conservatives18%View image in fullscreenAffluent, older and ideologically rightwing, this group is deeply anti-immigrant and socially conservative. They oppose workers’ rights and state spending. They generally resemble disillusioned Tory loyalists and traditionalists, but distrust climate action and are drawn toNigel Farage.Squeezed stewards29%View image in fullscreenAnxious, middle-income voters who are hostile to immigration yet care strongly about nature, fairness and local control. Feeling politically ignored, they mix cultural conservatism with environmental concern and want to see improvements on the cost of living.Reluctant reformers19%View image in fullscreenThe most moderate group, they back Reform out of frustration with mainstream politics rather than conviction. Pragmatic and fairness-driven, they value competence, stability and public services – especially the NHS. They are the most persuadable segment.Contrarian youth9%View image in fullscreenPredominantly young, diverse and politically volatile, they combine cynicism, conspiracy thinking and flashes of optimism. Many distrust institutions but are open to new ideas, holding socially conservative gender views yet showing more tolerance on race and multiculturalism.Group demographicsThe polling reveals the diversity across the different voter groups the party may rely on. While half of the Reform voters surveyed are older than 55, groups such as the reluctant reformers and the contrarian youth skew younger.Chart on ageOnly one in five have degree-level qualifications or above, but this goes up to two in five among the contrarian youth group.Chart on education levelsReform supporters were also asked about their socioeconomic status. A third reported a pre-tax household income of less than £25,000 and half earned between £25,000 and £70,000. Thirteen per cent overall are in the upper income brackets, and this figure rises to 23% in the contrarian youth group.Chart on incomeA third (36%) of Reform supporters are desperate or worried about their finances. This is particularly true for the working right and contrarian youth groups.Chart on feelings on financesHardline conservatives have better hopes or consider themselves to be better off.View image in fullscreenWhat does this mean for Reform’s policy platform?The diversity of the party’s support base carries significant implications for policy.One of the biggest tensions is between the working right, who generally are found in poorer towns and in northern constituencies, and hardline conservatives found in wealthier southern seats.For the working right, the cost of living crisis is the defining issue: 65% name it as a top concern, compared with 49% of hardline conservatives, who are more likely to focus on the economy in broader terms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe sharpest split is over immigration and asylum. While three in five (58%) potential Reform voters see it as a key issue, that figure falls to just 20% among contrarian youth and soars to 77% among hardline conservatives – highlighting how Reform’s coalition blends economic populists, traditional conservatives and disaffected young voters under one uneasy banner.Chart showing How Reform voter groups differ on issues most important to themWhen looking at broader attitudes, the polling exposes other splits within the coalition that could be hard for Farage to bridge.While the reluctant reformers and contrarian youth tend to hold pro-immigration views, this stands in stark contrast to the hostility held by the rest of the coalition – especially the working right.Chart showing how reluctant reformers and contrarian youth hold more moderate views towards immigrationA similar faultline appears on the climate crisis. The squeezed stewards broadly support action on climate change, while hardline conservatives are among the most sceptical, often rejecting the idea of human-driven global heating altogether.Chart showing how squeezed stewards and contrarian youth acknowledge climate crisisOn workers’ rights, the gulf is just as wide. The working right are strongly in favour of better pay and protections, while hardline conservatives opposed most pro-worker policies.Chart showing how working right and hardline conservatives clash on employment rightsThe analysts point to how this data underlines the tensions between Reform’s economically populist and free market wings.View image in fullscreenLooking ahead to the electionThe analysis also maps where these supporters are concentrated across the country, and compares it with their current voting intention.Reform’s core base, the working right, is based across post-industrial and coastal constituencies in the north and east of England, especially outside big cities. These voters, often economically insecure and alienated from Westminster, make Reform a serious threat in “red wall” seats where even small shifts in turnout could upend tight races.The hardline conservatives and squeezed stewards anchor Reform’s support further south, in rural, coastal and commuter-belt areas stretching from the Midlands to Kent and Wales.Their presence signals that Reform’s popularity is not just a northern revolt but a dual challenge for establishment parties: it is peeling off disillusioned working-class voters from Labour while eating into the Tories’ traditional heartlands with a blend of populist anger and cultural conservatism.The maps below show how working-right voters account for up to 40% of projected Reform backers in some north-west seats in England, but in areas of the south-east the hardline conservatives form more than a third.Maps showing how Reform’s different voter groups are centred in different parts of the countryThe report also found 301 constituencies where the number of squeezed stewards alone – both those who voted Reform previously and new voters – exceeds the margin the party would need to overturn to win the seat at the next election.There are 264 seats where the working right outnumber that majority, and 207 where the hardline conservatives do – showing how even small shifts in these groups’ support could prove decisive in dozens of tightly fought contests.You can search the table below to find out how many of these Reform voters are in each constituency, as well as the results forecast from theMRPmodelling for Hope Not Hate.Table allowing you to find out how your area compares in the pollingView image in fullscreenWillsqueezed stewards decide whether there is a Reform majority?The biggest group in the party’s voter makeup is the squeezed stewards, comprising 29% of all Reform backers. The voters in this group share some values on immigration but they are also anxious about the cost of living, the future and have a concern for nature.Squeezed stewards mostly switched from the Conservatives to Reform in the 2019 or 2024 general elections. There are also voters who switched from Labour in 2024.Chart showing how almost half of squeezed stewards voted Conservative in 2019Some of these voters live in constituencies that are forecast to have tight margins if an election were to happen tomorrow, so their vote could decide whether those seats turn to Reform or another party that appeals to their concerns.There are 20 seats with more than 35% of Reform voters being squeezed stewards and a margin of under 10%. These include Hitchin (forecast Labour win with a margin of 0.33%), Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven (Reform margin 1%) and Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Reform margin 2%).Chart showing seats where squeezed stewards could make differenceAnki Deo, who leads the policy and insights team at Hope Not Hate, says that in “an era of hyper-marginal politics where election results are decided by just a few percentage points”, identifying these groups and where they live is crucial.She adds: “For those of us desperate to prevent a Farage-led government in 2029, this research shows us that not all is lost. Reform UK voters do not fit a single profile or ideology. Far from a homogenous group, it is a broad coalition, with many voters having quite different and contradictory views from each other.“Somewhat bizarrely, the rise of Reform UK is often viewed almost exclusively through the prism of immigration. But our polling shows that these voters are also deeply concerned about financial insecurity and economic inequality. For some Reform UK voters, the cost of living is twice as important as immigration.“This is why improving our economy and public services, focusing on workers’ rights and defending multiculturalism are the most effective ways to not only fight the far right but win elections.”MethodologyThe survey and segmentation conducted by Hope Not Hate was based on a sample of 11,342 people who said they would vote for Reform if there was a general election tomorrow. This sample was taken from a national poll of 43,335 people conducted by Focaldata on behalf of Hope Not Hate and Ecotricity between 1 August and 11 September 2025.The poll was weighted to be nationally representative using 2021 census data on age, gender, region and education, as well as the 2024 general election vote.The segment proportion by constituency used for the table and map was calculated from that sample, but the proportion predicted for Reform and the margin of the seat were calculated from the voting intention of the widest sample of 43,335 people.The people were grouped together into segments using multidimensional factor analysis to group questions by theme and developing indexes that place individual respondents along an axis that represents polarisation of opinions, along with Gaussian mixed modelling to identify clusters of respondents who share similar political values and attitudes based on the factors.This article was amended on 13 November 2025. An earlier version said two in five Reform supporters have degree-level qualifications or above, which goes up to three in five among the contrarian youth group; this should have said one in five and two in five respectively.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageOpinion pollsnewsShareReuse this content"

Where am I going to go?’”After years of discussions, councillors have now approved planning permission to knock down most of Druids Heath, a postwar housing estate on the southern edge ofBirmingham, to create higher density housing.In total, 1,800 homes will be demolished to make way for 3,500 new ones, 400 (11%) of which will be designated as affordable, according to the planning documents – 800 fewer than there are now.This was the main point of contention at the planning committee meeting in which dozens of Druids Heath residents crammed into the room and adjoining corridor to voice their anger – shouts of “these are our homes” and “it’s not enough” could be heard throughout.In the end, the committee was split and the application was narrowly approved by a majority of just one vote.View image in fullscreenXylia Legonas: ‘For me to afford something of my own now, I’d have to move out of Birmingham.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe council insists it is committed to ensuring there will eventually be 1,785 affordable homes created through a partnership agreement with the developer and Homes England, and that the 400 already approved will be for social rent, although the planning documents do not specifically state this.“The scheme will not go ahead without those remaining affordable homes being delivered,” Nicky Brennan, the cabinet member for housing and homelessness, said.But residents are concerned that outline planning permission has been granted without this set in stone and are worried the promise may be reneged down the line due to financial pressures.“There’s a lot of ‘potentially’ and ‘in the future’. ‘We hope’ does a lot of heavy lifting,” said Corin Ennis, who lives with his girlfriend and two-year-old son in the house they bought seven years ago.Back then only the nearby 13-storey tower blocks were earmarked for demolition – then the red line was extended to encompass a much larger area. All affected homeowners have been offered market value plus 10% for their properties, which for Ennis equates to £180,000 for his three-bedroom home.View image in fullscreenCorin Ennis: ‘It feels like whatever we do it’s the wrong option.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“With the best will in the world, £180k is not going to touch the sides of what these new houses are going to cost,” he said. “We’re not going to be able to really buy anything for that in Birmingham. I don’t know what to do; it feels like whatever we do, it’s the wrong option.”Crisis charity to become a landlord in attempt to rectify ‘catastrophic’ housing in UKRead moreResidents say the council has offered shared ownership options for homeowners who want to return, but many – especially those who own their homes outright – aren’t keen on the idea.“They’ve moved the goalposts so many times, so why would I trust that information that they’re giving me?” said Legonas, who previously worked as a live-in carer and has returned to college to study welding. “My plan was to be rent-free, mortgage-free, and just me and my daughter.“For me to afford something of my own now I’d have to move out of Birmingham, but my family is here and I like it in Druids Heath. There’s a reason why I bought my house up here. I like the air. It’s not like down in the city where the air feels thick.”Druids Heath sits on one of the highest points in Birmingham, making it colder and windier than the rest of the city. It is also home to the most deprived part of the city, and the area has barely been touched since it was built in the 1960s, when it was the biggest industrialised housing scheme in the UK.Almost all residents agree change is needed, and some welcome the chance to move away. Others feel they haven’t been consulted.“Everyone says Druids Heath has been underinvested in and that’s why this needs to happen. But who has underinvested? The council. The government. The people up there, not the people living here,” said Rita Patel, one of more than 1,200 council tenants in the area. She has an accessible two-bedroom property that she has specially adapted over the 16 years she has lived there.“I agree something needs to happen. But I don’t think that all of the properties need knocking down.”View image in fullscreenRita Patel is one of the 1,200 council tenants in Druids Heath and lives in a specially adapted property.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianShe has been told all council tenants who wish to remain in the area will be given somewhere new to live under a right-to-return scheme, but her house is in one of the final phases of the project, meaning she has about 15 to 20 years to wait.“I could be living here in a building site for a very long time, with the looming thought of eventually having to move,” she said. “My life is getting harder as I’m getting older – 10 years ago I had a lot more energy than I do now. So it’s going to be a massive upheaval for me.“I’m finding it really, really scary – the reality of it for the people here.”Jayne Murray, the lead artist at a Druids Heath arts centre who has helped campaign on the issue, said: “Investment is a completely different thing to demolition. It is really extreme and harmful.“It’s so shortsighted. They’re doing it all over the city; it’s not just here. They’re just not valuing what’s here and the people who are here.”View image in fullscreenOne resident said investment was ‘completely different to demolition’, which is ‘shortsighted’.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianOther areas including Ladywood, Digbeth and the city’s markets are all earmarked for large-scale demolition as part of regeneration plans.At the heart of people’s concerns in Druids Heath is what “affordable” really means when it comes to the new houses. The government’s push to build rapidly, and the new housing secretary’s decision tocut affordable housing targets in the capitalto get things moving, have done nothing to ease fears.Patel said: “The attitude is: ‘We just need to get this through.’ And I’m guessing some of that comes from central government. Whatever happens in London, it filters down.“What are you building? Who are you building it for? And are you building communities or are you just building houses?”Explore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesBirminghamWest MidlandsRegenerationPlanning policyLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as AI software develops, it is increasingly being used to produce sometimes misleading photos and videos.“I think what’s really broken through in this election cycle has been the use of generative AI to produce content that goes directly to voters,” said Alex Bores, a New York state representative who has been at the forefront of introducing laws to regulate the use of AI.“So whether that was the Cuomo campaign thatused ChatGPT to generate its housing plan, or Cuomo and many others making AI-generated video ads for voters, that is, I think, felt very new in the 2025 cycle, or certainly, just much further than we’ve ever seen before.”Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who dropped out of the race in September, used AIto create robocallsto New Yorkers featuring him speaking in Mandarin, Urdu and Yiddish, and also producedan AI videoshowing New York as an apparently war-torn dystopia to attack Mamdani.Cuomo, meanwhile, was accused of racism and Islamophobia after his campaigntweeted a videothat showed a fictionalized version of Mamdani eating rice with his fingers and a Black man shoplifting. The advert also featured a Black man, wearing a purple shirt and tie and a fur coat and carrying a silver cane, appearing to endorse sex trafficking. The Cuomo campaign later deleted it and said it had been sent out by accident.Bores, who is running to represent New York in the House of Representatives, said many of the AI-generated ads in the last election cycle were “more likely” to “veer into what might be perceived as bigoted territory”.“I think that’s another thing that we need to track: is this either because the algorithms are playing up stereotypes that are in their training data, or [is it] because it’s so easy to manipulate. You don’t have to tell an actor of a certain race to do a certain thing, you just change it in the computer,” Bores said.“You don’t have to say to someone’s face to portray themselves in a certain way. Does that make it easier for people to put out content that, you know, really, I think polite society should be frowning upon.”In New York state, campaigns are supposed to label AI ads as such, but some – including the ad Cuomo posted and deleted – did not. The New York board of elections is in charge of potentially pressing charges against campaigns, but Bores noted that campaigns might be willing to bite the bullet on any punishment, particularly if any punishment comes after a campaign has finished.“I think you’re always going to find campaigns that are willing to take that trade-off. If they win and then they pay a fine afterwards, they’re not going to care, and if they lose, it doesn’t matter,” Bores said. “So you want to try to find an enforcement regime that can take things down quickly before an election, as opposed to just punish afterwards.”Robert Weissman, co-president of the non-profit advocacy group Public Citizen, which has been involved in passing many AI laws around the US, said that trying to fool people is now illegal in more than half the states, with campaigns required to post disclaimers on generative AI ads saying they are not real. Still, he said, regulating AI use in campaigns is a pressing issue.“Lies have been part of politics since time immemorial. This is different than lies, and it’s different than saying your opponent said something that they didn’t say,” Weissman said.Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine sign voice deal with AI companyRead more“When someone is shown an apparently authentic version of a person saying something, it is very hard for that person to then contradict it and say ‘I never said that’ because you’re asking people to disbelieve what they saw with their own eyes.”While AI is now capable of generating believable videos, some campaigns haven’t quite nailed it. A“Zohran Halloween special” videoposted by Cuomo – this ad did state it was AI-generated – showed an extremely sloppy rendition of Mamdani, complete with out-of-sync audio and an incomprehensible script.With the midterm elections approaching and the 2028 presidential election looming, AI-generated political videos are likely to stick around.They’ve already been used at the national level. Elon Muskshared an AI-generated videoof Kamala Harris in July 2024, after she became the de facto Democratic nominee for president. That video depicted Harris claiming she was the “ultimate diversity hire” and saying she doesn’t “know the first thing about running the country”.While states may be making progress on regulating the use of AI in elections, there seems to be little appetite to do so at the federal level.During the No Kings protests in October, Donald Trump shared an AI video that showed him flying a fighter jet anddropping brown fluid on Americans, just the latest of his AI video posts.With Trump apparently approving of the medium, it seems unlikely that Republicans will attempt to rein in AI anytime soon.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Andrew CuomoDonald TrumpZohran MamdanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarThe actor and comedian was Oscar-nominated for her film debut 40 years ago, then won an Academy Award just five years later. As she turns 70, we rate Goldberg’s greatest hitsByRyan GilbeyThu 13 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShare10.Girl, Interrupted(1999)Or: Winona, Overshadowed. Predominantly, that is, by Angelina Jolie, whose movie-stealing turn as one of Ryder’s fellow patients at a late-1960s US psychiatric hospital won her an Oscar. Don’t discount Goldberg’s contribution, though. Soothingly understated as Valerie, the chief nurse, she and fellow staff members, played by Vanessa Redgrave and Jeffrey Tambor, provide the emotional grounding over which their younger co-stars (also including Elisabeth Moss and Brittany Murphy) can soar.9. Made in America (1993)View image in fullscreenHate at first sight … with Ted Danson in Made in America.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarGoldberg is the owner of an African bookstore whose daughter (Nia Long) tracks down her sperm-donor father (Ted Danson). It’s hate at first sight for the parents, but antipathy turns to amorousness. Despite plenty of histrionics, and some regrettable slapstick involving a runaway elephant, Goldberg somehow clings to her dignity. There are bizarre moments, such as Danson gazing at a photograph of his daughter as a baby and saying softly to himself: “Funny thing, sperm.” Or Goldberg commanding him to “smell me” before they first lock lips. But the smooch itself is not to be sniffed at. Even in 1993, interracial romance was all but taboo in US cinema: a love scene between Goldberg and Sam Elliott was cut from Fatal Beauty only six years earlier.8. Boys on the Side (1995)View image in fullscreenBringing the goods … Goldberg with Drew Barrymore in Boys on the Side.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarA sugar-and-spice road movie, the former ingredient provided by director Herbert Ross (Steel Magnolias), the latter by screenwriter Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex). Goldberg plays Jane, a musician leaving New York after breaking up with her girlfriend, and hitting the road with Robin (Mary-Louise Parker), who has HIV, and Holly (Drew Barrymore), who is fleeing an abusive relationship. This is the 1990s, so Jane can’t simply be a lesbian: her sexuality must be mulled over by the straight characters. No matter: Goldberg brings the goods.7. The Long Walk Home (1990)This patronising film set in 1950s Alabama is part of Goldberg’s maids-and-housekeepers trilogy (see also: Clara’s Heart and Corrina, Corrina). But she gives a fine, subtle performance as the dutiful servant in a household whose matriarch (Sissy Spacek) is only just waking up to racial inequality. Behind the scenes, Goldberg successfully fought to keep footage of her character’s family in the final cut. On screen, she deploys stoicism brilliantly, especially when waiting on a white dinner party at which the guests are openly racist. “People have told me it’s a very restrained performance,” she later said. “It’s restrained because that’s what those women had to do. They were mad, but they had to work to support their families.”6. Monkeybone (2001)In the role of Death, stationed behind a desk in the purgatory-like Down Town where a hapless cartoonist (Brendan Fraser) finds himself stranded, Goldberg wears an eye patch, headgear that crosses a tricorn with a stovepipe hat, and a breast pocket overstuffed with pens. It is no impediment to her duties when her head explodes: she simply demands another one be taken from the shelf, Return to Oz-style, and screwed on to her neck. An unusually wacko project for Goldberg but just another day at the office for Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline.5. The Deep End of the Ocean (1999)Michelle Pfeiffer is the distraught mother whose three-year-old son has gone missing, Goldberg the tenacious detective who sticks with the case and becomes a family friend as the years tick by. Her most complex scene occurs early on, when she recoils suddenly from Pfeiffer’s affectionate display of gratitude, then offers an explanation: “Look, I’m Black, I’m a woman, I’m a detective supervisor, and I’m gay. Did you know that? So I always feel like the eyes of Texas are on me.”4. Sister Act (1992)View image in fullscreenNun so fine … as the singing Deloris in Sister Act.Photograph: Touchstone/AllstarMany of Goldberg’s roles have been castoffs from other actors: Jumpin’ Jack Flash was intended for Shelley Long, Burglar for Bruce Willis, while Fatal Beauty was rejected by Cher and Tina Turner. Even Sister Act only came her way after Bette Midler turned it down. But it became her second biggest hit, grossing $231m worldwide and spawning an inferior sequel and stage version. She plays Deloris, the singer causing havoc among the wimples when she hides out in a convent after witnessing a murder. Pluses include a lively soul soundtrack (My Guy is tweaked to My God) and her rapport with the British acting legend cast as Mother Superior. “You’reMaggie Smith!”Goldberg saidon the first day of shooting. “What are you doing in this fucking movie?”3. The Color Purple (1985)What a start: Goldberg’s Oscar-nominated movie debut, in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel about the woebegone lives of African American women in early 20th-century Georgia, could scarcely have been meatier. She had told Walker that she was willing to play any part, even if it was just “the dirt on the floor”, though she landed the lead role of Celie, the abused and exploited young woman who flickers to life in the company of the singer Shug (Margaret Avery), even if Spielberg goes light on the novel’s lesbianism. In fact, it is the director, tackling his first self-consciously grownup material, who feels like the tentative newcomer, while actual newbies such as Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey seem like seasoned pros. (The former has a cameo as a midwife in the 2023 version, which Winfrey produced.)2. The Player (1992)Robert Altman’s Hollywood satire, with Tim Robbins as Griffin Mill, the studio executive who murders a screenwriter, deploys its star wattage in stroboscopic fashion: A-listers including Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Cher and Susan Sarandon appear as themselves, flashing past the camera almost subliminally. Goldberg is one of the few playing a character, and she is a riot. Her sceptical, unfazed Pasadena police detective is perpetually amused by the shifty Mill, and given to blithely swinging her tampon around in front of him. Goldberg’s casting alone is a way for Altman to subversively undermine the plot’s suspense, just as he later would by hiring Stephen Fry to play the ineffectual police inspector in Gosford Park.1. Ghost (1990)View image in fullscreenIrreverent … with Patrick Swayze in Ghost, the film for which she won an Oscar.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarThis was the film that won Goldberg an Oscar, making her only the second Black female performer to do so (Hattie McDaniel had been the first, half a century earlier in Gone With the Wind); the prize also put her on the path to Egot (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) status, which she finally achieved in 2002. But the role of Oda Mae Brown, the bogus medium who finds herself an unwitting conduit for the murdered Sam (Patrick Swayze) to communicate with his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), nearly passed her by. Auditions were already under way, with Tina Turner the clear favourite for the part, when Goldberg heard about this unlikely stew of thriller, comedy and love story, and wangled a meeting. The film’s screenwriter, Bruce Joel Rubin, was aghast: “Anybody but Whoopi,” he pleaded. Later, he ate his words: “I mistakenly thought she’d be too broad. But nobody in the movie is more perfect than her.” Indeed, Ghost would be dangerously earnest without her irreverence, vitality and nutty line readings, not least the translation of Sam’s warning into Oda Mae’s own vernacular: “Molly, you in danger, girl.”Explore more on these topicsRankedWhoopi GoldbergfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are even companies to help you pick one …Emma RussellThu 13 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 05.28 ESTShare“I’m lucky I’m not a lawyer or an accountant or something professional,” says Peach Martine, a 23-year-old musician whose Instagram feed is a kaleidoscope of colourful faux fur and leopard-print outfits. “People sometimes have trouble taking my name seriously.” First, there are the jokey comments (“Is your sister named Papaya?”) and then the assumption that she must be “a bit silly”. And don’t get her started on going to Starbucks. “They always put Paige on the cup!”Martine wouldn’t dream of changing her first name though. She likes the fact that she has an unusual name. As a singer, she says, it has helped her to be more recognisable. If she had children, she would consider naming them something unique too.Martine is not alone. According toone study, based on an analysis of 325 million American babies born between 1880 and 2007, the use of common baby names has decreased steadily since 1983, with the greatest rate of change during the 1990s. In 2023, the last year for which figures were published, the UK’sOffice for National Statistics foundthat 64,560 unique names were being registered each year – twice as many as in 1999. This year, according to the US parenting website and appBabyCenter, Juniper, Malachi and Emersyn made it into the top 100 names for the first time. In Japan, the spread of unique names has been so vast that this year the governmentclamped down onkirakira(shiny or glittery) names, after parents had sparked criticism by naming children after brands or famous characters, including the Pokémon Pikachu, Naiki (Nike) and Pū (as in Winnie-the-Pooh), or others, such as Akuma (Devil), that made headlines.What is behind the rise? Some point to celebrity culture. Apple, the daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, isfronting a fashion campaign for Gapwith her mother. Pixie Geldof, daughter of Bob Geldof and Paula Yates, and Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, Yates’s daughter with Michael Hutchence, later adopted by Geldof, are celebrities in their own right. Then there are Rihanna and A$AP Rocky’s three children: Riot, RZA and Rocki; and rapper Cardi B’s daughter Kulture. The model Nara Smith announced to her Instagram followers recently that baby Fawnie Golden has joined her brood, which already comprises Rumble Honey, Whimsy Lou and Slim Easy. The YouTuber Trisha Paytas gave birth to Aquaman in July, joining her other children, Malibu Barbie and Elvis. And who can forget the arrival ofElon Musk and singer Grimes’ first child, X Æ A-12?In terms of naming children, says Kevin Schürer, a researcher at theCambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure: “What we’ve really seen in the last 20-odd years is that anything goes. You have more individualistic names coming in, either using older names with relatively new spellings, and the rise of names based on popular culture. So you’re moving away from a standard stock of names.” The practice of naming children after a godparent or family member declined from the 18th century onwards in the UK – when populations became more mobile around the Industrial Revolution, and parents became less constrained by custom and the opinions of extended family. Now, parents choose “names they like because they’re appearing on social media, television, and media sites,” Schürer says.View image in fullscreenThe three Rs … Rihanna with children RZA and Riot.Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicA name matters. Research has suggested it can affectwho we date,how well students do atuniversity (those with surnames later in the alphabet were found to receive lower grades), and in China, it has been found to impact how likely people are tocommit a crime. In fact, a name matters so much that there is now an industry devoted to choosing one. Taylor Humphrey, who set up her companyWhat’s in a Baby Namein 2015, charges more than $1,500 for a list of potential names. For $30,000, she offers full “baby name branding”. Websites such asNameberry,My Name for LifeandNamerologycoach parents on the dos and don’ts of naming. On TikTok, influencer Emily Kimpredictswhat celebrities and influencers will name their children, and also charges for her baby naming advice.Duana Taha, author of The Name Therapist: How Growing Up With My Odd Name Taught Me Everything You Need to Know About Yours, believes that a name says less about the person and more about the people who named them. “If you are somebody named Sarah, for example, that is a name that is fairly traditional and easily understood. It is biblical, but also literary. It is straightforward, doesn’t have a lot of frill about it. People who choose Sarah might value certain things versus people who choose something more fanciful, like Seraphina.”Girls with masculine names, such as Morgan and Taylor, were more likely to pursue advanced studies in science and mathsLittle Seraphina might turn out more confident though, says Taha. If your name is unusual: “You’re already getting more attention that you didn’t necessarily choose. That’s one thing for me to say as an adult, who has come to terms with this, but that happens to three- and four-year-olds. I think they become very used to advocating for themselves and realising there is this thing that sets them apart.”According to a study published inStrategic Management Journal in 2020, which analysed the names of CEOs of 1,172 public firms over a 19-year period, CEOs with unusual names “tend to develop a conception of being different from peers and accordingly pursue strategies that deviate from industry norms”.David Figlio, a professor of economics at the University of Rochester in New York, who studied how names can trigger different outcomes for schoolchildren in the early 2000s, says: “Jews often say that your name is your first gift.” His research found that American boys with names that sound more feminine (such as Ashley or Courtney) were more likely to be badly behaved once they entered grade 6. Meanwhile, girls with masculine names, such as Morgan and Taylor, were more likely to pursue advanced studies in science and maths than their siblings with more feminine names like Emma or Isabella.“From the very first moments of their lives, Isabella and Taylor were receiving different signals from all these people in society around them who had no idea that they were doing it. And the parents absorbed those signals too – and may not have been surprised when Taylor wanted to play with trucks and Isabella wanted to play with dolls,” says Figlio.Even today, “a substantial majority of people on both sides of the Atlantic still give their kids gendered names,” he says, although he believes that the increasing number of girls being given names that have traditionally been given to boys (like Taylor, thanks to a certain singer) is partly behind the rise in unique names. Parents are often more willing to choose an unconventional name for their daughters, he says, while picking traditional names for their sons. Even so, “you have these names that are relatively new in the name playbook – such as Kehlani which is in the top 100 this year – and you know it’s a girl,” he says. “We have been accustomed to associate certain linguistic features with masculinity and femininity even when what we’re observing in both the US and UK is a desire for uniqueness.”Coincidence? Sarah Blizzard is a weather presenter, Ellie Cook is a pastry chef and David Limb is an orthopaedic surgeonCould a name set you up for life? In 1985, the Belgian psychologist Jozef Nuttin found that people showed a preference for letters that occurred in their first or last names too. The name-letter effect, as it was called, drew on “implicit egotism”, which is the unconscious preference for things that are associated with yourself. It gives rise to “nominative determinism”, a term popularised by a column in theNew Scientistin 1994, which could explain why Sara Blizzard – a weather presenter at the BBC – gravitated towards her career; Chris Moneymaker became a famous poker player; Ellie Cook is a pastry chef and Mr David Limb is an orthopaedic surgeon.Limb, and his sons Richard and Christopher, who followed him into the medical profession, publisheda short paperin 2015 on the phenomenon after receiving comments about their name at work. Of the 313,445 entries in the medical register in the UK, they found the median frequency of names relevant to medicine was 1 in 149, including Doctor, Nurse and Ward; while those with names related to their subspecialty was 1 in 486. In urology, there were Burns, Cox, Dick, Koch, Balluch, Ball and Waterfall. In obstetrics and gynaecology, New, Bourne and Child. Dr Pain appeared most commonly in general surgery “but fortunately not Dr Handslip”, the paper says.In the kitchens at the Ettington Park hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon where Ellie Cook works, not a day goes without someone mentioning the link between her name and profession. Her front of house team tell diners the food is extra good because she was born for the role. “I used to teach at Le Cordon Bleu and the students used to get a kick out of it,” she says.Cook is originally from Solihull in the Midlands, where she would bake as a child with her mum. She quit nursing to attend culinary school with the hope that she would set up an ice-cream parlour one day. “Maybe there was an unconscious draw,” says the 33-year-old, whose great-aunt (nee Cook) fed the soldiers during the second world war. “I suppose if the name comes from somewhere in your family, it’s genetic to some degree.”Surnames were developed as the population grew in the middle ages to distinguish people with the same common first names for the purpose of collecting poll tax in England. It was at about this time that forenames were recorded too. The earliest poll tax returns from 1377 to 1381 are the first records historians have for English names and show a preference for west Germanic and Frankish names and those of Christian saints, which were introduced into England mainly after 1066, such as John, William, Thomas, Alice, Agnes and Joan. With the Reformation in the early 17th century, there was a rise in biblical names such as Elizabeth, Mary and Anne, and later Puritan ones such as Faith, Hope and Love (and more strangely: Helpless, DieWell and FearNot) in the second half of the century.Names can tell us a lot about someone’s class and identity – and much about our own prejudices. Caoimhe (pronounced Keeva) McMonagle, who is 26, never thought much of her name until she moved from northern Ireland to Manchester a year ago. She recently shared on TikTok some of the negative reactions she had experienced, particularly from men on nights out, who have said: “What kind of name is that?” and “That’s made up.” McMonagle says she hasn’t experienced issues in the workplace – she works as an anti-money laundering analyst – and loves her name. “I’m really proud to be Irish,” she says.View image in fullscreenStarting a trend in numerical names … Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) in Netflix’s Stranger Things.Photograph: Curtis Baker/Courtesy of NetflixNames from other ethnicities have been shown to have significant impact on careers. One 2023 study fromKing’s College London, conducted in Australia, created more than 12,000 fictional CVs in response to 4,000 job adverts. The CVs were all identical, apart from the names being altered to represent six distinct ethnic groups to reflect Arabic, Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, English, Greek and Indian backgrounds. The applications were for jobs across 12 different occupations. The results were stark. For leadership roles, 26.8% of applications submitted with English names received positive responses, while only 11.3% of those with non-English names received positive responses. “As well as violating anti-discrimination laws, businesses that are consciously or unconsciously rejecting people based on their name and not their qualifications and experience are reducing their chances of finding the right person for the role,” the study’s author wrote.No name is banned outright in the UK, although the UK Deed Poll Office has rejected names it thought would cause the child to face ridicule, including Martian, King, Princess and Monkey. In 2016, the court of appeal ruled that a mother in Wales could not name one of her twins Cyanide, after the poison. In Germany, Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden are banned; the US has 11 illegal names including Jesus Christ and Santa Claus; while Malaysia rejects plants, fruits, vegetables, animals and insects. One Australian journalist managed to name her babyMethamphetamine Rulesto test the country’s regulations.‘The truth is that I’m named after a Baywatch character’: readers on their unusual namesRead moreIt is, of course, possible to change your name. Although it might come as a surprise that it is classic names such as James and Elizabeth that people are ditching, not the more obscure ones. Rebecca, Thomas, Muhammad and David featured in the top 10 most changed names,swapped out for Liam, Riley, Kayleigh and Remiel, according to research fromMyNamesTags, which analysed more than 14,000 name changes by Deed Pollover the last five years.Some adapt names to better reflect theircultural or religious heritage, while others may choose a new name that aligns with theirgender identity. In 2025, oneprovider of legal deed polls said that one in six of allapplicationswere from people changing their name to live “more authentically”. In some cases, they maintain a connection to their original name, such as the actor Elliot Page. But that has not been the trend in the UK where nearly70% of applicantschoose new names that begin with a different letter.Whatever the reason, the proliferation of unique names seems here to stay. Peach Martine doesn’t think that’s going to change any time soon. “We grew up with so many interesting names in books and TV shows that I would be surprised if gen Z didn’t continue the trend of naming their kids from popular series.” She has seen a lot of number names, possibly inspired by the character Eleven in the Netflix series Stranger Things. Names such as Four or Six, which could be a more modern-day version of lineage, to honour relatives, allude to a birth order, and connect to culture, according toNameberry.They just need to be prepared for people’s reactions. “Sometimes it’s very charming,” Martine says, “but sometimes people make jokes. I’ve had my name for 23 years, so that’s more than 20 years of listening to jokes.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleBaby namesParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The drama kicks off with a newly deposited prisoner, Jenet (Gabrielle Brooks), famed for testifying against her family for witchcraft as a child, who is now accused of the same thing.There are many potentially powerful strands of story, from the coercion of children to the way in which the poorest, most disempowered women were targeted. But too much is stuffed in and not much of it evokes enough horror. Maybe it is because of the comic tone and cartoonish portrayals, which give it a Blackadder-ish glibness. The production, directed by Miranda Cromwell, feels relentlessly off-key, despite a robust onstage band and strong vocal performances.View image in fullscreenPsychodrama … Gabrielle Brooks as Jenet in Coven.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt is no fault of the actors. The plot sprawls in unruly ways, with simplistic messages in the book and lyrics about empowerment and historical revisionism. For a while, it seems like an ensemble piece, delving into the worlds of each of these women. It appears to find its focus in Jenet’s psychodrama as we are taken, eccentrically, into her mind with her childhood self played by a puppet.But once that story is told, it swings in other directions: a scene in which Maggie gives birth and the actors sing about mother earth; a broadly comic enactment of the misogynistic men of history who laid down the foundational ideas that led to the trials; King James I popping up in a ruff collar to give his stamp of approval to the witch-hunts. Slowly the drama becomes more static as it relentlessly charges from one ballad to another.The ideas are plentiful but they slosh around haphazardly, turning what might have been inspired gig-theatre into a strange soup.AtKiln theatre, London, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsKiln theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In a sense, it was just the latest in a series of guest appearances on the Brat tour: a string of collaborators from the album and its ensuing remixes – Lorde, Billie Eilish, Troye Sivan and Addison Rae among them – had turned up at different shows to perform their parts live. But as well as contributing her verse to their remix of 360, Robyn also took centre stage, performing her peerless 2010 single Dancing on My Own. Released when at least some of Charli xcx’s audience were still in nappies, it didn’t sound remotely like a throwback even in the context of a gig based around one of 2024’s most acclaimed and agenda-setting pop albums: the star of the show’s willingness to cede the spotlight to her felt like evidence of Robyn’s influence over contemporary pop.You can see why the Swedish singer-songwriter carries so much clout among pop stars of the mid-2020s. When she opened an album with a track called Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do, she wasn’t joking: after launching as a 90s teen-pop star produced by Max Martin, she rejected the usual strictures placed on female pop – walking away from not one but two major label deals due to lack of artistic control – and seemed intent on following a more idiosyncratic, complex, messy path. She never saw being in the centre of mainstream pop as antithetical to making music with depth, or that touched on contentious issues. Despite the worldwide success of her debut, Robyn Is Here, her second album, My Truth, went unreleased outside Sweden because her US-based label baulked at Giving You Back, a song about an abortion she’d had in 1998: when asked to remove the song, Robyn refused.Robyn: Dopamine – videoGaining her independence, she went on to collaborate with both Sweden’s blue-chip pop factories and a succession of experimental electronic artists, the Knife and Röyksopp among them, at a time when blurring the boundary between mainstream pop and the musical left field was far from commonplace. A 46-year-old who released her first single in 1995, a year before the Spice Girls were launched, she seems to have more in common with pop artists half her age than with most of her peers.How Robyn transformed popRead moreSo you would say that her first solo release in seven years was arriving at an opportune moment, were it not for the fact that Robyn doesn’t seem to do anything in a particularly opportune way. Either way, Dopamine is a striking return. Its sound is jubilant and dancefloor-focused: a four-to-the-floor house kick drum accentuated by a relentless rhythmic vocal sample, chattering Giorgio Moroder-esque synths, Daft Punk-like robotic voices, euphoria-inducing bursts of arpeggiated electronics, a killer earworm chorus. It’s noticeably a more neon-hued than her reflective last album,2018’s Honey, but just beneath its bright exterior lurks something more complex.It’s a song ostensibly about the first rush of falling in love, but tempers its giddy enthusiasm with a weird hint of desperation (“I just need to know that I’m not alone”) a further dash of fatalism (“it’s going to be whatever and that’s cool”). There’s also a curious tension between trying to explain attraction away as something scientific – an excess of the titular chemical – and something more spiritual and intangible: “Something here’s opening deep inside of me / And I can finally feel it.” The lyric never quite declares its hand: you could read it as emotion triumphing over rationality, or you could equally read it as tempering a standard pop cliche with a stark realism. It’s complicated and messy: it’s also an unequivocal pop banger. Which of course, makes it very of the moment, but also makes it very Robyn.Explore more on these topicsRobynPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the two struggle with their feelings and, indeed, the trailer includes several clips of kissing and crying in the rain to a new song created by Charli xcx, Chains of Love, as part of a new album to be released with the film in February.Viewers also glimpse some anachronistic fashions and Fennell’s signature colorful flourishes. “So kiss me, and let us both be damned,” Elordi’s Heathcliff says to Cathy at trailer’s end.The Promising Young Woman director, known for her love of mordant envelope-pushing, found controversy from the start with her erotically charged take on the English literature classic. The film’s casting director, Kharmel Cochrane,defended her choicesafter some suggested that Robbie was too old to play the role of a young maiden, while others questioned Elordi’s ethnicity, as Heathcliff is generally perceived to have a Romany or Gypsy background and darker skin.Reactions to atest screeningin August were reportedly mixed, with one attender calling the adaptation “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive” with one scene of a public hanging in which the “condemned man ejaculates mid-execution”.Fennell responded to some of the criticisms in September; at Brontë Women’s Writing festival, the Oscar-winning screenwriter said the novel “cracked me open” after reading it at 14 years old.“I’ve been obsessed. I’ve been driven mad by this book,” she said. “I know that if somebody else made it, I’d be furious. It’s very personal material for everyone. It’s very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private.“[It is] an act of extreme masochism to try and make a film of something that means this much to you,” she added. “There’s an enormous amount of sado-masochism in this book. There’s a reason people were deeply shocked by it.”Wuthering Heights will be released in cinemas on Valentine’s Day in 2026.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellEmily BrontëRomance filmsRomance booksJacob ElordiMargot RobbienewsShareReuse this content"

Now Labour is paying the priceThu 13 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareWes Streeting was always meant to be their Labour prime minister. The plan, hatched by a tiny clique of rightwing faction fighters, was this: find a candidate on whom they could fake a continuation Corbynism project to win the leadership. Then kick the ladder away from the people who backed them and the promises they made. At the next general election, given the scale of the Tory majority after 2019, get Labour back in the ring with more MPs and then hand over to Streeting. The real grownups would then be in charge and the subsequent election would be secured.But no one reckoned with Covid, Tory turmoil and thecollapse of the SNP. Suddenly Keir Starmer wasn’t going to just lead Labour to a better defeat and a springboard for victory next time. Against the odds, he was going to win. Just as Jeremy Corbyn was Labour’s accidental leader in 2015, Starmer was the party’s accidental prime minister in 2024.It was not a marriage made in heaven. Starmer and the Blairites made awkward bedfellows. Under their breath, the Blairites despised Starmer because he had aligned himself with the Corbyn project. While Streeting and Rachel Reeves stayed firmly on the outside, right up until the protracted Brexit negotiations that began in 2018, Starmer had remained loyal to the party leader, whom the Blairites loathed even more than him. But they needed Starmer as the only person who could break the grip of Corbynism precisely because he had promoted it. What the membership wanted was a professional version of Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer was the man. But it was only meant to be a temporary deal.Having worked closely withLabourTogether while it pretended to do what it said on the tin, and been courted to support the Starmer leadership bid, I reluctantly concluded early on that this project was doomed.It was always going to unravel, and not just because of the shotgun marriage. Neither Starmer nor the Blairites had done their intellectual homework. There was no vision on why they wanted to win and how they would govern. They just arrogantly assumed thatthey would be good at it. Add into the mix the hyper-factionalism that enabled them to secure total control of the party once they had the patronage of the leadership, and we now have a government with no breadth, no depth and none of the constructive challenge that any administration needs to manage the complexities of the polycrisis faced in office.The same coercive discipline the Blairites imposed on the party was deployed for the general election. But the Tory meltdown and the split vote on the right with Reform meant victory was already in the bag. They didn’t need to make the “cast iron pledges” on tax that are nowcoming back to haunt them. Starmer won the 2024 election by default. The project was already doomed.Despite a169 seat majority, Labour is finding it impossible to govern, because it has no vision of where it is taking the country and no ability to deliver on it even if it did. Because successful governments today don’t just rely on majorities at the top, but support, participation and advocacy throughout the country. A better future can only be negotiated, not imposed.Now the vultures are circling Starmer. He is weak and getting weaker. His self-proclaimed denial of anything that could be called Starmerism means there are few if any troops to defend him because there is nothing to defend him for.Maybe, in a sliding doors moment, the “true” path of history will out and Streeting, as it was always meant to be, will wear the crown? As they run around inpre-budget panic mode, Labour MPs need to stop and think, not just about changing the party leader but about changing the party’s whole policy and cultural direction. Nothing less will do. What economic policy will in time deliver the right kind of shared growth? How is the state to be rewired to pass power and resource down and out to the whole of the country? And how is the hyper-factionalism of the party to be ended and a positive culture of pluralism instilled that makes Labour more agile and resilient?Labour’s crisis is not a temporary blip. It is structural and fundamental. As things stand, recovery looks unlikely and the party could follow the same fate as its counterparts in France, who went from government to the margins almost overnight.Any potential new leader who helped get the party into this mess will not, no matter how much they “red wash” themselves, get the party out of it. Candidates who will say anything to win and mean none of it just dig a deeper hole for the left. In the absence of a shared vision and values, they’re just pumped-up personalities who will fight like cats in a sack to come out on top. There is no loyalty to each other because there is nothing to be loyal to, other than self-belief. They have all the cunning, skills and cynicism to make it to the top of the greasy pole, but none of the awareness, the boldness or the humility to lead Labour or the country to a better place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just who could be behind these dastardly briefings?Thu 13 Nov 2025 10.58 ESTFirst published on Thu 13 Nov 2025 09.54 ESTShareIt’s the worst game of Cluedo in town. Four players dealt a hand of cards. Without turning them over, player one makes the first guess. “Just one question. Does the suspect wear glasses?” he asks. “Yes,” replies player two. “But he doesn’t have to pay for them.”“OK,” says player one. “It’sKeir Starmerin the Cabinet Office with the suicidal tendencies.” Yup. Keir had managed to sneak up on Keir inside No 10 and club himself to death with the lead pipe. It had been a long and agonising end. Every time Keir had shown signs of regaining consciousness, he had somehow found the strength to inflict further damage on himself. You could only admire his determination. Players two, three and four throw their cards on the table in disgust. If only they had got there first.There’s hardly anyone in Westminster who doesn’t think that the circular firing squad in which everyone ended up badly wounded – AKATuesday’s extraordinary attackson Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Ed Miliband – came with Starmer’s blessing. Morgan McSweeney, Keir’s chief of staff, may increasingly appear to have the reverse Midas touch but he’s not yet that dim. Dim enough to have come up with the idea, but with enough sense of self-preservation not to go ahead without getting his insanity signed off by his boss. Not that he will necessarily escape getting the blame. But that’s another story. Prime ministers think nothing of laying down their friends for their lives.Weirdly the one person who is certain that the red on red briefings were nothing to do with him is Keir himself. His short-term memory is shot to pieces. He can now only remember the good bits of his life. And as there currently aren’t any, he can now remember nothing at all. Each day, each hour, each minute comes as a total surprise to him. He keeps having to be reminded who McSweeney is and what he does. Sometimes he doesn’t even know he’s the prime minister. There again, neither do all of his cabinet. Miliband was just sure thatKeir would have to sack whoever did the briefings. Keir. Meet Keir. The first man to fire himself.Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions had done nothing to provide any real answers of who had done what to whom, so it was inevitable the crisis would rumble on for a while longer. Sure enough, the Labour party chair, Anna Turley, showed up on Robert Peston’s late-night politics show. There would be a thorough investigation, she said. Keir was horrified at what had happened and wanted to get to the bottom of it. He had been paranoid enough about people plotting against him ever sinceAndy Burnham’s attempted coupa few months ago and he was even more paranoid now that his team was briefing against Wes. Or something.View image in fullscreenPrime minister’s questions on Wednesday was not enormously illuminating as to the big briefing mystery.Photograph: House of Commons/PAIt wasn’t immediately clear what form this investigation would take. Other than it was an investigation committed to only discovering a version of the truth that No 10 was happy with. That is the first rule of any investigation. Never announce an investigation unless you know what the findings are going to be in advance.But Turley was adamant that no stone would be left unturned. Keir would sit down with Keir and give Keir the third degree. “You knew all about this, Keir,” said Keir. “Morgs had promised you this would make you look stronger than ever. A prime minister ready to serve for the next three years.” Keir looked blankly at Keir. “I don’t know this Keir,” said Keir. “Who is he? I’ve never heard of him.” Like all the best investigations there would then be an investigation into the investigation. There would probably even be a BBC investigation into the investigation into the investigation. That’s if the Beeb could find the time after its endless programmes and investigations into itself.Next came reports that Starmer had had a brief phone call with Streeting to apologise. “Wes, is that you?” said Keir. “I just want to say sorry for all the things I haven’t done. I definitely did not do any of the briefings against you. I have set up an inquiry to try to find out who exactly is the prime minister. And as soon as I have an answer, I can promise you will be the first to know. Will this do?”New face, same problems: replacing Keir Starmer with Wes Streeting will do nothing to help Labour | Zoe WilliamsRead more“Thank you, prime minister. I do understand how difficult it must be to have so many Keir doppelgangers going feral in Downing Street. It’s bad enough when there’s only one. But it’s reassuring to have a prime minister who can’t run No 10 let alone the country. For my part, I want you to know I am definitely not plotting a coup against you. Well, no more than usual. I can’t really help myself. I’ve yet to find a world that would not be improved by having more Wes. I can’t help being ambitious. If I’m not careful, I find myself plotting against myself.”The two men hung up, having agreed to talk again soon. Which is a relief. It would be weird to have a prime minister and a health secretary who weren’t talking to themselves. Conveying messages via interpretive dance is fraught with risks. Later on Thursday morning, during a visit to Liverpool, Wes was eager to draw a line under the briefings. There was no bad blood between him and Starmer. It was all something that had been dreamed up by the media. All the public was interested in was hospital waiting lists going down and that he would be the next prime minister.On the morning media round, Ed Miliband also tried to distance himself from the psychodrama. He had been collateral damage. Dragged into it out of paranoia. Had no one forgotten he hadlost an election in 2015he had been tipped to win? No, there was no chance of him standing for leader. And hey, it had all been so much worse in the Blair-Brown era. They really knew how to do anonymous briefings.Why some in No 10 think Wes Streeting is plotting to become prime ministerRead moreThe last word went to Starmer. There would be severe consequences for anyone who leaked, he told reporters. He had full confidence in everyone except the people he didn’t. He was certain that no one in Downing Street had been responsible for the briefings. They had just spontaneously appeared out of the ether. It had all been divine intervention. A message from the Almighty that Keir was the best prime minister who had ever lived and would be in office for years to come.

The US would have done the sameThu 13 Nov 2025 13.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 14.25 ESTShareIt had all been so harmonious two months ago. “Together with the US, we’re building a golden age of nuclear that puts both countries at the forefront of global innovation and investment,” purred the prime minister aboutthe new “landmark” UK-US nuclear partnership.Now there’s an atomic split over the first significant decision. The UK has allocated Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn,to host three small modular reactors (SMRs)to be built by the British developerRolls-RoyceSMR. The US ambassador, Warren Stephens, says his country is “extremely disappointed”: he wanted Westinghouse, a US company, to get the gig for a large-scale reactor.This quarrel is easy to adjudicate. The US ambassador is living in dreamland if he seriously thought the UK wouldn’t show home bias at Wylfa. This is the coveted site for new nuclear power in the UK because the land is owned by the government, which ought to make the planning process easier and quicker, and the site hosted a Magnox reactor until 2015, so the locals are used to nuclear plants. Since Rolls-Royce’s kit is the best national hope of reviving the UK’s industry with homegrown technology, of course there was going to be preferential treatment.None of which is to say the SMR experiment will definitely succeed in the sense of demonstrating cheapness (a relative measure in nuclear-land) versus mega-plants, such as Hinkley Point C, Sizewell C or the Westinghouse design. Rolls-Royce oozes confidence about the cost-saving advantages of prefabrication in factories, but these have yet to be demonstrated on the ground. The point, though, is that the only way to find out is to get on and build. Rolls-Royce SMR’s only other order currently is from the Czech Republic for six units.Indeed, the criticism from some quarters is that the UK government has been too timid in ordering only three. If the batch-production is supposed to be the gamechanger on costs, goes the argument, then commit to a decent-sized batch at the outset.The choice of Wylfa may help on that score in time, though. The site is reckoned to be big enough to hold an additional five SMR units eventually, on the top of the first three. Since each SMR is 470 megawatts, a full build-out would equate to more megawatts in total than the 3,200 from each of Hinkley and Sizewell.The sop to the US is that Westinghouse gets to compete for future large-scale reactor projects in the UK. It would probably have been a good idea to tell the ambassador in advance before he blew a fuse. Reserving Wylfa for Rolls-Royce SMRs was the only sensible decision here.Hopes that SMR technology will become a major export-earner for the UK eventually are best treated with extreme caution at this stage. The first electricity from Wylfa won’t be generated until the mid-2030s, and the demonstration of falling costs with each additional unit can only come after that. There is a long way to go. But a good way to maximise your chance of success is to give the top site to your pet project. The US would have done exactly the same.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerViewpoint columnRolls-RoyceWalesEnergyManufacturing sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

What unites them is a desire for something differentWho supports Reform and why? The charts that show who favours Farage’s partyThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 07.50 ESTShareWho are Nigel Farage’s army, the voters who want him as our next prime minister? Few questions are as important in British politics. Were an election called tomorrow, the favourite for No 10 would be Farage, whose immigration policies are in some ways more extreme than those of the BNP were. His party’srole model for governmentwould be Donald Trump’s US: Elon Musk-style cuts to our public services and masked agents snatching families off the streets.A few months ago, many in Westminster and across the country would have considered this a cautionary nightmare, a catastrophe that would unfold if Keir Starmer failed. But in the week of another red-on-red assault and after 150 opinion polls in a row topped by Farage’sReform UK, it’s no longer a scare story. It’s the most likely prospect.And still the question of who actually supports Farage meets cliches and bluster. He is “a tribune of working-class rage against the elites”,claims Downing Street adviserMaurice Glasman, while the BBC’s Chris Masoncatches an “insurgency vibe”. An ex-City trader turned Brussels politico is now Merrie Englande incarnate, the teller of inconvenient truths from our bombed-out post-industrial heartlands. See our Nigel go hard-hatted into a steelworks! Watch him sink pints with ex-miners, or gambol along an Essex pier!That’s the sales pitch; the actual customers are vastly different. I can exclusively reveal here the results of the largest-ever survey of Reform voters: more than 11,000 people who would vote for Farage tomorrow, were the polling booths open. Yet far from a single bloc marching under one ideology, they form a large, diverse and fragile coalition.They stretch from Surrey to Sunderland, from affluent homes with mortgages long paid off to the hard-up. They disagree with each other and with Reform leaders. The results should be studied by anyone in politics, the unions and beyond wondering how to win back Reform voters and stop Farage from running Britain. A spoiler for those in Downing Street: waving flags won’t cut it.The analysis comes from Hope Not Hate, the respected anti-racist organisation, based on extensive recent polling by Focaldata as well as focus groups. The summary report is available now, and the Guardian analysis is based on extensive access to the background data and focus group responses. What did they find? Well for one, the “red wall” voters usually vox-popped by TV crews as the Farage faithful now make up a distinct minority of his supporters: only one in four of the Reform base. This is who analysts mean when they talk about Reform voters who go left on economics but right on social issues. They’re from towns, not cities, from the north and east of England, and very worried about getting poorer.Contrast them with another lot dubbed by Hope Not Hate “hardline Conservatives”. They’re about one in five of all Reform voters, often southern and well-to-do, and children of Thatcher. They clash with the first group on workers’ rights and wages and the NHS – and the tensions are growing.InfographicFarageism is a curious dish of microwaved Thatcherism, seasoned with a big dash of old Labour. He’s about slashing taxes and partially re-nationalising water, more manufacturing as well as plans to “bring crypto in from the cold”. It’s a mush of right and left economics, trying to glue together his disparate base. When heboasted last weekabout forming the “most pro-business, pro-entrepreneurship government this country has seen”, he was speaking to his hardline Conservative voters. But as an election looms, and he has to cobble together an actual platform, he’ll have to pick a side.But what’s most striking is that most of the Farage vote – much more than half – is not nearly as ideological. Starmer, Boris Johnson and David Cameron have all let them down so badly that they’ve drifted into Reform’s arms.“The NHS waiting list is still awful … housing crisis not getting any better,” one focus group member says. “I just feel the country was in jeopardy … andLabourhasn’t done anything to get us back on our feet.”All party leaders are “a load of rubbish”, another focus group member says. “They just spout whatever to get in.”This is why Farage poses as the anti-politician – even though he’s spent 20 years as a professional politician in Brussels and Westminster, more than double than Starmer’s time.Yet even among his own voters, Farage is no saviour: he’s a last roll of the dice. Their very lukewarm support is suggested by the terms Hope Not Hate use for the other groups of Reform voters they identified: “reluctant reformers”, “squeezed stewards” and “contrarian youth”. Each is motivated by a distrust of mainstream politics, but otherwise have little in common. To top the ballots they need to get into power; the turquoise brigade can no longer be a single-issue party, blaming “darkies” for all that ails the UK. Reform voters are easily the most hostile to migrants and yet there are significant chunks for whom immigration isn’t the number one issue. What is? Well, there’s a reason why Reform’s campaign leaflets say cost of living is the party’s number one priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The single biggest group of Reform voters, “squeezed stewards”, are middle-income (though anxious about the cost of living)and really care about the environment, even if for them it means getting poo out of rivers rather than following the latest Cop summit.What this analysis of Reform voters shows you is not Farage’s strength, but the political mainstream’s weakness – in two areas above all. First, the majority of Reform’s base are people who have been failed by Thatcherism, even while backing a party leader who is a true believer in the Iron Lady.Even so, Reform voters’ hopes for fulfilled lives – owning their homes, not worrying about food and energy bills, retiring at a decent age while still healthy to enjoy it – have run aground on the UK’s economic model. Yet the government that promised “change’ has delivered no such thing. Starmer and Reeves now give as their main reason for keeping their jobs the stability of financial markets. What’s their offer? Vote Starmer for PM; get bond traders for your government. Britain deserves far better.Knowing he has to fend off Farage, Starmer has chosen to festoon himself with flags and to spout poisonous rubbish about an “island of strangers” and a “one-nation experiment in open borders”. He has not opposed racist politics; he has normalised it. And the preachers of racist politics are getting more strident and more influential. Last year, Farage opposed mass deportations. Twelve months of Tommy Robinson calling for it on the hard-right social media channel renamed X and Farage has adopted the policy against people who have already got all the proper paperwork to stay – while Starmer has promised his own crackdown on people applying to remain here. From the extremists’ lips to the voters’ ears within a year.Yet what’s the message of this vast, detailed study? So many Reform voters want an alternative; they stay with Farage because the other parties only offer more of the same.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Today we have Cambridge-based Arm, a quiet titan designing more than 90% of the chips powering phones and tablets globally.​With such a pedigree, it is not idle daydreaming for British companies to win a significant chunk of the AI chip market; 5% is a conservative, achievable ambition. World-class universities, a thriving foundational AI company in DeepMind, and a robust ecosystem for innovation give the UK the practical tools it needs to compete.​The rewards of success are staggering. By 2033, the global AI chip market is projected to reach $700bn (£620bn) a year, outstripping the whole of today’s semiconductor market. Capturing that 5% means $35bn in new revenue and thousands of high-paying jobs.AI will reshape not only our economy but also our society and its security. Yet so many misunderstand where its true value and strategic power lie.In today’s gold rush, the real fortunes belong to those who build the shovel, not just those digging for digital gold. I saw this first-hand when I was on the Intel board in California between 1997 and 2006 as Gordon Moore and Andy Grove built that company. They built the “back end” of tech’s first revolution just as Nvidia is building the much bigger “back end” now.British engineers, British brains, British business and British investors are world-class at this stuff. But we will need the government to get on board.Consumer eyes are dazzled by OpenAI’s generative marvels. But it really is Nvidia, the company that supplies the advanced chips that make such feats possible, that reaps the market’s largest rewards. OpenAI looks as if it’s worth only a 10th of Nvidia. AMD, a semiconductor company that designs chips, is a distant second, while startups such as Cerebras and Tenstorrent jostle for a small piece of the pie.Every AI model and application, from autonomous robots to real-time translation tools, depends on advances in chip technology. Chips are the new oil in the digital economy, determining how quickly and efficiently future applications come to life. At present, theonly truly profitable giants in the AI sector are chipmakers.Some fear that China will commoditise AI chips just as it did with solar technology, causing prices to crater and incumbents to fall. The reality is more nuanced. US export controls prevent China from accessing the world’s advanced chip manufacturing technology for the next decade, severely limiting the country’s capacity to dominate high-end AI chip markets. For now, this leaves the US as the key player, with strong opportunities for Britain as its closest ally adept at chip design.The UK has already generated a few companies such as Fractile, Flux and Oriole working in this area. But we lack the scale to match the opportunity. We should not compete with Nvidia for the compute power of datacentres but in specialised applications that break new ground: robotics, factory automation, medical devices and autonomous vehicles.These sectors offer open terrain for innovative architectures and fresh competition.​skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionToo often, UK industrial strategy is hobbled by national trepidation and lack of confidence. This must change. First the government must strongly promote our determination to compete in AI chips.Second, within a decade we must double our chip design workforce from today’s 12,000, providing incentives for more talented students to study electrical engineering and computer science with generous bursaries. A target of 1,500 new students a year is realistic. Universities must offer the courses and the government must step up with practical financial support.​Third, the UK must use its investment levers: sovereign AI funds, the British Business Bank, the National Wealth Fund and the mandate to “buy British” by the Ministry of Defence.Fourth, the UK’s strategic relationship with the US must be a platform for deep integration with leading US chip manufacturers and access to their advanced sub-3 nanometer fabrication technology. Building robust supply chains and innovation pipelines with US partners is indispensable.​If the UK leans in fully, the new age of AI may be written not just in code, but in silicon, bearing a very British imprint.Lord Browne is the co-chair of theCouncil for Science and Technology.

Why would anyone agree to this?Thu 13 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 12.16 ESTShareOne night, late in the last century, I was with some friends walking home in the middle of the night. We were living in Cricklewood, on Shoot-Up Hill – which remains my favourite home address. Anyway, a police car, blue lights a-flashing, came to a halt in front of us. A couple of police officers leapt out and asked us to jump up and down. You what?They asked us again, but in a tone suggesting it was less of a question than a command. Up and down we jumped until told to stop doing so. The cops thanked us for our trouble and, jumping back into their vehicle, explained they were on the hunt for some lads who’d just robbed an amusement arcade. In the morning we asked each other if this had really happened. And 35 years on, I’ve just asked one of the blokes I was with if it really happened. And it did. I don’t think I’ve rummaged for coins in my pocket since without thinking about this incident.I filled my pockets with all the shrapnel, tightened my belt so my trousers didn’t fall down, and off I wentI have a pocketful of pound coins jangling away right now. Not because I’ve robbed an amusement arcade, though I might have to resort to it. You see, the barrier to the station car park I use bore bad news one morning: the ticket machines wouldn’t be accepting card payments. Cash had been recrowned king. Knowing I’d need to find five pounds, I made arrangements. I withdrew £10 from a cashpoint, paid for a coffee in Greggs with it, and carefully trousered the £5 note for later. It worked.I did the same the following day, but the machine had now taken against paper money too. Hopelessly, haplessly, I pressed the intercom at the exit barrier and begged for mercy. The barrier rose. But this had changed everything. Cash was king, but the pound coin was now king of kings.I set about buying things, often things I didn’t really need, just for the pound coins in the change. This car park was council run, which, unfairly perhaps, diminished my faith in the ticket machine trouble being tackled any time soon. I went to a community event, a talk about something, which was interesting enough, but not half as satisfying as the pound coins filling my pockets thanks to the change I’d been given at the door for my £20 note – the only denomination which I’d accidentally on purpose come out with.But the car park remained coin only, so demand persistently trumped supply. I tipped out the huge jar of miscellaneous change by the door. Therein, it turned out, were the coins of many countries, as well as the odd battery. Most of them, a huge pile, were British. But there were no pound coins. I had a bright idea. In the corner of my local Sainsbury’s there was a coin machine, dispenser, changer, whatever. I’d noticed it for years. Now was its moment. I filled my pockets with all the shrapnel, tightened my belt so my trousers didn’t fall down, and off I went, hoping not to be stopped by police in search of arcade robbers.I wasn’t, but what I found was almost as odd. This machine is run by a company called Coinstar. I assumed you bunged in your assorted coins and got nice notes, or even (please God) pound coins back. I didn’t think, naively perhaps, that I’d be charged for this service. But it turns out they charge a 39p transaction fee and an 11.75% processing fee if you want cash, or 8.9% if you want to give it to charity. I might be missing something here, but I can’t get my head around this. If you’re frugal enough to hoard your small change, why on earth would you pay someone to count it for you? According to Coinstar’s website, in 2019 it processed more than a billion coins in Western Europe alone. I mean, fair play, nice work if you can get it – #SoMoneyPossibilities as it says on the machine – but honestly, what’s wrong with people?To find out, I’ve been spending too much time loitering around their machines waiting to question potential users. But security staff keep giving me odd looks before anyone turns up. I remain baffled.As for me, I refuse to take part. I’ve piled my small change into one pound piles by the door and, slowly but surely, spending them where I can.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMoneyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But spend any time among the young people in these places, and you’ll notice an unmistakable similarity: a generation alienated from mainstream parties, with a vocal minority who find Reform’s message appealing.Despite differences in demographics, young people in both areas are politically apathetic on the left as well as the right. At the University of Bath, the Conservative Associationhas welcomed Reform sympathisersbut remains tiny. Far more students support the Left Union, but it still finds it difficult to channel that support into organised struggle. At Your Party meetings in both locations, meanwhile, turnout from young people is sparse.It’s not that young people are flocking to Reform, but that parliamentary politics itself feels exhausted. Whether it’s the cost of rent in Bath or the scarcity of permanent work on the Isle of Wight, people see problems piling up and Westminster seems increasingly ineffective at resolving them. For some, Reform offers a narrative of rebellion, a way for people to vocalise their frustration, even if its targets are misplaced. But for most, disengagement is the name of the game. This isn’t to say that political energy has disappeared altogether. For example, local debates and campaigns around public transportation – ferries on the Island and buses in Bath – draw intense passion, including from young people. What’s dying isn’t politics per se, but faith in a parliamentary system that feels detached from people’s actual lives.The answer won’t come from rebranding the same parties or lamenting extremism. We must rebuild politics where people are already fighting: in workplaces, universities and community campaigns. These are the spaces filled with potential, where we can organise together to improve our conditions. This won’t reach everyone – some will remain drawn to Reform’s simplistic answers – but it offers the only credible alternative: a politics rooted in solidarity rather than scapegoating.Enough theory! It’s time for the left to tell a compelling storyTalia WoodinTalia Woodin, 26, is an environmental activist based in north-east LondonHow can we convince people to change their minds about political and social issues? In the years I’ve spent campaigning, I’ve realised that the most effective strategy is storytelling. A compelling narrative is often the best way of encouraging people to look anew at an issue, or of winning them round to your way of seeing the world. Terrifyingly, the far right often does this most effectively.Its straightforward and digestible narrative cuts through because it speaks directly to feelings of neglect and disenfranchisement that are particularly widespread among young people. Its messaging offers apparent solutions that don’t require a deep understanding of political theory to grasp. Meanwhile, the left gets tangled up in internal debates and abstract theories of change, losing sight of the need to meet people where they are – recognising their immediate material and emotional realities, and building up from there.True change emerges from the ground up. We only need look at the recent controversies around Your Party to illustrate how party politics more often than not leads to disappointment. Even so, the remarkable recent performance of the Green party highlights the power of narrative. Zack Polanski has reached people through his simplicity and sincerity. In a recent interview with Channel 4, Polanski stated: “Nigel Farage is a one-man show, if I’m a one-man show I’ve absolutely failed as a leader.” It was the perfect encapsulation of what politics should be about – a statement about representation and participation that was almost impossible to refute from any end of the political spectrum.In today’s climate of increasing social and economic instability, reimagining what it means to be British could be a starting point for challenging the divisive and persecutory language of Reform and the hard right. A video released by the Trades Union Congress last weekthat highlighted a workplace friendshipbetween third-generation Irish and first-generation Pakistani colleagues was an effective example of this. By telling these sorts of stories, we can begin to replace fear and exclusion with empathy, connection and a shared sense of belonging.We must be proactive in exposing Reform’s failuresMaebh CareyMaebh Carey, 19 and based in Gateshead, is an organiser for the Youth Equality CoalitionFor the past five months, I’ve been working with the Youth Equality Coalition (YEC), which unites leftwing young people against far-right activism. We put young people in contact with one another and help them organise demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine and asylum seekers, and we’ve been removing flags that were put up by the campaign group “Operation Raise the Colours”.Much of the anger we see in modern Britain stems from a sense of isolation. Cuts to youth clubs and the more recent effects of the cost of living crisis have robbed young people of the opportunity to socialise, feeding into a collective sense of apathy about politics. Given how fragile the social fabric feels in Britain, it’s no wonder that so many people are now retreating online, where conspiracies and far-right content flourish.Yet community-building alone isn’t enough. To stop the ascendancy of the hard right, it’s important to show the public what it would mean in government. The YEC has highlighted stories about the resentment synonymous with Reform, such asprotests against Durham county council, a Reform-led council that recentlyabandoned its climate pledges. As the hard right achieves power and subsequently flounders, reporting its ineptitude will allow voters to make informed electoral choices.Crucially – and this is where national politics comes in – it’s vital that we address the grievances that the right has so deftly exploited. Reform performs well in areas that areeconomically stagnantand oftendeindustrialised, and those voting for the party often see no solutions in mainstream politics. To counter its rise, our government should be properly funding public services, tackling the scourge of poverty and creating opportunities for young people in work and education. We all deserve better than the current status quo.Young people just don’t take Labour seriously any moreRohan SathyamoorthyRohan Sathyamoorthy, 20, is a student from south-west LondonThe recent news that Conservative student societies arestrugglingin the face of competition from Reform is just one sign of young people’s growing disillusionment with mainstream politics. Faced with sky-high rents, soaring tuition fees andcollapsing graduate job opportunities, is it any wonder that they are defecting from the UK’s formerly dominant parties?It’s worth remembering that this exodus is mostly to parties on the left. A recent YouGov poll of those aged 18-24 showed that 36% of young peoplewould vote for the Green partyin a general election, while only 8% would vote for Reform.Labour is just as much a victim of this growing disillusionment as the Conservatives. In some university campuses, left-leaning societies have replaced Labour Students: over the summer, the Manchester, Newcastle and Warwick Labour societies allsevered ties with the Labour party.This disaffection has been building for years, as mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions that tangibly improve young people’s prospects or quality of life. During the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris showed the world what happens when the establishment relies solely on chastising the right while offering little in the way of an alternative. A fatigue has set in among young people. We’ve been ignored and told that our demands – whether it’s a reduction in tuition fees, or political recognition of Israel’s genocidal crimes in Gaza – are too radical to be taken seriously. Only this month, for example, the liberal heroine Hillary Clinton said that students opposed to Israelwere “deeply misinformed”and falling for TikTok propaganda on behalf of the Chinese state.The resulting political vacuum will be filled by whoever dares to try. Ultimately, today’s young people reflect the political realities of a society in a state of terminal decline, and won’t be stopped by any amount of condemnation or intimidation from established institutions. As long as the status quo works against their interests, young people will keep looking for alternatives.Labour’s stale messaging ignores young people who need a futureXavi MesquitaXavi Mesquita, 20, is a student at the University of Edinburgh and a freelance writerReform has exploited the sense in which everything, from work to relationships, is now precarious. Ever since the pandemic, young people have been spending more time alone, scrolling endlessly through other people’s lives. Farage meets their alienation head-on. The Reform “doers and achievers” promise change for a stalled generation, while Farage rhapsodises about entrepreneurial ambition on TikTok feeds and self-help podcasts. He has positioned himself as the straight-talking champion of the left behind, strategically turning their alienation into a story of pride, grievance and aspiration.Labour’s leadership, by contrast, feels managerial and airless. Ministers speak of “missions”, “foundations” and “working people” – abstract platitudes remote enough to convince anyone under 30 that nothing ever really changes. Whether it’s red or blue in power, politics appears washed out. That’s not only a political problem, but a cultural one. “Politics is downstream from culture,” or so the Breitbart doctrine goes. If so, Labour must reclaim the zeitgeist in a way that it is failing to do. The far right is growing not because of policy suggestions, but because its story is simple, emotional and everywhere.Rather than condemn young people turning to populism, progressives should see hope in their desire for alternatives and build from it. That starts with visible investment – in social housing, youth services and spaces where community can exist. The adults may be back in charge, but early retirement looms unless they discover what it means to speak to a future, not just manage decline.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe panelReform UKLabourGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

The question is not only what Epstein’s associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that hehad “no idea”about Epstein’s crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats’release of emailsin which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn’t barked”, adding that “[victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the lateVirginia Giuffre, who told lawyersthat “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief –abruptly changed their mindsthis year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of theMaga far rightjoining Democrats.The Republicans took a drubbing inoff-year electionslast week, and Mr Trump’s approval rating isthe lowest of this term. Theending of the longest government shutdownin history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll’ssuccessful civil suitagainst him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) andtwo dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein’s circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it’s hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such asAndrew Mountbatten-Windsorand Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims anddogged reportingto make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromPat ReadyandPete LavenderThu 13 Nov 2025 12.33 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 13.00 ESTShareAndré Corrêa do Lago, the president of the Cop30 climate conference, is right to suggest that enthusiasm for combating climate change is draining away in richer countries (Report, 10 November). And it’s not just governments. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’slatest reporton corporate governance and sustainability suggests that the issue is losing ground in boardrooms.We are not going to achieve the transition to a sustainable future quickly enough when only 8% of global patents are green. Innovation in climate and environmental technologies, which must be the foundation of a credible transition, is simply not happening quickly enough. Without stronger incentives for green research and development, and sharing the fruits of that work, the current trajectory risks locking firms into incremental rather than transformative change.TheOECDdid report a welcome rise in board sustainability committees, and more companies now include sustainability performance metrics in executive pay packages. However, the evidence around their effectiveness remains limited. These governance mechanisms are likely to be largely symbolic unless backed by measurable outcomes and genuine integration of sustainability into strategic decision-making.This takes on an even bleaker hue when it is remembered that the data-gathering for the OECD report largely predates Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.Early research around his administration’s impact concluded that while only a minority of companies are explicitly scaling back their environmental efforts, greenhushing is on the rise, and several climate initiatives have collapsed. We are at a critical juncture. If these trends persist, global efforts, including through the Cop process, to accelerate the climate transition might not only slow down, but go into reverse.Sonia FalconieriProfessor in corporate finance, Bayes Business SchoolRe your report (Tussles break out between protesters and security at Cop30 in Brazil, 12 November), my daughter-in-law is attending some sessions with Indigenous groups at the Cop30 meeting, supporting my granddaughter, who is translating, and explains that some of the anger was because access to the Blue Zone was restricted to those who had passports, and of course many Indigenous leaders do not have passports – nor are they required to do so in their own country.I’m told that the Brazilian government had tried to get this rule waived by the UN for certain sectors, but without success. No wonder “Nothing about us without us” still needs to be said forcefully.Pat ReadyWelling, LondonI am delighted to see officials at Cop30 getting behind a global forest fund (How could Tropical Forest Forever fund proposed at Cop30 tackle deforestation?, 6 November).

The strength of the case is not in doubt; the issue is lack of political will to legislate. Perhaps there is more will now than ever, with results from the 2024 general election and wide-ranging Electoral Calculus forecasts pushing parties currently against proportional representation to reconsider.Labour’s position is clearly crucial. Based on the forecasts, PR offersLaboura hedge against a doomsday scenario of losing up to 90% of its seats. All those who favour change must hope that Labour’s leadership, even if they do not support electoral reform in principle, will adopt it for pragmatic reasons, closing their minds to conventional wisdom that voting for change is like turkeys voting for Christmas. In any event, Christmas will arrive; the central issue is how happy it will be for those formerly known as “the two main parties”.John CulleyBarcombe, East SussexAndy Beckett is right to argue that a more diverse and fluid politics under proportional representation may become more appealing. And more fair. The 2024 election result was the most disproportionate in our history, leaving 57.8% of voters unrepresented in that the candidate they voted for was not elected.The risk of continuing with the current system is that the first of any number of smaller disparate groups to pass the post may well end up forming the next government in the face of an alarming number of electors who did not vote for them.If you want to see how the last election might have panned out under PR, the Electoral Reform Society’s website gives agraphic breakdown of the projected results.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, much more needs to be done to build regional capacity for medicine and vaccine production, improve the accessibility, effectiveness and robustness of indigenous health systems, and scale up proven prevention initiatives aimed at reducing future pandemics, illness and death. These are the very actions that will be sacrificed to protect the ongoing purchase of life-saving commodities.For example, the fund’scurrent strategystresses the importance of improving indoor air quality to avert the spread of known pathogens such as those causing tuberculosis, flu and Covid, and to build resilience against future pandemic pathogens. However, I can see no targets, indicators, budgets or activities aimed at addressing this urgent need among the fund’s ownmonitoring tools.The need to build strong health systems, as well as capacity for localised production of pharmaceutical and medical technology, to shift away from dependence on the fickle largesse of wealthier nations, was very well laid out in the recent Guardian long read by Mara Kardas-Nelson on her experience in Sierra Leone and elsewhere (‘They take the money and go’: why not everyone is mourning the end of USAID, 4 November).Our leaders’ vision for global health and pandemic prevention needs to look beyond the illusion of short-term savings and scale up effective, accessible treatment and prevention to protect us all.Desmond WhymsFormerhealth adviser, Department for International DevelopmentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I appreciate that my perspective was included, and I stand by my belief that “AI will be as common in healthcare as the stethoscope”.Reinhart rightly points out that there are serious risks in deploying new technologies in our profit-driven, time-constrained healthcare system. But to judge the risks of genAI accurately, we need to first acknowledge the unnecessary errors and deaths that occur today. And then we must ask whether this technology will make those problems worse or make medical care safer.In the United States, 400,000 people die each year from misdiagnoses. Another 250,000 die from preventable medical errors. People with chronic diseases (lifelong conditions that affect them daily) are often seen only once every four to six months, with no evaluation or treatment modifications in between. Over time, blood pressure remains elevated, blood sugar levels stay uncontrolled and chronic heart failure worsens. The result: hundreds of thousands of avoidable heart attacks, strokes, cancers and kidney failures each year.GenAI can help. Patients can receive timely, reliable guidance, while physicians can be alerted to early warning signs and adjust medications before irreversible harm happens. Likewise, individuals with mental health conditions can access support at night when anxiety or depression worsens and the only option is the emergency room.Instead of replacing physicians, genAI can fill the gaps when clinicians are unavailable. Rather than framing the future as either/or (ie clinicians or AI) it should be both/and. The combination of dedicated clinicians, empowered patientsandgenAI will lead to safer, higher-quality and more accessible care than any of the three can achieve alone.Reinhart’s essay raises important questions, and we should keep discussing them. But rejecting genAI won’t protect patients. It will harm them by allowing today’s problems to become worse.DrRobert PearlLos Gatos, CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareHealthArtificial intelligence (AI)lettersShareReuse this content"

Thomas Tuchel’s team can only beat what is in front of them and they had done that with sufficient regularity to guarantee theirplace at the finalsnext summer with two matches to spare.It made for the question. Could they do it on a soggy midweek night when most of the people outside their camp did not care? The answer was yes, even if it was not a performance or an occasion to quicken the pulse or live for any length of time in the memory. The serious business is to come.Five pointers for Thomas Tuchel: England’s race for No 10 hots upRead moreTuchel had demanded energy, a finessing of the connections between his players, a reinforcement of the identity he has wanted to emerge from the autumn programme. It did not completely happen like that. Too often, the final pass was missing. But what the manager did get was another win and another clean sheet. Count seven of each from seven qualifiers. The final one is against Albania in Tirana on Sunday. And, also, two lovely goals.Bukayo Saka got the first in the 28th minute with a volley that was marked by trademark technique. And Eberechi Eze, who came on as part of a quadruple substitution on 65 minutes that also included Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, scored the second in stoppage time.Serbia wanted a foul for a shirt pull by Bellingham but he played on to Foden, who operated as a false 9, winning praise from Tuchel. When Foden found Eze, the first-time curler for the far corner was too much for theSerbiagoalkeeper, Predrag Rajkovic. It was a moment of impressive incision on the counterattack and went a long way towards elevating the tone of it all.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford charges down the wing for England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianTuchel’s headline selection call had been to name the recalled Bellingham as a substitute, the manager retaining Morgan Rogers as the No 10 in his starting lineup. How could Tuchel have put Bellingham straight back in? It would have undermined so much of what he has preached. Rogers had been excellent as a starter in the previous three matches, won by scorelines of 5-0, 3-0 and 5-0. The first of those had been the transformative result against Serbia in Belgrade.Bellingham got arguably the loudest cheer of the night when he was introduced, although the bar was low in this regard, Wembley pretty subdued, quite a few empty seats. It was always going to be on Tuchel’s players to spark the supporters, not the other way around. The motivation had to come from within. Really, it was about getting the job done.The first paper plane from the stands was cheered on to the fringes of the pitch in the 19th minute and it was certainly a sleepy start, despite the best efforts of Elliot Anderson and Rogers to inject a bit of tempo. Or England’s desire to open up the game with raking long diagonals.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze curls in England’s second goal to secure victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSaka cut through the torpor. From a Declan Rice free-kick, it was a poor punch under no pressure from Rajkovic, which located the debutant left-back, Nico O’Reilly, on the edge of the box and his shot deflected out to Saka on the right. It is a movement that Saka has practised over and over again. The quick adjustment of the feet. The opening up of his body. The left-foot volley, almost caressed into the far corner.England made a few inroads up the left, Marcus Rashford flickering, trying his tricks. O’Reilly saw a deflected cross fly at the outside of the near post – from the corner, Harry Kane headed wide – while Rashford had shot too close to Rajkovic on 25 minutes. It was a shame that Rashford fluffed a pass to Rice on a break before the interval. Rogers also glanced a header wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pace was there from him; the willingness to run at his full-back. The end product was erratic.It was Serbia’s first game under thenew manager, Veljko Paunovic, and the importance of it could not be overstated. The visitors had arrived in London determined to keep alive their slim hopes of a playoff spot. By the end, with Albania beating Andorra, it was over for them.In the England goal, it was yet another quiet night for Jordan Pickford. He had entered the game on the back of a record nine consecutive clean sheets. The last time he conceded for his country was in October last year in theNations League defeathere against Greece. England’s defenders barely ceded an inch.Serbia wondered whether they could produce one moment and it almost came in the 63rd minute when Filip Kostic crossed after a rare break. Dusan Vlahovic flicked wide of the far post. Serbia pushed a little more towards the end; everything was on the line for them but they never truly looked like scoring.Eze made a difference. On for Rashford, he went close after Bellingham had got the ball back from Reece James’s outrageous flick. Foden was off target with a header and Eze hit the crossbar after good buildup work from Bellingham and Foden. When he was played in again by the pair, the finish was a beauty.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersEnglandSerbiamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, because he was shown a straight red card for violent conduct the forward could face a three-match ban.In that case, Ronaldo would miss Portugal’s first two World Cup group stage game should they top their qualification group, as the suspension would carry over to the tournament. If they were to drop to second in the Group F and reach the tournament through the playoffs, Ronaldo would then be available for the start even if his suspension was extended.Hallgrímsson said after the game he may have got into Ronaldo’s head. Ronaldo spoke to the Icelander pointedly as he made his way off the pitch and asked afterwards what he had said, Hallgrímsson revealed: “He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee.“It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card. It had nothing to do with me – unless I got into his head.”Portugal’s manager, Roberto Martínez, said: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games – I think that just deserves credit – and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.“He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender …“I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don’t think it’s an elbow, I think it’s a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow.”Francebooked a spot for their eighth consecutive World Cup after a Kylian Mbappé double helped to secure a 4-0 home victory againstUkraineLes Bleus, who are unbeaten in a Euro or World Cup qualifying game since 2019, will be seeded when the draw for the tournament is made on 5 December.Captain Mbappé scored either side of Michael Olise’s 76th-minute goal, before Hugo Ekitike added a late fourth.Francetop Group D with 13 points from five games and have an unassailable six-point lead over second-placed Iceland.

Italy need to beat both Moldova andNorwayin their remaining two qualifiers and overturn a 19-goal deficit to leapfrog the Norwegians and snatch the automatic qualifying spot.The visitors initially denied the hosts the space and rhythm they have so often exploited during this qualification campaign. Oscar Bobb missed the best chance to put Norway ahead when he struck the woodwork with a low cross just before half-time. The home crowd, expecting a comfortable lead, made their frustration clear, greeting the whistle with loud boos as the players headed towards the dressing room.Five minutes after the restart, loud cheers erupted around the stadium after Sander Berge swung in a cross in front of the box that Sørloth headed in to break the deadlock. Barely two minutes later, Sørloth guided a second header home.From then on there was no stopping Norway. The Estonian defence fell apart, and another driven cross found Haaland, who powered in yet another header to give Norway a 3-0 lead in the 56th minute. Haaland added another in the 62nd minute before Robi Saarma pulled one back for Estonia just two minutes later.NigeriabeatGabon4-1 in their World Cup African qualifying playoff semi-final in Rabat, but they needed extra time before running out comfortable winners.The striker Akor Adams snapped up a shallow back pass from Gabon’s defender Aaron Appindangoyé and caught the goalkeeper Loyce Mbaba way out of his goal for an easy tap-in for Nigeria’s opening goal in the 78th minute.

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) has held emergency meetings with referee representatives, but clubs continue to highlight controversial decisions.So how did it come to this? Relations between referees and clubs have never been warm in Portugal – some clubs have historically demanded behind closed doors that certain officials be kept off their games and in late July Benfica publicly criticised the appointment of Fábio Veríssimo for their Super Cup game against Sporting. Yet in recent weeks things have reached boiling point.I’d rather Van Dijk’s goal stood, but it wasn’t a clear and obvious error to deny him | Chris FoyRead moreOn 2 November Veríssimo accused Porto of pressuring him by broadcasting a replay of a disallowed goal on a television in his dressing room during half-time. With the game goalless, Veríssimo had blown for a foul after a Porto player collided with the Braga goalkeeper, ruling out a goal scored from the loose ball. According to Veríssimo’s official report, the television could not be turned off.Veríssimo said that after the match, which Porto won 2-1, the screen switched to showing footage from a youth match between Porto and Benfica in 2024, which he had also officiated. In that game, he allowed a similar goal – in Benfica’s favour – after contact with Porto’s goalkeeper inside the six-yard box.Benfica and Sporting have since accused Porto of trying to intimidate Veríssimo, and Sporting suggested the victory should be annulled if Porto were found guilty of wrongdoing.Porto, in their only public comment, did not deny Veríssimo’s account. They released a statement listing penalties, red cards and other contentious calls they claim have gone against the club this season. Addressing Veríssimo directly, Porto accused him of threatening club officials in a previous game and of seeking “revenge” during the Braga match.Veríssimo has not responded publicly but the FPF has defended the referees and continues to investigate the allegations related to the dressing room television.André Villas-Boas, Porto’s president, said the club would look into that too.Tensions further escalated a week later when, during Benfica’s match against Casa Pia, a referee was allegedly threatened by a Benfica executive after awarding a controversial penalty. “You are a fucking embarrassment,” one Benfica official was reported to have said. Benfica were leading 2-0 and their joy when the spot-kick was saved turned to despair when the defender Tomás Araújo slammed the ball into his own net in trying to clear. A stoppage-time equaliser gave Casa Pia a draw.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s José Mourinho confronts Gustavo Correia.Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty ImagesJosé Mourinho, Benfica’s head coach, was involved in a brief post-match exchange with the referee, Gustavo Correia, though nothing unusual was recorded. The FPF is investigating both matters. Benfica wrote on their website above the video highlights that the referee had “awarded a penalty to the visitors without justification”.Pedro Henriques, a former top-flight referee and former lieutenant colonel in the Portuguese army, believes acts of intimidation are nothing new – just more sophisticated. “We’ve moved from the traditional kicking down the locker-room door, common in the 90s, to looping images on a television that can’t be turned off,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This behaviour goes largely unpunished, with fines and suspensions for the biggest clubs minimal and delayed.“Presidents and club directors do this to show off, to say: ‘We’re watching them, we’ll scare them,’” Henriques says. “But, the truth is, the chance of that actually influencing a referee is 0.0%.”Even with VAR, mistakes happen. Last weekend Sporting were incorrectly awarded a late corner at Santa Clara – and scored the winning goal from it. The margin for error, Henriques notes, has never been smaller. The award of corners is not covered by VAR but Henriques says: “The supporter’s logic is: if the ref makes a mistake and VAR doesn’t correct it, then the referees must be corrupt.”In response, the Portuguese Referees’ Association last weekend staged a symbolic protest, match officials walking on to the pitch without the teams in the top two divisions – a coordinated act of defiance meant to signal they will not be intimidated.Referees, usually the quietest figures on the field, have found their voice. The head of the FPF’s refereeing council has defended them publicly, revealing that 97% of refereeing decisions in the first 10 rounds were correct. Threatened officials, he said, would continue to be assigned matches.The protests have yet to affect the games but Portuguese football is playing on the edge – and the next whistle could spark more than just another controversy.Explore more on these topicsRefereesEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Accomplishment?’” he says. “Like, it’s amazing. Being a part of this England squad at the minute is amazing and I couldn’t wish for anything else, really. And now to be a part of an Ashes squad, going to Australia’s own backyard and playing against them … I just can’t wait for the next couple of months.”Tongue can expect the excitement to be sustained for a bit longer than that. When the England and WalesCricketBoard announced this year’s batch of central contracts at the start of the month most of the two-year deals, reserved for the nation’s most integral players, went to core members of the white-ball squad, many of them also in the first-choice Test side.There were a few exceptions: Gus Atkinson, an occasional limited-overs international but established as a key member of the red-ball team, and Ben Stokes, the Test captain, were two. And then, finally, an injury-prone 27-year-old who has played six Tests in two and a half years and never had a sniff in any other format. It seems someone, somewhere, has a lot of faith in Josh Tongue.You get the sense that the player himself does not require much by way of affirmation. He carries his confidence, as he does most things, quietly, but when conversation turns to subjects that might be sources of insecurity – the frailty of his own body, say, or the moment earlier this year when, in the most high-profile situation possible, he appeared to completely lose his ability to determine the direction in which the ball left his hand – there seems to be none. After all, why interpret sustaining injuries as proof of weakness when you can see your recovery from them as demonstrations of strength?View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue bowls during day three of the 5th Test against India at The Oval in August.Photograph: Gareth Copley/ECB/Getty Images“I think with my first proper injury in my shoulder, that thoracic outlet syndrome, getting through that first big injury has helped me a lot,” he says. “I was out for over 18 months and I was close to retiring, speaking to loads of people. I didn’t know what was going to happen to my career, I was looking for other things to do if worst comes to worst. Obviously every injury is horrible, no one wants to get injured, but I feel like that first one prepped me well for my second and third one.”Tongue admits that there were, briefly, some doubts when he was first called into the Test side, for the one-off match against Ireland in 2023, just the ninth first-class game he had played after returning from his shoulder injury.“I was thinking: ‘Am I good enough to play for England?’” he says. “But I just knew that I had to be diligent with my prep, trust my processes, do what I’ve done to get myself in this position, don’t change who I am. Because that’s not me as a person. I’m very introverted and I just want to do what I do best really, and not change who I am.”There is a conflict here, between the introvert and the entertainer, an inherently quiet soul whose job involves performing for thousands. At the Oval this summer there was a moment when any faults in his composure might have widened into serious fissures, a nine-ball, 12-run over in the Test against India that contained two humiliatingly wild deliveries, each disappearing down the leg side for five wides. But Tongue did not falter, and soon produced stunning, unplayable deliveries to dismiss Sai Sudharsan and Ravindra Jadeja.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue during a nets session at Old Trafford in July.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images“Growing up as a kid, I’ve always been introverted,” he says. “But I feel like when I step out on to that pitch, things just change. I feel like if I open the game up, that brings a different side of me. It’s different on the pitch, off the pitch. Because the main reason I play cricket is to enjoy playing cricket, to have a smile on my face. It’s very rare I haven’t got a smile on my face, even if it isn’t going well, which has happened this year as well.“Especially in that India game at the Oval, those wides down the leg side. I was standing at the top of my mark in that game and I was just like, look around you, you’re playing in front of thousands of people. Enjoy the moment, you never know how long it’s going to last.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I just went back to that and got those two quick wickets. I feel like sometimes I am a bit of an over-thinker. And with the amount of people watching you as well, you want to impress them so I feel like sometimes I put a bit too much pressure on myself. But also I know when to just be nice and chilled, and I’m a chilled guy. Just enjoy every single minute of it.”It must help that, in Brendon McCullum, England have a coach whose guiding philosophy is the removal of pressure, and encouraging his teams to play without fear. “Definitely,” Tongue says. “In that spell [against India] I bowled really good balls, play-and-misses, nicking people off, and he always reminds me about that sort of stuff, to make me feel good within myself. He’s very good at that.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue batting at the Oval against India.Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images for Surrey CCC“I still remember the first chat he had with everyone, introducing me to the group at Lord’s before the Ireland Test. You just want to lock in and listen to him, no distractions. You listen to every single word he says, and he pumps your tyres up as well. That’s what makes you feel so much better, knowing he’s behind you, knowing you’re good enough to be here and sort of just change matches on their head. I feel like I’ve done that well so far.”With shoulder, pectoral and hamstring injuries now behind him, Tongue goes into the Ashes as part of a miraculously injury-free seam-bowling group that includes Jofra Archer (“Amazing”), Mark Wood (“Unbelievable”), Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Matt Potts, as well as Stokes. Most of them were in New Zealand during the recent white-ball series, building their workloads before moving to Perth. “We thrive off each other. We all want everyone to do well,” Tongue says. “Obviously you want your name on the team sheet, but we all celebrate everyone’s successes.”For now, though, Tongue is quietly celebrating his own. “I’ve always wanted to play in an away Ashes. I think it’s everyone’s dream to play in the Ashes,” he says. “It’s a massive thing for English cricket. As a young kid, my idol was Fred Flintoff. Watching those moments, they were just amazing. And just to be involved, even if I don’t play one game, just to be involved in the Ashes is incredible.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia cricket teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

She received warm applause when her name was announced on the par-4 10th tee and again after she drove it safely into the fairway, one of the few calm moments in a jittery start.Why is Maga-land so obsessed with Kai Trump turning 18? Do you really need to ask? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTrump confessed afterward she was more nervousthan when she spoke at the Republican National Convention last yearand it showed. She bogeyed her opening four holes, a run of tentative strokes that left her scrambling before she had taken a fifth swing from a fairway. A steady par at the par-5 14th finally stopped the slide, and she mixed two more bogeys with a pair of pars, including a sharp up-and-down at the par-3 16th that drew one of the biggest roars of the early afternoon. She reached the turn in 41.Her mother, Vanessa, and University of Miami assistant coach Jim Garren walked inside the ropes throughout – one day after Miami formally announced her commitment to join the Hurricanes for the 2026–27 season. WhatGolfChannel commentators described as the day’s largest gallery trailed along, a mix of supporters, skeptics and onlookers aware that her exemption had dominated American golf discourse for weeks.The LPGA’s television window expired after Trump’s first hole, an awkward scheduling outcome given the buzz surrounding her debut, but it did nothing to slow the crowds. Fans pressed up against the ropes on nearly every fairway.The back nine offered more turbulence. Trump dropped a shot immediately after the turn, then ran into real trouble with two double-bogeys over her next four holes. On the par-4 eighth – her 17th – a topped iron produced an audible gasp, only for her to answer with her crispest swing of the day, knocking the following shot to four feet despite Trump looking straight into the sun. Two more bogeys at the finish left her at 83, the highest score of the day.“The whole time I was nervous without a doubt,” Trump said. “But I thought I did pretty good for a first time, being the youngest player in the field. Now I kind of know how it goes.”View image in fullscreenUniversity of Miami commit Kai Trump plays a sand shot on the first hole at The Annika tournament on Thursday.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesHer presence has split opinion across the US golf establishment. Some analysts argued that the combination of Donald Trump’s granddaughter in the field and WNBA star Caitlin Clark in the pro-am made this one of the tour’s most talked-about weeks in recent memory. Others questioned whether a player ranked No 461 in the American Junior Golf Association should occupy a late-season spot in a field where professionals are fighting for season-ending accolades and – for some – their jobs next year.Tournament host Annika Sorenstam defended the decision, urging critics to “give this girl a chance.” Pelican Golf Club owner Dan Doyle Jr, whose club controlled the exemption, said Trump’s presence had already driven a noticeable surge in attention, particularly across social media, where she has more than nine million followers. “She’s lovely to speak with,” Doyle said. “And this has created a buzz on top of the other great players we have here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On three occasions last year he was part of teams narrowly edged out in the final stages by the All Blacks in Dunedin, Auckland and London but says England are now significantly better placed to seal the deal on Saturday.Scott Barrett fit to return and captain All Blacks against England at TwickenhamRead more“I think we’re ready,” said Itoje as England put the finishing touches to their big game preparations at their hotel base in Bagshot. “New Zealand are a good team, no doubt about that. They possess enough talent, accuracy and power to hurt any team but I think we’re ready to take that next step.“I think we have a clearer understanding of how we want to play and more belief in what we do and how we do it. The quality of the playing squad has improved and with the experiences we’ve all had over the last year or so we’re just more equipped to take advantage of opportunities at hand.”Itoje’s optimism is also based on England’s growing strength in depth, particularly off the bench, compared with 12 months ago. They were leading in the second half of all three of their Tests against New Zealand last year, only to fail to score a point in the final quarter of all those contests.In Dunedin theylost 16-15after Marcus Smith’s goalkicking radar deserted him, while in Auckland they were in front 17-13 beforegoing down 24-17, missing out on a possible late penalty try which might have secured them a draw.Then there was the frustrating24-22 home reversethis time last year when George Ford narrowly missed a late penalty and a drop-goal opportunity which could have yielded a first triumph over the All Blacks at Twickenham since 2012. Add everything together and there is no escaping England’s desire to go one better now.Itoje, though, is fully aware there will inevitably be twists and turns along the way: “Playing against the All Blacks, you need to be sharp mentally and you need to execute when you get your opportunities because you don’t get many of them. So when they come we need to make sure we execute. We need to have a physical intensity as well as an accuracy to what we do.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand players show their delight at winning at Twickenham last year.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images“I think we had the belief we could do it last year and if maybe one or two things went the other way, it could have been a different conversation we’re having now. But throughout this year we’ve had a number of challenging games and a number of challenging experiences, and I think we’re beginning to learn from them.”England, however, have managed only eight wins over New Zealand in the long history of this fixture. In Japan they famously stood in a V-for-victory formation to face the All Blacks’ pre-game haka but what Itoje remembers most is the pre-match feeling of certainty in the winning dressing room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was one of those weird games where they had periods on top but it felt like there was only one outcome. Hopefully we can do something similar this weekend.”Advantage England? Emma Raducanu gives tips to squad for All Blacks clashRead moreTo that end, England’s focus in camp has been on keeping as calm as possible at pivotal moments. More broadly, it would also underline the progress Steve Borthwick’s side have been making this year, which has so far yielded nine successive wins – several of them secured late on – since their loss to Ireland in Dublin in February.“For me, it’s all about mental clarity,” stressed Itoje, who is set to win his 96th cap for England. “If you’ve played the whole game there’s a fatigue element in there but the ones who are able to see it through … there’s a toughness, there’s a mental clarity which gives you the ability to execute.“A number of Test matches are going down to the last quarter or the last 10 minutes, if not even less than that. In the last 15 minutes it’s the teams that can execute, keep their composure, don’t do erratic things, stick to task but also do all that at an incredibly high intensity that tend to be the ones that follow through and win.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Barretts must have some good skin.” His older brother Beauden will start at fly-half again, but younger brother Jordie is back in New Zealand having treatment on the ankle injury he suffered in that same match against Ireland.England play Generation Game against All Blacks with overhaul of traditional order of selection | Robert KitsonRead moreThe wing Caleb Clarke is also out injured, so Robertson has moved Leicester Fainga’anuku into the back three, and brought Billy Proctor in to play at outside-centre. Up front, Simon Parker comes into the back row, and Robertson has kept Wallace Sititi on the bench in a clear attempt to provide a counterweight to the strong set of replacements picked by his opposite number, Steve Borthwick. As well as Sititi, he has Anton Lienert-Brown and Damian McKenzie among the subs, too.Robertson says he has no concerns about picking Fainga’anuku on the wing: “Did you see him play the second Bledisloe Cup match?” Yeah, he was pretty handy on the left wing, he’s got power, he’s a left-footed kicker, and he’s playing good footy, so it’s his spot.”The All Blacks’ debrief after the Scotland game focused on the way the hosts had taken control of the match in the third quarter, when they came back from 17-0 down.“We looked at the momentum swings, and how they put pressure on us,” Robertson said. “The ability to get out of our own end cleanly was key for us, it just took longer than we’d planned for so we’ve done a bit of work on it this week and how to get the momentum back.”Quick GuideEngland v New Zealand teamsShowEngland:Steward; Roebuck, Lawrence, Dingwall, Feyi-Waboso; Ford, Mitchell; Baxter, George, Heyes; Itoje (c), Coles; Pepper, Underhill, EarlReplacements:Cowan-Dickie, Genge, Stuart, Cunningham-South, Curry, Pollock, Spencer, Marcus SmithNew Zealand:Jordan; Carter, Proctor, Tupaea, Fainga'anuku; Beauden Barrett, Roigard; De Groot, Taylor, Newell; Scott Barrett (c), Holland; Parker, Savea, LakaiReplacements:Taukei'aho, Williams, Tosi, Lord, Sititi, Ratima, Lienert-Brown, McKenzieWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The All Blacks are also preparing for an aerial contest. “England have got a great aerial game, Alex Mitchell’s a quality kicker,” Robertson said. “He puts it on the spot.

The health secretary dismissed the row as “yesterday’s news”.The prime minister apologised to the health secretary in a brief phone call with him late on Wednesday in which Streeting did not bring up McSweeney by name.TheGuardian reportedthat, in private meetings with MPs on Wednesday, the prime minister stood by McSweeney and would not directly commit to any consequences for those who had briefed the newspapers.Starmer was never meant to be Labour’s prime minister – his leadership was doomed from the start | Neal LawsonRead moreStarmer spoke to senior Downing Street staff on a video call on Thursday morning to stress that “briefings against cabinet ministers are completely unacceptable”, his deputy spokesperson said, adding that “the prime minister said he had been assured that no No 10 staff briefed against ministers” and that he accepted the assurances.Asked why Starmer had apologised to Streeting if he did not believe the health secretary had been briefed against by No 10, the spokesperson said the PM had “apologised for the situation that the health secretary was in”.Starmer, in a TV clip recorded during a visit to north Wales, told broadcasters he had warned his team against such briefings. He said: “I have been assured it didn’t come from Downing Street, but I have been equally clear that whether it is this case or any other, I intend to deal with it.”Asked if he would sack anyone found to have briefed, Starmer said he would “absolutely deal with anybody responsible for briefing against ministers”.One senior Labour source said they expected MPs would eventually turn their attention back to the budget – as well as significant immigration plans to be announced by the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chancellor suggested there would be a leak inquiry, though No 10 suggested the prime minister had already accepted assurances from his staff that they were not briefing against Streeting.“The prime minister was really clear yesterday that there is no place for that sort of briefing and that sort of behaviour, and I absolutely agree with the prime minister,” Reeves said.Cabinet ministers had been among those privately calling for McSweeney to be sacked in the aftermath of the story. But, on Thursday, several ministers said they were prepared to draw a line under the row. “I still think it’s a question of when, not if [there is a leadership challenge],” one said.Another senior MP said: “The only person who has emerged well out of this is Wes, which cannot have been the intention of those briefing.”MPs who spoke privately to Starmer on Wednesday said they believed the prime minister when he insisted he had not authorised the briefings. But another said it had been a test of resolve as to whether Starmer was prepared to root out who was briefing.“I don’t know what else we can say to him if he can’t even pretend those responsible will be sacked – he’s made Wes a martyr and there’s lots of people here saying how good he was on the radio,” said one MP who saw the prime minister on Wednesday.Another Labour source said that MPs who obsessed about the briefings were “asking the wrong questions”. “The drift in direction is the real government killer, not briefings. The question that should be worrying everyone is – why does this government feel so panicked and under siege? Because if they are, then we all are.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingMorgan McSweeneyRachel ReevesShabana MahmoodEd MilibandShareReuse this content"

But we will not accept anything less than what we already have.”At Cop30, countries are due to agree on a gender action plan to mainstream the experiences of women in climate action, and make the design of climate policy more inclusive.Many countries are now preparing to fend off attempts to narrowly define the term “gender” in the plan.Climate change amplifies inequalities, making the most disadvantaged and marginalised people also the most vulnerable and least likely to be able to adapt. Women aredisproportionately affectedby the impacts of climate breakdown, often because of their caring responsibilities and lack of power in society.In the climate negotiations, gender talks aim to address men’s and women’s different experiences of climate change, and countries have interpreted the discussions based on their national laws and cultural contexts.But aglobal rollback of women’s rightsand a growing backlash against gender equality have seengovernments like that of far-right president Javier Milei in Argentinastart questioning the legitimacy of the word “gender”.In preparatory talks for Cop30, Argentina and Paraguay requested the inclusion of footnotes in an informal note on the state of the negotiations to clarify their understanding of gender as referring to the female and male sexes.The Vatican, which rarely intervenes in climate negotiations, called for a reference to “sex” rather than “gender” during discussions on the need for disaggregated data.Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and Egypt havepreviously opposed references to gender, which is widely understood to reflect their opposition to the inclusion of trans and non-binary people.The US was absent from pre-Cop30 talks and Donald Trump, whose administration has repeatedly attacked women’s reproductive rights and is pulling the country out of the Paris climate accord for the second time,is not expected to send a delegation to the negotiations in Belém.Claudia Rubio Giraldo, of the Women’s Environment & Development Organization, which advocates for gender issues in the climate talks, said claims that the consensus-based negotiations are imposing an understanding of what gender means are “disingenuous”.“This attempt to impose a narrow definition of gender is a way to stall the negotiations, to burden the process and block more ambitious conversations,” she said.In contrast, some western delegations such as those from the EU, Norway and Canada want to broaden the scope of the discussion. They have called for language on “intersectionality”, references to women and girls “in all their diversity” and “gender-diverse” people. But this is also being met with strong pushback.Women’s rights advocates said governments should have a conversation on climate change and gender that supports everyone in society to respond and adapt to a warming world, taking into account peoples’ diverse identities and socioeconomic circumstances.“As women, we are not all the same,” said Aguilar. “In some countries, gender-responsive climate action is the difference between living and dying.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Yet, they are often excluded from decision-making andstill face hurdlesto participate in theUN climate talks.Only 3% of international climate aid going to transitioning communities: ‘This is absurd’Read moreChikondi Chabvuta-Mkawa, a women’s rights advocate from Malawi and the gender coordinator for a group of the 44 nations designated as “least developed countries”, said the row over the definition of gender was a distraction from ensuring measures to address inequalities are funded.Onlya small fractionof climate finance is flowing to projects aimed at addressing gender equality and women’s rights. In 2022,just 4%of government aid going to climate adaptation had a primary focus on gender.Developing countries want wealthier nations to help them finance measures that make gender considerations core to climate action.But wealthy nations argue that such decisions should be made in the finance negotiating rooms, not the gender rooms.“Financial and technical support is critical for us,” said Chabvuta-Mkawa. “Time and time again, women’s groups go unfunded and we end up in a cyclic poverty trap, which could be broken if the gender lens was applied to climate action,” she said.“Without a gender perspective, climate action is not effective,” Vanessa Dolce de Faria, Brazil’s high representative for gender affairs, saidin a social media post.“We have a historic window of opportunity to further consider the rights and challenge that women and girls face in relation to climate change.”Explore more on these topicsCop30WomenBrazilUnited NationsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It was only the second flight of the rocket thatJeff Bezos’s company andNasaare counting on to ferry people and supplies to the moon.The 321ft (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from the Cape Canaveral space force station, sending Nasa’s twin Mars orbiters on a long journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled for four days by inclement local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida.In a first for the fledgling company,Blue Originrecovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to how SpaceX rockets work. Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600km) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from launch control.Return of Chinese astronauts delayed after spacecraft struck by debrisRead more“Next stop, moon!” employees chanted following the booster’s bull’s-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket’s upper stage deployed the twoMarsorbiters in space, the mission’s main objective.The New Glenn’s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic.The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1m miles (1.5m kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet’s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also study how best to protect astronauts against Mars’s harsh radiation environment.“We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,” Escapade’s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. “Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we’re going to have two spacecraft at the same time.”The relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80m, is managed and operated by UC Berkeley. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but Nasa passed up that ideal launch window – Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years – because of feared delays with Blue Origin’s brand-new rocket.Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world, the New Glenn is five times bigger than Blue Origin’s New Shepard rockets that send wealthy clients to the edge of space from west Texas. Blue Origin plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on a demo mission in the coming months onboard the New Glenn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX beat out Blue Origin for the first and second crew landings, using its Starship rocket, nearly 100ft (30 meters) taller than Bezos’ New Glenn.But last month, Nasa’s acting administrator, Sean Duffy, reopened the contract for the first crewed moon landing, citing concern over the pace of the Starship’s progress in flight tests from Texas. Blue Origin as well as SpaceX have presented accelerated landing plans.Nasa is on track to send astronauts around the moon early next year using its own Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket. The next Artemis crew would attempt to land; the space agency is pressing to get astronauts back on the lunar surface by decade’s end in order to surpass a Chinese mission to do the same.Explore more on these topicsBlue OriginMarsNasaJeff BezosSpaceShareReuse this content"

In addition to new heavy ice breakers,Canada is weighing the purchase of a dozen patrol submarines.In thefederal budget unveiled last week, Canada announced a C$1bn (US$710m) Arctic infrastructure fund to help build new airports, seaports and all-season roads.Anita Anand, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, told reporters last week the Nato military alliance should devote effort to the Arctic, adding it “must be an organization not only that focuses on the eastern flank, but also that looks north”.In his speech, Rogers also said CSIS agents foiled attempts byRussiato illegally acquire Canadian goods and technologies for use in its war against Ukraine.“This year, CSIS took action to prevent this by informing several Canadian companies that Europe-based front companies seeking to acquire their goods were in fact connected to Russian agents,” he said, adding that the companies took immediate measures to deny the Russians.He also said that Chinese spies “have tried to recruit Canadians with information and military expertise”.In addition to threats fromChinaand Russia, Rogers said the agency foiled potentially lethal threats by Iran directed against dissidents.His remarks are the first public confirmation that the agency has intervened to protect Canada-based critics of Tehran. CSIS had said previously it was investigating Iranian threats, but did not mention specific threats.“In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we’ve had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime,” Rogers said.“In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating, and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada,” he said.Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012.

Researchers estimate 53,000 females died after bird flu hit in 2023.The population has now plummeted by 47%, researchers found. “It was quite a stark number,” said the lead author, Connor Bamford from the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. “I didn’t anticipate it to be this high.”In 2024, tourists on cruise ships said the explorer ErnestShackleton’s grave had become inaccessibleto visitors due to “dead seals blocking the way”. But Bamford said it was likely that many dead animals were never seen, having returned to the sea when they were sick to cool down.It is possible that direct losses from bird flu have been exacerbated by females becoming physically stressed and abandoning their pups.Drone footage of a wide bay with a low plain from the shore and snowy mountains in the backgroundSt Andrews Bay on South Georgia, which has one of the largest colonies of southern elephant seals and king penguins“We were aware there was a high level of mortality – way above normal levels – but it wasn’t until we got this before-and-after comparison that we could see how extensive it was,” said Bamford. In the long term, he said, it would have a “dramatic impact on the population”.The island in the South Atlantic is home to54% of the global breeding populationof elephant seals. The team used aerial imagery from three beaches to compare the breeding population from 2022 relative to 2024,according to the paper, published in the journal Communications Biology.There was a particularly high level of mortality among pups, and females take three to eight years to start breeding.“One of my colleagues is down there on a ship at the moment, and this year the count is lower than it was last year. That suggests the virus is circulating in the population,” said Bamford. “I wouldn’t say it’s over at all.”View image in fullscreenElephant seals stricken with avian flu at one of South Georgia’s largest colonies.

Sign up hereOliver Milmanin BelémThu 13 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 08.01 ESTShareUnder Donald Trump, America has not only jettisoned any effort to deal with the climate crisis, but has also attempted to stymie moves by other nations to shift to cleaner forms of energy, such as solar and wind.The climate crisis is “the greatest con job perpetrated by the world”, Trump told the UN in September, urging other governments to stick to oil and gas (preferably drilled in the US, of course) and ditch the “scam” of renewable energy.So, the US’s absence from the Cop30 climate summit under way in Belém, Brazil was initially met by other delegates here with a kind of relief akin to when the school bully takes a day off sick.More on what an absent America means for this year’s climate conference, after today’s climate headlines.Essential readsWorld still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report findsFossil fuel projects around the world threaten the health of 2bn peopleChina’s CO2 emissions have been flat or falling for past 18 months, analysis findsIn focusView image in fullscreenAn Indigenous person walks in the Cop30 village in Belém.Photograph: Adriano Machado/ReutersTrump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, said last week that Cop30 is “essentially a hoax” and while there is no US delegation for the first time ever at the annual talks, next year he might show up “just to try to deliver some common sense”.Not having a recalcitrant US in Belém has allowed the rest of the world to crack on with trying to make up some of the yawning gap between what the science demands to avoid disastrous climate impacts and our lagging response.The US’s absence is “actually a good thing”, according to Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change. “Ciao, bambino,” was her response to the US’s departure from the Paris agreement.But there are also waves of nervousness rippling through the diplomats here in Brazil. While the world’s leading economic and military superpower isn’t officially present, it is watching. And it could intervene in a similar way to a recent international meeting aimed at curbing shipping emissions, in which US representatives were accused of bullying tactics to derail the process.Some negotiators have admitted privately to treading carefully, wary of upsetting Trump.

Theaccelerating rollout of renewable energyis now close to supplying the annual rise in the world’s demand for energy, but has yet to surpass it.Cop can be torturous and tedious – but here’s why it’s worth paying attentionRead more“A world at 2.6C means global disaster,” said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics. A world this hot would probably trigger major “tipping points” that would cause the collapse of key Atlantic Ocean circulation, the loss of coral reefs, the long-term deterioration of ice sheets and the conversion of the Amazon rainforest to a savannah.“That all means the end of agriculture in the UK and across Europe, drought and monsoon failure in Asia and Africa, lethal heat and humidity,” said Hare. “This is not a good place to be. You want to stay away from that.”The world has already heated up by about 1.3C since the Industrial Revolution due to deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, a situation that has already unleashed fiercer storms, wildfires, droughts and other calamities.Under the Paris deal, signed in 2016, countries are meant to periodically update their plans to slash emissions, with new submissions of so-called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) expected for this round of UN climate talks currently under way in Belém, Brazil.But onlyabout100 countries have done so, with the cuts envisionedvery much insufficientto address the climate crisis.Under a scenario that considers countries’ net zero targets as well as NDCs, the outlook has slightly worsened, with global heating moving from 2.1C to 2.2C by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker, largely because of the US’swithdrawal from the Paris climate deal.Donald Trump has called the climate crisis a “hoax”, torn up climate policies at home and agitated for more oil and gas drilling in America and overseas. For the first time, the US has not sent a delegation to a Cop summit, to the relief of some delegates.While the rate of global heating is still dangerously high, the expected levels have come down since the Paris deal, when about 3.6C of heating by 2100 was expected. This is due to an explosion in the rate of clean energy deployment and a decline in the use of coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels.However, an assessment released simultaneously by theGlobal Carbon Project(GCP) found emissions from fossil fuels are still projected to rise by about 1% in 2025.Fossil fuel emissions chartThe new analyses also show a worrying weakening of the planet’s natural carbon sinks.The scientists said the combined effects of global heating and the felling of trees have turned tropical forests in southeast Asia and large parts of South America from overall CO2sinks into sources of the climate-heating gas.There was a global agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023, but the issue is always contested at the UN meetings.On Tuesday, the G77 group of nations plus China, representing approximately 80% of the world’s population, announced support for an agreed process atCop30to support a just transition away from fossil fuels – though other countries (including Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, the UK and the EU) did not support it.Brazil has established aninvestment fund to tackle deforestation, but many countries, including the UK, have not signed up to it.Former US vice-president Al Gore told delegates that it is “literally insane that we are allowing [global heating] to continue”.“How long are we going to stand by and keep turning the thermostat up so that these sort of events get even worse?” he said.“We need to adapt as well as mitigate, but we also need to be realistic that if we allow this insanity to continue, to use the sky as an open sewer, that some things will be very difficult to adapt to.”Prof Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia, one of the 130 GCP scientists, said: “We’re not yet in a situation where emissions are going down as rapidly as they need to to tackle climate change, but at the same time emissions are growing much less rapidly than before because of the extraordinary growth in renewable energy.“It is clear that climate policy and actions work – we are able globally to bend these curves.”She said 35 countries, representing a quarter of the global GDP, now have growing economies but falling emissions. This has been the case in Europe and the US for some years, but these nations have now been joined by Australia, Jordan, South Korea and others.The report projects that the level of CO2in the atmosphere will reach 425ppm (parts per million) in 2025, compared with 280ppm in the preindustrial era. It would have been 8ppm lower if the carbon sinks had not been weakened.China emissions chartThe GCP projection for 2025 is based on monthly data up to September and has proven accurate in the previous 19 annual reports.Romain Ioualalen, at Oil Change International, said: “The countries meeting at Cop30 need to double down on renewable energy and start planning for an accelerated phaseout of fossil fuel production and use.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisFossil fuelsCop30EnergyEnergy industryGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

A source close to the bill said it was possible it could in effect get filibustered if peers pushed many amendments to a vote.The bill – which began as a private member’s bill from Labour MP Kim Leadbeater – passed theHouse of Commonsin June and is now in the House of Lords.On Thursday night, 65 peers including two cabinet secretaries, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and the former Tory leaderRuth Davidsonwarned that it would be anti-democratic for the Lords to kill the bill after it had been passed by a reasonable majority in the Commons.Its opponents argue that the bill is not in the government’s manifesto and therefore the rules over the primacy of the Commons do not apply. Unlike in the Commons, the lord speaker does not have the power to choose or group amendments to limit them.The signatories of the letter, including Gus O’Donnell, Andrew Turnbull, former lords speaker Helene Hayman, the scientist Robert Winston, as well as Kinnock, Davidson, and the former Green leader Natalie Bennett, said it was not the job of the Lords to stop the bill.“Our role is to test and refine the bill where genuine improvements can be made, while respecting both the will of the Commons and the overwhelming support of the public.“It is not our role to frustrate the clear democratic mandate expressed by elected Members.”It added: “This is an issue of immense public importance, commanding support across society. The public rightly expects this House to conduct its scrutiny with integrity, care and a focus on practical improvement.“We owe it to dying people to use the ample time available to make this law workable, safe and compassionate.”In response to the letter, Labour’s Luciana Berger, who has opposed the bill, said: “The Lords select committee took evidence from a wide range of professional bodies and organisations including the EHRC, that strongly refuted any suggestion this bill is either safe or workable, with the EHRC itself strongly criticising the government’s equality impact assessment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This bill is full of holes which vulnerable people will fall through and be harmed if peers don’t act to change and amend it.”Those who have tabled the amendments to the bill include Ilora Finlay, a former doctor who has been a campaigner against assisted dying, as well as the former Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, who was one of the key voices speaking to MPs to try to persuade them the bill would put disabled people at risk.Both have tabled more than 100 amendments. The former health secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has tabled 60.Backers of the bill said there was still a high expectation that the bill would pass and that most peers would expect to follow convention. One said they were “confident that there is a clear majority in the Lords – including opponents as well as supporters of the bill – who believe the upper house should scrutinise but not seek to frustrate the will of the elected chamber”.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHouse of LordsHealthRuth DavidsonNeil KinnockHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Similar intervention schemes are planned for other military locations, including the Akrotiri base in Cyprus, from next year.Britain’s military has been hit by a string of rape, assault and sexual harassment scandals in recent years, including in the Royal Navy’s submarine service, the RAF’s Red Arrows display team and in multiple units of theBritish army.A former army sergeant major wassentenced to six monthsin jail in October for sexually assaulting Jaysley Beck, a 19-year-old soldier, in July 2021. Beck killed herself after senior officers failed to properly investigate the attack.Across the regular forces, 67% of women serving reported experiencing at least one form of sexual harassment or sexualised behaviour in the past 12 months. That compared with 34% of men, with gaps in all 19 sub-categories surveyed.In all, 8% of female personnel said they had been “subjected to sexual activity which [they] did not consent to” in the past year, compared with 1% of men. That could include rape or serious sexual assault, but the MoD said the intention of the question was to capture the experience or perception rather than record criminality.A total of 32% of women were “touched in a way that made [them] feel uncomfortable”, compared with 5% of their male counterparts. Among female personnel, 21% said they had been sent unprompted sexual messages, compared with 6% of men, while 42% reported they had been “stared or leered at”, against 9% of men.Emma Norton, the director of the Centre forMilitaryJustice, said the research “sadly reflects what all our female clients would say, which is that they are experiencing wholly disproportionate levels of sexual harassment”.The lawyer also highlighted that “despite experiencing all these behaviours, hardly any women actually reported or formally complained about their situation”, citing some of thesurvey evidencethat accompanied the MoD report.A minority of female personnel who said they had been affected made some sort of complaint: 12% said they had done so formally, while 20% had used an informal route. Ten per cent said they had gone to the police.In 18% of cases the perpetrators of sexual harassment against women were “senior officers”, the survey found, compared with 13% of those who harassed men. Around half of perpetrators – 52% for women and 50% for men – came from the junior ranks, the research concluded.There are 16,300 women serving across the armed forces, 11.9% of the total force. The Ministry of Defence has said it has an ambition to increase the level of female new recruits to 30% by the end of the decade to help stamp out sexual harassment and illegal behaviour, but few experts believe that is achievable.A report for the British army by Prof Anthony King, of Exeter University, completed in July 2022 and released by the Ministry of Defence three years later after afreedom of information request, concluded that the central problem was “because 90% of the army consists of men, it is coded male”.He concluded that it was “very unlikely” the army could increase the level of new recruits to 30% to change its culture and that instead the force needed a programme of reform to change from “a masculine institution into a hyper-professional force”.Air Chief Marshal Rich Knighton, the head of the armed forces, said it was necessary to “actively root out unacceptable behaviours” in order for the British military to retain its reputation globally. “Training, education and upholding the standards we set will all play a key role in driving the change we need,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryBritish armyRoyal NavyRoyal Air ForceSexual harassmentWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But at the same time, we know the vast majority of bowel cancers we see in young people arise from these precursor lesions,” he said.Writing in the journal Jama Oncology, Chan and colleagues report how they studied data collected as part of the US-based Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), which began in 1989 and involved female nurses born between 1947 and 1964.From 1991, participants were asked to complete a food questionnaire every four years in which they reported how often they had eaten various items over the previous 12 months.The team studied data from 29,105 participants who had completed the questionnaires, undergone a colonoscopy at some point after 1991, and did not have a prior history of polyps, inflammatory bowel disease or any type of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer.These participants were followed until June 2015, by which time all had reached the age of 50. By then, 1,189 cases of early-onset conventional adenomas and 1,598 cases of another type of polyp, known as a serrated lesion, had been recorded.The team divided participants into five equal sized groups based on their UPF consumption, finding that compared with the group that ate the least UPF – on average 3.3 servings a day – the group that ate the most – on average 9.9 servings a day – had a 45% greater risk of having early onset conventional adenomas once factors such as BMI, smoking and physical activity were taken into account.However, there was no associated risk of developing serrated lesions.The study has limitations including that it is based on participants’ recall of food, may be complicated by difficulties in classifying foods as UPFs, did not look at the development of bowel cancer itself, and cannot prove UPFs cause the development of polyps.However, Chen said there were several plausible mechanisms that could explain the results, noting UPFs had been associated with metabolic disorders linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes that were associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer. He also said UPFs could promote a general state of chronic inflammation, or might impact gut microbes and the gut lining.Chan said while it was likely the results would also hold for men, more research was needed.“It doesn’t suggest that if you eat UPFs, that you are inevitably going to develop cancer. That’s certainly not our message,” he said. “But it’s a piece of the puzzle in terms of what might be driving underlying cancer rates.”Fiona Osgun, the head of health information atCancerResearch UK, said that while the study did not directly measure cancer risk, it offered a useful insight into how diet might influence early changes in the bowel that sometimes led to cancer.Osgun added that policy-level changes were needed to make healthier diets more accessible for everyone. “Our overall diet matters more for cancer risk than any single food type,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUltra-processed foodsBowel cancerCancerWomenFoodHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Some areas could have up to 8cm of rain, with deep flood water posing a danger to life.The warning is in place from noon until the end of the day and covers parts of Wales, the Midlands, the south-west, the south-east and the east ofEngland.A separate yellow warning for rain covers much of England, from Cheshire and North Yorkshire down to the south coast, for a 24-hour period from 6am on Friday, while an additional warning for winds of up to 70mph in some western areas of the UK is in place from noon until midnight.TheMet Office saidthe weather may lead to power cuts, travel disruption and damage to buildings. Those travelling are urged to be cautious.The Met Office chief meteorologist Matthew Lehnert said: “Storm Claudia will bring very heavy rainfall to a large swathe of central and southern England andWaleson Friday into Saturday.“This rain will become slow moving and some areas could see up to a month’s worth of rain in 24 hours. Much of this will fall on saturated ground, increasing the chances of flooding and contributing to the amber warnings we have issued.“Within the amber warning areas, some could see in excess of 150mm accumulate during the event, with 60-80mm fairly widely.“Gusty winds in the north-west of England and north-west Wales is an additional hazard, with 60-70mph gusts possible in exposed places within the warning area.”Unlike many named storms, Storm Claudia is not expected to directly cross the country and instead will maintain its position in the west, the Met Office said.It has been named by the Spanish because of its impact in the Canary Islands this week.The AA has advised against travelling in the “hazardous weather”, saying: “Safety comes first. Conditions may change quickly, so stay updated and make sure you are prepared before you travel.”It added: “Flood water can appear quickly and even shallow water can be dangerous – never try to drive through it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The planprovoked protests in the city centre.The Serbian government has not disputed the authenticity of the published documents. While the agreement dates back to February 2024, it was kept secret and became a flashpoint only last week, after Serbia’s national assembly passed a special law to fast-track development of the site as a “project of importance for the Republic of Serbia”.Thousands protest Jared Kushner-linked development on site of bombed-out Belgrade buildingRead moreThe new law allows the government to sidestep regulatory controls which had halted progress on the scheme in May, pending an investigation into whether documentation removing the headquarters’ protected cultural status had been forged.According to the agreement published by Radar, the Serbian state was obliged to remove the cultural designation of the complex and to complete demolition work of the existing buildings “in a manner that is satisfactory” to Kushner’s Atlantic Incubation company. If Serbia fails to meet a deadline of May next year to prepare the site for construction, the US company can terminate the contract “at its discretion” and demand a substantial sum in termination costs, according to the published document.The deal provides for a free lease of the land for 99 years, with an option for the lease to be converted into full ownership.The passing of the special law has given a fresh focus toyear-long student-led demonstrationsagainst corruption that were first triggered by the collapse of a railway station in the city of Novi Sad.This week, demonstrators formed a human chain and painted a red line around the headquarters complex, in an effort to stall the sell-off of the site for what is reportedly planned as a hotel, apartments and museum complex.Apart from its historic significance as the site of Nato bombing during the Kosovo war, it had protected status as the only work in Belgrade of Yugoslavia’s star modernist architect, Nikola Dobrović.The passing of the special law accelerating the Kushner project has come at a time when the Serbian government of Aleksandar Vučić is seeking to curry favour with the Trump administration after Washington imposed sanctions on the country’s national oil company NIS, owing to the majority stake owned by Russia’s Gazprom and Gazprom Neft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, the information minister, Boris Bratina, threatened the privately owned N1 news channel, the Nova television network and the US state-owned pro-democracy Radio Free Europe, which the Trump administrationis trying to shut down.Bratina said the stations “should not exist on the air on the territory of the state”, earning a rebuke from the European Commission. A commission spokesperson told N1 that independent media were “a key pillar of European democracy”.The Serbian foreign ministry and Kushner’s umbrella investment company, Affinity Partners, were approached for comment about the agreement published by Radar.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It declined 3.6% as it continues to grapple with the fallout from thedisclosure by Japanese investor SoftBankthat it had sold its entire stake in the firm for $5.8bn.“There’s a lot of uncertainties about the state of the economy,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “What we’re going through is a little bit of a correction in the market in the AI sector and we’re seeing market rotation.”With the longest US government shutdown in history now over after more than 42 days, federal officials are preparing to publish a string of highly anticipated economic data reports, including on jobs and inflation.Remarks by senior Federal Reserve officials meanwhile tested market confidence that the central bank is preparing to again cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting next month. “We need to proceed and tread with caution,” said Alberto Musalem, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.Kevin Hassett, director of Donald Trump’s national economic council, said on Thursday that the jobs report for October would show how many jobs had been added or lost in the labor force that month, but not include the headline unemployment rate.The Bureau of Labor Statistics stressed that it hoped to publish data on employment “as soon as possible”, but cautioned that it “may take time to fully assess the situation” before finalizing revised release dates.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsArtificial intelligence (AI)Market turmoilEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There will be financial and other incentives to encourage voluntary recruitment, but if that fails to find the numbers a compulsory nationwide call-up will be reconsidered. This would take further legislation, however.Women are also being encouraged to volunteer, but will not be not obliged to participate in the selection process.Similarly to other western countries,Germanydramatically reduced the size of its armed forces after the end of the cold war, but it now faces the huge challenge of building it up again amid the looming threat posed by Russia and other security concerns.Pressure from the US for Germany to pull its weight militarily, as well as doubts over Washington’s commitment to Europe’s future security, has also contributed to the urgency and led to the chancellor,Friedrich Merz, pledging on entry into office that he would turn Germany’s armed forces, or Bundeswehr, into “Europe’s strongest conventional army”.Security officials have warned thatRussiacould be in a position to launch a full-scale attack on Germany and the rest of Europe within a few years.“We will make voluntary service more attractive,” Jens Spahn, the parliamentary leader of Merz’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), told journalists on Thursday. “We want to win over as many young people as possible for the service for the fatherland.” If voluntary recruitment did not provide sufficient numbers of soldiers and related personnel, he said, “we’ll need to make it obligatory”. But he said this would involve new legislation.Spahn coined the phraseBedarfswehrpflicht, meaning needs-based recruitment, to describe the mandatory element of conscription that the government can fall back on if necessary, “so that we’d be able to recruit as many people as we needed”.The agreement reached on Wednesday night and announced on Thursday morning followed months of heated debate between the CDU and its junior partner, the Social Democrats, over how best to reconstruct the military through recruitment, ensuring at the same time that the population is broadly supportive of the move.On Thursday the headline in the tabloid Bild read: “One out of every 15 men will have to serve”.Under the proposals, expected to enter the statute books at the start of 2026, every 18-year-old – those born in 2008 – will initially be considered eligible for military service and will face mandatory registration involving medical screening and filling out a questionnaire in which they can signal their interest.If a compulsory call-up was considered necessary, this would require a separate vote in parliament.Incentives to boost recruitment are to include free access to driving licences (which can cost several thousand euros in Germany), and a considerable increase in existing pre-tax pay at entry level, to €2600 a month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those numbers should be boosted to up to 270,000 in addition to another 200,000 reservists by 2029 at the latest, by when the defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has said Germany must be “kriegstüchtig” (war-ready).From 1956 Germany had a military conscription programme which it suspended in 2011 under the government of Angela Merkel, in order to modernise it for the post-cold-war world, where it was thought the focus would be on foreign missions requiring the skills of a professional army rather than conscripts needed to fight a war. Lawmakers avoided having to change the constitution by not abolishing the legal basis for conscription but merely suspending it.Before the Merz government took power in May, parliament voted in favour of raising billions of euros to bolster defence spending. This was in addition to Merz’s predecessor Olaf Scholz’s decision, shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to raise €100bn in military funding to rebuild and refurbish the ill-equipped armed forces.Pistorius, a popular politician and social democrat who spearheaded the revamp, said he was confident the new rules would work based on the experience of other countries, especially in northernEurope, of voluntary service. He said he expected compulsory service to be a “last resort” and said the move to create “an attractive service” should boost confidence in Germany’s ability to defend itself, rather than stoke feelings of fear.“There are no reasons to worry, or reasons to be afraid. The lesson is quite clear: the more capable and defensible our armed forces are, through weaponry, training, and personnel, the lower the likelihood that we will ever become a party to a conflict – and that benefits everyone. That’s the lesson of the cold war. Therefore, there’s absolutely no reason to worry,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeRussiaCold warFriedrich MerzShareReuse this content"

Last month Ineos closed two chemical factories in Germany and said it wouldcut a fifth of jobsat its East Yorkshire plant, blaming “sky-high” energy costs and “dirt-cheap” imports from China.The company has accused Europe of carrying out “industrial suicide” by imposing green policies that Ineos claims raise the cost of energy. The group is also scrambling to file anti-dumping cases to block the import of cheap chemicals products into the EU in an attempt to protect its core petrochemicals business from further financial strain.But the company has alreadylost the confidence of credit rating agenciesand debt investors. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that two leading credit ratings agencies had raised red flags over the Ineos Group, which could lead to its debt pile climbing to almost €12bn (£10bn) this year.Fitch Ratings and Moody’s, which provide financial health checks for most big companies, said in February that Ratcliffe’s chemicals business had racked up debts that were between five to six times larger than the company’s annual earnings. Its debts have since climbed to eight times their annual earnings, according to Fitch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A court in Germany also considered that the name “eliminates the risk of misleading the consumer” and raised the question that European regulation on spirits could be at odds with the freedom to conduct a business under the EU’s charter of fundamental rights.But the Luxembourg judges said EU law was clear that the term “non-alcoholic gin” was prohibited. “The fact that the legal name ‘gin’ is accompanied by the term ‘non-alcoholic’ is irrelevant,” the court said.The 2019 EU regulation states that such provisions protect consumers, prevent deceptive practices, ensure fair competition and safeguard the international reputation of the EU’s spirit drinks.The ruling could be a setback to the EU’s fast-growing alcohol-free drinks industry. PB Vi Goods didnot immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Thursday.It is not the first time that some of the EU’s top legal minds have been asked to grapple with the names and shapes of food and drink, whether indulgences or everyday staples.In 2018, the ECJ ruled that the makers of KitKatscould not trademarkthe four-fingered wafer shape, ending a decade-long legal battle between chocolate makers over what one court adviser called the “four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base”.The previous year, the court ruled that only animal-derived products could use names such as milk, butter, cream and yogurt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

September also undershot a forecast of flatlining growth.The gloomier-than-expected figures increased expectations of an interest rate cut from the Bank of England in December, afterlast week’s narrow vote to hold the rate at 4%when four out of nine members of the monetary policy committee backed a reduction.The GDP data followed an ONS release on Tuesdaythat showed theunemployment rate had risen to 5%,the highest for four years.Martin Beck, the chief economist at the consultancy WPI Strategy, said: “Combined with a softening labour market, the figures add to evidence that economic and political uncertainty is weighing on activity and leave a Bank of England rate cut in December even more likely.”graphThe chancellor is widely expected to raise taxes in her second budget later this month, to offset a forecast downgrade from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.Reeves said in a recent speech: “Each of us must do our bit for the security of our country and the brightness of its future.”The weak GDP reading underlined the risks that sharply higher taxes could slam the brakes on the economy.James Smith, the research director at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “This latest slowdown shows the scale of the challenge facing the government as it seeks to kickstart growth. The next challenge will be to ensure that the upcoming budget supports rather than hinders growth – no mean feat given the scale of fiscal consolidation that is expected.”Alongside the decline in manufacturing output as JLR’s production lines fell silent, the ONS said there had also been a slowdown in the growth of services output in the third quarter, to 0.2%, from 0.4% in the previous three months.It pointed to a decline in “professional, scientific and technical activities” as the driver of this weaker growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within that, the ONS said “new work”, rather than repairs, was down by 0.2%.Labour will not be pleased either with news that business investment declined, by 0.3% on the quarter, to a level just 0.7% higher than a year ago. Boosting private sector investment has been a key aim of the government’s economic strategy.A No 10 spokesperson described the GDP figures as “disappointing”.“It’s obviously important to recognise the significance of the cyber-attack” on Jaguar Land Rover, which is “clearly the primary driver behind the weaker September figures”, they said.“But we are determined to deliver that growth. We had the fastest-growing economy in G7 in the first half of this year, but there is clearly more to do to build an economy that works for working people.”Asked whether the chancellor should take responsibility for the slowing growth, the spokesperson said: “I don’t accept that.”The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said the data was evidence of a prime minister and chancellor who were “in office but not in power”. Referring to Downing Street briefing about apossible leadership challenge, he added: “If the prime minister does not have the backbone to control his team, he has no hope of reducing spending.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Jaguar Land RoverEconomicsEconomic policyManufacturing sectorCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

However, his empire, previously stretching through the UK, eastern Europe and Australia, hasunravelled in the years since the collapseof the lender Greensill Capital in 2021.The UK’s Serious Fraud Office has beeninvestigating GFG and Greensill since 2021. GFG and Gupta have strenuously denied any wrongdoing, while administrators of Greensill Capital have previously declined to comment.Gupta has lost control of key assets including the steelworks in Whyalla, Australia, as well as theSouth Yorkshire operations of Liberty Steel UKin August.Liberty Steel’s Romanian operation is based in Galați, near the Ukrainian border. The prosecutor’s office said it carried out the searches in Galați, as well as in and near Bucharest, the Romanian capital.Referring to an unnamed company, the Romanian prosecutors said: “Persons with management positions within the company acted to embezzle it through affiliated entities registered in other jurisdictions”, as well as “a series of contracts for the purchase of goods or the provision of services that were not based on real operations, as well as fictitious loan contracts”.Transactions under investigation included a €137m (£121m) sale of CO2certificates – required by EU regulations for heavy polluters such as steelworks – to the Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom. The money from those sales was transferred “to the accounts of the ‘parent company’” via a company in Singapore, the prosecutors said. Gazprom wasplaced under UK and US sanctions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukrainethis year, well after the alleged transactions.The company was forced to later replace the certificates for €154m, leaving it with a heavy loss, the prosecutors said. Funds intended for industrial investments were diverted to cover payments to affiliated legal entities, “without an operational justification”, they added.A GFG spokesperson said: “Liberty Steel and its management will vigorously defend itself against the unfounded allegations directed at the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His latest installation is literally an exhibition of 10 tons of old rope, accumulated by him over months, and left in towering mounds in this swanky gallery in London’s Mayfair. Most of it is marine rope, destined for landfill. It’s hard to recycle this stuff, it seems, and there’s an endless supply of it dumped around the world. So Shrigley scooped up as much of it as he could find, piled it up and put a massive price tag on it.The work can be yours for £1m. And that’s the point of the show: this is literally money for old rope. It’s not that deep – it’s just an idea taken to its logical conclusion, an idiom taken too far, a pun taken too literally.It’s obscene, ridiculous and funny. I want to pick it apart, untangle its conceptual threadsShrigley made his name with deadpan, easily intelligible, visual one-liners: simple paintings with simple phrases written across them, just a bunch of glum, self-deprecating but often funny non-sequiturs. And that’s exactly what this is, a non-sequitur, a joke with no punchline. Just an idea and a price tag.And it looks great! Largely because it looks pretty much like any other conceptual art installation. Piles of discarded rubbish have been a common sight in art galleries for decades, but this is the first one to do it quite so sarcastically and knowingly. It’s like Shrigley is gamely admitting that, well, this is all a bit stupid.View image in fullscreenSalvaged from climbing schools, tree surgeons, offshore wind farms and scaffolders … the new artwork.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThe issue here is that, at its root, this is art about the value of art, about what people are willing to pay for an idea, about which ideas have value and which don’t. But I don’t think the financial value of art is all that interesting. Who cares if someone wants to pay millions for adirty old bed, or alight going on and offor arotten banana taped to a wall? What rich people do with their money is about as relevant to me as what they have for breakfast.Making a snarky comment about the value of art in a gallery that’s struggling to survive financially (SFGannounced some pretty huge lossesearlier this year) does feel a bit awkward, too. It’s like Shrigley is saying: “You lot would buy any old crap, wouldn’t you?” Yet this is a gallery that’s having quite a hard time selling any old crap.Maurizio Cattelan, the artist now famed for making agolden toiletthat was stolen, made a similar point – in a more aesthetically impactful way – when he taped a banana to a wall at an art fair in 2019 and sold it for more money than anyone should ever spend on a banana. But that was then, when the art world was a lot more boomy. These days, when things are so much more cautious, I don’t think ideas about the financial value of art are as clearcut or obvious as they once were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I want to pick it apart, untangle its conceptual threads and prove that they don’t weave into anything sensible – butobviouslythey don’t. The conceptual threads are just a big pile, a mess. Part of me wants to go all lyrical and describe the colours and fabrics, the smell, the history implied in each strand, the narratives of the hands that once pulled these ropes and yadda yadda yadda.But I don’t think that’s the point.

It turns out to be an AI-generated video created by Butters as revenge against his former crush, Red, who cruelly manipulated him in a recent episode by pretending to like him in exchange fora rare Labubu doll. After learning of the video, Red decides to fight fire with fire, making her own AI footage of Butters molesting beloved Studio Ghibli character Totoro.A South Park Halloween: latest episode destroys Trump over White House demolitionRead moreThis kicks off a war of attrition amongSouth ParkElementary’s student body, who use the Sora 2 OpenAI video generator – a real-life tool that allows users to create customised videos – to churn out videos of one another engaging in all manner of sexual and scatological behaviour with the likes of Popeye, Bluey and Droopy Dog (who poos in Kyle’s mouth). The adults of South Park can’t distinguish between AI and reality, so the town’s hapless police force think they have stumbled on a vast child sexual abuse ring.View image in fullscreenKids churning out sexual deepfakes starring Popeye and Bluey? It can only be South Park.Photograph: ParamountAs all this is happening, we catch up with Eric Cartman, last seen two episodes back being abducted by billionaire and antichrist expert Peter Thiel after undergoing some kind of demonic possession. Thiel’s plans for Cartman are still unclear, but in the meantime, he uses Sora 2 to throw Cartman’s worried mother off their trail, sending her AI videos of her son pretending to have a blast in the nation’s capital.Also in Washington DC, Donald Trump has uncovered the still-murky plot between Thiel and JD Vance to kill his forthcoming love child with Satan. The diminutive Vance convinces his boss that he was only acting in his best interests before seducing him. The president and vice-president then engage in a sensual bout of lovemaking inside the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom. The use of Trump and Vance’s actual faces in the throes of orgasm make for some of the most disturbing visuals in this or any season. It is gut-bustlingly funny and stomach-churningly gross.(The real Vance has tried to play the good sport about the show’s caricaturing him over the past few months, but it is doubtful that he’ll approve of this latest development.)View image in fullscreenGetting peed on by Santa? … Red rages at the AI revenge video about her.Photograph: ParamountThe episode’s threads converge when the South Park detectives trace one of the Cartman deepfakes to Thiel’s hideout. They arrest Thiel and rescue Cartman, who berates his mother about falling for the deepfakes. Searching Thiel’s laptop, the police uncover illegal surveillance footage from inside the White House of Trump and Vance’s sexual tryst. The public release of this footage initially causes the team at Fox News (who have been as constant a target this season as the president and his inner circle) to freak out, before Trump succeeds in convincing them, as well as a sceptical Satan, that the footage is – what else? – an AI fake.It is only fitting that this episode, which features damning proof of Trump’s sexual misconduct and connections to widespread child sexual abuse in the world of South Park, would come out the same day that Congress released thousands of pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including several emails in which he states outright that Trumpknew about “the girls”and had a lengthy engagement in the company of one of the victims. This wasn’t necessarily planned – South Park’s last-second production schedule is good, but it’s notthatgood.Meanwhile, the latest episode, Sora Not Sorry, can be read as a mea culpa from series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who have a personal stake in and history with its subject matter. In 2020, the duo founded Deep Voodoo LLC, a production studio powered by deepfake technology. So far, their output has been limited to oneKendrick Lamar music videoand a series of web shorts released during the pandemic calledSassy Justicewhich revolved around a news reporter who bore a striking resemblance to none other than Donald Trump.The first episode of this season of South Park – or last season, since Stone and Parker decided to split up this 10-episode run as part of a meta “six-seven” gag – ended with what many viewers thought was a fully AI-generated scene of a naked Trump wandering the desert. It turns out said scene was mostly real footage, with deepfake tech being applied only to the human actor’s face.This has all come full circle now, as this episode not only condemns AI for degrading other people’s’ hard work (as one Studio Ghibli representative angrily proclaims: “[We] make Totoro with pencil and paint, not by typing sentence on stupid Sora app”), but also sounds the alarm for how this ever-evolving tech can and will be used to trick people into believing lies as well as denying the truth. Whether Parker and Stone act in accordance with their convictions and shutter Deep Voodoo remains to be seen.As far as South Park goes, the pieces continue to fall into place for what promises to be a wild finale over the course of the remaining two episodes, although it will be as hard for them to top the horrific Trump-Vance sex scene as it will be for the rest of us to scrub it from our brains.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionUS televisionAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Illness and pain, “journeys” and “battles”, finding appreciation for life while reckoning with death – these are the building blocks of cancer stories, at once uniquely devastating and devastatingly common. The poets Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley, romantic partners for over a decade, took divergent approaches to the Big C. As a writer and editor, Falley strived to “eradicate” cliche; Gibson, as Falley put it, would instead “double down”.Being Eddie review – reverential Netflix doc paints limited portrait of Eddie MurphyRead moreDiagnosed with incurable ovarian cancer in their late 40s, Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado thus chose to double down on mantras we often aspire to embody but forget to practice: live fully, laugh more, love harder. Savor it all. “This is the beginning of a nightmare, I thought … my worst fear come true,” they say early in the exquisite new documentary Come See Me in the Good Light. “But stay with me … because my story is about happiness being easier to find once we realize we do not have forever to find it.”It is cliche. And yet, as told by Gibson and Falley in poetry, prose and whispers in bed at their home in rural Longmont, Colorado, such happiness is tender, hard-won and luminous. Their heart-forward film, directed by Ryan White, sits with plenty of pain in what the couple know will be some of their last months together: doctor visits and chemotherapy, tears and the overwhelming grief of knowing your loved ones will go on without you. The couple live in three-week increments – the time between blood tests that can quantify the spread of Gibson’s cancer and the success, or diminishing returns, of different treatments to keep it in check. A high score: shock, processing, a bruise blooming in real time. A low score: utter joy. A temporary period of lightness. And throughout, the most gutting revelations and sacred connections, often triggered by the most quotidian and profane (for Gibson, it’s one of those novelty iPhone age filters, giving them wrinkles and gray hair they will never see).Gibson, a former touring spoken word poet whose fearlessly unbridled, unminced words on life and mortality once sold out rock clubs, is uniquely qualified to stare down the big feelings, to wrangle and put words to the fragile and brittle subject of dying. They make for a magnetic subject, chatty and amiable, uninterested in the usual boundaries; hardly a scene goes by without Gibson and Falley, their rock, addressing the film-makers directly, inviting them into their circle of trust, intimacies and at times raunchy jokes. An early scene – one of the first White and producing partner Jessica Hargrave filmed in 2023 – finds the couple collapsed in laughter at the dinner table with a friend, after Gibson joked that Falley would “finger the cancer” out of them.Such humor, dark and disarming, forms the lifeblood of the 104-minute film; no wonder it won the audience-voted festival favorite award at Sundance. Around it, White constructs a delicate portrait of the poet, collaging readings of their most poignant poems – listen toTincture, on the soul grieving the fallible body, and try not to well up – with footage from their earlier years, as a closeted queer kid in rural Maine, then a depressed young adult who found purpose in spoken word poetry. White smartly weaves Gibson’s evolution as a poet and performer, commanding stages like a rockstar –“we called them the gay James Dean,” Falley jokes – with their hopes to stage one final show, a celebration of life before their death.That performance, graced by Gibson’s friend and documentary producer Tig Notaro, is the film’s greatest public triumph, a stunning showcase of one person’s achingly full life. But its primary feat is one of direct, unvarnished honesty, addressing ironies that would feel too neat if they weren’t so poignant and true: how it felt for Falley, working for years on a memoir about her lifelong struggle with body image issues, to watch her partner long for a body, just any body, that was healthy. How Gibson must decide whether a potentially life-extending experimental treatment is worth the possibility of permanently losing their voice. How gender confusion, dysphoria and fluidity, long a focus of Gibson’s work, seemed to melt away with the real specter of death. “I don’t know myself by my gender any more – it’s almost like your identity itself sort of drips off of you, it sort of falls off,” they say. How a person who lived with a “persistent desire to die”, and who spoke frankly of self-harm and suicidal thoughts in their art, suddenly felt, with cancer, a persistent and prodigious desire to live.Gibsondiedin July, at the age of 49, surrounded by Falley, their parents, their pets, several ex-girlfriends and incalculable love. The date goes unmentioned in the film, and there is no footnote. It ends, instead, some time before that, somewhere between life and death, Gibson vibrant on screen and vibrating with wonder: what a glorious thing, to be alive. What a gift to carry on.Come See Me in the Good Light is available on Apple TV+ on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsPoetryApple TV+CancerreviewsShareReuse this content"

You cannot look awayLucy ManganThu 13 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 10.50 ESTShareIt comes as a great surprise to learn that The Beast in Me is its creator, writer and executive producer Gabe Rotter’s first major work for the screen. Because it is, simply put, so very, very good. Even without two astonishing performances from the lead actors –Claire Danesand Matthew Rhys – the script, the sheer style and confidence of it all, would be things of beauty. But add what that pair are doing, and this clever, taut eight-part psychological thriller moves seamlessly into top-tier television.Danes plays Aggie Wiggs (Rotter may still have some work to do honing his naming skills), a writer who made her name with a book about her troubled relationship with her father. She is currently stuck on her next book, about the friendship between supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her fellow judge but polar political opposite Antonin Scalia, not least because she is grieving the eight-year-old son she and her now ex-wife Shelley (Natalie Morales) lost to a drunk driver four years earlier. The driver, a young man called Teddy, who lives locally and frequent sightings of whom negate any chance of peace for Aggie, managed to delay a breathalyser test at the time and avoid being charged with the boy’s death. Aggie lives alone with her rage and grief in the large, empty house that was supposed to overflow with family.‘I’d barely kissed a boy, but was making out with Adonis’: Claire Danes on sex, spy camp and teen stardomRead moreInto her affluent neighbourhood comes multimillionaire scion of a real estate developer, Nile Jarvis (Rhys), who has been the prime suspect in his wife’s suspected murder since she disappeared without trace six years ago. His first act in his new home (where he lives with his former secretary/new wife Nina – Brittany Snow) is to ask everyone if he can cut a jogging trail through the nearby communally owned woods. Everyone agrees to let the suspected murderer have his way, except for Aggie. “I should hang out with more dykes,” he says admiringly. He is a deeply unlovely piece of work and exactly what she needs.Thus are they brought together, forming the fundamentally antagonistic and compelling connection that fuels the rest of the show. Aggie is blocked with the RBG book, Nile points out with his characteristic lack of nicety, because it’s the last thing people want to read. “No one wants hope. They want gossip and carnage.” He suggests that she write about him instead. She declines.Then two things happen. She is visited in the night by a drunk FBI agent, Brian Abbott (David Lyons), who was the lead investigator into Nile’s wife’s disappearance. He warns her that Nile “is not like us” and says he couldn’t live with his conscience if he didn’t tell her to stay away from him.View image in fullscreen‘Alone with her rage and grief’ … Claire Danes as Aggie Wiggs in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix © 2025Then Teddy disappears. The morning after Aggie inadvertently identified him to Nile as the killer of her son, his clothes and a suicide note are found on the beach, despite his multiple future plans with his girlfriend and no sign of being in any mental distress.The police have no interest in following up her suspicions. In order to pursue them herself, she agrees to write Nile’s story with him. As their central cat and mouse relationship progresses, along with a possible sapphic vibe from Nina (an agent who also becomes interested in representing artist Shelley), the wider narrative builds too. Nile’s father, Martin (the veteran character actor Jonathan Banks – you will know, and be as ever terrified by him, when you see him), comes into play, leading us to wonder if his son is a chip off the evil old block or merely tainted by association. Protests against the Jarvis company’s latest planned development mount, led by councilwoman Olivia Benitez (Aleyse Shannon), who has mayoral ambitions that may make her dangerously incorruptible or a useful ally to the Jarvis cause. Further complications and potential for blackmail, bluffs and revelations are added by Abbott’s affair with a married woman.At its heart, though, The Beast in Me remains a two-hander between Danes as a wounded warrior struggling to rise and Rhys as an elusive mass of possibilities and contradictions. They spark off each other through beautifully written scenes designed to immerse you in the world of two people discovering what it means to find someone who truly sees you and accepts you in your entirety – even when that entirety drives others away – and how much of them you will accept in return. It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.The Beast in Me is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionClaire DanesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Liz and Malcolm have been together for about a year, which we gather early on has marked the time Liz has bolted from past relationships. Still, she seems optimistic about this one. She thinks she knows Malcolm pretty well, and their early scenes together are neither as dotted with red flags nor as suspiciously idyllic as other recent characters in the doomed-couple genre. Liz has a wary, deadpan sense of humor, and Malcolm has a slightly slurred-together accent as he explains some oddities about his family-owned cabin in the woods (like the fact that he has a creepy cousin who lives nearby). But their awkwardness levels are complementary. They seem comfortable together.Osgood Perkins, the director, introduces discord through his shot choices, rather than micro-aggressions or backstory. Liz and Malcolm’s faces are rarely outright hidden, but they’re often partially obscured, shown from odd angles, or framed in shots with a disconcerting amount of headroom. This establishes a pattern of disorientation that continues as Liz thinks she hears faint noises through the house’s vents. When she relaxes in the house’s posh tub, there’s an intensely memorable superimposition of the nearby river rushing all around her, as if she’s about to transcend space and time. “I feel like I took mushrooms,” she tells a friend she calls when she’s left alone at the cabin. Her friend asks if she did, in fact, take mushrooms; Liz doesn’t answer directly.For a while, Keeper – named for Liz’s supposed status as the woman in Malcolm’s life – seems like it could go in any number of directions, its horror elements mixed together in a dreamlike jumble. Is it a ghost story, a slasher-in-the-woods movie, or just a really bad trip? Perkins, a horror specialist who has been on a prolific run for the past 18 months with another movie due out next year, makes it difficult to tell, both in-movie (so many of the creepiest early moments are moments just out of focus or in the corner of the eye) and extra-textually; his last two films were the tonally distinct serial-killer freakout Longlegs and the Final Destination-ish horror comedy The Monkey. This eclecticism, combined with Keeper’s elusive and spoiler-averse ad campaign, could make the new film feel to some like a shell game designed to dress up what is, at its core, a pretty simple horror story.Maybe it is that. But part of what makes Perkins’ film so refreshing is the way it prioritizes its visceral effect on an audience over a desire to bend that story into a modern relationship parable. As clever as so many contemporary horror movies are, they often write toward theme rather than shooting toward immediacy. As a result, some are starved for original imagery, unexpected juxtapositions or a sense of genuine, uncanny mystery. Keeper has all of this, and Perkins knows just how far to push those elements without allowing the movie to become abstract woo-woo self-indulgence.He also seems to know what a powerful grounding element he has in Maslany, who isn’t called upon to do the usual virtuoso demo reel of a woman on the verge of oblivion. Liz does get freaked out by the strange things that happen around her, and the character is written and performed with a certain directness. (She’s not one of those horror heroines who inexplicably avoids asking what the hell is going on.) Yet Maslany delivers a second level to her performance in her unguarded moments: a cynical flick of her eyes in one direction or another, the tenuousness of her more polite smiles, the shorthand of both her familiarity and quickness to irritation with her unseen friend on the phone. Though no particular skeleton key to her traumatic past awaits, the character still feels complete.That’s true of the movie as a whole, too. It’s not as rich as Sinners nor as narratively ambitious as Weapons, two of 2025’s standard-bearers for original horror. But when Keeper finishes up, its tight confines feel satisfying, correct and unlikely to spawn a sequel. That tidiness drives home some of its themes in a way that the more overt messaging of other dating-hell stories don’t always manage: maybe it takes a fable-like horror for the messy business of relationships to stay so neatly kept.Keeper is out in cinemas on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Pulling them off requires an affinity for the composer’s distinctively private soundworld and a willingness to share a single instrument, often requiring a different way of thinking about the mechanics of making music.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Schubert Four Hands.Photograph: EratoLeif Ove Andsnes and Bertrand Chamayou are thoughtful musicians, and it’s immediately apparent from these affectionately searching accounts that they possess an emotional synergy. The great F minor Fantasia finds the Norwegian spinning seamless lyrical lines over the Frenchman’s cushioned bass. Dynamics are impeccably sculpted; the central Largo is weighty with perfectly balanced trills throughout. They can be playful, too, though their instincts turn inwards, probing the music’s spirit. The return of the poignant main theme is a heart-stopper.The A minor Allegro, issued posthumously with the title Lebensstürme (storms of life), is full of dramatic urgency, Chamayou tearing into the primo part. Andsnes goes with him cheek by jowl amid a torrent of turbulent runs and pianistic fanfares. The Norwegian is back on top for the A major Rondo, a conversational account full of good-natured bonhomie.

Boosted bya win in the BBC Sound of 2020 poll, and her single A Little Love appearing on the John Lewis Christmas ad the same year, her debut album Not Your Muse entered the charts at No 1, spawned two big hits – Stop This Flame and Strange – and ultimately went gold. That’s the perfect starting place from which to make a second album: success, acclaim and attention, but not on the kind of overwhelming scale that seems ultimately paralysing, where it’s impossible to work out how you can follow it up.View image in fullscreenAnd yet, the making of Woman of Faces has clearly been attended by some difficulty. Celeste has talked openly about butting heads with its producer, Jeff Bhasker, whose hugely impressive CV includes work with Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and Kanye West: she commissioned string arrangements from British composer and conductor Robert Ames, but Bhasker “didn’t let me use [them]”. Last month, she was on Instagram, protesting that her label was showing “very little support of the album I have made” and had threatened to drop her entirely if she “didn’t put two particular songs” on its track list. This accusation caused a certain degree of eyebrow-raising, not least because Celeste is signed to the same label that singerRaye complained about in 2021, insisting they had refused to allow her to release a debut album: Raye subsequently left the label, released the album herself to vast success and noted that record companies might be better served allowing artists to “always create with a sense of purpose, rather than the means to sell”.It’s hard not to think of that remark when you listen to Woman of Faces. It’s far from a fanbase-confounding left turn – a Metal Machine Music for the jazz-inflected pop-soul set – but nor is it hugely commercial. Its sound manages to be both sumptuous and stark. Its opulence results from its orchestrations and modern classical flourishes – the piano introduction to People Always Change is a dead ringer for Opening, the first movement of Philip Glass’s 1981 chamber piece Glassworks. But there’s something austere about it, too. Its emotional tone is sombre; songs deal with the societal pressures placed on women and the deleterious effect of technology on our lives, and the overwhelming theme is the fallout from a broken relationship. The pace is glacial and there is an almost complete absence of drums: aside from a brief rattle of martial snare during On With the Show, the first time a rhythm track appears is on the penultimate song, Could Be Machine, a brief and joltingly uncharacteristic explosion of fizzing electronics and stomping double-time beats with a lyric that you could interpret as being about anonymous trolls, social media bots, AI or all three (whichever it is,Celesteis very much not in favour).Celeste: Woman of Faces – videoSombre, glacial, austere: it’s not an easy sell, and it’s unquestionable that the music on Woman of Faces often feels at one remove from the rest of mainstream pop. You can draw a line between Time Will Tell and the darkest ballads in Amy Winehouse’s catalogue, but the album’s contents frequently sound closer to prewar vocal jazz, the Frenchchanson réalistetradition and the stuff of the old-fashioned West End showstopper than anything from the 21st century. It’s not hard to imagine Keep Smiling floating from the jazz clubs of New York’s 52nd Street. On With the Show takes a theme that runs through modern pop from Gene Pitney’s 1966 hit Backstage to Taylor Swift’s I Can Do It With a Broken Heart – the performer putting a brave face on their misery – and returns it to the wings of the London Palladium.It says a great deal about how potent and beautiful these songs are that they never sound like genre pastiche: the pace at which they proceed works with Celeste’s voice, giving her room to display its nuances, her command of phrasing and enunciation, her ability to gradually build from something close to a whisper to full power and push her vocal to a point where it feels it might break, before pulling back.‘I have different weathers in my brain’: how Celeste rekindled her love of music after heartbreak and lossRead moreBut if you had to pinpoint a flaw, it’s that the album’s near-uniform pacing and tone make it a challenge to consume in one sitting. It might have benefited from more disruptive tracks along the lines of Could Be Machine, or indeed Everyday, the standalone single from earlier this year that sampled Death in Vegas’s guitar-heavy Dirge. This is a problem, given that Woman of Faces is clearly intended as a song cycle, to be listened to from start to finish. That said, every song is individually stunning – excerpted on a playlist, they would stop you dead in your tracks. In that sense, at least, Woman of Faces feels like a thoroughly modern pop album.This week Alexis listened toSmerz/They Are Gutting a Body of Water – Big City LifeFrom an album of reinterpretations of tracks from Smerz’s acclaimed Big City Life, intense Philadelphia shoegazers They Are Gutting a Body of Water turn the title track into something contemplative and magical.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockAlexis Petridis's album of the weekSoulCelestereviewsShareReuse this content"

In Feminist History for Every Day of the Year, Kate Mosse, the bestselling author ofLabyrinth, celebrates can-do women and gives history’s trailblazers their due. Aimed at teenage readers but just as enjoyable for adults, this anthology comprises bite-sized stories of female achievement and the centuries-old fight for equality. As Mosse notes in the introduction, it is about women “who refused to accept the limitations put on them, who campaigned and marched, battled and challenged the status quo to change the world for the better”.The book features a mixture of famous and lesser-known figures: artists, writers, scientists, academics, sportswomen, educators and politicians. There’s primatologist Dian Fossey; avant garde painter Amrita Sher-Gil; Britain’s first black headteacher Beryl Gilroy; Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai; Ethiopian politician and humanitarian Senedu Gebru; racehorse trainer Florence Nagle; computer programmers Ada Lovelace and Dorothy Vaughan; and actor and music hall star Josephine Baker, who was also a pilot and agent in the French resistance during the second world war.

For London, though, they brought a different programme, in the shape of Janáček, a lifetime Rattle speciality, and Bruckner, a composer from whom the conductor once seemed to keep his distance but whose music he has gradually embraced with greater confidence.The quality of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra was obvious in Janáček’s Taras Bulba rhapsody. At the start, ardent cor anglais, oboe and violin solos float above rich and shimmering strings before a sudden and more violent call to Slavic heroics: Janáček at his most angular and spine-tingling. The Bavarians’ playing of this quicksilver and fervent score was predictably first-class. Maybe, though, the orchestral mastery was also a notch too technically perfect, missing the ineffable fragility that animates so much of Janáček’s music so brilliantly. No reservations, though, about the excitement of the final movement, in which Janáček’s score catches fire.At home with Simon Rattle: ‘There are still things I feel are beyond me’Read moreRattle’s Bruckner journey has been a fascinating aspect of his long years in Germany and central Europe. Hisearlier penchantfor making and shaping Bruckner’s symphonies in new and sometimes unconvincing ways has eased now. Traces of that instinct do remain – some questionably dramatic pianissimos, for instance – but the overall result, in this performance of the seventh symphony, is a more illuminating, because more vernacular, approach, to which the Bavarians contributed consistently fine playing.The vast span of the opening movement was very persuasive, carrying all before it, and avoiding any trace of needless religiosity as it climbed towards its home key resolution. The adagio was equally impressive, both coherent and bold in conception. Transitions were delicately handled, and orchestral balance and colours rich and varied, notably in the sombre Wagner homage after the cymbal climax. The scherzo danced rather than battered, as it surely should, while the finale worked, which it does not always do. All in all it was convincing evidence that Rattle’s Bruckner has acquired greater depth, while retaining the indispensable element of flexibility.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicSimon RattlereviewsShareReuse this content"

It contains within it an allegory of hunger and pain, its history is our history, the history of Fascism … It is tragic, but immediate, and for this reason, full of life.” For Pasolini, ugliness was its own kind of truth, such that Rome could lay no claim to being the most beautiful city in the world “if it were not, at the same time, the ugliest”. For some, though, that truth risked becoming “unseeable”. The gaze of the touristic voyeur, said Pasolini, skimmed over slums for the poor “filled with illness, violence, crime, and prostitution”, “convinced of the extraneousness and untimeliness of this sub-proletarian, underdeveloped world”.Olivia Laing’s second novel, The Silver Book, is a work preoccupied with beauty. Set in the world of Italian cinema in 1974, the book overflows with extravagant film sets, feasts, dazzling costumes. Even Pasolini himself, cruising around in his Alfa Romeo, oozes charisma and allure. But as Pasolini made clear, beauty without its opposite can only ever be incomplete.The book opens at the peak of its art and intensity. For reasons initially withheld, Nicholas, the book’s callow protagonist, flees London for Italy. In Venice, he meets real-life set designer Danilo Donati, who takes him first as a lover and then as a paid assistant, whisking him off to the studio in Rome where Fellini is filming Casanova, then later to a remote villa, the setting for Pasolini’s notorious masterpiece of fascist brutality, Salò.At its best, Laing’s writing is urgent and elegantly wrought. Fellini’s Casanova is described as “floating on a greasy tide of his own compulsions through the guttering century”. Pasolini has the physical presence of “a downed power line, whipping across tarmac until it melts the road”. Quickly, though, the technique that lends the novel its pace becomes a liability. Laing fashions canapes of prose: tight, present-tense paragraphs, each separated by a line break from the next. As the novel strains to take on more challenging material, these morsels of image and event begin to feel measly and insubstantial.Working in constrained space, Laing compiles lists in place of living description. Memories are itemised rather than explored (“Wife’s perfume, car keys in his pocket, the job, the club, the parents, the bank accounts …”); hopeful actors lining up for a casting are reduced to a spreadsheet of physiognomy (“Pimpled foreheads, Adam’s apples, bedroom eyes, fine blonde hair”); landscape is rendered as finger painting (“Grey stone, green mountains, grey sky, green trees”). On the set of Salò, Danilo runs his hand over a collection of costumes, feeling “Cream damask. Crushed brown velvet. Black satin.” Just a page later, his memories of the war are rendered in precisely the same shorthand: “Denunciations, round-ups, missing people, deportations. The trucks, the trains.”The trucks, the trains: this cursory, free-associative language is not how a person who experienced the war would recall it; it is how someone with only a very limited knowledge of the war would fail to imagine it. It is also precisely the point at which the deeper inadequacy of Laing’s taxonomic method is exposed. In this bullet-pointed world, the weight of one thing compared to another is erased. People become occurrences; events are disassembled into things. A stretch of fabric and the experience of deportation resonate at uniform pitch.The Silver Book is a novel fatally undermined by all the things it invokes without daring to depict. Take, for example, Salò – in which Pasolini refashions the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom into a visceral postmortem of fascist violence. Reading the script, Nicholas “enters hell”. Filming is described as “the daily descent into hell”. The reader, though, is spared any such experience. Instead, Laing gives us Salò as dressmaker’s dream – an array of props and costumes cleansed of their power to shock.“Most people, not Pasolini, are ruled by fear,” Laing asserts, pressing Pasolini into service as an avatar of political and creative courage. It’s an evasion, because much as The Silver Book might strike a revolutionary pose, it is a novel of class-bound conventionality – one that flirts again and again with transgression, only to back timidly away. Cruising – both a vital part of Pasolini’s life and the backdrop to his unsolved murder – is mentioned but never in any detail depicted. Fascism is alluded to but its victims and machinery remain invisible. Rome’s sub-proletarian world remains untimely and extraneous.The clothes, the food, the glossy aesthetic, the spritz of radical chic, the gestures towards a political resistance stripped of all material context, the arrangement of aspirational icons, those floating squares of prose, scrolling frictionlessly by – there’s a reason this all feels familiar and easy to consume. The Silver Book is a novel distorted by the medium it has shaped itself to flatter: it is an Instagram feed bound between book covers. There can be no ugly, unseeable truth here; only the artful pose is of value.In an afterword, Laing notes that though the truth of Pasolini’s murder remains opaque, looking for individuals to blame “risks missing the point of Pasolini’s warnings about a system in which we are all enmeshed, and which has only grown more powerful in the past half-century”. It’s the final move in The Silver Book’s evasive political dance. Laing has shown us nothing of this system or its workings, and nothing of our own culpability in its crimes. In showing us nothing, Laing has risked nothing, and so must invoke at every opportunity those who risked and lost everything. The result is a novel both self-protecting and superficial – hypnotised by beauty, safely distant from everything it hints at in hope of depth.The Silver Book by Olivia Laing is published by Hamish Hamilton (£20).

They must spend their lifetimes battling it, facing horror after horror in the process.This is the plot, roughly, of Stephen King’s novel It (his best; no arguments). It is also the plot, roughly, of King’s son Joe Hill’s new horror doorstopper, in which six friends summon the ancient, infinitely malicious dragon King Sorrow from the Long Dark to help them defeat some baddies. Needless to say, their supernatural ritual backfires.Joseph Hillström King started his career making great efforts to avoid any connection with his famous father, publishing under the pen name he still uses today and avoiding meeting his agent in person (he bears a striking resemblance to his dad). But in this latest novel, he leans into it. There are lines that deliberately echo some of King’s most famous (“The man in black fled across the desert …”); a moment that brings to mind a King plot point (a riddling contest). In this whopper of a novel, Hill is delighting in his family connection, and we delight along with him. King Sorrow is huge, sprawling – and absolutely fantastic.Back to those friends: five of them are students at the fictional Rackham College in Maine. There’s Arthur, bookish and brilliant, solving Old English riddles in his spare time; Colin, rich, sharp, and prone to trampling anyone who stands in his way; twins Donna and Donovan; the beautiful Allie. And there’s Gwen, who doesn’t study with them, but becomes a key part of their group as they dabble, half believing, half not, in the occult.Arthur is, for reasons we don’t need to go into here, forced into stealing rare books from his beloved college library by a bunch of local criminals. This tears at his bookish heart, especially when he’s made to take the library’s most valuable and disturbing title: the journal of occultist Enoch Crane (executed “for trafficking with the devyll in 1703”; the book’s jacket is made from his skin). Our Scooby gang read the journal, discover they could summon what Crane describes as a “proud worm, cunning serpent, armoured devil” to help Arthur out with his blackmail problem – and spend the rest of the novel reaping the consequences. King Sorrow will indeed rid them of those troublesome local drug dealers, but they’ll have to choose a new sacrifice each year or become his victim themselves. As Arthur later puts it: “You sow dragon’s teeth, all you get is more dragons.”Moving through four decades, Hill also moves with effortless ease between genres: as the friends attempt to deal with the situation they find themselves in by, variously, picking people who are obviously evil to sacrifice, or hunting down ways to kill the dragon themselves, we go from thriller to dark fantasy, black-ops torture to romance to horror. My favourite genre switch was to a quest story, deep in the caves below Cornwall, a section sprinkled with JRR Tolkien that was gloriously terrifying.There are trolls – bridge-dwelling ones and online ones, properly scary and perfectly brought to life. There are magical swords and betrayals, heart-stopping scenes of courage and ones of dreadful evil, both human and otherworldly. It’s a tour de force: a horror novel that is above all a paean to the imagination, and to love and friendship. “We needed a story to believe and now we’ve got one,” says Colin as the friends sit around the table, preparing to summon their dragon into being with the force of their minds.As Hill puts it in his epigraph: “Hic sunt dracones”.

Set in a secure hospital in Birmingham – walled off from the rest of life – occupational therapist Naomi (Aimée Powell) starts hosting weekly Caribbean cooking classes. Believing in the meditative power of food, she hopes to engage the men with memories of home-cooked meals and maybe even provide a space for difficult conversations to flourish. But, with Ty, Leroy and Daniel’s simmering histories at play, the room can tip into conflict with one wrong step.Over the course of the sessions, the men’s pasts gradually become less hazy. The youngest, Ty (a witty, bravado-infused performance from Corey Weekes), is desperate to get out and return to prison. Leroy (David Webber) has been on the ward for what feels like for ever and fears leaving as much as he longs for freedom. The newest arrival, Daniel (Darrel Bailey), just wants to get fixed quick and reconnect with his family. Griffin holds back the details of the characters’ offences until just the right moment, letting us get to know them first. When we finally hear snippets of them, it feels like a punch to the skull.Big Ange review – divided Britain faced down by a dinner ladyRead moreThat’s because each of them is shaped into a figure of depth and substance, and Griffin’s play zooms in on what it’s actually like to exist in an environment like this. Banter and tension bubble between the group, and what seem like small things on the surface become monumental – such as the idea of cooking for loved ones on the unit’s friends-and-family day. There are some exceptional performances too, especially from Webber, whose voice wobbles and cracks as Leroy attempts to craft a letter to his estranged daughter.Breathwork is central to Corey Campbell’s direction, which sees the men reaching violently forward in movement sequences between the scenes. With sound composed by XANA, the potential for full-blown rage hangs thick in the air. We remain hungry to stay with the men at the play’s close, with the final scene feeling unresolved. But Griffin paints a vivid picture of a system in crisis. Driven by Naomi’s impossible battles with the people higher up and a desperate want for things to get better, it stings.AtBush theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But you don’t feel the dread.Arifa Akbar, the GuardianMia Carragher, daughter of ex-footballer Jamie, is an energetic central presence as Katniss Everdeen, the warrior who fights off rivals in the gory contest that’s the ratings equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing in Panem, the grim state ruled by a foppish elite. But the fact that she’s required to narrate much of the story while sprinting here and there is a distinct flaw.Clive Davis, the TimesPlaywright Conor McPherson and director Matthew Dunster have set this dystopian tale in a drab, delicately evoked version of Depression-era America, where the inhabitants of District 12 eke out a living amid coal-mining disasters and food shortages. A chorus of townsfolk sway like sun-bleached clothes on a washing line, powerless and adrift, in choreographer Charlotte Broom’s evocative movement sequences.Alice Saville, the IndependentIn the chrome-and-glass dystopia of Canary Wharf in east London, most of the money looks like it’s been blown on creating a hi-tech colosseum. Eight vertiginous banks of seating – some of which move during the performance – open out into a runway, or close in to form the killing fields … Martial arts, modern dance, and hand-to-hand combat are what drive the pageant, heightened by strobe lighting and nasty white noise.Patrick Marmion, Daily MailView image in fullscreenIndefatigable … Mia Carragher in The Hunger Games: On Stage.Photograph: Johan PerssonSet pieces rise up from beneath the arena-like stage, and props are lowered from above.

Moreover, they don’t critique the queasy subject matter. There’s simply never enough sense that we, the audience, are complicit in what we are seeing … Given that the story is about children killing each other in the name of TV entertainment, the failure properly to characterise the tributes themselves is almost a moral problem.Claire Allfree, the Telegraphskip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Twenty years in the north-east with her Tottenham accent intact, she has a heart-driven sense of right and wrong. She is all community spirit. After an epiphany seeing football manager Ange Postecoglou, she reinvents herself as Big Ange and helps turn the school team into a winning squad.Meanwhile, the forces of good and evil are lining up to fight for the soul of 18-year-old Steven Mooney (Curtis Appleby), a Blyth boy distressed by his Northumberland town’s economic decline and eager to find someone to blame. Will he go with big sister Caroline (Erin Mullen) who has taken her socialist values south for a comfortable life of middle-class protest? Or will he throw in his lot with the charmingly sinister fascist with no name (Lucy Eve Mann) who encourages his Islamophobic online videos?It is close enough to Christmas to guess how this morality tale will play out, but that is not to underestimate the importance of the playwright’s questions. Eastlake, who continues to enjoy success with his adaptation of Jonathan Tulloch’sGerry & Sewell, has some uneven writing, underdeveloped themes and the odd misfiring joke as he swings between his parallel stories, but he also has a keen sense that all these issues – deprivation, justice, radicalisation – need to be discussed openly with empathy and humour.As a director, his fielding of an all-dancing, all-scoring chorus of eight, in defiance of the small stage, is a shrewd move. Their synchronised exuberance gives theatrical life to questions affecting us all.At Live theatre, Newcastle,until 22 November.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a place in which the haves and have-nots are divided into districts, and in which children are pitted against each other as “Tributes” in a deadly TV gameshow, forced to kill for prime-time entertainment.

The show does not manage to nail her relationship with Gale (Tristan Waterson) but how can it, when he is not part of the central gameshow world, and when it is trying to achieve so much else?View image in fullscreenNo fizz … Euan Garrett (Peeta Mellark) and Mia Carragher (Katniss Everdeen) in The Hunger Games: On Stage at Troubadour Canary Wharf theatre, London.Photograph: Johan PerssonCarragher, complete with Katniss’s signature plait, is fresh-faced, physical and thankfully does not imitate Lawrence’s laconic performance. Euan Garrett as Peeta, her fellow District 12 Tribute and picture of pure goodness in the book and film, feels more of a sidekick. The romance between them does not bubble up enough beneath the surface, and it is Katniss’s brief friendship with Rue (Aiya Agustin) that is more affecting.Because of the pace, there is not enough time for characters to come to life, from the stylist Cinna (Nathan Ives-Moiba) to the escort Effie (Tamsin Carroll). The actors do capable impressions of their screen counterparts instead: Cinna wears the same gold eye makeup as Lenny Kravitz, Joshua Lacey as Haymitch channels Woody Harrelson’s voice, with the same abrasive rakishness, while Carroll even has a physical resemblance to Elizabeth Banks’ Effie in the film.View image in fullscreenCameo … John Malkovich (centre, screen) as President Snow.Photograph: Johan PerssonJohn Malkovich, appearing on screen as President Snow, goes his own way a little more, not as lugubriously contemptuous as Donald Sutherland in the film, more blank-eyed and Spock-like. But he remains as flat as his 2D image, more a cameo than a character.‘A venue like this doesn’t exist elsewhere’: inside the colossal arena built for The Hunger GamesRead moreAt times, the contestants look less like modern-day gladiators and more like TV’s Gladiators (the cheesy, Lycra-clad stars of the original 1990s show). The Tributes are impressively athletic and look caffeinated to the eyeballs, but feel benign even as they come on doing tricks with daggers or bows and arrows.Made in the same mould as the stage version ofStranger Things, this show is not as consistently eye-popping. The production bursts into life in the second half, when the Tributes find themselves in the killing field. There is a brutal frenzy as light, sound and movement combine forcefully. It excels in action drama, and at times seems like an analogy for child soldiers in real-life wars.The biggest advantage the stage production has over the film and book is that the auditorium of this new theatre really does seem like a gameshow space, with us as its bloodthirsty audience, and there are even some moving blocks of seats to create a sense of immersion.Fans of the series will probably lap it up and the ending leaves it well open for the burning girl to return, and return.

The groundbreaking drama series Play for Today is backThe revered BBC strand that gave us Abigail’s Party and The Black Stuff makes a return … on Channel 5. Will it be as successful as in its heyday?Mark LawsonThu 13 Nov 2025 09.24 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 11.24 ESTShareIn March 1977, BBC One screened Spend, Spend, Spend, a single drama about a woman whose husband won the pools, a weekly competition to guess football scores. This week, Channel 5 will show Big Winners, a one-off play about the national lottery turning a couple into multimillionaires.The parallel, intentional or not, is appropriate. Jack Rosenthal’s Spend, Spend, Spend, which won a Bafta, was one of the standout successes of Play for Today, the prime-time drama strand that ran on the BBC’s main channel from 1970 to 1984. Big Winners, written by Martha Watson Allpress, is included in 5’s four-play revival of the Play for Today franchise.With only three channels available for watching (until the arrival of Channel 4 in 1982), the original BBC series reached many millions. It is often remembered as a slot for new TV writers and did develop several – including David Hare and Stephen Poliakoff – but also drew on established TV dramatists (Dennis Potter, Alan Plater), famous stage playwrights (John Osborne) and novelists (Fay Weldon, Ian McEwan, William Trevor). From its opening sample, the new run showcases newer writing talent.Under Ben Frow, its director of programming, 5 has taken to rebooting shows from the last century to court an older audience that the first four British terrestrial channels may be neglecting. Remakes include All Creatures Great and Small, Dalgliesh and Challenge Anneka. But while those revivals looked very similar to the originals, Play for Today’s relationship with its ancestor is more complicated. As well as Spend, Spend, Spend/Big Winners, each of the 2025 quartet has a twin in the earlier collection.View image in fullscreenA joy … Anita Dobson and Nigel Havers in Never Too Late.Photograph: Dan Fearon Designs/5/Vertigo FilmsThe four new dramas start on 13 November with Never Too Late, written by Simon Warne and Lydia Marchant, in which Anita Dobson plays a widow encountering flirtation in a rest home. It’s a more mature version of the plot of Colin Welland’s 1973 Play for Today, Kisses at Fifty. David Whitehouse’s new drama A Knock at the Door, which casts Alan Davies as a “national treasure” visited by a young, accusatory male, has a tense premise similar to Barrie Keeffe’s 1977 Gotcha ,in which a pupil locks his bully of a PE teacher in a cupboard and threatens to set him on fire. And Special Measures by Lee Thompson, with Jessica Plummer as a teacher juggling extreme pressures on the day of an Ofsted inspection, might be a grandchild of John Challen’s Headmaster (1974), in which a traditional head tries to adapt to a changing education system.If not a deliberate shadowing, these parallels most likely arose because any shortlist of mainstream viewer concerns, then and now, includes money, sex, violence and education. And there is a significant difference between yesterday’s Play for Today and today’s. The first version was politically ideological to the degree that rightwingers satirically called it “Plays for Trotskyists”. Several memorable editions – Jim Allen’s The Spongers (1978) and United Kingdom (1981), and Trevor Griffiths’ All Good Men (1974) and Country (1981) – were explicitly socialist critiques of British society.Admirers of the original series will crave plays about asylum seekers or a group of Tory voters who have defected to Reform. But the days of such narratives in peak-time TV are probably over. The four new plays focus on the well-heeled middle classes and feel essentially apolitical. That reflects a broader change in culture; political drama tends more towards even-handedness, as represented by the work of James Graham.View image in fullscreenCash grab! … Paul Copley and Sue Johnston in Big Winners.Photograph: Joel Pammenter & Karl Livingstone/5 Broadcasting/LA ProductionsTwo of the four new plays –Big Winners and Never Too Late – count women among their writers, a proportion that differs significantly from the original. Play for Today’s writers were predominantly male, although some women – Paula Milne, Julia Jones, Carol Bunyan, among others – made significant contributions when allowed.Another potential departure from the BBC series is the possibility that this is not focused solely on one-off plays. Certainly, the opener, Never Too Late, ends with a plot twist, moving the story to a new location, that could seed a six-part comedy-drama at the very least. And viewers might be lured to it, given the cast attached: Dobson, Nigel Havers and Tracy-Ann Oberman, the latter in a small role with potential to expand. Big Winners and Special Measures also have series potential, although they would bump into the memory of ITV’s At Home With the Braithwaites (2000-03) and the BBC’s Waterloo Road (2006-15, 21-present). Perhaps, though, Frow wants to add versions of those to his nostalgic roster of old hit shows.The original Plays for Today certainly featured a few shows that went on to have a longer life. Among the 300 or more instalments were John Mortimer’s story of a shabby barrister, Rumpole of the Bailey (1975); Alan Bleasdale’s story of Liverpudlian road-layers, The Black Stuff (1980), and his teenage drama Scully’s New Year’s Eve (1978); Philip Martin’s Gangsters (1975), featuring civil war between Brummie thugs; and Challen’s Headmaster, an early warning of Britain’s dangerous educational inequalities. All became series, with Rumpole running to seven seasons, although on ITV rather than the BBC.Curiously, two Plays for Today later became West End musicals: Spend, Spend, Spend and Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976), both by Rosenthal, a colossus of the slot who also wrote the poignant wartime piece The Evacuees. And the most revered Play for Today ever – Mike Leigh’s Abigail’s Party (1977) – started as a stage play, as did another Leigh contribution to the series, almost as popular: Nuts in May (1976).View image in fullscreenJuggling it all … Austin Haynes and Jessica Plummer in Special Measures.Photograph: Joel Pammenter & Karl Livingstone/5 Broadcasting Limited/LA ProductionsIf the aim is for the four new Plays for Today to remain as one-shot dramas, it would be daringly contrary to the prevailing TV culture. Streamers want “long content” to sustain subscriptions and feed multi-season box sets on websites. Even a four-parter, such as Adolescence, was considered worryingly short by Netflix until that quartet of episodes made such a spectacular impact.The original Play for Today was remarkable for its scale: 20 or so dramas a year for 14 years. Inevitably, with that volume, the “right to fail” – a popular concept in culture at the time – was frequently claimed. This was how TV worked in those times of financial and artistic freedom, and it was important: if each series producer had been asked in advance to pick the six from each annual 20 that were really good, plays now feted would never have been made, because hits are often unpredictable.View image in fullscreenMenacing … Nikki Amuka-Bird in A Knock at the Door.Photograph: Joseph Conway/Vertigo Films/Channel 5However, if Frow announced he was making 20 single plays in 2025 or 26, his bosses would send him to a doctor. The four we have are an impressive start: in particular, the acting and writing in Never Too Late are a joy, and A Knock at the Door has a menacing premise.Given 5’s positioning as 1980s TV in exile, it’s unsurprising that two of the main characters are octogenarians and two septuagenarians. This is demographically sensible and a commendable stand against ageism – although, if it persists, it may become a limitation. Cinematography is also frank about the realities of some older bodies. Davies in A Knock At The Door and Michael Fenton Stevens in Never Too Late boldly take their shirts off, camera angles sparing nothing, the latter scene leading to a lovely punchline.As long as not too many of the scripts are pilots in disguise, the revival of a strand that was once a symbol of British television drama’s ambition and confidence feels welcome.Play for Today: Never Too Late airs on Channel 5 on 13 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having an independent label, Invada Records, I wondered if I could actually make a film. I was at school with [co-writer and actor] Marc Bessant, I’ve worked with [director] John Minton for 20 years and I met [co-writer] Rob Williams – a scriptwriter for Judge Dredd and stuff – when he moved to Portishead [Somerset]. The idea of someone trapped in an upside down car comes from JG Ballard’s Concrete Island. Initially it was gonna be a horror film where the character was attacked by rabid dogs, but instead we set it during the end of rave culture. I immediately thought of Jason Williamson fromSleaford Modsfor the role of a poacher and it turned out that his dad had rabbited. He’s brilliant in it.How easy was it to recreate the sense of the 90s rave scene on film?k4ren123There are only a couple of sequences, but we wanted to capture the way the rave scene went from free festivals to something more corporate where the drugs were really organised. All my mates inPortishead[the town] were ravers. I wasn’t. I went to a couple, but for the film I looked at lots of old footage and bought most of the clothes for the film on eBay. Nineties rave wasn’t fluorescent outfits. They were ordinary kids in street gear, so I’d think: what kind of trainers were they wearing?When the three classic Bristol albumsDummy [Portishead, 1994],Maxinquaye [Tricky, 1995]andProtection [Massive Attack,1994]came out around the same time the analogue/electronic production blew my mind. Did you know how connected and influential those three albums were or were you too busy bickering with each other?bruce66There was no bickering, because the grand masters like DJ Mushroom from Massive, the Wild Bunch [sound system] and Smith and Mighty were all really supportive. I’d made tea and sandwiches in the studio when Massive made Blue Lines. Tricky worked with Mark Stewart from the Pop Group. So there was a wealth of experience. Everyone had the same punk attitude of “London music industry people are pricks. Don’t try and fuck with us. We’re not desperate for your money.” But we all signed to major labels who had money to promote us, which made a huge difference. We all worked in different studios so didn’t see each other much, and once the records took off we didn’t see anyone. I used to fight against the idea that there was a “Bristol scene”, but before us there’d been people like Rip Rig + Panic or a punk/reggae band called Head, so there was definitely something in the air that moved everyone.View image in fullscreenGeoff Barrow, Beth Gibbons and Adrian Utley of Portishead in Bristol, 2011.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverDid you ever imagine that your sonic experiments on Dummy would become the backdrop to so many romantic entanglements – andhow do you feel about being the unsung hero of the 90s sex playlist?VerulamiumParkRangerI’ve heard that people were going out, doing ecstasy, coming back, smoking spliffs and putting Dummy on. If you just listened to the music, you’d think: “That’s really chilled, man.” However, the worst thing that anyone can say about my music is that it’s chilled! That makes me throw up. They’re only listening to Beth [Gibbons]’s voice, not what she’s saying, which makes a huge difference. I’ve had people actually say “My daughter over there was made to your music”, and I’m like, “fuck off”. I can’t think of anything worse to make love to.Beth Gibbons: Lives Outgrown review – long-awaited solo debut is a gripping study of ageing and lossRead moreIs there a chance of any new Portishead music in the not so distant future?Sebastiaan10No. Not for me. There’s so much to learn in film and film music, so that’s where my heart is, but we’ve never broken up. We just do different stuff. We did a gig for Ukraine and recorded Roads for Brian Eno’s Together for Palestine concert. Those are the sort of things that get us together to do something.How did you getWill [Young, no relation to the pop star] intoBeak>?I know him from Brighton. He would claim that Beak> needed some eyecandy.fizzbombsHa. We definitely needed eye candy. Matt [Williams] left and Ben [Power] from Blanck Mass phoned me and said, “I know someone who can do it.” Will came to Bristol and he’s been amazing and a lot of fun. What I loved about Beak> was that it didn’t matter if we were crap. We toured in a car and played King Tut’s in Glasgow to six people – the six people were the Horrors, who were playing the night after – and that was just after I’d headlined Latitude or whatever [with Portishead]. I’ve had to leave the band now because after a tour in Europe I started getting properly sick with exhaustion, which I took as a sign from my body telling me to slow down.A friend of mine once played in a football team alongside you. Were you any good?JohntaylorI’ve never been any good. I’m probably a bit better now than I was. There’s an over 50s team in the Bristol casual league called Bryan Munich and I always threaten that if I play twice a week I’ll get fit enough to play for them again. I never do, because I wake up on a Sunday morning, it’s pissing down and I think “Nah”. Film and music is a drier pastime.Do you remember the first time you were taken to the cinema and is that cinema still there?WifeofbathIt was a cinema called the Clevedon Curzon close to Portishead and it’s still there, one of the oldest cinemas in the UK. I was taken on a Sunday school trip to see Bambi. Later, when I was 16 my dad took me to see Blue Thunder, a kind of cheaper Airwolf. It was an 18 so my dad went: “Sorry, lad, you can’t get in.” He was too honest. The cinema has an amazing history. My gran and my auntie Kay were inside when it was bombed during the second world war. We’re going to screen our film there, which will be really special.View image in fullscreenBarrow, centre, with his Beak> bandmates: Will Young (left) and Billy Fuller.Photograph: Adela Loconte/ShutterstockI could listen to the opening50 seconds ofRoadson a loop for hours. Is there any song intro that makes you feel the same?DeJongandtherestlessContract on the World Love Jam, a Terminator X instrumental track on Public Enemy’s Fear of a Black Planet. It starts with church bells and when the beat kicks in it doesn’t matter how many times I’ve heard it, it still gives me goose bumps. A few Low tracks do that to me as well, especially Plastic Cup.I loved the Quakers album with the vocalists found on Myspace. Do you know which of them went on to have a career in music?JoetteWhen I set up Invada Records with Ashley Anderson AKA DJ Katalyst, Myspace was thriving and it was a great way to discover music. We had loads of hip-hop beats, so as well as approaching professional MCs we put instrumentals on Myspace and asked people to rap over them. All these kids ended up on a record next to someone they really respected. There was a guy called Jonwayne [who] now does beat tutorials; a hardcore Texas Christian rap crew who rapped about God and then broke up. Guilty Simpson does lots of stuff. Tone Tank is an Italian guy from New York who’s an extra in CSI and stuff. I recently saw a video of him driving a Cadillac alongside a guy dressed as a fish.Are you still grumpy on social media?figgrossI’m not grumpy. I just get very let down by the music industry. I come across so many amazing musicians and they’re not being raved about because they aren’t the ones with a marketing budget. When you get inside the industry you realise there are some pretty nasty people out there, but I’ve never lost that feeling of “this music is shit”, which is probably not a good look for a white guy in his 50s.‘It’s dark in the US right now. But I turn on a light, you know?’: Mavis Staples on Prince, Martin Luther King and her 75-year singing careerRead moreMy uncle John played keys for Portishead back in the day, so they were the first band I ever saw live. What was the first gig you ever went to?SamuelStockleyMy first proper gig was Cameo in Bristol – amazing superhero alien funk guys from the States, with codpieces and massive hair. However, the first band I saw were a three-piece playing the hits at a caravan park in the mid-70s. The drummer, Roy, let me play his drums when they had a break. I was about nine and still learning drums when I did my first public performance, at Pontins in Torbay. There was a camp comedian who dressed as a nazi who would go around with a broken air gun, telling anyone he saw kissing: “We don’t have smut in this camp!” One night he ordered the band to stop, pointed his rifle and made the drummer disappear. The organist asked: “Does anyone know how to play the drums?” So I got up and played.Game is in cinemas from 21 November, with a screening/Q&A tour from 17 November.

Given our dating and ticketing hellscapes it is interesting to consider which is the more reliable pleasureElle HuntThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 01.02 ESTShareLet’s say you find yourself with an evening free. You’re feeling refreshed, open to experience, and eager to shake things up a bit from your usual post-work routine of slump-and-scroll. The world is your oyster! Would you rather a) go to a gig or b) have sex? The answer, as is so often the case with these “would you rather” questions, is obviously: “It depends.” Thinking adults may reasonably inquire: what is the gig? Who is the sex with? Is it likely to be good?Few would opt for a Limp Bizkit/Slipknot/Korn triple bill if one enchanted evening with Jonathan Bailey was the alternative. But adjust either end of the equation, and it becomes less clearcut. For the40,000 people asked this question by gig promoter Live Nation, however, no such clarification was offered – and the response came out unambiguously and overwhelmingly in favour of gigs.Live Nation’s global Living for Life report, surveying 40,000 people aged between 18 and 54 in 15 markets (or, as you may know them, countries) found that concerts are now the world’s top form of entertainment, ranking above sports, movies and – yes – sexual intercourse (or, as I recently and unpleasantly heard it dubbed, “inty”). If limited to one type of entertainment for the rest of their lives, 39% of respondents chose live music, versus going to the cinema (17%) and sports events (14%). They were also more than twice as likely to choose seeing their favourite artist in concert (70%) over sex (30%).You show up hopeful of being pleasantly surprised – and quite often you’ll end up with someone else’s hair in your mouthOf course it’s not surprising that a PR survey, conducted for a gig promoter, should come out so overwhelmingly in favour of gigs – and, in the freewheeling, speculative spirit of a would-you-rather, if your favourite artist is, say, Paul McCartney, you can see why watching him in concert might win out over a common or garden shag. But this binary choice between live music or sex, obviously silly though it may be, is interesting to consider given the odd juncture we’re at with both.In recent years, gig-going has become not just a communal experience but a competitive sport. Live Nation duly points out that stadium attendance has “tripled year-over-year”, and festivals sell out faster than ever. Simply getting tickets now requires military-level planning, rapid-fire response times and bottomless pockets (or a generous credit card limit). Even if you’re successful, it’s not enough to simply turn up and enjoy the show. There’s now an expectation, at least among pop fans, that you can boost your return on investment by attending more than once (even travelling internationally), swotting up on the set list ahead of time and knowing your marks to hit and calls-and-responses established by previous crowds.I am still scarred bymy experience of the Taylor Swift Eras tour: what felt like a choreographed performance of 72,989 people, to which I alone turned up not knowing the steps. That 18-month, $2bn juggernaut was proof of the lengths to which people will go to feel part of a cultural moment and see their favourite artist perform, even if the actual music seems increasingly secondary to the spectacle.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not as simple as a straightforward choice between one or the other’ … A couple kissing at Glastonbury.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersSex, on the other hand – a relatively cheap and accessible pleasure – is in dire straits. According toa 2020 YouGov survey, about a quarter of Brits had sex in an average week, while just under a third were sexually inactive. In the US, in 2021, 26% of American adultssaid they had not had sex a single timein the past year, up from 20% in 2010. In both territories, the shift has been attributed toless sexual activity among younger people. Compare this with the market driving growth for stadium extravaganzas and the cutthroat competition for tickets. Of course it’s not as simple as a straightforward choice between one or the other – “would you rather see the Eras tour five times, or remain a virgin?” – but it’s perhaps an indication of which is perceived as the more reliable pleasure.Sex and live music are more comparable than you might think. Both represent the activation of a relationship, a real-world test of impressions or potential that might have amassed only in your head. You show up with some idea of how it’s likely to go, but hopeful of being pleasantly surprised – and whether it proves good or bad depends very much on whether your energy and expectations match theirs. Quite often you’ll end up with someone else’s hair in your mouth, and afterwards be hanging out for a cigarette and some quiet time by yourself. And, in both cases, drugs and alcohol can either enhance or detract from the experience (but definitely make the most dire occasions easier to weather).Music sounds better with you? How your listening habits affect your love lifeRead moreThe magic to both gigs and sex depends on finding that elusive sweet spot between familiarity and novelty, similarity and difference, effort and ease. Of course it happens only rarely – but it’s the memory of when they did, the knowledge that it’s possible, that motivates us to try again: to go out on that date, or shell out for those tickets. Materially, of course, they starkly diverge. Perhaps the most revealing truth we can glean from this promotional survey on sexual versus musical serendipity is that the pursuit of one is much more fraught than the other. Given the bad behaviour, desultory encounters and even open hostility that seem to define dating at the moment, it’s no wonder people say they’d rather go to a gig instead.Personally speaking, it would be a no-brainer to relive my favourite-ever gig (Carly Rae Jepsen in the packed-out basement room of XOYO in London) over the average one-night stand. But I’ve also been to many shows, including some by my most cherished artists, that I couldn’t wait to finish: I wasn’t in the mood, or something about the environment was putting me off, or they were doing this experimental new stuff I wasn’t into. The variables are numerous, and nigh-on impossible to prejudge: it could be exhilarating, a night you’ll remember for ever and which reaffirms your faith in the medium – or you might find yourself impatient to leave before the encore. Either way, you won’t find out by spending another night at home alone on the couch.Explore more on these topicsMusicSexPop and rockDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Doig’s Maracas painting features towering speaker stacks.“I was actually quite nervous,” says Doig. “Would people be sort of scratching their heads and saying ‘why do we need music to look at paintings?’.”Peter Doig: House of Music review – intoxicating paintings with a banging soundtrackRead moreBut Doig isn’t the only artist using high-end audio gear or sound systems in his work. His exhibition is part of a growing trend where artists are turning the gallery into a listening space.Theaster Gates hosted listening sessions during his shows atthe White Cubein New York, with selections drawn from his expansive vinyl collection. At Liverpool’s Walker Gallery, Zinzi Minott’s “blood-filled” speaker hummed over the groundbreaking Conversations group show, while this spring V&A East hostedSound Clash, a weekend of sound system-based activity.Later this month, Autograph and House of Dread hostListening Room, a performance that explores “how sound operates as presence, erasure and resistance within archives”, while Doig has called on friends to host their own sound service sessions (this week the poets Roger Robinson and Linton Kwesi Johnson take control).There has already been a clear increase in the number of Japanese-stylelistening barsacross the UK, but the visual arts trend is also harnessing sound system culture, whichoriginated in Jamaica in the 1950sand was initially a cheap, democratic way for neighbourhoods to listen to the latest releases.It then made its way to Britain with the Windrush generation, including the first system run by Duke Vin in west London, which helped to transform UK music with its introduction of heavy, rib-tickling bass.Doig was exposed to Caribbean sound system culture when he moved to Trinidad. Even at his daughter’s school fete there was a huge speaker stack, “something you’d have at Notting Hill on the street would be there”, just for the kids. “Sound system culture is just something that’s there,” he says. “It is just a fabric of the country.”Prof Julian Henriques, of Goldsmiths, University of London, who has spent a career studying and participating in sound system culture, says the work of Doig is part of a new frontier being opened up. “I think it’s new territory for sound systems,” he says. “It is taking it to new audiences and they’re being seen in a different way.”Henriques references the Turner prize-nominated Black Obsidian Sound System, a Black and Brown queer collective of artists who have hosted takeovers at the Whitechapel Gallery and are reimagining the sound system as a community resource. “They’re actually opening up the sound system culture to an entirely new world,” says Henriques, who notes that traditionally it was a male pursuit.It’s not just visual arts where sound systems are popping up, either: they’re also the latest accessory for fashion houses, with Valentino inserting a high-end audio system in its New York flagship store where it hosted a10-hour listening session.During this year’s Milan design week, Stone Island collaborated with Shivas Howard Brown’sFriendly Pressure, while Doig arguably triggered the fashion trend with his 2020 runway show collaboration with Dior, where huge speaker stacksloomed over strutting models.So why have the worlds of visual arts and fashion embraced high fidelity? The culture critic Suze Webb, who wrote about the trendin her Substack, says speakers are now status symbols. “Sound systems and quality hi-fi have over the last few years become cool and aspirational,” she says.Webb notes that there are more Black and Caribbean people in creative teams, bringing more “understanding and appreciation for sound system culture as a whole”.There’s also the looming influence of Virgil Abloh, who was a DJ before becoming a designer and whose protege Devon Turnbull built the OJAS Listening Room at 180 the Strand, which hosts deep-listening sessions.Henriques says that while some of sound systems’ original radical roots have been erased, the popularity of the culture is a positive.“I’d rather it was happening than not happening,” he says. “That’s to say, I’d rather the brand picked sound system as the backdrop to their fashion show or whatever than a skating rink or any other kind of cultural event.”Explore more on these topicsPeter DoigSerpentine GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the Who What Wear Instagram account, in comments below Hathaway’s post, followers made their feelings known. “Giving rockstuds that much airtime was a … choice,” wrote one, while another simply said “no to shoes”.On TikTok, the creatorNewsWithLilswrote: “I’m no fashion expert but even I know Miranda Priestly wearing Valentino rockstud shoes in 2025 is a diabolical move and not in a good way.”The reaction is in line with a wider trend for online debate after the release of trailers or on-set images from films and TV that have a fashion angle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were quickly trashed by fans, with one describing the images as “fashion murder”, with everything from the shade of blond of Pidgeon’s hair to the “wrong” handbag becoming a source of outrage.Strong reactions around costumes demonstrate the love of fashion in film and TV, which is something those making the shows are no doubt conscious of – so much so a preview of “wrongness” in the costumes could be deliberate and designed to get the internet talking and create more buzz before release.With the Rockstud, there’s also the possibility that the tide could turn and the shoe be viewed as a clever choice – because something that feels so behind the times is, in fact, ripe for a revival.“When I started at Vogue in 2011, I remember Rockstuds being a familiar sight,” says Julia Hobbs, a senior contributing fashion features editor at Vogue. “In my mind, there’s something deeply nostalgic about them.”She suggests there is more to come with the film. “If I were to play devil’s advocate, I’d say I’m always here for a vintage shoe revival – if we can call the 2010s vintage, which is a debate for another day,” she says. “And if anyone can kickstart a shoe trend, it’s Miranda Priestly.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's shoesThe Devil Wears Prada 2Meryl StreepAnne HathawaynewsShareReuse this content"

I like the freedom it gives us, but we have different approaches when it comes to keeping home comforts when we’re abroad.I believe Dave needs to acclimatise more to Barcelona in order to get the most out of it. When we got to our apartment this year, the furniture was a bit tired. So Dave decided to fix that by buying a load of blankets. He draped them over everything. Dave said he was covering up the worn-out furniture, but the flat now looks less like a Barcelona flat and more like a British student bedsit. He thinks I am just being pedantic and calls me a snob.He likes his home comforts too much and doesn’t do as much to embrace new thingsI know we have different tastes, and there’s a certain charm in the chaos, but his version of comfort just looks too much of a mishmash, and it seems as if he’s trying too hard to recreate a sense of our home in the UK.The blankets are really an example of a bigger problem, though. I think Dave likes his home comforts too much and doesn’t do as much to embrace new things. Whenever we travel, he will pack so many things from Britain that I’ll start to wonder: what’s the point in coming abroad? He will bring jerk seasoning, Marmite and Mini Cheddars. While I like all those things, I don’t feel we need them when we have moved to a country with better produce on offer.Bringing all these food items from home limits our chances to try new things. I think travelling and living in new places is all about putting yourself outside your comfort zone, whereas Dave prefers to play it safe.We’ve been together nine years and he’s always been like this. I find it quite funny, but I also don’t like him taking up packing space with teabags and crisps. Dave needs to branch out and try the local delicacies. The blankets he’s draped over our furniture and the British foods he’s brought have made me believe he needs to be more open-minded.We’re not in Barcelona to replicate our lives in London. He needs to stop trying to make our old tastes fit in here.Thedefence: DaveWe are abroad for six months a year, so I like to takefamiliar things. Jenna’s just being a snobJenna is one of those well-travelled people who likes to tell everyone else how to enjoy their trips. She can’t believe there are British cafes in Spain that serve a full English, and her mouth drops when she sees British people eating sausage and chips here.I jokingly call her a snob, but I see her point. You should embrace the local culture when you travel. But people should be able to enjoy themselves however they like. Not everyone wants to spend their mornings deciphering a Catalan menu.I like to feel at home when I’m away. I bring everything but the kitchen sink. I want my slippers, my favourite tea, my Mini Cheddars. Jenna, however, treats it like she’s a backpacker who must keep everything light.It was her idea to do hybrid living. We’re Irish but live in London, so we both have EU passports – we can just sublet our flat and off we go. She says we are not setting up a life abroad, just living away for six months, but six months is half the year, not a weekend away. Sometimes she forgets to bring essentials like socks, an iPhone charger or a decent jacket, and I have to try not to say, “I told you so.”When it comes to decorating the flat, I take the lead as I am the shopper out of us two. I bought blankets to add warmth and it’s my way of nesting. Jenna reacted as if I’d brought home a bunch of rags.I think home comforts are important when you’re abroad. They make you feel more grounded in your new spaceOur clashing styles were never an issue back home, but here she wants the tatty old furniture to be visible to “let the Spanish vibe shine through”. What Spanish vibe? It’s all tatty stuff that doesn’t represent Barcelona, but Jenna acts as if we are going to offend the locals. I don’t care about impressing the tourist police – it’s our home.I think home comforts are important when you’re abroad. They make you feel grounded in your new space. I’m probably more of a homebody than Jenna, but I’m up for travelling and living abroad, too. Jenna says my behaviour is a bit weird and that I’m not being “present” in our new home, but for me it’s about finding a balance and merging the old and the new.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Jenna seems like more of a free spirit who is happy to embrace the locals and the culture. As Dave is agreeing to her wishes, perhaps she could accept some of his?Mousumi, 53As Dave and Jenna go to Barcelona for half the year, I think he should be able to take some “home comforts” with him. It’s good that he sees Jenna’s point about embracing local culture, so maybe they could go shopping together to buy some Spanish furniture.Katharine 73Jenna’s idea of Barcelona feels curated, almost costume-like, but Dave actively rejects adapting. He’s turned living abroad into simply exporting his everyday habits, closing himself off to the culture around him. Living in another country is about expanding your horizons, not taking your familiar comforts with you.Daniel, 45I find myself missing burger and chips when I’m away from the UK for a while, so I empathise with Dave. Jenna sounds like she is being too strict about such matters. Why can’t he take his slippers away with him?Janine, 39It’s nice to have creature comforts with you when you’re away.

And, when there’s a chill in the air, I like to eat food than leans towards smoky and earthy flavours: charred vegetables, stews, sausages and mushroomeverything.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For this type of cooking and living, I tend to turn to north-west Italian reds, particularly those from Piedmont. You’ll find a range of wine styles in this region – Gavi di Gavi and moscato d’Asti are both made here – but there’s something about its red wines that I find helplessly alluring and seductive. The word Piedmont means “at the foot of the mountain”, a reference to its proximity to the Alps, and its wines are of international renown, even though they make up only a tiny fraction (less than 5%) of Italy’s total production. Demand for them is high, so expect prices to start a little higher, too (apologies in advance).Nebbiolo is perhaps Piedmont’s most famous red grape, and it’s often compared to pinot noir on account of it being similarly tricky to grow and its susceptibility to disease; it can also possess a pinot-like lightness in colour, with an expressive, complex nose. I’m very sensitive to its smell of rose petals, which seem to jump out of the glass. Derived fromnebbia, the Italian word for fog (perhaps due to the fact that, in winter, especially, mist collects in the hills of Piedmont), nebbiolo makes up 100% of the globally celebrated barolo and barbaresco wines.You’ll also find barbera, the most widely planted grape in Piedmont, with some of the most iconic examples found around Asti and Alba. Barbera is just as capable of producing age-worthy, elegant and earthy wines, but even so you get a sense that it tends always to play second fiddle to nebbiolo. That said, that’s also why barbera is often a fair bit cheaper.The dolcetto grape is even more under-appreciated, but in my book it offers just as much as its two more lauded siblings. You’re more likely to find and drink dolcettos when they’re young, being low in both acid and alcohol, because they’re not generally considered as age-worthy (though there are exceptions to every rule). Their finely meshed tannic structure makes them a great food match, though.Speaking of food matches, I asked Liam Colucci ofRaeburn Fine Winesfor advice, not least because he’s a) Italian and b) a lover of a fine wine BYOB. “Piemonte is blessed with perfect hazelnuts, truffles and mushrooms, and it’s as if the local wine is made for such dishes. For barolo, I love agnolotti with a guinea fowl filling, married with fresh ceps and a glossy sauce made from reduced stock. Barbera, meanwhile, pairs wonderfully with vitello tonnato – the like-for-like acid is electric.”Four Piedmont reds to whet the appetiteM&S Araldica Barbera d’Asti£9.50 Ocado, 14.5%. Oak adds spice and complements the fruity cherry notes. Made by a winemaking cooperative in the Asti region that works with 230 growers.GD Vajra Dolcetto d’Alba£16 The Wine Society, 12%. A core of blue fruit brings a graphite coolness.Il Poeta Barolo£22 Laithwaites, 14%. For affordable barolo, you’ll struggle to do much better. Perfumed and aromatic.Cantina del Nebbiolo Nebbiolo d’Alba£14 Waitrose, 14.5%.

These ones are fromThe Flygerians Cookbookby Jess & Jo Edun.Photograph: Clare Winfield/ Ryland Peters & Small.FoodJimi Famurewa’s recipe for puff-puff pancakesThese spongy, doughnutty snacks are a Nigerian staple with a Dutch twistJimi FamurewaThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareEfteling isa fairytale-themed, 73-year-old amusement parkin the south of the Netherlands that, after two consecutive years of visits, has become an acute obsession among my family. We love the vaguely folk-horror animatronic trees, witches and giant sea monsters lurking within a labyrinthine real forest. We love the anthropomorphised talking bins that plead (in a haunting, perpetual sing-song) for crumpled pieces of paper to be shoved into their suction-powered mouths. We love the inventive rides that, variously, judder along rattling wooden tracks, plunge cursed pirate ships into water, or nudge gondolas serenely through sylvan scenes of bum-flashing goblins showering beneath waterfalls.But our very favourite thing about the place might well be thepoffertjesstand, a perennially busy kiosk where exhausted families gather for dinky paper boats filled with these yeast-puffed and sugar-dusted miniature buckwheat pancakes that are a Dutch institution. Made to order in a vast, uniformly indented pan, speared through their light, custardy middles with toothpicks and served with a thick swoop of pale butter, they always prompt an acute, grunting sort of shared pleasure and succour. Poffertjes (pronounced a little like “poffeh-tyuss”) are the dangled prize for the four of us; a reliable salve to the jittery overstimulation-loop that only themed leisure environments can provide. When we cajoled the blubbering eight-year-old on to a haunted house attraction that then promptly broke down (I imagine this tale will be tearfully described to a therapist one day), a shared portion of a dozen, ethereally warm poffertjes was how we chose both to apologise and collectively soothe our jangled nerves.Flash forward to a year or so after my first encounter with poffertjes, and I was back in our south-east London kitchen, trying to contrive a way to make Nigerian puff-puff without deep-frying. This, for the uninitiated, is a quite different, almost-soundalike snack that nonetheless delivers a similarly potent hit of pleasure. West African in origin (and also known asbofrot), puff-puff are the bulbous, gratifyingly chewy Nigerian version of the yeasted drop doughnuts that many different food cultures seem to have a beloved version of. Puff-puff are peddled at Lagos roadsides, and are often whipped up to toast births and commemorate deaths. They are a spongey, sugar-glistened mainstay among the “small chop” snacks at a lavish Nigerian party; the thing my mother rarely leaves the house without the rudimentary ingredients for. Ask about the oil levels in her car and you could easily be referring to the giant bottle of Crisp ‘N Dry that has permanent residence in her boot.Puff-puff are always deep-fried: a sticky, aerated dough that’s plopped into a generously poured, roiling pan of oil with either a wooden spoon or (if you are a proper West African matriarch) a dextrous hand. This wouldn’t do for my specific puff-puff purposes – a cooking demonstration where deep-frying wasn’t possible – so I had to think laterally. And that is when I thought of poffertjes or, rather, a hybrid version of puff-puff pancakes, too good to be eaten only at breakfast or, for that matter, in the hallucinatory wilds of a Dutch amusement park.Puff-puff pancakesServes84 tsp dried active yeast(about 13g)120g granulated sugar, plus 1 tbspextra350ml warm water, or warm milk for a deeper flavour380g plain flour½ tbsp salt¼ tsp ground cardamom½ tsp grated nutmegNeutral oil, for frying75g icing sugar½ tsp ground cinnamonWhisk the dried active yeast with a tablespoon of granulated sugar and the warm water, then set aside for 10 minutes, until fully bloomed and foamy.Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the plain flour, salt, the remaining 120g granulated sugar, ground cardamom and grated nutmeg. Make a well in the middle, pour in the foamed yeast mix and stir to make a smooth batter. Cover with a couple of clean, damp tea towels and leave at room temperature for about 45 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size (it should be quite wet and tacky).Put a dribble of neutral oil in a wide, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat, then, working in batches, fry tablespoon-sized dollops of the mixture for two to three minutes per side, until puffed into chubby, golden-brown pucks. Set aside on a large, warmed plate while you cook the rest.Finish by mixing the icing sugar and cinnamon, then dust this mix over the top of the pancakes with a sieve. Eat as they are or with jam, curd, chocolate spread or chopped seasonal fruit.Picky, by Jimi Famurewa, is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £20.

In anothervideo, a user wrote that she liked a face-altering filter until she realized that it generated the appearance of a smaller nose. Now, new research shows that such filters, along with a collection of other race-related online experiences, can negatively affect Black adolescents’ sleep and ability to concentrate on schoolwork the following day.Anew studypublished in the Jama Network that looked at Black adolescents’ exposure to online racism – including traumatic videos of police violence, online racial discrimination and racial bias perpetuated by AI – can cause increased anxiety and depression. On average, Black adolescents experienced six race-related online experiences everyday – 3.2 of which were online racism, and 2.8 of which were positive.The research was led by Brendesha Tynes, a University of Southern California education professor and co-authored by Devin English, a Rutgers public health associate professor, and Taylor McGee, a Christopher Newport University assistant professor. They also analyzed survey data from 141 adolescents of Black descent between 11 to 19 years old throughout the nation.Asonline hate speech increasesand the federal governmentcracks downon diversity initiatives, which Tynes said has spurred the normalization of racism, investigations into youth’s exposure to online racism is more important than ever. “We need studies that are documenting what’s happening,” Tynes said. “And also we need platforms to help people to manage those experiences, to critique them.”In the absence of federal oversight to prevent online racism, Tynes said she hoped that states would “stand up to the current pressure to be silent on what’s happening, that they’ll create policies that specifically will protect young people of color from these experiences”.The study began with a nationally representative sample of 1,138 white, Black, Latino and multiracial adolescents recruited by Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel, a US online research panel. Out of the larger sample, 504 participants were asked to complete a seven-day survey for a nationwide look at young people’s online behaviors in December 2020. While the study authors only focused on Black participants’ responses, they hope to compare those experiences to that of adolescents of different races in the future.Some of the questions measured respondents’ mental health by asking them to write whether they had trouble falling asleep, concentrating on their school work, or if they were on edge on a scale from one, “not at all”, to four, “constantly”, over the last 24 hours. The study authors found that youth exposed to algorithmic bias reported depressive and anxious symptoms a day later. And participants who experienced more algorithmic bias also had higher levels of anxiety, regardless of their age or gender.“We expected each of the three types of online racism to be associated with the next day’s depressive and anxiety symptoms,” Tynes told the Guardian. “But I was still surprised that the algorithmic bias items were associated with mental health. It was the first time we were actually measuring it and although we expected it I was surprised that we actually found what we expected.”Respondents reported experiencing algorithmic bias one time per day every three days. Some of the survey questions about algorithmic bias included how many times in the past year that a filter made them look more European by lightening their skin and straightening their hair, or whether their content about racial justice didn’t get likes because a platform suppressed it.Questions about positive experiences that they had online around race included how many times they saw favorable comments or information about their race on a television show, film, a cultural website or social media. Another question asked how many times they learned something positive online about their race’s contributions to society in the past 24 hours. Participants had an average of 19.6 positive experiences per week, compared with more than 22 racist experiences online.“Given what we found in this study, it’s very, very concerning,” said English. “Companies will not regulate themselves on this and that’s the role of the government to step in. We haven’t seen any federal level legislation to protect young people from the harms of social media and the harms of AI.”Aside from affecting Black youth’s mental health, said Tynes, algorithmic bias can yield deadly consequences. Before Dylann Roof killed nine Black people in a South Carolina church in 2015, he typed“Black on white crime”, into Google, according to his manifesto, and the search algorithm’s results brought him to white supremacist sites that deepened his bias.“Instead of him getting, at the time, the justice department’s actual facts on crime and who’s committing it,” said Tynes, “he got these biased white supremacist results, and then that fueled his desire to commit a massacre.”Tynes wants youth to be armed with digital literacy tools that help them navigate algorithmic bias that perpetuates racism. Along with other researchers and designers at USC and the University of Maryland, she hopes to launch a platform next spring that offers virtual reality experiences, digital literacy and mental health tools to help youth learn how to, she said, “critique, counter and cope with the messages that they get online”. It will include modules where youth learn how racism gets introduced to online spaces.In the future, the study authors plan to collect and analyze youth’s responses for longer than a week’s time. Tynes also wants to see how the role of resilience and positive cultural messages helps adolescents navigate online racism. Tynes is curious about “how young people are using their creativity, the skills they got from being told about their group’s history, and how their parents instill pride”.She hopes to analyze whether teaching Black history in schools imparts students with the knowledge and confidence needed to “help people protect themselves, critique the messages, and place them in historical context so that they don’t have the impact that they have”."

Platforming sustainability and social issues, and showcasing local talent, it’s doing things a little differentlyUgonna-Ora OwohThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareInside a marquee in the grounds of Lagos’s five-star Federal Palace hotel and casino, models wearing sharply tailored suits and flowing woven pieces in earthy tones walk down the catwalk to the beats of Yoruba talking drums, an ancestral instrument that can mimic the sound of speech. The show, presenting thelatest collection from the brand Emmy Kasbit– known for transforming handwoven Akwete fabric into modern silhouettes – marked the official start of 2025’s Lagos fashion week, which took place in the former Nigerian capital last month.From a dedicated catwalk space featuring more than 70 designers, to the American singer Ciara closing one of the shows wearing a gele – a traditional Nigerian head wrap – the showcase, which takes place every October, has come a long way from its early days of power cuts and a lack of interest from industry gatekeepers.View image in fullscreenThe singer Ciara closes the Fruché catwalk show.While the big four fashion weeks – New York, London, Milan and Paris – remain the industry’s undisputed powerhouses, Lagos has quietly carved out its own space on the global calendar.Founded in 2011 by lawyer-turned-fashion-editor Omoyemi Akerele, Lagos fashion week continues to shape what fashion in Nigeria, and the wider African continent, is and could be.The event has grown into a five-day showcase and is attended by more than 15,000 people.Acting as a talent-spotlighting platform, many of the designers who have shown at Lagos have gone on to achieve success on an international scale. Size-inclusive womenswear designerOnalaja’s designs have been worn by stars including Lizzo, Jennifer Hudson and Chloe Bailey.Lisa Folawiyo’s work has been celebrated for modernising Ankara textiles into bold, embellished luxury fashion.Kenneth Ize, who reimagines Nigerian aso-oke weaving, has shown in Milan, Paris and New York.While the schedule includes pan-African designers, the focus remains largely on Nigerian talent. FromSevon Dejana’s couture-style glamour toHertunba, a brand that riffs on traditional aso-oke weaving techniques to create fun geometric designs, Lagos fashion week aims to capture and celebrate the breadth of what Nigerian fashion looks like today.View image in fullscreen‘Couture-style glamour’ at the Hertunba show.Photograph: Emmanuel Adegboye/EPA“It has helped build so many names in the industry,” saysAdebayo Oke-Lawal, the creative director ofOrange Culture– a brand that was a finalist for the LVMH prize in 2014, and had alive show at London’s Victoria and Albert Museumin 2024. Oke-Lawal’s innovative designs, reshaping narratives around identity and masculinity, have been worn by stars including Ncuti Gatwa, Lupita Nyong’o, Dua Lipa, Burna Boy and Beyoncé’s team for Black is King, her 2020 visual album exploring African culture. Since debuting at Lagos fashion week in 2011, Oke-Lawal has become a defining voice for modern African fashion. “It’s not perfect, of course,” he says of the event, “but it’s consistent. It genuinely cares about designers, and that’s what matters.”Still in its relative infancy compared with other fashion weeks – Milan was officially established in 1958 – Lagos has evolved since its inception. At the beginning, when the city’s creative scene was starting to form, there were teething problems: endless traffic jams, occasional power cuts in the city at large, and a long list of young designers waiting for their turn to build a name and a clientele. It was a fashion market with so much potential but without the infrastructure to help it grow.Now, having been held at the central Federal Palace hotel for a decade, the structures are in place – with more brands showing, an impressive list of invitees, and sponsorship from major multinationals, including Heineken.View image in fullscreenLooks from Kadiju, Orange Culture and Emmy Kasbit at Lagos fashion week 2025.Photograph: Stephen TayoOne of Lagos’ strengths lies in the fact that the industry moves differently in the city, being defined by community and storytelling rather than grand budgets or legacy houses. The result is more opportunity for creative innovation.Here, designers use their platforms to address themes such as sustainability, gender, identity and craft preservation, often drawing on community-rooted stories to do so.Challenges are transformed into catalysts for creativity – something designer Bubu Ogisi ofIamisigodid particularly well this season. Her collection, Dual Mandate, transformed recycled materials and discarded fabrics into sculptural, thought-provoking pieces. It was a perfect example of how Lagos’s designers continue to make meaning out of limitation, creating beauty from what others may overlook.Through initiatives such as theGreen Access(which focuses on craft-driven innovation by asking designers to reimagine waste) and Woven Threads (whichbrings sustainable ideas to life through exhibitions and installations exploring community and responsible consumption), the platform has reshaped how designers and consumers think about fashion.“Lagos fashion week is showing that sustainability can be liberating,” says Ogisi, who was the winner of the 2025 Zalando Visionary award at Copenhagen fashion week. “For us, it’s about finding new ways to express that, coming from the continent, using craft, and turning that into something truly global.”Every year, five young designers are selected by Green Access to be trained in making their practice more circular, with a catwalk showing the end result.Alexandra Obochiwas one of the designers chosen for this year’s prize, with Ifenkili, a collection that used indigo dyeing as one of its aesthetic techniques.View image in fullscreenLooks from Kilentar, Fruché and Iamisigo at Lagos fashion week 2025.Photograph: Stephen TayoThis focus on sustainability is, increasingly, recognised internationally. This month, Lagos fashion week was announced asone of the winners of the Earthshot prize, in the ‘Build a Waste-Free World’ category. It was awarded £1m, recognising its pioneering role in sustainable fashion.Akerelesaid that the recognition wasn’t simply about her, or the event – but about the community of designers and young people who continue to prove that African fashion has something powerful and lasting to offer. “Fashion has the power to create jobs, preserve culture, and transform lives,” she said. “That is why we do this work, and why being a winner will allow us to keep pushing for a future where fashion is not just beautiful, but also meaningful and responsible.”Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion weeksNigeriaAfricaShareReuse this content"

As we turn into the drive, the house reveals itself, a handsome limestone edifice framed by a steep ridge of wooded hills, ablaze with autumn colours, and fronted by rolling parkland where sheep graze on the riverbanks. Despite its bucolic aspect, this is a landscape that has been carefully honed and crafted over centuries by successive generations of the Cavendish family, who have lived in this beautiful corner of Derbyshire for more than 450 years.Some of the most significant alterations were made in the 19th century by the 6th Duke of Devonshire (also known as “the Bachelor Duke”), an extravagant character who had the estate village demolished and rebuilt over the brow of a hill because he felt it was spoiling the view from the house. His perfectionism paid off; as the long queue of cars snaking up to the ticket office on a beautiful October morning attests, Chatsworth is one of the most popular stately homes in the UK today, welcoming more than 600,000 visitors a year.Opening its doors to the public is just one of the ways that this grand old pile keeps the show on the road. The estate is a sprawling enterprise that covers a sizeable chunk of thePeak District national parkand has grown to encompass theChatsworth Farm Shop, dozens of holiday lets – ranging from shepherd’s huts to a 16th-century hunting tower – two pubs (theBeeley Innand thePilsley Inn), and theCavendish Hotel.View image in fullscreenThe Hide has doubles from £80 and good value meals made with produce from the estateThe latest addition to the fold is the Hide hotel, which is being pitched as an affordable, family-friendly alternative to some of the pricier accommodation in theChatsworth Escapesportfolio, with doubles from £80 a night, room only. Previously known as the Highwayman hotel, it sits on the A619 road from Chesterfield to Bakewell and was run as a Premier Inn and Beefeater restaurant for many years (“lots of orange and pictures of cows”, as one staff member described it to me). It reopened in October after a refurbishment overseen by Laura Burlington, daughter-in-law of the current Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. We’re among the first guests to stay in the new-look hotel.After completing the automated check-in (there’s no reception desk, but staff are on hand in the bar/restaurant next door), we settle into our family bunk room, which has a kingsize bed and built-in “cabin bunks”. The decor is simple but cosy, with soft woollen blankets and carpets, furniture made from reclaimed wood and modern artwork from the Cavendish family’s private collection.View image in fullscreenA family bunk room at the Hide hotel.Photograph: Anna BatchelorWe’re booked in for dinner at the Hide Grill and Pizzeria, which offers a “campfire-inspired menu designed for sharing and cooked over an open flame”. Fears of being marched outside and forced to sing Ging Gang Goolie quickly dissipate as we’re shown to a fireside table in a quiet corner of the large and sprawling restaurant. The menu offers a long list of crowd-pleasers from fish and chips to wood-fired pizzas and barbecued spare ribs, as well as kid-friendly desserts such as s’mores sharing boards. The food isn’t the only thing that’s designed with families in mind. There’s a dedicated play corner, with books, toys and a miniature kitchen to keep younger diners entertained while they wait for their food. It’s a Sunday, so we order from the roast menu – a choice of rotisserie chicken, Chatsworth estate-reared beef or lamb with all the trimmings, followed by ginger parkin with custard. The food is great, the portions generous and, at £18 a person, it’s incredibly good value.When the tapestries in the state drawing room were removed, they found chocolate wrappers dating to the 1930s stuffed behind themEntry to the house and grounds is not included in the room rate, but multi-entry tickets are available, which give unlimited access for the duration of your stay. Hotel guests can buy a day pass to theChatsworth Health and Fitness Club, a couple of miles away, with its pool, gym, tennis courts and treatments, and can book conservation tours during the winter when the house is closed to the public. Another perk is having direct access to the estate’s 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of park and moorland.In our room is a booklet of circular walks that start from the hotel or the nearby village of Baslow. One route takes you from the hotel’s back gate across the fields to Chatsworth House, a walk of around 5 miles; another takes you up toCurbar Edge, one of the Peak District’s distinctive gritstone escarpments. Walkers and cyclists are made to feel welcome here with bike and boot wash stations, cycle storage and an outdoor dog bath and shower for those bringing a four-legged friend. There’s also abus servicethat runs from Chesterfield to Chatsworth with a stop outside the hotel, making this a viable base for exploring the national park without a car.We’ve arranged to have a private tour of the house, and our guide, Martin, proves to be a mine of fascinating facts about the17 generationsof Cavendishes who have called this their home. He leads us through the breathtaking Painted Hall with its colourful frescoes, the regal State Rooms, the chapel, the cosy library (where a huge Christmas tree is being installed) and the purpose-built Sculpture Gallery, pointing out some of the artworks, which range from Roman and Egyptian sculpture to old masters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Martin tells us the house was used as a girls’ boarding school during the second world war. When the 17th-century tapestries in the State Drawing Room were removed for cleaning, they found Cadbury’s chocolate wrappers dating back to the 1930s stuffed behind them.We spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the grounds – the greenhouses, grotto, maze and spectacular Emperor Fountain, built in 1844, another addition by the 6th duke, who wanted to build the tallest fountain in the world to impress Tsar Nicholas I. In the event the tsar was a no-show, although Chatsworth has had its fair share of illustrious guests, from King Edward VII to novelist Elizabeth Gaskell and political philosopher Thomas Hobbes. There has been speculation that Jane Austen based her descriptions of Pemberley on Chatsworth, although there is no evidence that she visited. Nevertheless, the house stood in for Mr Darcy’s grand estate in the 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. “There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire,” wrote Austen in that same novel. If you’re looking for an affordable, comfortable and friendly base from which to explore the county, the Hide is a very decent place to start.The Hidehas doubles from £80 a night, and bunk rooms sleeping two adults and two childrenfrom £125, both room-onlyExplore more on these topicsDerbyshire holidaysWeekend breaksEngland holidaysDay tripsShort breaksCultural tripsUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for a significant and growing group, this is far from the caseKate McCuskerThu 13 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 09.04 ESTShareNow that she is retired, Deborah Herring’s days are hers to fill – usually with leisurely walks, museums and trips to the theatre. But she still manages to spare a thought for her ex-colleagues at the private boarding school where she taught religious studies for 14 years. “In their nice, expensive Oxfordshire village, I think they’d be frankly horrified about my situation,” she says with a laugh.Horrified that a few weeks ago she came home to find two strangers asleep on her sofa; horrified that she has to put up with an overflowing litter tray belonging to a cat that isn’t hers; above all, horrified that at the age of 65, she is about to leave a two-bedroom flatshare to move into a four-bedroom one where she will “probably be living with people whose combined age is less than my own”.Herring initially made the move toflatsharingtwo years ago, when, fed up with living alone in a rented house near Banbury, she moved to London and into her current place, which she shares with a thirtysomething couple. “I would rather do anything than live out the rest of my life in the country, where there’s barely one bus an hour,” she says. Now, after a period of feeling “slightly like a third wheel”, she is moving into a mixed-use block of flats in Bermondsey, south London.“I’m not going to have an elegant garden, and drink cocktails and have barbecues on my patio,” says Herring. Rather, she will share a kitchen with strangers, wait for twentysomethings to empty the washing machine, and try to find common ground with people who don’t remember a time before the internet. “It doesn’t actually bother me. I’ve got five children, so I don’t have a problem with young people,” says Herring, who has twice been married. Her teacher’s pension, coupled with a small income as a part-time A-level examiner, is enough to cover £1,000 a month in rent, plus the odd theatre ticket. “You’ve got to think about it as the chance to do something new and different – not as a comedown in the world,” she says.If it sounds like a less-than-ideal setup for a pensioner, many more of us will soon have to adopt Herring’s attitude. According to the English Housing Survey, just6% of householdsheaded by someone over 65 are privately renting. But the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) forecasts that this will almosttreble to 17% by 2040. Online rental platform SpareRoom says that the era of flatsharing in later life may already be upon us: just 2.7% of its users were aged over 55 a decade ago, compared to7.1% in 2024.View image in fullscreenDeborah Herring, 65, pictured in her new flat in BermondseyPhotograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe proportion of over-65s in the private rental sector has remained relatively unchanged in the past two decades – largely, says Anna Brain, a senior policy researcher for the PPI, due to the introduction of Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy policy in 1980. Among the over-65s, “we’re not seeing a huge increase in private renting yet, because a lot of those people had the opportunity to buy their home in the 80s and 90s,” she says.Many of these homes were not replaced with fresh council housing stock, leading to a lack in provision of socially rented properties. And yet today, more than40% of the homessold under the scheme are privately rented.“The challenges that younger people face getting on the housing ladder have really significant long-term implications,” says Brain. “Behind that [right-to-buy] group, you have a whole cohort of people coming through who couldn’t get social housing, didn’t have the right to buy, and then were faced with rising house prices.” In short, many more of us will have to make peace with renting into our twilight years. It’s unclear, though, how many of us could afford it.Andreas Savva, 68, pays £800 a month for a mould-ridden house in east London, which belonged to a friend’s mother. Savva’s ankylosing spondylitis – an inflammatory condition affecting the spine – makes his job in patient transport for a cancer charity increasingly difficult. “I can’t do the patients, so at the minute, I just move the vehicles around,” he says. The mould at home is exacerbating things: “It’s too toxic – it’s beginning to affect my lungs. I have to leave,” he says.Savva used to live rent-free in a house belonging to his brother, but he had to move out when his brother died without a life insurance policy. He was forced into a series of precarious living situations – first in a hotel, where he paid through the nose for a room, and then in his current place, where the smell of mould soaks into his laundry and garlands the kitchen walls.Now, the problem is that with a budget of £800 in a city where the monthly price of a one-bedroutinely tops £1,300, he is unsure of where exactly he can go. “I hate the idea of sharing,” says Savva. “I hate the idea of a place where there are so many people using the toilet and the kitchen. But I’ve got no choice.”“I should be retired, but I’m paying rent,” he says. “I need to keep working.” Though he has a small state pension and some money put aside, Cyprus-born Savva doubts he can stay in the UK. “I can’t just keep going on like this for ever,” he says.Even dedicated savers are unlikely to be putting aside enough money to allow for rent or mortgage payments in retirement. “The UK pension system is based on the assumption that people reach retirement without housing costs,” says Brain. “There’s a huge concern that people aren’t saving enough.” The PPI conservatively estimates that you would need about £180,000 more in your pension pot to cover the cost of renting a one-bedroom flat through later life. “Generally, the people who we find in rented homes over 40 are not high-income households. So to be able to pay their rent today and set aside enough to pay their rent in retirement is going to be incredibly difficult,” she adds.That’s assuming they find somewhere to rent in the first place. These days, 63-year-old Tamara Kocsubej spends an inordinate amount of time checking her SpareRoom account to see if anyone has responded to her pleas for a decent room in shared accommodation. “I’m checking it all day, every day,” says the Ukraine-born charity worker, who has rented in Nottingham and London since moving to the UK from Hungary.Her recent stint as a lodger came to an end after just under a month of renting from a live-in landlord, where she felt “unwelcome all the time”. So she took a room in a three-person Airbnb for £950 a month. Before that, she rented a room in a six-bedroom house in north London, which soured when her twentysomething flatmates began to make comments about her age. “At the end of every day, I didn’t want to go back,” she says. “I never used to live with a closed door. Now, I close my door all the time.“I actually like living with someone,” says Kocsubej. “I don’t want to live alone. But everywhere I look, people are in their 20s.” Many of them, she says, won’t even consider sharing with a 63-year-old. “I want tostaysomewhere. I want to be part of the community. It’s making me wonder whether I should go back to Hungary. But all of my life is here.” Last she checked, she was number 146 on one non-profit’s waiting list for affordable housing. “Every day I check and I wait. That’s all I can do,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘Every day I check and wait’ … Tamara Kocsubej.Photograph: Courtesy of Tamara KocsubejThe UK housing sector could hardly be less prepared for an influx of older renters.Just 12%of households in England headed by someone over the age of 75 have step-free access to their home. A report published earlier this week byAge UKreported a huge shortage of housing suitable for an ageing population, finding that 44% of over-50s are worried about accessibility.“When people talk about older people’s housing, they very often think of supported living,” says Age UK’s Lisabel Miles. “Actually, the vast majority of older people will be living in mainstream homes – not in some kind of specialist unit. And the vast majority of people will move when they’re younger and then age in that home.” The problem is that many existing properties are difficult to adapt – whether they contain plumbing that makes it hard for a bath to be replaced with a shower, or stairs that can’t accommodate a stairlift. Applying for a disabled facilities grant to cover the cost of adaptations is slow: on average, it takes247 working daysto get such a grant approved and the work completed. Then there’s the time that private renters may well have to expend on convincing their landlord to make the changes in the first place. “I’m desperate to find somewhere, but I’ve had to turn down rooms where the stairs just weren’t doable,” says Savva.Of course, there are social advantages to housesharing in later life. Digital marketer Nick Henley founded Cohabitas, an accommodation-sharing site for over-40s, when his father died and his mother was left alone in a three-bedroom house. “She was lonely,” says Henley. “She would ride the buses just to talk to people.” Though his mother quickly dismissed the idea of living with other people in her mid-70s (and never did actually end up sharing), he launched the site anyway, and says that today business has never been better, as a result of rent hikes, rising utility bills and a desire for connection. “The oldest person I’ve ever helped find a flatmate was probably 88,” he says. He admits that if given the choice, most people wouldn’t choose to share a house with strangers, but adds: “Many people would love to live in a flat with a friend, a partner or a family. They would not like to live in a flat on their own.”Herring supports this hypothesis: “It’s just nice knowing there are bodies around,” she says. “I’ve been surrounded by people all my life. It would be weird to now suddenly be living alone.”A flat of her own is all that Sarah (not her real name), a 55-year-old paralegal, has ever wanted. Despite being employed for the past 21 years, the self-described “veteran renter” from Surrey could never afford to buy. “There’s an assumption made that when you are a certain age, you are mortgaged, you’re married, you’ve got kids,” she says. “There’s a lot of ageism when you go to view places. It’s like a job interview or dating. I don’t want to be doing this at my age.”After 12 years in a beloved bedsit – “it wasn’t much,” she says, “but it wasmine,where I could do whatever I want, whenever I want” – she was tossed into the SpareRoom arena a few months ago when her landlord wanted the house back for her own family. After years of paying £500 a month for a flat with no central heating or washing machine, she realised she could probably never again afford to live alone.The flat hunt was brutal: months of messages, interviews and bruising disappointments. Each time she thought she’d found somewhere she might like to live, an email along the lines of “we just don’t think you’re suitable” would land in her inbox. “They may as well have said, ‘You’re too old.’ But what do they think a 55-year-old is going to do? Suddenly keel over and have a heart attack? It was upsetting, quite frankly,” she says.With a decade still to go until she reaches state pension age, she’s uncertain about whether she could stop working. A few weeks ago she found a room via a care-and-share scheme, offering companionship and light help to a woman in her 80s in exchange for affordable rent. “It’s fine,” she says. “I get to live with some dignity here. But then I remember that, again, I’ll eventually have to leave.”Explore more on these topicsHousingAgeingRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Narges Rashidi and Joseph Fiennes reveal how they brought their nightmare to the small screenZoe WilliamsThu 13 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 05.04 ESTShareWhen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Iran in 2016, it wasn’t immediately obvious what had happened – but within 100 days, we had the contours of the story. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, held a press conference. He had amassed 780,000 signatures on a petition for her release, anddelivered a letter urging the same thing to former PM David Cameron. This, it transpired much later, was after murky meetings with the Foreign Office in which civil servants insisted that the best thing, both for Nazanin’s release and the safety of her parents and brother in Iran, was to lay low and let diplomacy take its course.“It was state hostage-taking,” says Joseph Fiennes, who plays Richard Ratcliffe in the BBC’s four-part dramaPrisoner 951. “It clearly goes on, and innocent people and families are completely disrupted and tarred for life. And now I’ve told this story, I look at anyone that might be accused of something, and I don’t quite believe it.”After six years, the UK announced that it would repay the £400m Chieftain tank money. She was released that dayBack in July 2016, it was plain that something had gone terribly wrong. A dual national, Nazanin was held in jail on spying charges, separated from her two-year-old daughter. She was accused of attempting to overthrow the Iranian regime, of working for MI6, “empowering women” (in one interrogation) and earning money illegally. It sounded fanciful. She worked for Thomson Reuters – not its news-gathering arm, rather its charitable foundation – and she had legitimate business in Iran, taking her daughter to see her parents.If the charge sheet sounded dodgy to an unschooled audience, it rang louder alarm bells still in the Iranian diaspora, as Narges Rashidi, who plays Nazanin and was born in Khorramabad in Iran (moving to Germany when she was seven) attests. “We were all very aware that there was no truth to the made-up reasons they said she was being held.”But the UK was fresh from Brexit, and the day after that letter went to Cameron, Theresa May took over as prime minister. The news agenda only had eyes for constitutional chaos, and Boris Johnson was suddenly foreign secretary, with dire results. Probably the most attention the Zaghari-Ratcliffes got in this period was whenJohnson made his egregious remarksthe following year, that she’d been “teaching people journalism, as I understand it”, which was untrue and gave heft to the Iranian state’s trumped up allegations, making her position even worse.For all the information and intermittent debate, which Richard Ratcliffe worked so hard to keep alive while Nazanin fought to maintain her will to live, the human reality of this kidnapping is utterly shocking to see brought to life in Prisoner 951. Rashidi, who was inGangs of London, sounds so much like Zaghari-Ratcliffe it’s uncanny. She says that’s all testament to her dialect coach: her real English-speaking accent is mid-Atlantic and she lives in LA.Rashidi watched everything: interviews with Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and the heartstopping but understated reunion with her daughter. There is also surprising footage available: somehow the moment of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s capture at the airport has made it online. “A little tiny bit of footage; she wasn’t aware that she was being filmed.”I now look at anyone who is accused of something and I don’t quite believe itIn the drama, she is on a tightrope, suspended between the confidence of her innocence and the uncertainty that, if you can be arrested over nothing, who knows where that ends? Knowing what we know now, that she would be in prison for six years, it is absolutely mortifying to see all this play out in the emotions on her face. Her battle not to overreact; her futile attempt to resist the chaos of arbitrary state power. “To me,” Rashidi says, “that is a very different Nazanin to six years later. I saw somebody extremely petrified and extremely soft, not knowing what is happening to her. I met her strength later, after this whole ordeal.”View image in fullscreen‘He was lied to’ … Joseph Fiennes as Richard Ratcliffe.Photograph: BBC/Dancing Ledge Productions/Rekha GartonFiennes “had the privilege of sitting with Richard”, he says. “You don’t always get that with the person you’re playing, and he’s a forensic accountant. The tenacity, where you get to the place of ‘Show me the bloody receipt’, is in his DNA.” That makes it a painful watch too, as this pretty establishment guy slowly and then swiftly loses his faith in the things he used to trust: experts, officials, the government, other establishment guys. “He felt the British government would have it in hand, but that wasn’t the case. He was just lied to, lied to and lied to.”Richard Ratcliffe went through five foreign secretaries during the period of his wife’s imprisonment: Johnson, Hunt, Raab, Truss and Cleverly. He and his wife would always be the last thing on the minister’s to-do list after they’d settled into the post, and by the time they examined the predicament, their tenure was up. In Prisoner 951, it takes Ratcliffe a while to see that “there’s a military industrial complex at play here,” Fiennes says, “and it’s not transparent. It lives beneath the government, and this is a family that got caught up with that.”View image in fullscreen‘Tenacity is in his DNA’…the real Richard Ratcliffe, on hunger strike in 2021.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThere’s a bit in which Ratcliffe storms into Cleverly’s office (he was then the minister of state for the Middle East and North Africa), “and just rants at him. He really does unravel. He’s unkempt. He’s onday 18 of a hunger strike, he’s at rock bottom. But it takes a lot for Richard to get to that place. He’s not liberated until he’s pushed to the brink.” Plainly, starvation was messing with his brain, but equally plainly it’s an incredible testament to his self-control that he didn’t lose it with any of the other four foreign secretaries.The Ratcliffes’ imposed separation, and the separation of both from their daughter, are agonisingly drawn in the drama. At one point Nazanin’s brother holds two mobile phones next to each other, one connected to her in prison, the other to Richard in London, so that they can speak to each other for the first time since her arrest. Their attempts to reassure one another, when both are so flattened by geopolitics, are excruciatingly moving. The original working title for Prisoner 951 was “Love Story”.“That certainly doesn’t reflect the pain and the horror that Nazanin went through,” Fiennes says. “It’s not really a love story. But then it is, in terms of the profound nature of love as a sort of salve, if you like, to survival. I’m thinking of Richard’s family, hugely supportive to him, and Nazanin and her family. Her love of her daughter, his love of his daughter, the love they have for each other – all these components, in the face of this horrific political situation, kept them alive.”Rashidi says she found “their bond as a couple extraordinary. To a point where, when I was reading it, I was saying to my husband [Christian Straka, a former German tennis pro], ‘You’d better fight for me this hard.’”View image in fullscreen‘They went through pain and horror’ … the Zaghari-Ratcliffes at the time of their reunion in 2022.Photograph: Victoria Jones/PAThe real reason for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s arrest was in the public domain all along. Richard Ratcliffe started saying it out loud as early as 2018. As described in the BBC documentary podcast Nazanin, the Shah of Iran had made a payment for 1,500 Chieftain tanks and other armoured vehicles in 1971, but the deal was cancelled when his regime fell. The British government wouldn’t refund the partial payment, citing sanctions. However in March 2022, Liz Truss announced thatthe United Kingdom would repay nearly £400mto Iran, and the same day, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was allowed to fly home.You can imagine another world in which this repayment had been negotiated within a week or a month. You can also imagine a world in which she’d stayed in prison for ever. “You wonder whether there are others who don’t have her visibility,” Fiennes says, “who don’t have her sense of confidence, and whose families are in Iran and can’t say anything. I imagine there are poor souls out there who are going through this and have spent decades in prison.”Fiennes has just finished filming another real-life role: Gareth Southgate, in a TV adaptation of the hugely successful play about the England football team,Dear England. Southgate and Richard Ratcliffe almost feel like bookends of heroism, defined by their tenacity and decency in the face of such different pressures. Fiennes also refers wryly to his stark performance as the monster patriarchFred Waterford in The Handmaid’s Tale: “That’s probably why I’ve gravitated towards Gareth and Richard. I think this is all part of a cleansing act that could go on for ever. I mean, it could conceivably take the rest of your career trying to wash that away.”“Growing up in the diaspora,” Rashidi says, “always comes with the guilt of having certain freedoms, and not having certain struggles that the Iranian people have. So every time I get the chance to shine a light on those struggles, humanise them, show the real people and their real emotions, that is a gift, and it is something that I feel obligated to do.”Prisoner 951 is on BBC One and iPlayer from 23 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeFactual TVDocumentaryJoseph FiennesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of the imported fuel has also beensmuggled into Sudan, where it has prolonged that country’s civil war.Sentry calls for a western-backed investigation into the Libyan oil officials known to be at the heart of the fuel-smuggling enterprise and for international help to ensure Libya’s own investigative bodies identify those who have stolen funds from the Libyan people.Fuel smuggling has been a long-standing problem in Libya, but the report claims the sums involved rose sharply after 2022 after a change to the leadership of Libya’s NationalOilCorporation (NOC), one of the few state bodies that spans the east-west divisions that have effectively created two governments since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.The NOC introduced a system whereby plentiful Libyan crude oil was swapped for imported refined fuel, which instead of being consumed in the Libyan market at subsidised prices was resold abroad at vast profit.By late 2024, the NOC’s fuel imports had surged from about 20.4m litres per day in early 2021 to a peak of more than 41m litres per day by late 2024. No genuine surge in domestic demand for refined petrol could justify such a large increase, and Sentry claims more than half the imported refined petrol has been sold on by criminal networks at a private profit.Libya still has little domestic oil refining capacity.Sentry calculates more than $6.7bn-worth of fuel was smuggled out of the country in 2024 alone, sufficient for Libya to more than triple its spending on healthcare and education.The report claims: “Given its sheer scale, fuel smuggling can no longer be portrayed merely as a byproduct of weak governance. In 2021, Libya’s top rulers effectively embraced it as part of a broader, systematic strategy to siphon massive wealth from the population.“Kleptocrats and organised crime networks – working alongside corrupt officials who wield influence over state bureaucracy, logistical hubs, distribution points, routes, and border crossings – orchestrated a drastic increase in illegal export of subsidised fuel. Destinations include Sudan, Chad, Niger, Tunisia, Albania, Malta, Italy and Turkey.“The transportation methods involve various categories of vessels, tanker trucks, and smaller vehicles – even rogue pipelines, depending on the geographical context and specific circumstances of the business model. This illegal fuel exportation causes domestic shortages, forcing citizens to pay much higher prices at unofficial outlets, especially in Libya’s peripheral area.The report claims the smuggling not only deprived the Central Bank of Libya of crucial dollar revenues, it also undermined the integrity of the NOC, whose hydrocarbon exports account for virtually all of Libya’s income.The vast increase in fuel imports occurred during the NOC chairmanship of Farhat Bengdara who left his position in January after 30 months in charge, the report said.The NOC has said it abandoned the swap system in March 2025, and the quality of fuel imported from January to September fell by 8% compared with the previous year. But experts say Libya is still importing far more fuel than it could possibly need.Bengdara told Sentry that under his tenure, the NOC remained transparent and proactive in its cooperation with national institutions and international organisations. He said he had submitted reforms to the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council for Energy Affairs to reduce reliance on subsidised diesel in electricity generation.These proposals, Bengdara added, included increasing natural gas production, promoting gas and renewable energy for electricity generation, and initiating the gradual removal of fuel subsidies.Explore more on these topicsLibyaOil and gas companiesEnergy industryMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Last month, WHO officialsissued a warningthat the tobacco industry was intensifying efforts to weaken global control measures.Jorge Alday, director of the tobacco industry watchdog STOP at health organisation Vital Strategies, said: “We see evidence of industry lobbying everywhere. Tobacco company fingerprints are on delayed tax increases in Indonesia, stalled legislation in Zambia and even aweakened declarationat the UN high-level meeting onNCDs.“If a tobacco control measure isn’t passed because of this letter, the price could be paid in lives of people who might otherwise quit smoking.”The tobacco control bill going through Zambia’s parliament includes proposals to go further than UK legislation by also applying to e-cigarettes, and mandating that graphic health warnings cover 75% of product packaging.In the letter, BAT suggests this be reduced to 30% or 50% “within the WHO-FCTC [Framework Convention on Tobacco Control] recommended threshold”, delayed for at least 12 months after the bill passes.TheWHOin fact recommends a warning should cover at least 50% of the front of a pack “and aim to cover as much of the principal display areas as possible”. In the UK, warningsmust cover 65%of a packet’s front and back.View image in fullscreenFarmers selling tobacco in Chipata, Zambia.Photograph: Tobacco Board of ZambiaBAT asks for the removal of broad restrictions on flavoured tobacco products, suggesting that it would push consumers toward “illegally traded” products. It suggests prohibiting a smaller list of “flavours based on desserts, candy, energy drinks, soft drinks and alcohol drinks”. All flavoured cigarettes have been banned in the UK since 2020.The draft bill suggests penalties for various offences “ranging from a percentage of annual turnover to 10 years’ imprisonment”.In the letter, Mukubesa Maliande, managing director of British American Tobacco (Zambia) plc, says the firm is “committed to good corporate behaviour” and “supports the objectives of governments to reduce smoking incidence and the associated health impact” but claims that “some regulations can have unwelcome and unexpected consequences.”Chimbala said BAT’s proposed changes would “weaken this legislation so much that the impact needed for it to cause long-term change in society will not be achieved”.The fact that many such provisions existed in the UK, where BAT is headquartered, was “utter hypocrisy itself”, he said.“We live in a global village. If I plant tobacco in my back yard and harvest that and sell it out – and my children do not consume tobacco, but my neighbour’s children do … to enrich myself and all the generations of my children while my neighbour’s children are dying … is in itself total emotional, moral and spiritual bankruptcy.”Tobacco control legislation in the UK or elsewhere had not caused companies to close, Chimbala said. “Legislation never shuts down the industry. It only protects the people.”A BAT Zambia spokesperson said:“BAT Zambia conducts its business in compliance with applicable local laws. Further, the company participates in the country’s legislative process in line with the relevant frameworks which provide for stakeholder participation in policymaking.”The company was “not opposed to regulation”, they said, adding that underage people should be protected from access to tobacco and nicotine.“We advocate for progressive regulation to achieve intended public health goals, while acknowledging the spectrum of rights and obligations on industry, consumers and related stakeholders,” they said, adding that BAT’s proposals “reflect the realities of the Zambian market and tobacco industry, which includes rising levels of illicit trade”.Zambia’s department of trade, commerce and industry was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentZambiaGlobal healthBritish American TobaccoTobacco industryAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, the Cop in Dubai resulted in countries vowing to “transition away” from fossil fuels, although there is little evidence of this happening as yet.“If we continue to extract hydrocarbons from the Earth, we will exterminate ourselves,” said Olivia Bissa, president of the Chapra Nation in the Peruvian Amazon.“We worry what will happen if we don’t have concrete action now. We as indigenous people in the Amazon are tired of being sacrificed by a group of powerful people who want to rule the planet. If we don’t do something together we will be complicit with ecocide and the assassination of humanity.”Activists from the Fossil Fuel Treaty at Cop30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on 13 November 2025Photograph: Oliver Milman/The GuardianTzeporah Berman, chair of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, praised Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for urging a fossil fuel phase out but criticized the Brazilian president for allowing a new oil drilling project near the mouth of the Amazon, pointing to a recent International Court of Justice ruling that demands countries address the climate crisis.“We know fossil fuel production continues to rise, pushing the world past planetary limits and deepening inequality,” said Berman, singling out the US, Australia, Norway and Canada for ramping up oil and gas drilling since the Paris agreement a decade ago. A treaty to end all this would be a “major act of love and justice for our time,” she added.Given the format of this Cop, and pushback that is already happening from Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers, it’s unclear what, if any, language on fossil fuel phase out will be included in this year’s agreement.A major opponent of any such pact would be Donald Trump, who has called for the US, and the rest of the world, to “drill, baby, drill.” Crystal Cavalier, a Native American woman from North Carolina, is atCop30, unlike the US government, and said a new treaty would at least put international pressure on the US to kick its fossil fuel habit.“We are being targeted in sacrifice zones that are pushing our ecosystems to the brink,” she said. “Our current government is aggressively rolling back environmental protections.“The Fossil Fuel treaty can be a tool, a pressure point that frontline communities can wield when their governments avoid accountability. We need external pressure in the US, we can’t do this alone. The US isn’t showing up, but the rest of the world can show up for us.”ShareUpdated at12.33 EST"

In addition to new heavy ice breakers,Canada is weighing the purchase of a dozen patrol submarines.In thefederal budget unveiled last week, Canada announced a C$1bn (US$710m) Arctic infrastructure fund to help build new airports, seaports and all-season roads.Anita Anand, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, told reporters last week the Nato military alliance should devote effort to the Arctic, adding it “must be an organization not only that focuses on the eastern flank, but also that looks north”.In his speech, Rogers also said CSIS agents foiled attempts byRussiato illegally acquire Canadian goods and technologies for use in its war against Ukraine.“This year, CSIS took action to prevent this by informing several Canadian companies that Europe-based front companies seeking to acquire their goods were in fact connected to Russian agents,” he said, adding that the companies took immediate measures to deny the Russians.He also said that Chinese spies “have tried to recruit Canadians with information and military expertise”.In addition to threats fromChinaand Russia, Rogers said the agency foiled potentially lethal threats by Iran directed against dissidents.His remarks are the first public confirmation that the agency has intervened to protect Canada-based critics of Tehran. CSIS had said previously it was investigating Iranian threats, but did not mention specific threats.“In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we’ve had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime,” Rogers said.“In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating, and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada,” he said.Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012.

But we will not accept anything less than what we already have.”At Cop30, countries are due to agree on a gender action plan to mainstream the experiences of women in climate action, and make the design of climate policy more inclusive.Many countries are now preparing to fend off attempts to narrowly define the term “gender” in the plan.Climate change amplifies inequalities, making the most disadvantaged and marginalised people also the most vulnerable and least likely to be able to adapt. Women aredisproportionately affectedby the impacts of climate breakdown, often because of their caring responsibilities and lack of power in society.In the climate negotiations, gender talks aim to address men’s and women’s different experiences of climate change, and countries have interpreted the discussions based on their national laws and cultural contexts.But aglobal rollback of women’s rightsand a growing backlash against gender equality have seengovernments like that of far-right president Javier Milei in Argentinastart questioning the legitimacy of the word “gender”.In preparatory talks for Cop30, Argentina and Paraguay requested the inclusion of footnotes in an informal note on the state of the negotiations to clarify their understanding of gender as referring to the female and male sexes.The Vatican, which rarely intervenes in climate negotiations, called for a reference to “sex” rather than “gender” during discussions on the need for disaggregated data.Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and Egypt havepreviously opposed references to gender, which is widely understood to reflect their opposition to the inclusion of trans and non-binary people.The US was absent from pre-Cop30 talks and Donald Trump, whose administration has repeatedly attacked women’s reproductive rights and is pulling the country out of the Paris climate accord for the second time,is not expected to send a delegation to the negotiations in Belém.Claudia Rubio Giraldo, of the Women’s Environment & Development Organization, which advocates for gender issues in the climate talks, said claims that the consensus-based negotiations are imposing an understanding of what gender means are “disingenuous”.“This attempt to impose a narrow definition of gender is a way to stall the negotiations, to burden the process and block more ambitious conversations,” she said.In contrast, some western delegations such as those from the EU, Norway and Canada want to broaden the scope of the discussion. They have called for language on “intersectionality”, references to women and girls “in all their diversity” and “gender-diverse” people. But this is also being met with strong pushback.Women’s rights advocates said governments should have a conversation on climate change and gender that supports everyone in society to respond and adapt to a warming world, taking into account peoples’ diverse identities and socioeconomic circumstances.“As women, we are not all the same,” said Aguilar. “In some countries, gender-responsive climate action is the difference between living and dying.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Yet, they are often excluded from decision-making andstill face hurdlesto participate in theUN climate talks.Only 3% of international climate aid going to transitioning communities: ‘This is absurd’Read moreChikondi Chabvuta-Mkawa, a women’s rights advocate from Malawi and the gender coordinator for a group of the 44 nations designated as “least developed countries”, said the row over the definition of gender was a distraction from ensuring measures to address inequalities are funded.Onlya small fractionof climate finance is flowing to projects aimed at addressing gender equality and women’s rights. In 2022,just 4%of government aid going to climate adaptation had a primary focus on gender.Developing countries want wealthier nations to help them finance measures that make gender considerations core to climate action.But wealthy nations argue that such decisions should be made in the finance negotiating rooms, not the gender rooms.“Financial and technical support is critical for us,” said Chabvuta-Mkawa. “Time and time again, women’s groups go unfunded and we end up in a cyclic poverty trap, which could be broken if the gender lens was applied to climate action,” she said.“Without a gender perspective, climate action is not effective,” Vanessa Dolce de Faria, Brazil’s high representative for gender affairs, saidin a social media post.“We have a historic window of opportunity to further consider the rights and challenge that women and girls face in relation to climate change.”Explore more on these topicsCop30WomenBrazilUnited NationsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The incident was captured on video and provoked outrage among Mexican women.The fact that even the president could face such an assault brought national visibility to an issue that affects millions of Mexican women every day.According to the country’snational statistics agency, seven out of 10 Mexican women and girls aged 15 and up had experienced at least one incident of violence in their lifetime, including psychological or sexual abuse. So far this year, 25,000 complaints of sexual harassment have been filed in Mexico nationwide.Such instances of abuse often lead to greater violence: InMexico, an average of 10 women are murdered every day, while in just the first six months of this year, more than 500 women were killed because of their gender in a crime known as femicide.“What happened to the president is what has happened to many of us,” said Congresswoman Rocio Abreu, from Sheinbaum’s Morena party. “The president is just another one of us who have experienced harassment, political violence, physical violence, sexual violence, economic violence. There is a whole range of violence against women … And none of us are exempt.”‘Attacked no matter what they do’: why female politicians face relentless cycle of abuseRead moreA key part of the president’s plan is ensuring that sexual assault is considered a criminal offense in all of the country’s 32 states, bringing them in line with federal law, which imposes six to 10 years of prison time for violent sexual abuse committed against vulnerable people or minors.“We need to review who has legislated on issues related to the agenda of non-violence against women,” said Senator Martha Lucía Mícher, also from the governing Morena party, who added that the senate would be reviewing state penal codes on sexual abuse. “It’s a crime committed against the daughters of judges, their sisters, their wives.”But Mícher noted that legislation was just one element of what needed to happen in order to properly address the issue.“You have to classify the crime as a serious offense. You also work with men. You also empower women. You also conduct awareness campaigns. You also train public officials, police officers, government officials and judges. And you also do great work with the community.”But some women were skeptical that the government would really be able to enact meaningful change, particularly given the strength of Mexico’s feminist movement and the lack of forceful state response.“It’s been too many years of fighting and too many years of this movement and there hasn’t been a difference,” said Itzayana Brito, a 20-year-old nursing student. “There have been small changes, but there’s never been a concrete difference.”Meanwhile, feminist activists questioned the government’s emphasis on criminal punishment of crimes as a means of stopping the rampant abuse.“What worries me is that the president’s focus is exclusively on criminal law and she is neglecting other avenues that could be strengthened,” said Estefania Vela, a legal expert and executive director of feminist group Intersecta. “It’s an easy response to change criminal codes but there’s little change in real life.”Feminist activist Oriana López agreed.“There’s a theory that if we include it in the penal code and increase the penalties, making it a harsher punishment, meaning more years in prison, then it will prevent people from doing it,” she said. “That’s the theory, but there’s no evidence to support it. It hasn’t been proven that this is a realistic, or long-term measure.”Rather, the activists said, the government should be focused on educational campaigns to bring about a societal shift where this kind of abuse is no longer viewed as acceptable.“There has to be cultural change in masculinity,” said López. “What are we doing so that men have a masculinity that isn’t toxic, that isn’t violent, that isn’t invasive – so that they’re not abusive?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision to invoke a never-used-before cold war law had been taken two days earlier at the highest level of the Dutch government and was enacted after detailed legal checks.Karremans says it had nothing to do with a US move on 29 September to put Nexperia on a list of companies facing import controls. “We were absolutely not pushed or pressurised or whatever by the Americans to take action on this,” he says.“What we heard from the Americans was they weregoing into [government] shutdownand they wanted to ensure Nexperia was on the list.”View image in fullscreenVincent Karremans: ‘If I had been in the same position, with the knowledge I know now, I would have done the same thing again.’Photograph: Koen van Weel/EPAThe Dutch intervention triggered a furious reaction from Beijing, which for four days banned the export of Nexperia’s chips from China, most of which are finished. That in turn threw carmakers’ supply chains in to chaos, leading to production pauses in Mexico and warnings from EU manufacturers thatthey were “days away” from stoppages.After thedeal between Donald Trump and Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in South Koreaat the end of last month cleared the way for Beijing to resume chip supplies to Europe, the crisis appears to be over. For now.Nexperia row shows how China is weaponising EU relationship - and winningRead more“Now, for the short term, there’s a solution … and we’re very grateful for the steps that the Chinese authorities have taken on this.” However, Karremans stresses: “If I had been in the same position, with the knowledge I know now, I would have done the same thing again.”The Dutch chipmaker, once part of the Philips electronics group, was bought by China’s Wingtech in 2018. Concerns about its future ability to export to the US emerged in 2023 when the US notified the Dutch that they were considering putting Wingtech on an “affiliate list” of companies that could pose a threat to national security.“These restrictions were immense, so it was in our best interests to work with the American and Chinese governments and the Nexperia Chinese shareholder to work out a solution.”The Dutch then entered a dialogue with Zhang Xuezheng, the founder of Wingtech and chief executive of Nexperia in the Netherlands, to ensure the company’s independence. Demands included the establishment of an independent supervisory board and a requirement that Zhang no longer act as both CEO and head of human resources.“I spoke to Mr Zhang about this in the ministry last summer,” says Karremans. “It was one of the first meetings I had as minister for economic affairs. He was telling me they were very much on board. We had a list of measures to be taken and then we would engage with the Americans and say this is a Dutch company.”But in September, things took a dramatic turn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said he was moving away intellectual property rights, they were firing people, and they were looking to relocate production from [Hamburg] to China.”Asked who these people were, he says: “I can’t tell you who they were … but we have physical evidence that this [relocation] was happening.”He argues that if Wingtech had moved its semiconductor wafer production to China, then “this interdependence that Europe had [with China] would have changed into a full dependency. That … would have been very dangerous for Europe.”After the situation with the Chinese escalated in the aftermath of the Nexperia intervention, Karrenmans spoke to Germany’s economy minister, Katherina Reiche. “She supported our action. She was very concerned about what this meant, obviously, for the car industry.” Leaders in the EU, US, China, France and elsewhere around the world were also kept informed.“We weren’t intending to go public on this. We wanted to solve this swiftly and silently,” Karremans says.Beijing’s move to restore chip supplies at the weekend came after the US decided to pause sanctions for companies on its affiliate list. But the Dutch have yet to reverse out of Nexperia, with Karremans hinting nothing will happen until the first chips arrive on European shores.“We are in direct touch with the German car industry and with other car manufacturers and clients of Nexperia. They will let us know when they receive the chips. And once the supply resumes and we are confident it will continue, then … we’ll take the appropriate steps that are needed by the Dutch government to resolve this issue.”Karremans hopes this “will serve as a wake-up call” over the dangers of depending on one country for essential tech or raw materials. Although his VVD partyfinished third in last month’s general election, he will remain economy minister until a new government is formed, which could take a year.When Wingtech was asked about the allegations that it was planning to move part of its physical production line in Hamburg to China, the company said it was pressing ahead with an investment rollout in Germany with 150 new jobs created, including 100 in R&D and 50 in production.A spokesperson said: “Wingtech’s $200m investment plan for the Hamburg wafer fabrication facility, announced in 2024, is progressing steadily … As the new production lines start to ramp up, we were expecting to continue the expansion of our operational team, a development which has since been sidelined due to the Dutch government’s intervention.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryChinaNetherlandsTariffsAsia PacificEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In other fake clips, a newsreader reports on bear sightings in the local area and an older woman is shown feeding fruit to a bear in a field.Japan’s new PM faces sumo-sized dilemma: will Takaichi defy the sport’s ban on women?Read moreSome even depict people, including a schoolgirl, fighting off the animals – the worst possible response to an encounter: black bears inJapancan weigh up to 130kg (287 pounds) and Ussuri brown bears, commonly found on the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, as much as 400kg. And they can easily outrun humans.Experts hope most people will be able to distinguish real from fake content, but the sheer number of clips could exacerbate fears thatJapanis in the grip of an outbreak of ursine terror.There is concern too that the videos could undermine government messaging on what to doduring an encounter with a bear, either in the wild or, increasingly,in towns and other built-up areas, where they search for food.In a search of the words “bear” and “video” on TikTok, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper found that about 60% of 100 selected clips were fake, having been produced using OpenAI’s video generator.The clips featured a Sora watermark indicating they had been made using the US-based technology, and some posters indicated their posts weren’t real.But some were so realistic that users could struggle to distinguish between fact and fiction.Several clips included details that added to their air of authenticity, such as references to locations where bear sightings have made the news.In one, a “news report” showed a bear being captured after entering a convenience store in Noshiro, Akita prefecture, where officials were quick to point out there had been no such incident.Another AI-generated video showed people running away from a bear on a street on Ishikawa prefecture, prompting an official to issue a denial and urge residents to ignore information not issued by the local authorities.Experts are particularly concerned about content showing people feeding the animals, despite repeated warnings not to carry food while hiking in the woods.Experts blamepoor crops of acorns and beechnuts, which form the bulk of the animals’ diet, for the sudden surge in bear sighting. Exacerbating the problem is the decline in natural boundaries that once separated forests and built-up areas, which have been blurred by decades of rural depopulation.Faced with food shortages, the animals are venturing further out of their natural habitat and into residential areas.“Feeding a bear is extremely dangerous, and could result in them no longer fearing humans,” Shinsuke Koike, a professor at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, told the Yomiuri.The number of fake videos has soared in recent weeks, as users attempt to capitalise on public interest amid a slew of media reports of sightings and attacks.A record 13 people have died in bear attacks in Japan this year – more than double the previous high – and more than 100 have been injured, according to the environment ministry. About 20,700 bear sightings were reported nationwide between April and September, about 7,000 more than in the same period in 2024.The disruption to daily life in regions of northern Japan where the bear encounters are concentrated is unmistakably real.Japan Post recently suspended collections and deliveries in part of Akita prefecture, where members of the self-defence forceshave been deployedto help licensed hunters trap and dispose of bears.The telecom firm NTT East will revisit safety protocols for engineers who have to venture into the mountains to maintain and repair communications towers, while the logistics firm Yamato has said it could suspend parcel services if it believes its workers are at risk.Explore more on these topicsJapanAnimalsWildlifeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump oversaw the signing of aceasefire agreementbetween the two nations in Malaysia this October, after the US president previously threatened to withhold trade privileges from the two countries unless they stopped fighting.But the newly signed truce has been shaky since Monday, when a Thai solder patrolling the borderlost a foot in a landmineexplosion, according to Thai authorities. Thailand blamed Cambodia for the blast, alleged the landmine was freshly laid, and announced it was suspending the terms of the deal.Timeline chartTwo days later, officials on both sides have reported gunfire across the border between Thailand’s Sa Kaeo province and Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province.‘Wailing ghosts through loudspeakers’: Cambodia accuses Thailand of psychological warfare along borderRead moreThe Cambodian prime minister, Hun Manet, said three civilians had been wounded and one killed in Prey Chan, in Cambodia’s north-west.“The action goes against the humanitarian spirit and recent agreements to resolve border issues peacefully,” he said in a statement.A Cambodian residentin the area, Hul Malis, told news agencies that at least three people in her area had been wounded by gunfire from across the border. “They just shot at us. We did nothing,” she said. “I am so frightened, I am running away now.”Her husband, Thong Kimleang, said Thai soldiers “fired a lot of shots” for about 15 minutes.Bangkok has blamed Cambodian troops who “fired shots into Thai territory”, Thai army spokesperson Winthai Suvaree said.The border dispute goes back centuries, stemming from maps drawn when Cambodia was under French colonial rule and which Thailand says are inaccurate. A scattering of temples along the border are claimed by both sides.Map of borderThe ceasefire agreement did not resolve the underlying basis of the dispute or longstanding differences over where the border should run. Trump has cited it, however, as evidence of his presidential peace-making abilities.On Tuesday, the Thai prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, visited frontline troops at the border and told reporters: “Today, we consider that the deal that we made in order to bring peace is now over.”Foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura later clarified that Thailand had paused the agreement’s implementation, not officially withdrawn from it.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandAsia PacificTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He said She continued to deny any wrongdoing.At the time of his arrest, She headed a gambling empire that included a $15bn casino, entertainment and tourism complex called Shwe Kokko on the Thai-Myanmar border.The US treasury department in September sanctioned nine companies and individuals tied to Shwe Kokko for their links to regional scam and trafficking networks.The border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have becomehubs for online fraudsince the Covid-19 pandemic, and the UN says billions of dollars have been earned from the trafficking of hundreds of thousands of people forced to work in these compounds.Hundreds of thousands of people have beentrafficked by criminal gangs across south-east Asiain recent years and forced to work in scam centres, many of them located inside war-torn Myanmar.On Wednesday, the US imposed financial sanctions on a Myanmar militia group for supporting a cyber scam operation that targeted Americans from territory it controls.The latest US sanctions aimed at scam networks target the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army and four of its leaders, as well as entities and an individual linked to Chinese organised crime, the US treasury department said.“Criminal networks operating out of Burma are stealing billions of dollars from hardworking Americans through online scams,” said John Hurley, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, using an older name for the country.“These same networks traffic human beings and help fuel Burma’s brutal civil war. The [Trump] administration will keep using every tool we have to go after these cybercriminals – wherever they operate – and to protect American families from their exploitation.”With Reuters and the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsThailandChinaAsia PacificScamsnewsShareReuse this content"

It may work politically, but will it work as policy?The evidence suggests not. It creates more victims of crime. It is putting an extra padlock on the back door while leaving the front wide open.The national children’s commissioner, the Law Council of Australia, even the conservative Institute of Public Affairs agree: the best way to prevent violent offending is to increase investment in crime prevention, not to lock up more people for longer.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJust last year the Victorian government raised the age of criminal responsibility, justifying this by using the same evidence it is now ignoring about what works.“We know that disproportionate criminal justice interventions actually increase rather than decrease the risk of offending for children and young people,” someone said at the time.Quick Guide'Adult crime, adult time': Queensland and VictoriaShowQueensland's laws• Child offenders as young as 10 can face adult sentences for serious offences.• Young offenders convicted of murder face mandatory life imprisonment with a non-parole period of at least 20 years.• The laws originally applied to 13 offences such as murder, manslaughter, home and business break-ins and robbery and dangerous operation of a vehicle.• In May, an additional 20 offences were added, including attempted murder, rape, attempted rape, torture, aggravated attempted robbery and trafficking in dangerous drugs.• Restorative justice orders, designed to divert young people from court, have been removed as a sentencing option for young people convicted of one of these offences.Victorian Labor's proposed laws• Children as young as 14 will be sentenced as adults for certain offences in the state's county court.• This means the county court will treat children like adults, with longer sentences and more time in prison.• The county court can impose prison sentences of up to 25 years for aggravated home invasion and aggravated carjacking. The children's court maximum for a single offence is three years.• The changes would lift the maximum sentence for aggravated home invasion and carjacking from 25 years to life imprisonment for anyone 14 years and over.• The five offences are aggravated home invasion, home invasion, intentionally causing injury in circumstances of gross violence (including machete crime), recklessly causing injury in circumstances of gross violence (including machete crime) and aggravated carjacking.• Carjacking will also be heard in the county court by default unless there are \"substantial and compelling reasons\" for a matter to stay in the children's court.• Aggravated burglary and armed robbery, if \"serious and repeated\", will also be moved to the county court.• The sentencing principles for judges will be overhauled to ensure community safety is prioritised, that they consider the impact of a child's alleged offending on the victim and remove the rule that prison is a \"last resort\" for child offenders.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That “someone” was the state’s police and crime prevention minister, Anthony Carbines, not the head of a not-for-profit, or a lawyer, or a Greens MP. The comments were made during his second reading speech for the bill aboutchanging the age.“Community safety is best served through prioritising diversion wherever possible and appropriate, and targeting intensive interventions to children and young people who are most likely to offend seriously and repeatedly,” Carbines continued.“Lasting results are only achieved by addressing the underlying causes of offending and tailoring interventions based on risks and needs.”Victoria to raise age of criminal responsibility to 12 with no exceptionsRead moreThe other laws Labor trumpeted this week were about “targeting the evil adult puppet-masters pulling the strings” behind youths committing crime, according to exclusive comments by the premier, Jacinta Allan, in the Herald Sun.But the government has already played this tune. Back in 2017, while some of those who now face jail time were starting primary school, the so-called “Fagin’s law” to apparently prevent this very thing was passed. This is a reheated announcement made at a time when Melbourne is increasingly spoken about like Dickensian London.In 2010, the last time the Coalition won a Victorian election, it was in no small part due to a promise to install protective services officers – armed guards – on every metropolitan train station at night.Never mind that the actual number of violent crimes at stations was not that high; if you ever felt unsafe at night waiting for a train – and most of us have – this was the answer.Every election since, the Victorian Coalition has thrashed about looking for a policy that would similarly cut through. None have come, though not for want of trying; during the 2018 campaign, it even tossed around the idea of trying to give itself the power to sack magistrates who handed down light sentences.This is increasingly the place of state and territory conservative parties in opposition and trying to win government: focus on crime, and crime alone, and hope voters see them as knights in shining armour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is following the Queensland LNP playbook for how to win government, while it is in government.Less than 1% of population responsible for 40% of all offending in Victoria as crime rate climbsRead moreThere is little to suggest this was in any way thought through. Labor has printed promotional material with its “adult time for serious crime” slogan, but hasn’t actually written the laws. The first many in cabinet reportedly heard about it was when they were sent the proposal an hour before a meeting. It is policy by polling, law formed by focus group.It is important to note there is a restlessness in the state, and people want answers. Seemingly everyone knows someone who is a victim of crime, and footage of the latest home invasion or carjacking or murder is only a click away.There is a greater sense of disorder that is pervasive too, particularly in Melbourne. Public drug-taking or defecating, people in the grips of mental ill-health, even empty shops: all of this makes people feel less safe, though it may not result in a criminal charge.People are angry; MPs emailed by constituents about violent crimes in their suburbs can attest to that.Allan started her press conference on Wednesday to announce the new laws by reading from such an email. It was from a family who intervened when a 16-year-old broke into their neighbour’s house, leaving the husband stabbed three times, and a son who can no longer sleep at night, fearful that every noise is another offender.But political leadership is not taking a wild swing and hoping it connects: it is looking people in the face, telling them you have heard them and explaining how you will make it right – even if they don’t like the answer.Nino Bucci is justice and courts reporter at Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsVictoriaVictorian politicsCrime - AustraliaYouth justiceanalysisShareReuse this content"

It also could extend to those deemed leftist supporters of the groups in the United States, allowing federal authorities to use similar surveillance and financial oversight tools against US citizens.“Groups affiliated with this movement ascribe to revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, ‘anti-capitalism’ and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas,” the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in a statement.The administration’s press release described incidents including the use of homemade explosive devices, shootings and hammer attacks as the cause for the listing. The designation would make financial transactions with the organisations or its members a criminal act in the United States.The Trump administration has blamed leftist organisations for violent confrontations in the United States in the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, following the assassination of the rightwing youth political organiser Charlie Kirk. The focus on antifa was first codified in a presidential executive action from September that declared “antifa” a “domestic terrorist organisation”.National security experts have said that the designation is problematic because antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, does not have a clear membership or leadership structure.Mary Bossis, emeritus professor of international security at Piraeus University in Athens, said it was “plain wrong” to conflate anti-fascist activists with violent extremists. While Greece, was once a hotbed of underground guerrilla activity wherearmed leftwing militantscounted US diplomats and military personnel among their victims, antifa had never advocated violence.Bossis told the Guardian: “It is highly exaggerated to say that the antifa movement inGreeceemploys terror tactics. They even run in elections and have never shown any sign of violence.”If anything, she said, terror groups snubbed the antifa movement, because “it talks too much”. Meanwhile, the online messaging of antifa activists across Europe had shown no sign of the violent rhetoric often seen in rightwing groups, the security expert said.“It is so sad to see this extreme conservatism in the US,” added Bossis. “It seems to me that this is part of a [Trumpian] strategy to divide the world between the ‘good right’ and ‘bad left’. It makes no sense unless you see it in the light of blackening the name of anyone with centre-left or progressive views because these guys don’t advocate violence.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyGermanyItalyGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The planprovoked protests in the city centre.The Serbian government has not disputed the authenticity of the published documents. While the agreement dates back to February 2024, it was kept secret and became a flashpoint only last week, after Serbia’s national assembly passed a special law to fast-track development of the site as a “project of importance for the Republic of Serbia”.Thousands protest Jared Kushner-linked development on site of bombed-out Belgrade buildingRead moreThe new law allows the government to sidestep regulatory controls which had halted progress on the scheme in May, pending an investigation into whether documentation removing the headquarters’ protected cultural status had been forged.According to the agreement published by Radar, the Serbian state was obliged to remove the cultural designation of the complex and to complete demolition work of the existing buildings “in a manner that is satisfactory” to Kushner’s Atlantic Incubation company. If Serbia fails to meet a deadline of May next year to prepare the site for construction, the US company can terminate the contract “at its discretion” and demand a substantial sum in termination costs, according to the published document.The deal provides for a free lease of the land for 99 years, with an option for the lease to be converted into full ownership.The passing of the special law has given a fresh focus toyear-long student-led demonstrationsagainst corruption that were first triggered by the collapse of a railway station in the city of Novi Sad.This week, demonstrators formed a human chain and painted a red line around the headquarters complex, in an effort to stall the sell-off of the site for what is reportedly planned as a hotel, apartments and museum complex.Apart from its historic significance as the site of Nato bombing during the Kosovo war, it had protected status as the only work in Belgrade of Yugoslavia’s star modernist architect, Nikola Dobrović.The passing of the special law accelerating the Kushner project has come at a time when the Serbian government of Aleksandar Vučić is seeking to curry favour with the Trump administration after Washington imposed sanctions on the country’s national oil company NIS, owing to the majority stake owned by Russia’s Gazprom and Gazprom Neft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, the information minister, Boris Bratina, threatened the privately owned N1 news channel, the Nova television network and the US state-owned pro-democracy Radio Free Europe, which the Trump administrationis trying to shut down.Bratina said the stations “should not exist on the air on the territory of the state”, earning a rebuke from the European Commission. A commission spokesperson told N1 that independent media were “a key pillar of European democracy”.The Serbian foreign ministry and Kushner’s umbrella investment company, Affinity Partners, were approached for comment about the agreement published by Radar.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Additional money will go to an infrastructure fund and a “housing activation office” to unblock bottlenecks, Browne said.The government wants to convert more vacant shops and premises into homes by providing funding of up to €140,000 (£124,000) per property. Derelict homes are to be restored through vacant property refurbishment grants.The plan will offer housing and special support to homeless people, older people, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said housing was a “defining issue”. The tánaiste, Simon Harris, called it a national emergency. The challenge was not money but speeding up delivery and removing blockages, he said.Critics called the plan a disappointment that would repeat mistakes of previous housing ministers.Eoin Ó Broin, the housing spokesperson forSinn Féin, the main opposition party, said: “The emperor has no clothes. This is not a new housing plan. This is a reheated and repackaged version of the failed Darragh O’Brien [the previous housing minister] housing plan.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions called the plan “old wine in a new bottle”. The Irish Planning Institute said new levers to increase housing supply were to be welcomed.“But we must also recognise that it will take time for our housing delivery system to get from where we are now to where we need to be,” the institute said.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A court in Germany also considered that the name “eliminates the risk of misleading the consumer” and raised the question that European regulation on spirits could be at odds with the freedom to conduct a business under the EU’s charter of fundamental rights.But the Luxembourg judges said EU law was clear that the term “non-alcoholic gin” was prohibited. “The fact that the legal name ‘gin’ is accompanied by the term ‘non-alcoholic’ is irrelevant,” the court said.The 2019 EU regulation states that such provisions protect consumers, prevent deceptive practices, ensure fair competition and safeguard the international reputation of the EU’s spirit drinks.The ruling could be a setback to the EU’s fast-growing alcohol-free drinks industry. PB Vi Goods didnot immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Thursday.It is not the first time that some of the EU’s top legal minds have been asked to grapple with the names and shapes of food and drink, whether indulgences or everyday staples.In 2018, the ECJ ruled that the makers of KitKatscould not trademarkthe four-fingered wafer shape, ending a decade-long legal battle between chocolate makers over what one court adviser called the “four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base”.The previous year, the court ruled that only animal-derived products could use names such as milk, butter, cream and yogurt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scores of faculty members at both private and public institutions have beenplaced under investigation– and in some cases fired or forced out – over criticisms of Israel characterized as antisemitic. The suit is the first to be filed by a professor against a university that explicitly challenges the constitutionality of the IHRA definition and the application of federal Title VI anti-discrimination protections to criticism of Israel.The chilling effect of Title VI investigations: the professors accused of antisemitismRead moreJay Blanton, a spokesperson for the University ofKentucky, said that Woodcock had not been suspended, but rather “reassigned” pending the outcome of the investigation. Woodcock has been banned from teaching, advising students, attending faculty meetings and accessing the law school’s building. According to the lawsuit, the only aspect of his job he is still able to carry out is “professional development”.“Title VI does not and cannot constitutionally prohibit criticism ofIsrael,” the lawsuit argues. “To the extent that the IHRA definition prohibits calling for the dismantling of colonial state structures, prohibits legal scholars from debating the contours of the right of self-determination, prohibits allegations of race discrimination, and prohibits allegations of genocide, the IHRA definition is unconstitutional.”But because Woodcock’s criticism of Israel goes well beyond more mainstream critiques – even some defenders of his free speech rights say his views could be understood to support violence against Israelis – the case is also bound to test the strength of constitutional protections for controversial speech. Apetitionby the Antizionist Legal Studies Movement, a group he founded, reads: “We demand that every country in the world make war on Israel immediately and until such time as Israel has submitted permanently and unconditionally to the government of Palestine everywhere from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”When the university first launched its investigations into Woodcock, the school’s president, Eli Capilouto, issued apublic statementdenouncing the petition as “calling for the destruction of a people based on national origin” and implying his speech “threaten[ed] the safety and well-being of the university’s students and staff” – both characterizations which Woodcock rejects.In additional charges the university brought against Woodcock in September, it accused him of creating a “hostile environment” on campus and of “calling for violence against Israel, the genocide of Israeli people and the ultimate destruction of Israel in a manner that uses antisemitic tropes”.Woodcock said in response to the university’s allegations that more than 80 other western colonies were brought to an end in the 20th century. “Does President Capilouto really believe that each involved the destruction of a people rather than the liberation of one?” he asked.“People in this country have the right to express themselves,” Blanton said. “That is not in question. But the university has the right to express itself as well.“If someone’s views as stated threaten the safety and wellbeing of the university’s students and staff, we are obligated to act to protect our community and our people. That’s clear under Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. We have an obligation to find out if that’s the case,” Blanton continued.Attorneys with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), which is representing Woodcock, say that the petition is constitutionally protected speech. Had Woodcock been speaking about any other country in the world, including the United States, “he would have been free to do as he pleases”, Gadeir Abbas, Cair’s deputy litigation director, told the Guardian. “But because it’s about Israel, the University of Kentucky has given into the hysteria.”According to a letter sent to Woodcock by the university and reviewed by the Guardian, the investigation was initiated after individuals outside the university complained about Woodcock’s statements against Israel at off-campus academic conferences, on a website he runs and in private chat groups of the Association of American Law Schools. The investigation is being led by Farnaz Farkish Thompson, an attorney who contributed to the rightwingProject 2025blueprint. Thompson did not respond to a request for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why is my work in Harvard’s antisemitism report? |Read moreThe Kentucky state senate adopted aresolutionin April directing the state’s public schools to combat antisemitism by using the IHRA definition, which conflates some criticism of Israel with antisemitism. State legislators hailed the university’s investigation into Woodcock as soon as it was announced, calling his statements “incredibly disturbing”. “Kentuckians have every right to expect that our public universities will foster free and open debate,”saidLindsey Tichenor, a Republican state senator who co-sponsored the resolution and is a co-chair of the Kentucky-Israel caucus. “But when speech crosses the line into targeted hate, institutions must act.”While challenging Woodcock’s suspension on free speech grounds, the lawsuit also alleges the university violated its own protocol, which previously permitted suspending faculty only upon a showing of “immediate harm”. According to the suit, the university revoked the policy after Woodcock complained about its violation. The university denies its policy changes were linked to Woodcock’s case.‘Fighting words’ or academic freedom?Woodcock strongly rejected the suggestion that his views threatened campus safety.He said his calls for military intervention against Israel, and his views that the future of Palestine should be determined by Palestinians alone – including Jews who lived in Palestine before large-scale Jewish immigration began in the late 19th century – are consistent with recognizing Israel as a colonial project. Woodcock, who is part Algerian, often refers to that country’s experience of ending French colonial rule as a basis for his argument.“If Israel has a right to exist, then French Algeria had a right to exist and the British Raj had a right to exist,” Woodcock told the Guardian in an interview.Woodcock rejects the argument that his position is antisemitic but confirmed that his view of Israel as a colonizing power means the state should be brought “to an end”. The future of the land Israel occupies, he says, should be for Palestinians “alone” to decide – and “that includes according to Palestinians the right to decide the legal status of the colonizer population”. He adds: “While the principle that Palestinians alone should decide is essential to maintaining a rule against colonization, it is likely that Palestinians would grant equal rights to the colonizer population.”‘Canary in the coalmine of totalitarianism’: how Columbia went from a home for Edward Said to a punching bag for TrumpRead moreAlvin Goldman, a retired law professor at the University of Kentucky and self-described “lifelong Zionist”, was an outspoken advocate of Woodcock’s free speech rights when the university announced its investigation. Goldman strongly disagrees with Woodcock’s premise of Israel as a colonizer and agrees with the university that his views might be interpreted as calling for a destruction of a people based on their national origin. But, he adds, “that of itself is not grounds for a state university to discipline or dismiss a professor”.“It is not surprising to me that the call for the destruction of Israel can prompt an emotional response from many. I am among them,” Goldman wrote in a letter sent to the law school faculty a day after Woodcock’s suspension, which he also sent to administrators. In certain contexts, he adds, such calls might amount to “fighting words” – a reference to speech not protected by the first amendment – but says Woodcock’s calls don’t qualify as fighting words.Goldman, who has challenged Woodcock’s views on private faculty channels, called on administrators to reverse their decision and instead sponsor opportunities for debate.“Unfortunately, in the years since I began teaching, faculty have become more and more divorced from the principles of academic freedom and the principles of what constitutes a sound university environment,” Goldman said in an interview.He said that Woodcock’s calls for Israel’s “end” are wrong but not antisemitic. He added: “He is entitled to be wrong.”This article was amended on 13 November 2025.

Thousands of ordinary people have given their time and money to build a real alternative to endless cuts and endless war.“A dedicated team of volunteers has been working on a shoestring budget to deliver a founding conference at the end of the month. Their efforts are heroic, but without funding Your Party’s capacity has been severely restricted. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were donated to the party by supporters in good faith, but have since remained beyond its reach. This has been extremely frustrating and disheartening.“A small portion of these funds was today transferred to Your Party. This is insufficient. We will continue to pursue the immediate transfer of all the money that was donated by supporters to get a new party off the ground, alongside a resolution to outstanding legal issues.“Building a democratic party from the ground up was never going to be smooth sailing. Some of the difficulties we have faced were inevitable, but others were deliberate acts.”The political infighting on Monday centred on thousands of pounds’ worth of donations and fees received by MOU Operations Ltd, a company set up earlier this year.Party officials were seeking a sum of about £800,000 from MOU Operations and had threatened to take legal action against the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”The BBC has been considering how to respond to the legal threat since Trump’s angry reaction to the editing of the programme.However, it is thought that the BBC has also been advised that it has a strong legal case. It remains to be seen how Trump will now respond.It comes after the BBC concluded there was no reason not to apologise more personally to President Trump, given Shah had already said sorry for the edit and described it as giving the impression “of a direct call for violent action”.The corporation is already reeling fromthe resignations of Davie and Turness, which followed thesplicing together of the Trump speech in an edition of Panoramalast year.The programme was broadcast a week before the US election. The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Concerns about the Panorama cut were raised in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in the summer. The memo drew on instances Prescott said showed a systemic bias at the BBC, which the corporation has denied.Some in the BBC argue the Panorama edit did not change the meaning of the speech significantly, but others disagree.Shah has since apologised, while Davie said responsibility had to be taken for errors revealed in the Prescott memo.It has been suggested Trump would file the case in a Florida court. Legal experts have questioned his chances of victory, given Florida’s liberal libel laws and the fact the Panorama episode was not available in the state.The broadcast was too long ago to take legal action in the UK. Trump would have to prove he was damaged by the programme.Since the Panorama edit was revealed, BBC’s Newsnightwas also accused of editing the same Trump speechin a way that made it appear he made a more explicit call for violent protest before the Capitol riots.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It did not appear that the edit alerted viewers to the cut.It spliced together a section of Trump’s speech on the day of the riots, in which he urged supporters to walk to the Capitol building, with a later segment of the address in which he urged them to “fight like hell”.A former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, criticised the BBC on air at the time for splicing together the footage. “Your video actually spliced together the presentation,” he said. “That line about ‘and we fight and fight like hell’ is actually later in the speech.”A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”On Thursday, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said his party had written to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, calling on him to demand that Trump “drop his ludicrous $1bn lawsuit against the BBC”. Trump has not yet filed a lawsuit, despite previous reports.In another post on X, Davey said Trump “wants to destroy the BBC” and urged people to join his campaign, calling on the corporation to “fairly balance its political news coverage all year round, not just at election time”.He also said the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who accused the BBC of being “infected with leftwing bias”, is “egging [Trump] on”.There have been reports that Reform has pulled out of a BBC documentary about the party because of the controversy over the edited speech.Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpTim DavienewsShareReuse this content"

I broke the law. I am ashamed, sorry, and I hold myself accountable.”The judge, Jessica Clarke, said Lewis’s circumstances did not warrant incarceration and imposed a $44m fine on his company, Broad Bay, on top of his $5m personal fine and probation.But on Thursday, the Daily Telegraph was first to report that Trump planned to pardon Lewis entirely. The Guardian understands that the fine will not be repaid to Lewis or his company.The White House later confirmed the pardon and said Lewis requested it so that he could receive medical treatment and visit his grandchildren and great-grandchildren in the US, the Associated Press reported.Lewis said: “I am pleased all of this is now behind me, and I can enjoy retirement and watch as my family and extended family continue to build our businesses based on the quality and pursuit of excellence that has become our trademark.”A source close to the family said: “Joe and the Lewis family are extremely grateful for this pardon and would like to thank President Trump for taking this action.“Over his long business career, Joe has been a visionary, creating businesses across the world, which multiple generations of his family are now taking forward. There is so much more to the Joe Lewis story than this one event.”Lewis already transferred his majority ownership interest in Tottenham to his family via a trust in 2022, the year before he was charged.The north London football club is now overseen by Lewis’s daughter Vivienne, his son Charles, and Vivienne’s son-in-law Nick Beucher.Details of the insider trading schemewere documented in a29-page dossierpublished by the US attorney for the southern district of New York in 2023.Prosecutors accused Lewis of passing on share tips based on inside information to his employees, including his private jet pilot and his then 33-year-old girlfriend, Carolyn Carter, to allow them to make a profit from stock trading.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod. One of her shots showed the seal flying through the air above the scrum of orcas frothing the water, and she assumed she was witnessing the seal’s last moments alive.But as the orcas got closer to the boat, Drucker and her group realized the pod was still chasing the seal. In line with wildlife boating regulations, they had cut the engine to prevent any injury to the whales. The seal clambered out of the water and on to a swimming platform at the stern of the boat near the motor – claiming it as a life raft of sorts.Wildlife regulations also prohibit touching or interfering with the seal, but Drucker began filming video.“You poor thing,” Drucker can be heard saying, as the seal looks up at her. “You’re good, just stay, buddy.”The orcas did not give up immediately, but instead appeared to team up to rock the boat and make the seal fall off. Drucker’s cellphone video shows the orcas lining up and moving in on the boat with staggered dives to create waves. The “wave-washing” technique has been documented by scientists since at least the 1980s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The seal on Drucker’s boat slid off at least once, but managed to climb back on, and the orcas swam away after about 15 minutes.Drucker has photographed dead seals in the mouths of orcas before, and she says she’s generally happy when the whales get to eat.“I’m definitely team orca, all day, every day. But once that seal was on the boat, I kind of turned [into] team seal,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday.The killer whales that hunt seals and a diverse set of marine animals in the area are known as Bigg’s or “transient” orcas. They are better fed then other more specialized species like the salmon-focused “resident” orcas who are on the endangered species list, according to Noaa.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsWhalesMarine lifeCetaceansnewsShareReuse this content"

The outlet says the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency sent a letter to the attorney general claiming Swalwell may have committed mortgage and tax fraud.Swalwell said in a statement: “As the most vocal critic ofDonald Trumpover the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me.”The move is the latest in Trump’s ongoing retribution campaign, in which he is pushing for criminal charges against his enemies and issuing executive orders that punish those who have worked against him.Trump has gone after the New York attorney general, Leticia James, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and Senator Adam Schiff, all with claims of mortgage fraud originating from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He posted on Truth Social a public note of pressure to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his critics. James has been charged and is fighting the allegations.In separate instances, the former FBI director James Comey was indicted for allegedly making a false statement and obstructing a congressional investigation during a testimony to Congress in 2020, and former national security adviser John Bolton was charged over mishandling classified materials.“Like James Comey and John Bolton, Adam Schiff and Lisa Cook, Letitia James and the dozens more to come – I refuse to live in fear in what was once the freest country in the world,” Swalwell said. “As Mark Twain said, ‘Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.’ Mr. President, do better. Be Better.”The referral to the justice department “alleges several million dollars worth of loans and refinancing based on Swalwell declaring his primary residence as Washington” and says Swalwell should be investigated for a host of potential fraud crimes, according to NBC News.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

It declined 3.6% as it continues to grapple with the fallout from thedisclosure by Japanese investor SoftBankthat it had sold its entire stake in the firm for $5.8bn.“There’s a lot of uncertainties about the state of the economy,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “What we’re going through is a little bit of a correction in the market in the AI sector and we’re seeing market rotation.”With the longest US government shutdown in history now over after more than 42 days, federal officials are preparing to publish a string of highly anticipated economic data reports, including on jobs and inflation.Remarks by senior Federal Reserve officials meanwhile tested market confidence that the central bank is preparing to again cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting next month. “We need to proceed and tread with caution,” said Alberto Musalem, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.Kevin Hassett, director of Donald Trump’s national economic council, said on Thursday that the jobs report for October would show how many jobs had been added or lost in the labor force that month, but not include the headline unemployment rate.The Bureau of Labor Statistics stressed that it hoped to publish data on employment “as soon as possible”, but cautioned that it “may take time to fully assess the situation” before finalizing revised release dates.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsArtificial intelligence (AI)Market turmoilEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Organizers plan to expand the strike to more locations should executives hold firm – and want customers to steer clear of the chain as part of acampaigndubbed “no contract, no coffee”.Starbucks said it was “disappointed” that Workers United had voted to strike, rather than continue bargaining, but insisted the “vast majority” of stores would be unaffected by the action. The company stands accused of “stonewalling” at the table by union officials.Utah’s oldest LGBTQ+ bar closes amid workers’ union push: ‘We feel extremely disposable’Read moreSince the first Starbucks storevoted to unionize in 2021, more than 650 have followed, in the face of vehementopposition from the chain’s management. Contract negotiations broke down earlier this year, following the union’srejectionof Starbucks’ economic offer.Starbucks Workers United announced last week that workers had voted to authorize an open-ended ULP strike with92% votingin favor. The union had spent months demanding that managers consider new proposals to improve staffing and pay, and resolve hundreds of unfair labor practice charges filed by the union against Starbucks throughout its organizing campaign.“We have not been given meaningful proposals to finalize this contract since the announcement of the strike authorization vote,” Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks barista for three years and strike captain from Buffalo, New York, told the Guardian. “The baristas are prepared to do whatever it takes to get this finalized contract.”Striking baristas are asking that customers “do not buy at Starbucks while workers are on strike”, Leli added, to help “win the fair contract that we have spent many, many months negotiating with Starbucks”.“We’ve waited long enough,” said Leli. “We are so close to finishing this contract, and we need them to just finish it.”The beginning of the strike coincides with Starbucks’ “red cup day”, a promotion in which customers receive a reusable red holiday cup with the purchase of a holiday drink. It is typically one of the company’s biggest sales days of the year.The chain is scrambling to turn around its US business and win back customers, after several years of sluggish sales.

The ball is in Starbucks’ court.”A spokesperson for Starbucks, Jaci Anderson, said: “We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. When they’re ready to come back, we’re ready to talk.”Any contract “needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners”, added Anderson. “The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1m million job applications a year.“Our customers can be assured that our partners will be ready to serve them at the vast majority of our more than 10,000 company operated coffeehouses and nearly 7,000 licensed locations throughout the holiday season, regardless of the union’s plans.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksUS unionsFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The IEA has denied it reintroduced its new scenario in response to pressure from the US.Critics of the forecast believe it underestimates the pace of electric vehicle take-up, particularly in developing countries in Asia, a trend that is already helping to reduce the world’s demand for oil.The IEA’s report, which comes as leaders gather in Belém, in Brazil,for the Cop30 climate talks, also included two main scenarios in which oil consumption reached a peak by 2030 because of the strong take-up onof electric vehicles and renewable energy.In all scenarios, renewable energy is expected to at least double over the next five years. The outlook suggested the world was likely to build more renewable energy projects in the next five years than had been rolled out over the past 40.The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) said there was now “irreversible momentum towards the age of electricity”, which in every IEA scenario showed that renewable energy was “growing faster than any other major energy source”.How thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists got access to UN climate talks – and then kept drillingRead moreA GWEC spokesperson said: “It is important an outdated political narrative does not distract from this data-driven reality.”In its monthly report the IEA said it now expected global oil supply to grow by about 3.1m barrels per day (bpd) in 2025, and by 2.5m bpd next year, each up by about 100,000 bpd on the month.With supply outpacing demand, the IEA’s latest monthly oil report suggested that by 2026 total oil supply would be 4.09m bpd higher than total demand, up from an implied surplus of 3.97m bpd in last month’s report.Explore more on these topicsOilCommoditiesEnergy industryFossil fuelsEnergyRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

A court in Germany also considered that the name “eliminates the risk of misleading the consumer” and raised the question that European regulation on spirits could be at odds with the freedom to conduct a business under the EU’s charter of fundamental rights.But the Luxembourg judges said EU law was clear that the term “non-alcoholic gin” was prohibited. “The fact that the legal name ‘gin’ is accompanied by the term ‘non-alcoholic’ is irrelevant,” the court said.The 2019 EU regulation states that such provisions protect consumers, prevent deceptive practices, ensure fair competition and safeguard the international reputation of the EU’s spirit drinks.The ruling could be a setback to the EU’s fast-growing alcohol-free drinks industry. PB Vi Goods didnot immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Thursday.It is not the first time that some of the EU’s top legal minds have been asked to grapple with the names and shapes of food and drink, whether indulgences or everyday staples.In 2018, the ECJ ruled that the makers of KitKatscould not trademarkthe four-fingered wafer shape, ending a decade-long legal battle between chocolate makers over what one court adviser called the “four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base”.The previous year, the court ruled that only animal-derived products could use names such as milk, butter, cream and yogurt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, his empire, previously stretching through the UK, eastern Europe and Australia, hasunravelled in the years since the collapseof the lender Greensill Capital in 2021.The UK’s Serious Fraud Office has beeninvestigating GFG and Greensill since 2021. GFG and Gupta have strenuously denied any wrongdoing, while administrators of Greensill Capital have previously declined to comment.Gupta has lost control of key assets including the steelworks in Whyalla, Australia, as well as theSouth Yorkshire operations of Liberty Steel UKin August.Liberty Steel’s Romanian operation is based in Galați, near the Ukrainian border. The prosecutor’s office said it carried out the searches in Galați, as well as in and near Bucharest, the Romanian capital.Referring to an unnamed company, the Romanian prosecutors said: “Persons with management positions within the company acted to embezzle it through affiliated entities registered in other jurisdictions”, as well as “a series of contracts for the purchase of goods or the provision of services that were not based on real operations, as well as fictitious loan contracts”.Transactions under investigation included a €137m (£121m) sale of CO2certificates – required by EU regulations for heavy polluters such as steelworks – to the Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom. The money from those sales was transferred “to the accounts of the ‘parent company’” via a company in Singapore, the prosecutors said. Gazprom wasplaced under UK and US sanctions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukrainethis year, well after the alleged transactions.The company was forced to later replace the certificates for €154m, leaving it with a heavy loss, the prosecutors said. Funds intended for industrial investments were diverted to cover payments to affiliated legal entities, “without an operational justification”, they added.A GFG spokesperson said: “Liberty Steel and its management will vigorously defend itself against the unfounded allegations directed at the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, because he was shown a straight red card for violent conduct the forward could face a three-match ban.In that case, Ronaldo would miss Portugal’s first two World Cup group stage game should they top their qualification group, as the suspension would carry over to the tournament. If they were to drop to second in the Group F and reach the tournament through the playoffs, Ronaldo would then be available for the start even if his suspension was extended.Hallgrímsson said after the game he may have got into Ronaldo’s head. Ronaldo spoke to the Icelander pointedly as he made his way off the pitch and asked afterwards what he had said, Hallgrímsson revealed: “He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee.“It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card. It had nothing to do with me – unless I got into his head.”Portugal’s manager, Roberto Martínez, said: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games – I think that just deserves credit – and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.“He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender …“I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don’t think it’s an elbow, I think it’s a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow.”Francebooked a spot for their eighth consecutive World Cup after a Kylian Mbappé double helped to secure a 4-0 home victory againstUkraineLes Bleus, who are unbeaten in a Euro or World Cup qualifying game since 2019, will be seeded when the draw for the tournament is made on 5 December.Captain Mbappé scored either side of Michael Olise’s 76th-minute goal, before Hugo Ekitike added a late fourth.Francetop Group D with 13 points from five games and have an unassailable six-point lead over second-placed Iceland.

Italy need to beat both Moldova andNorwayin their remaining two qualifiers and overturn a 19-goal deficit to leapfrog the Norwegians and snatch the automatic qualifying spot.The visitors initially denied the hosts the space and rhythm they have so often exploited during this qualification campaign. Oscar Bobb missed the best chance to put Norway ahead when he struck the woodwork with a low cross just before half-time. The home crowd, expecting a comfortable lead, made their frustration clear, greeting the whistle with loud boos as the players headed towards the dressing room.Five minutes after the restart, loud cheers erupted around the stadium after Sander Berge swung in a cross in front of the box that Sørloth headed in to break the deadlock. Barely two minutes later, Sørloth guided a second header home.From then on there was no stopping Norway. The Estonian defence fell apart, and another driven cross found Haaland, who powered in yet another header to give Norway a 3-0 lead in the 56th minute. Haaland added another in the 62nd minute before Robi Saarma pulled one back for Estonia just two minutes later.NigeriabeatGabon4-1 in their World Cup African qualifying playoff semi-final in Rabat, but they needed extra time before running out comfortable winners.The striker Akor Adams snapped up a shallow back pass from Gabon’s defender Aaron Appindangoyé and caught the goalkeeper Loyce Mbaba way out of his goal for an easy tap-in for Nigeria’s opening goal in the 78th minute. But Mario Lemina snatched an 89th-minute equaliser to take the game into an additional 30 minutes.A goal from Chidera Ejuke and two from Victor Osimhen made sure of Nigeria’s progress to the final in the Moroccan capital on Sunday, where they will take on the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Two half-chances fell for Cameroon’s Karl Etta Eyong in the closing minutes, even as the Congolese seemed to be finishing stronger, before Mbemba popped up with the winner.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersNorwayEstoniaNigeria football teamGabonCameroon football teamRepublic of IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

She received warm applause when her name was announced on the par-4 10th tee and again after she drove it safely into the fairway, one of the few calm moments in a jittery start.Why is Maga-land so obsessed with Kai Trump turning 18? Do you really need to ask? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTrump confessed afterward she was more nervousthan when she spoke at the Republican National Convention last yearand it showed. She bogeyed her opening four holes, a run of tentative strokes that left her scrambling before she had taken a fifth swing from a fairway. A steady par at the par-5 14th finally stopped the slide, and she mixed two more bogeys with a pair of pars, including a sharp up-and-down at the par-3 16th that drew one of the biggest roars of the early afternoon. She reached the turn in 41.Her mother, Vanessa, and University of Miami assistant coach Jim Garren walked inside the ropes throughout – one day after Miami formally announced her commitment to join the Hurricanes for the 2026–27 season. WhatGolfChannel commentators described as the day’s largest gallery trailed along, a mix of supporters, skeptics and onlookers aware that her exemption had dominated American golf discourse for weeks.The LPGA’s television window expired after Trump’s first hole, an awkward scheduling outcome given the buzz surrounding her debut, but it did nothing to slow the crowds. Fans pressed up against the ropes on nearly every fairway.The back nine offered more turbulence. Trump dropped a shot immediately after the turn, then ran into real trouble with two double-bogeys over her next four holes. On the par-4 eighth – her 17th – a topped iron produced an audible gasp, only for her to answer with her crispest swing of the day, knocking the following shot to four feet despite Trump looking straight into the sun. Two more bogeys at the finish left her at 83, the highest score of the day.“The whole time I was nervous without a doubt,” Trump said. “But I thought I did pretty good for a first time, being the youngest player in the field. Now I kind of know how it goes.”View image in fullscreenUniversity of Miami commit Kai Trump plays a sand shot on the first hole at The Annika tournament on Thursday.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesHer presence has split opinion across the US golf establishment. Some analysts argued that the combination of Donald Trump’s granddaughter in the field and WNBA star Caitlin Clark in the pro-am made this one of the tour’s most talked-about weeks in recent memory. Others questioned whether a player ranked No 461 in the American Junior Golf Association should occupy a late-season spot in a field where professionals are fighting for season-ending accolades and – for some – their jobs next year.Tournament host Annika Sorenstam defended the decision, urging critics to “give this girl a chance.” Pelican Golf Club owner Dan Doyle Jr, whose club controlled the exemption, said Trump’s presence had already driven a noticeable surge in attention, particularly across social media, where she has more than nine million followers. “She’s lovely to speak with,” Doyle said. “And this has created a buzz on top of the other great players we have here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Woods told her to “go with the flow”, guidance she referenced again Thursday as she recounted regrouping after mistakes.South Korea’s Ryu Hae-ran led after a six-under 64, one shot ahead of Australia’s Grace Kim.

The league will begin its season in mid-July, take a winter break starting in mid-December, then restart games in the first or third week of February (avoiding Super Bowl week).“The calendar shift is one of the most important decisions in our history,” said MLS Commissioner Don Garber. “Aligning our schedule with the world’s top leagues will strengthen our clubs’ global competitiveness, create better opportunities in the transfer market, and ensure our Audi MLS Cup Playoffs take center stage without interruption. It marks the start of a new era for our league and for soccer in North America.”MLS salaries: Son Heung-min deal pays $11m, second only to Lionel MessiRead moreThe switch will take place in 2027, with the league playing a short season to begin the year and then starting its first full season under the new format that July.The calendar switch will be accompanied by a major change to the league’s format, also in a way that aligns more closely to European leagues. MLS’s 30 teams will now compete in a single table, the first time the league will be structured that way after spending most of its history with Western and Eastern conferences.The single table will also feature five six-team regional divisions, with teams playing each of their division rivals twice (home and away) and every other team in the league once, maintaining the league’s current 34-game regular season.Qualification for the playoffs will be based on the overall league table, with division winners guaranteed a spot in the postseason.The decision will bring an end to the schedule MLS has stuck since its first game in 1996, which sees the season begin in the spring or late winter and end in the fall, playing through the summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The current calendar also gives MLS less competition for more of its regular season in a crowdedUS sportslandscape. Among the country’s major men’s sports leagues, the NFL, NBA, and NHL all play fall-to-spring. By playing through the summer, MLS’s only competition among major men’s leagues for most of its regular season is Major League Baseball.However, there have also been significant disadvantages to that arrangement, which have become especially problematic for the league as it seeks to become more of an active player in the global transfer market.MLS’s offseason currently falls in the middle of the European league season, with most teams doing only limited transfer business in January. That makes it difficult for MLS teams to add star players in a way that will allow those players to have a full preseason with their teams. It also makes it difficult for MLS teams to sell players abroad for sums they would like at a time that will not impact an ongoing seasonSimilar issues then come up in the summer, with MLS teams reluctant to sell desired players abroad in the middle of a league campaign, and incoming players dropped into the middle of an MLS league campaign with no preseason.“If they don’t do it, there is no logical thought,” Columbus Crew coach Wilfried Nancy told reporters on Thursday. “If you don’t make the change, you can talk and talk and talk — it is impossible that people overseas are going to take us seriously.”The calendar switch also enables MLS to have its most important games – the end of the regular season, playoffs, and MLS Cup – during a period that is comparatively free from interference. The current MLS playoff format sees the postseason interrupted by a Fifa international window, and games themselves competing for attention alongside the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL season starts, and occasionally the World Series.MLS Cup has typically been played in late November or December – a time of year that features freezing temperatures in much of the country. After 2027, it will be played in May – likely in comparatively beautiful weather.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Until now.Jokić tied the highest-scoring performance in theNBAthis season with 55 points, and the Nuggets beat the Los Angeles Clippers 130-116 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory. The Nuggets were 0-4 in his previous 50-point games.“It’s a good feeling,” the three-time NBA MVP said.He equaled Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 55 in a double-overtime game at Indiana on 23 October.Jokić has been on a roll during Denver’s winning streak. He’s the first player in NBA history to average a 35-point triple-double while shooting 60% or better across a six-game stretch. Over that span, he’s averaging 35.8 points, 12.0 rebounds and 11.0 assists while shooting 73.9% from the field and 55.6% from three-point range.For the season, he’s averaging 26.2 points, 13.2 rebounds and 11.3 assists, and he leads the league in the latter two categories.Opposing defenses have thrown everything at the Serbian star in a fruitless effort to slow him down.“I think I saw everything,” he said, “but I think it’s hard. We are really running a lot of plays for me, all kind of different plays.”Playing on the second night of a back-to-back, Jokić scored 25 of Denver’s 39 points in the first quarter.“I didn’t open the game really good,” he said. “I think I missed like two, three layups, and after that I felt good.”Last season, Jokić played well on the back end of consecutive games, too. His routine on 24 hours’ rest includes a daytime nap in between eating avocado, eggs, oatmeal and toast.“The way he played today is how he works out when no one is watching,” Nuggets coach David Adelman said. “He prepares every day for situations like this.”Jokić had eight points in the second quarter before coming back with 19 in the third, including two personal runs of six straight points.“The guys, especially in the fourth quarter, they’re giving me the ball,” he said. “I just keep shooting it.”Jokić sat out the fourth until coming back with about six minutes remaining. He scored three points to complete his night going 18 for 23 from the field. He missed out on adding to his league-leading six triple-doubles with six assists. He was 5 of 6 on three-pointers and made 14 of 16 free throws.“He was extraordinary,” Adelson said. “That’s one of those performances you won’t forget.”The Nuggets led by 16 points going into the fourth and extended their advantage to 22 points early on.Adelman said there was “zero disrespect” to the Clippers in deciding to put Jokić back in.“They started to press us and he’s one of our best ballhandlers, he’s a guy that can bleed the clock, he’s one of the best players alive,” the coach said. “It would be stupid for me not to put my best players back in to make sure we win the game.”Explore more on these topicsNikola JokićNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

During this season, more than 200 matches were simulcast on bothMLSSeason Pass and Apple TV, including the league’s “Sunday Night Soccer” package. Dropping the separate subscription was announced Thursday at an owners’ meeting.Apple has made its Friday night Major League Baseball double-headers available to all subscribers since its start in 2022. It recently secured US rights to Formula One for five years which will also be available beginning next season.MLS announces calendar change, will play fall-to-spring from 2027 onwardRead moreMaking the MLS games more accessible also comes as the United States hosts the World Cup next year and the league switches to a late summer to spring calendar matching the European model in 2027. The current season runs from late February to early December.MLS deputy commissioner Gary Stevenson said Apple approached MLS early this year about the possibility of moving all of its matches to Apple TV.“We had been testing ‘Sunday Night Soccer’ on Apple TV and we got a really good reception to it. Then we talked to them about the potential schedule change and they thought that made sense. So it all kind of seemed like the perfect evolution to what we started and we think that the fans are going to find the experience and the value to be significantly better,” Stevenson said.MLS season ticket holders will receive Apple TV subscriptions after previously receiving MLS Season Pass.MLS said it averaged 3.7m gross live match viewers per week across streaming and linear platforms for its 15 weekly matches, a 29% increase over 2024.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To keep showing up, day by day. It was about respect, courage and a genuine desire to belong. What I saw was a person growing beyond himself. In football, words can build trust, connection, identity. That is what true professionalism really looks like.” Well, at least someone is pleased with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s progress at Real Madrid. Unfortunately, it happens to be Sara Duque, his language teacher.When Alexander-Arnold filmed a video in hesitant but really very good Spanish for Duque’s Instagram page, it’s fair to say it wasn’t received entirely in the spirit of pride and achievement it was intended. Very quickly, internet auditors started to do the maths. Alexander-Arnold claimed to have been learning Spanish for five months, which meant he must have started in May, when – gasp – he was still under contract atLiverpool. Rat, scum, traitor, etc. Perhaps, judging by how well he spoke at his unveiling in June, he had been under Duque’s tutelage even earlier. All of which brought to mind the old Frank Skinner joke (although others have claimed it) about John Lennon airport. A fitting tribute, seeing as it was the first place he went after making a bit of cash.Foden, Bellingham and Kane cannot all start in England’s system, insists TuchelRead moreDoes it really matter when Alexander-Arnold started learning Spanish? Obviously not. Jacob Ramsey is learning French, and nobody at St James’s Park is suggesting a move to Paris Saint-Germain any time soon. The point is how quickly these morsels and snippets get co-opted into a wider narrative, a self-reinforcing cycle of bad choices and bad karma, folly and fall, one in which Alexander-Arnold’s first few months at Madrid would appear to fit seamlessly.This week, for example, he will have plenty of time to polish his Spanish given he has been left out again from Thomas Tuchel’s England squad. Last weekhis return to Anfieldwas marked by boos from the crowd and thedefacing of his muralon Sybil Road, timed by incredible coincidence to attract maximum attention before Liverpool’sChampions League game against Real.View image in fullscreenThe Trent Alexander-Arnold mural near Anfield defaced with the word ‘rat” before the match between Liverpool and Real Madrid on 4 November.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Alexander-Arnold has found himself injured for much of the season and on the bench for much of the rest. Fede Valverde has been preferred at right-back by Xabi Alonso, despite the injury to Dani Carvajal and the fact Valverde isn’t really a right-back. There are whispers that Alonso doesn’t remotely rate him, that he prefers a hard-running, all-action tackler in the role, that Alexander-Arnold has looked troubled, overawed, lost. “He comes from a big club, but he’s arrived on a different planet,” wrote Jorge Valdano in hisEl Paíscolumn.The sober assessment would be that Alexander-Arnold hasn’t really had a chance yet. That he has been struggling for fitness and will be gradually integrated into Alonso’s system at a point in its evolution when his weaknesses might be less damagingly exposed. But, of course, this jars violently with the prevailing Trent orthodoxy, one in which a Liverpool legend detonates his career, blows his World Cup chances and ends up as a 27-year-old punchline already being spoken about in the past tense.And frankly this is a conscious decision, driven in large part by the internet economy and its unquenchable thirst for fresh marks. Watch how the Amazon Prime cameras cut effortlessly to a shot of Alexander-Arnold on the bench as Liverpool score the only goal of the game last week: an explicit editorial call, the real-time result of a producer shouting: “Get me Trent,” because this is what the story demands.None of this is to cast judgment on Alexander‑Arnold’s choices, or indeed those of the Liverpool fans who turned on him. Is there a certain hypocrisy there in their treatment of Alexander-Arnold for forcing through a transfer, and their treatment of Alexander Isak for forcing through a transfer? Of course there is. They’re not elected officials or the BBC. To demand that the views of football supporters be held to an objective standard of proof is basically to miss the point of fandom entirely. Everyone here is simply playing their role, trying to extract maximum personal capital from this shared diorama.All the same: something interesting is definitely happening here, a little window into the way discourse and narrative have a real-world impact on the way players are judged and perceived. In recent years there has been an increasingly pervasive theory that the future of football fandom would be oriented around players rather than teams. That we lived in the era of the superstar cult – the Messi stan, the Ronaldo bro – and that clubs would essentially become a vehicle for personal devotion.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold at the Valdebebas training ground as he looks to break into the Real Madrid team.Photograph: Maria Jimenez/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesLike most football theories, it had a kernel of truth but was essentially a bit of a stretch. Beyond the anomalous talents of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and perhaps Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland, does anybody actually meaningfully back a player over a club? Do people reallysupportHarry Kane? Is there an Ousmane Dembélé community out there? Are there non-Barcelona fans who venerate Lamine Yamal? Are there fans of Phil Foden or Lautaro Martínez? Can the personal appeal of Son Heung-min or James Rodríguez be separated from a broader, nationality-based allegiance?By and large, the biggest men’s clubs remain the biggest brands in the sport. And nowhere is this more evident than with Alexander-Arnold, a player whose biggest misstep – in brand terms – has been his decision to forsake the Liverpool fanbase and its immense soft power. These days, performances are no longer enough on their own. You need advocates, adherents, a base, people to stand up for you on the internet and argue your case in the media, people to challenge the perplexing and increasingly prevalent view that a Champions League-winning defender “can’t defend”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Influencers and television pundits are now club‑aligned, permanently online, and will inevitably take their cue from social media discourse. Jamie Carragher was critical of Liverpool fans for booing Alexander-Arnold in their 2-2 draw with Arsenal in May, saw which way the wind was blowing, and now accuses him of “hoodwinking” supporters. Perhaps in time Alexander-Arnold will reap the benefits of the considerableReal MadridPR machine. But it’s a tough ask when he can’t even get a start.View image in fullscreen‘Mohamed Salah looks a fraction of the right winger he was without the right-back who generated such possibility for him.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSo who, now, will speak up for the maligned, marginalised Alexander‑Arnold? Well, I’ll have a go. And perhaps I should declare my own bias too: I am instinctively drawn to mercurial and misunderstood players, players who gild the game rather than dominate it, players who prod at the boundaries of the possible. Give me Mesut Özil over Alexis Sánchez. Give me Paul Pogba over Bruno Fernandes. Give me Jude Bellingham over Declan Rice. Give me Eden Hazard over Cole Palmer, give me Dele Alli over Kane.These are players who would basically be impossible to invent from scratch because their profile barely even existed before they came along. There has arguably never been a right-back like Alexander-Arnold, a defender who isn’t really a defender at all, possessed with the poise and touch and range of a great midfielder. Alexis Mac Allister recently described him as the best passer of a football he’s ever seen, and he played with Messi. That’s not to say he’s the best or the greatest, full stop. But there’s not a huge amount out there to compare him to. Partly that’s the problem. Particularly at England level, where the impulse is understandably to fit the available talent into an existing template.I love the fact that he is clearly cerebral, introverted and quiet, but also the fact he wants to win the Ballon d’Or as a right‑back and came right out and said it, and that he would prefer to do that than win a World Cup, and didn’t care what anybody thought about him saying it. Secretly, I love the fact that Liverpool are struggling in his absence, that Mohamed Salah looks a fraction of the right winger he was without the right‑back who generated such possibility for him.Words can build trust, connection, identity. Duque was right about that part. A last-minute injury to Reece James and Alexander-Arnold is probably back in the World Cup squad. A run of games for Real and perhaps he can relax a little, learn his role, unleash the stinging crosses and pinpoint long balls that have always been his unique talent. Trent can overcome. But – if he doesn’t know it yet – he’s probably going to have to do the heavy lifting himself.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldReal MadridLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

But they weren’t there for the world famous soccer stadium. Instead, the sea of Barça jerseys was heading for the club’s basketball arena, the Palau Blaugrana. There was an expectant but apprehensive buzz in the air – the night marked a big occasion:Real Madridwere in town.It’s widely accepted that the biggest rivalry in basketball is between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics;between themthey have won almost half of all championships in NBA history. The Lakers-Celtics showdowns of the 1980s went beyond basketball and embodied different Americas: West Coast glitz versus East Coast grit; flashy fastbreak basketball versus fundamentals; and, frankly, though perhaps sometimes oversimplistically,Black versus white.In world basketball, however, there are a few rivalries that could contend with Lakers v Celtics in terms of cultural significance, even if the standard of play does not quite match up. Panathinaikos-Olympiakos in Greece comes to mind. So too does Belgrade’s raucous Red Star-Partizan fixtures and the fierce Intercontinental Derbies between Istanbul’s Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray. Another that could compete and, in the coming years, even collide with Lakers-Celtics? Last Friday’s game:Barcelonav Real Madrid – basketball’sclásico.You have almost certainly have heard of soccer’sclásico. It’s arguably the biggest derby in the world and attractsaround 650m viewers. Like the Celtics and Lakers, Barcelona and Madrid’s football and basketball teams are also the most storied in their leagues. In basketball, they’ve won 58 Spanish league titles between them and Madrid have dominated Europe over the decades to win 11 EuroLeague titles,the most in the historyof the continent’s elite competition. (Barcelona have two.)Tension was building as tip-off approached on Friday. In the long queues snaking into the stadium, chants about Madrid’s history of cheating (in football, basketball, politics, and who knows what else) erupted. Here, basketball is inseparable from soccer and the rivalry lays bare socio-political chasms going back not just to the 1950s or 60s, as with Lakers-Celtics, but centuries into the past. Barça soccer fans still sing “in, inde, independència!” at the 17:14 minute of matches to mark the end of the Spanish War of Succession – and with it the fall of Barcelona and theabolition of Catalan political institutionsunder Bourbon absolutist rule – all the way back in 1714. Similarly, chants of of ¡Puta Barça,Puta Catalunya!(Whore Barça, Whore Catalonia!) are still heard at Madrid matches.The two clubs have had roles in Spanish history that ripple through the modern day rivalry. During the Spanish Civil War, Josep Sunyol, Barcelona’s president, was executed due to his pro-Catalan independence views, and his memory lives on as the club’s ‘martyr president’. In fact, the first recorded basketballclásicowas playedat around midnight in Madrid in May 1942, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, a regime that championed Real Madrid as a symbol of centralised Spanish nationalism and international sporting ambassadorship. Just a few months ago, Madrid fanschanted “Franco, Franco”when new Argentinian signing Franco Mastantuono entered the field, outraging many Catalans.The intensity of the footballclásicois also present in basketball’s version. The heyday of the on-court rivalry was arguably the Audie Norris-Fernando Martín battles of the late 1980s, where the Lakers-Celtics echoes continue. Madrid’s Martín led Spain to a silver medal at the 1984 LA Olympics, and Barcelona’s Norris, a former NBA player, made his own transatlantic comparison toEl Paísin 2019: “I always compare it to the Lakers-Celtics rivalry. That was what made basketball grow in the US and my fight with Fernando made the Barça-Madrid rivalry grow.”Last Friday, the Palau Blaugrana bleachers began filling up an hour before tip-off. Players warmed up, the squeak of rubber soles filling the air. Camera crews set up their equipment. The smell of hotdogs wafted through the stands. A group of excitable teenagers arrived in Lionel Messi and Lamine Yamal jerseys and searched around for their seats. Thisclásicocomes at a time of tectonic shifts in the landscape of European basketball. The two rivals face off in EuroLeague, thoughreports suggestthey could switch to a proposed NBA-run European league in the coming years. The NBA is reportedly considering other major cities such as Milan, Munich, Berlin, Manchester, London, and Paris and targeting a 2027 launch date.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid players attend a basketball game against Barcelona in 2023.Photograph: Europa Press Sports/Europa Press/Getty ImagesIn Europe, basketball teams are often divisions of the soccer club. The Spanish Basketball Federation has itself described Madrid and Barcelona as the“heirs to their soccer rivalry”. Some clubs have different sporting divisions beyond football and basketball. Here in the arena the jerseys of retired Barcelona greats from the basketball, handball and futsal teams line the walls, and the corridors of the Palau Blaugrana are plastered with photos of star players from across the Barça brand. On court, the faint outline of futsal and hockey markings are visible on the hardwood.This multi-sport club model may soon become more familiar to Americans. Whether by including pre-established giants like Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich, or by creating basketball teams for soccer powerhouses –reports claimMilan, Chelsea and Manchester City could be involved – multi-sport clubs would probably have a presence in any NBA-Europe league.Last Friday, the wider Barça family were in attendance. Club president Joan Laporta arrived and started shaking hands. Players from the cities’ soccer clubs – including Real’s Jude Bellingham, Vinícius Júnior and Aurélien Tchouaméni – often attend, and several players from Barça’s handball team were present. High in the bleachers, Barça’s hardcore fans, the Dracs 1991, were already on their feet, whistling, chanting with the intensity of soccerultras. As tip-off approached, the bleachers filled with Barça and Catalan colours, a wall of blue-and-garnet streaked with the red and yellow of the regional flag, theSenyera, and the pro-independenceEstelada. There may have been as many soccer jerseys as basketball jerseys. And in Europe, many fans follow both their club’s soccer and basketball teams. Madrid are no exception: a small but loud travelling section filled up on the far side. Their muffled chants echoed across the stadium before being drowned out by Barça fans reestablishing homecourt advantage.Tip-off finally arrived and the Palau Blaugrana erupted into ear-splitting whistles and roars. On the rosters were Madrid’s Alex Len, making his debut, as well as Trey Lyles and Facu Campazzo, all ex-NBA players. Madrid have nine former NBA players, joint highest in the EuroLeague,according to Basket News data.Barça have six, notably Tomas Satoransky and Jan Vesely.That’s unsurprising. Real Madrid and Barça’s basketball teams have long been home to top talent. For many USNBAfans, however, their most direct association with Madrid is probably Luka Dončić, the Slovenian superstar and likely future NBA MVP who signed a five-year contract with Madrid when he was 13 years old.The Dracs bounced up and down, urging Barça on. But Madrid came out hot, hitting five early three-pointers. Madrid’s Chuma Okeke, a five-year NBA vet, threw up a prayer from inside his own half at the buzzer and saw it sink, adding to the feeling that Madrid couldn’t miss. Nonetheless, the atmosphere stayed tense, soccer-like, deafening, and was awash with furious anti-Madrid chants as the Barça fans continue with a relentless wall of noise.Later in the game the Madrid lead stretched to 17 and Barça fans began waving white handkerchiefs to show their discontent. Lyles in particular puts on a silky smooth performance, showcasing one-on-one skills more common in style on the other side of the pond. When the final buzzer sounded, Madrid had completed a 101-92 road win, their ninth consecutiveclásicovictory. But could it be one of the last in EuroLeague?It seems likely that we could soon seeclásicogamesunder the NBA logo. Perhaps, one day, we could even see Boston and Barcelona or LA and Madrid face off in cross-continental competition. With basketball possibly heading for its biggest ever shake-up, who knows? Whatever happens, for Madrid and Barça fans it’ll be a long way from that midnight game back in 1942 but never too far removed from the history and politics of the derby – wherever they play, in whatever league, the biggest game of the season will always beel clásico.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBABarcelonaReal MadridUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thomas Tuchel’s team can only beat what is in front of them and they had done that with sufficient regularity to guarantee theirplace at the finalsnext summer with two matches to spare.It made for the question. Could they do it on a soggy midweek night when most of the people outside their camp did not care? The answer was yes, even if it was not a performance or an occasion to quicken the pulse or live for any length of time in the memory. The serious business is to come.Five pointers for Thomas Tuchel: England’s race for No 10 hots upRead moreTuchel had demanded energy, a finessing of the connections between his players, a reinforcement of the identity he has wanted to emerge from the autumn programme. It did not completely happen like that. Too often, the final pass was missing. But what the manager did get was another win and another clean sheet. Count seven of each from seven qualifiers. The final one is against Albania in Tirana on Sunday. And, also, two lovely goals.Bukayo Saka got the first in the 28th minute with a volley that was marked by trademark technique. And Eberechi Eze, who came on as part of a quadruple substitution on 65 minutes that also included Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, scored the second in stoppage time.Serbia wanted a foul for a shirt pull by Bellingham but he played on to Foden, who operated as a false 9, winning praise from Tuchel. When Foden found Eze, the first-time curler for the far corner was too much for theSerbiagoalkeeper, Predrag Rajkovic. It was a moment of impressive incision on the counterattack and went a long way towards elevating the tone of it all.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford charges down the wing for England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianTuchel’s headline selection call had been to name the recalled Bellingham as a substitute, the manager retaining Morgan Rogers as the No 10 in his starting lineup. How could Tuchel have put Bellingham straight back in? It would have undermined so much of what he has preached. Rogers had been excellent as a starter in the previous three matches, won by scorelines of 5-0, 3-0 and 5-0. The first of those had been the transformative result against Serbia in Belgrade.Bellingham got arguably the loudest cheer of the night when he was introduced, although the bar was low in this regard, Wembley pretty subdued, quite a few empty seats. It was always going to be on Tuchel’s players to spark the supporters, not the other way around. The motivation had to come from within. Really, it was about getting the job done.The first paper plane from the stands was cheered on to the fringes of the pitch in the 19th minute and it was certainly a sleepy start, despite the best efforts of Elliot Anderson and Rogers to inject a bit of tempo. Or England’s desire to open up the game with raking long diagonals.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze curls in England’s second goal to secure victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSaka cut through the torpor. From a Declan Rice free-kick, it was a poor punch under no pressure from Rajkovic, which located the debutant left-back, Nico O’Reilly, on the edge of the box and his shot deflected out to Saka on the right. It is a movement that Saka has practised over and over again. The quick adjustment of the feet. The opening up of his body. The left-foot volley, almost caressed into the far corner.England made a few inroads up the left, Marcus Rashford flickering, trying his tricks. O’Reilly saw a deflected cross fly at the outside of the near post – from the corner, Harry Kane headed wide – while Rashford had shot too close to Rajkovic on 25 minutes. It was a shame that Rashford fluffed a pass to Rice on a break before the interval. Rogers also glanced a header wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pace was there from him; the willingness to run at his full-back. The end product was erratic.It was Serbia’s first game under thenew manager, Veljko Paunovic, and the importance of it could not be overstated. The visitors had arrived in London determined to keep alive their slim hopes of a playoff spot. By the end, with Albania beating Andorra, it was over for them.In the England goal, it was yet another quiet night for Jordan Pickford. He had entered the game on the back of a record nine consecutive clean sheets. The last time he conceded for his country was in October last year in theNations League defeathere against Greece. England’s defenders barely ceded an inch.Serbia wondered whether they could produce one moment and it almost came in the 63rd minute when Filip Kostic crossed after a rare break. Dusan Vlahovic flicked wide of the far post. Serbia pushed a little more towards the end; everything was on the line for them but they never truly looked like scoring.Eze made a difference. On for Rashford, he went close after Bellingham had got the ball back from Reece James’s outrageous flick. Foden was off target with a header and Eze hit the crossbar after good buildup work from Bellingham and Foden. When he was played in again by the pair, the finish was a beauty.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersEnglandSerbiamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) has held emergency meetings with referee representatives, but clubs continue to highlight controversial decisions.So how did it come to this? Relations between referees and clubs have never been warm in Portugal – some clubs have historically demanded behind closed doors that certain officials be kept off their games and in late July Benfica publicly criticised the appointment of Fábio Veríssimo for their Super Cup game against Sporting. Yet in recent weeks things have reached boiling point.I’d rather Van Dijk’s goal stood, but it wasn’t a clear and obvious error to deny him | Chris FoyRead moreOn 2 November Veríssimo accused Porto of pressuring him by broadcasting a replay of a disallowed goal on a television in his dressing room during half-time. With the game goalless, Veríssimo had blown for a foul after a Porto player collided with the Braga goalkeeper, ruling out a goal scored from the loose ball. According to Veríssimo’s official report, the television could not be turned off.Veríssimo said that after the match, which Porto won 2-1, the screen switched to showing footage from a youth match between Porto and Benfica in 2024, which he had also officiated. In that game, he allowed a similar goal – in Benfica’s favour – after contact with Porto’s goalkeeper inside the six-yard box.Benfica and Sporting have since accused Porto of trying to intimidate Veríssimo, and Sporting suggested the victory should be annulled if Porto were found guilty of wrongdoing.Porto, in their only public comment, did not deny Veríssimo’s account. They released a statement listing penalties, red cards and other contentious calls they claim have gone against the club this season. Addressing Veríssimo directly, Porto accused him of threatening club officials in a previous game and of seeking “revenge” during the Braga match.Veríssimo has not responded publicly but the FPF has defended the referees and continues to investigate the allegations related to the dressing room television.André Villas-Boas, Porto’s president, said the club would look into that too.Tensions further escalated a week later when, during Benfica’s match against Casa Pia, a referee was allegedly threatened by a Benfica executive after awarding a controversial penalty. “You are a fucking embarrassment,” one Benfica official was reported to have said. Benfica were leading 2-0 and their joy when the spot-kick was saved turned to despair when the defender Tomás Araújo slammed the ball into his own net in trying to clear. A stoppage-time equaliser gave Casa Pia a draw.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s José Mourinho confronts Gustavo Correia.Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty ImagesJosé Mourinho, Benfica’s head coach, was involved in a brief post-match exchange with the referee, Gustavo Correia, though nothing unusual was recorded. The FPF is investigating both matters. Benfica wrote on their website above the video highlights that the referee had “awarded a penalty to the visitors without justification”.Pedro Henriques, a former top-flight referee and former lieutenant colonel in the Portuguese army, believes acts of intimidation are nothing new – just more sophisticated. “We’ve moved from the traditional kicking down the locker-room door, common in the 90s, to looping images on a television that can’t be turned off,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHenriques argues that such gestures are often performative, meant to please supporters rather than sway officials. This behaviour goes largely unpunished, with fines and suspensions for the biggest clubs minimal and delayed.“Presidents and club directors do this to show off, to say: ‘We’re watching them, we’ll scare them,’” Henriques says. “But, the truth is, the chance of that actually influencing a referee is 0.0%.”Even with VAR, mistakes happen. Last weekend Sporting were incorrectly awarded a late corner at Santa Clara – and scored the winning goal from it. The margin for error, Henriques notes, has never been smaller. The award of corners is not covered by VAR but Henriques says: “The supporter’s logic is: if the ref makes a mistake and VAR doesn’t correct it, then the referees must be corrupt.”In response, the Portuguese Referees’ Association last weekend staged a symbolic protest, match officials walking on to the pitch without the teams in the top two divisions – a coordinated act of defiance meant to signal they will not be intimidated.Referees, usually the quietest figures on the field, have found their voice. The head of the FPF’s refereeing council has defended them publicly, revealing that 97% of refereeing decisions in the first 10 rounds were correct. Threatened officials, he said, would continue to be assigned matches.The protests have yet to affect the games but Portuguese football is playing on the edge – and the next whistle could spark more than just another controversy.Explore more on these topicsRefereesEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After arriving fromClub Bruggeto replace Ivan Toney, Thiago’s first season was quiet, disjointed and frustrating. Two knee injuries restricted him to just eight appearances, 168 minutes and no goals.‘The butt of every joke’: when Wolves were relegated three seasons in a rowRead moreThere were plenty of gloomy pre-season predictions for Brentford this summer. After losingThomas Frank,their captain, Christian Nørgaard, and the forwardsBryan MbeumoandYoane Wissa– who were responsible for 60% of their goals and a quarter of their assists last season – Brentford were not expected to thrive. Few thought they would be dishing out defeats to Liverpool, Newcastle, Manchester United and Aston Villa, with Thiago as the main man.Thiago’s story begins far from the manicured pitches of thePremier League. He grew up in Gama, near Brasília. At the age when most academy prospects are worrying about which boots to wear, he was already shouldering responsibility far beyond his years. Thiago’s father died when he was 13, leaving him to support his mother, Maria, who worked as a rubbish collector.Thiago took on various jobs to help his family, such as carrying groceries in a local supermarket and working as a bricklayer, all while holding on to a dream of professional football. “It helped me as a man and it helped me as a person,”he says of those early struggles. “It helped me to appreciate the little and big things in life.”He played for a local club, Verê FC, before signing for Cruzeiro, where he made his senior debut at 18. Four goals in 43 Série B appearances hardly sent shockwaves through Brazil but his potential was clear. In 2022 he made the leap to Europe, signing forLudogorets. His early promise blossomed in Bulgaria, where his 21 goals and 11 assists helped the club win back-to-back league titles.His performances impressed Club Brugge, who signed him in the summer of 2023 for £7m. It quickly proved a bargain for the Belgian side. Thiago scored 18 league goals in his only season with the club, enough to attract the attention of the astute analytics-driven recruitment team atBrentford. They made him the club’s record signing in July 2024.His task was simple: succeed Ivan Toney, who had scored 36 goals in 83 Premier League appearances for Brentford. Instead, injuries held him back and his job became to replace Mbeumo and Wissa. Brentford have an outstanding track record of replacing players. Ollie Watkins, Saïd Benrahma, Neal Maupay, David Raya, Toney and Ezri Konsa have all come and gone over the last few years. Each departure led to questions about how they would cope but the team has hardly missed a beat. If anything, they often improve.View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago and Rico Henry celebrate after Brentford’s win against Liverpool.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesBut this summer felt different. Brentford had lost three prolific goalscorers in the space of two seasons and were relying on Thiago, who had very little Premier League football under his belt, to carry much of this burden. They were considered among the favourites for relegation, especially when they replaced Frank with Keith Andrews, their youngset-pieces coach, who made the step up to head coach for the first time.Andrews himself acknowledged the scepticism. “I understand the narrative,” he said. “If I were someone externally not understanding what goes on in the building, I might be of the same opinion.” And yet he showed unwavering confidence: “We’re in a really good position and I just feel like most people don’t know that.” He said this in mid-September after his team had started the season with one win in their first four games. Seven games and four wins later, it’s safe to say Andrews was on to something.Brentford have climbed up the league, largely driven by Thiago’s eight goals. The 24-year-old thrives on long balls, timing his runs behind defences to perfection much like Mbeumo and Wissa did under Frank. He finishes with conviction – his shot conversion rate of 32% is one of the best in the league – and he drops deep to link up play, hold up the ball and create chances. He also uses his strength and 6ft 3in frame to his advantage; a crucial role in a Brentford side built on fast transitions.His ability in the air (he is second for aerial duels won among strikers this season) and relentless work rate make him a nightmare for opponents. Ronny Deila, his former Club Brugge coach, summed him up perfectly, saying: “Defenders hate playing against him. He presses non-stop, runs all the time and kicks them.” It’s still early days, but the signs suggest Brentford’s recruitment team have done it again.Thiago’s form has peaked at just the right time. With seven months to go before the World Cup, he has put himself on Carlo Ancelotti’s radar. The battle for places in theBrazilattack is fierce, with eight forwards in the Premier League alone competing for a spot alongside Vinicius Junior, Endrick, Rodrygo, Raphinha and others. The good news for Thiago is that he boasts the most impressive record: he is the top scoring Brazilian in Europe’s top five leagues this season.“I’ve always dreamed of being able to play for Brazil,” he told thefootball journalist Josué Seixas. “I ask God that, when he takes me to the national team, I don’t want to go just for the sake of it. When I get there, I want to stay.” Thiago has already gone from laying bricks to leading the line for Brentford in the Premier League. Now he is in a great position to achieve his biggest dream.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsBrentfordGuardian Sport NetworkBrazilClub BruggeLudogoretsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His long passing and shot-stopping have always been of decent standard, but, over time, he’s developed his short game, able to keep the ball moving and begin attacks by picking out teammates at closer range. His handling is tidier, meaning mistakes are fewer, and he is no longer as affected by his emotions as he was in his youth.Reece James (Chelsea)Perhaps a surprising entry, but the Chelsea captain is even better than he is given credit for. For years people questioned whether Kyle Walker or Trent Alexander-Arnold should be England’s right-back when, all along, the correct answer was neither because James combines the strengths of both with the weaknesses of neither. He has power, tenacity and recovery pace, all elevated by creativity and attacking impetus. A total footballer, he is not just one of the best in his position in thePremier League, but one of the best in the world.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Reece James surges forward as he holds off the challenge of Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAMatthijs de Ligt (Manchester United)De Ligt is reaping the rewards of a fallow summer and full pre-season, the only member of United’s squad to play every minute of every Premier League match. His box-defending is excellent, he is dominant in the air – at both ends – and has adapted well to a role that demands he contest challenges in midfield, winning duels and second balls with increasing regularity. As his confidence has grown, he has assumed the role of defensive organiser, showing once more the leadership skills that earned him the captaincy of Ajax at 18.Maxence Lacroix (Crystal Palace)Challenging for inclusion simply by virtue of the name Maxence – originating from Latin and meaning “greatest” or “illustrious” – the Palace centre-back is quick, strong, classy on the ball and commanding in the air. He is the only player to play every minute of Palace’s 19 games this season, which reflects not only his ability, but also his influence. His comment before last season’s FA Cup final, that “Wembley will shake and it will be beautiful”, formed a central part of the fans’ tifo that preceded thewin over Manchester City, immortalised on a banner and firmly ensconced in Eagles folklore for ever more.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s Maxence Lacroix displays his aerial aptitude when beating Liverpool’s Alexander Isak to a header.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersMichael Kayode (Brentford)Usually deployed at right-back, Kayode can also play on the left, and it is here he features in this XI. Though he has become famous for throw-ins hurled not just far but flat, there is much more to him than that. Comfortable on the ball and adept at passing or tackling with either foot, like many young full-backs Kayode is a threat driving forward with the ball. But unlike many his defensive fundamentals are also sound: he is physically dominant, reads the game well and, when beaten, can often rely on his recovery pace to extricate him from trouble.Yasin Ayari (Brighton)The most eye-catching work in Brighton’s midfield is done by Carlos Baleba, but it is Ayari who provides the Cameroonian with the platform to go on adventures. Refined in possession, even when receiving under pressure, he dictates play, but also has the speed, discipline and intelligence to cover space and track runners. There is more yet to come: Ayari strikes the ball with purity, making it a matter of time before he regularly produces goals and assists.Noah Sadiki (Sunderland)Signed in the summer for £15m, the 20-year-old midfielder – who can also play full-back and centre-back – has been quietly revelatory, one of the key men in Sunderland’s outstanding start to the season. Sadiki’s barely believable energy allows him to rampage from box to box for 90 minutes while also giving Granit Xhaka the scope to control the pace of games. Sadiki can also dribble, pass and tackle, on top of which he is, the Guardian is reliably assured, a lovely boy with exemplary attitude.View image in fullscreenNoah Sadiki of Sunderland controls the ball as he moves away from the challenge of Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi (Fulham)There are few as reliable in all phases of midfield play as Iwobi, whether that be in a pivot, going box to box or out wide. Able to take the ball under pressure, carry it well and use it intelligently, his movement without it is also excellent and the numbers back up the eye test. Only six Premier League players have created more chances than the 29-year-old this season, while he leads his team in assists, expected assists, key passes, progressive passes and shot-creating actions, among other metrics. Quietly, Iwobi has become one of the most effective players in the country.Jacob Murphy (Newcastle)It took Murphy time to establish himself at the top end of the game. Starting out at Norwich, he was loaned to Swindon, Southend, Blackpool, Scunthorpe, Colchester and Coventry before signing for Newcastle, after which he spent time at West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday. On his return to Newcastle, he was deployed as a wing-back by Steve Bruce. Now, though, the 30-year-old is a key member of the squad, starting the majority of matches and coming off the bench in almost all the others, his hard-running creativity elevated by improved output. Last season, he contributed nine goals and 14 assists, he has two and three this season, and has grown into a far better player than most expected.Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)To arrive in the Premier League from overseas and score four times in eight games is impressive in any context, but to do so as a 19-year-old is exceptional. Kroupi’s first three goals for Bournemouth were of the poacher’s variety, his ability to anticipate where the ball would drop supported by the intelligence to calculate and finesse to apply the necessary finish. Against Nottingham Forest last monthhe showed he is more than that, scavenging for possession in the centre-circle and carrying the ball forward, jinking to unbalance the two defenders between him and goal, then hammering a low shot into the corner from 25 yards. He will not be under-appreciated for much longer.View image in fullscreenEli Junior Kroupi hones his acrobatic skills during a Bournemouth training session.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesLeandro Trossard (Arsenal)Trossard is almost the perfect squad player for a title-chasing team. Though he is not of elite level, he is still very good and understands that his role of utility forward, covering and excelling across the frontline, is a specialist one. Though the Belgian will never be an automatic selection he will play plenty of games, from the start and off the bench. His job is to be ready when called upon and the ability to affect games, often with little time in which to work, requires unimpeachable mentality and is no less important than that of the regular starters. Impact is measured in outcomes, not minutes, and Trossard has shown more than once he can make an impact for Arsenal.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueJordan PickfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The national teamreached the quarter-finalsfor the first time and a total of 623,088 were in attendance at the 31 matches, a tournament record. The hope within Switzerland was for a boost at club level similar to what England experienced three years previously. Those heights have not been reached, but there has been a definite bump.According to Switzerland’s football association, their Women’s Super League has enjoyed a 62% increase in attendances this season, with an average attendance of 787. While that does not compare with the huge spike England’s Women’s Super League had after Euro 2022 – an average attendance increase of 172% the following season – it is still encouraging.Grasshopper, currently second in the Swiss WSL, had an average attendance of 300 last season; that is up to 450 for this campaign. Thun, bottom of the Swiss WSL, have more than doubled their average attendance, from 156 to 326. Basel, who sit sixth, have experienced a big increase in the amount of season tickets sold, from 300 last season to 800 this. However, the number of supporters attending games there remains roughly the same.Basel’s women’s sporting director, Fabian Sanginés, says the club are trying different things in order to encourage fans to buy tickets, including offering free popcorn to children. It has had a positive effect but, for Sanginés, it is crucial progress at domestic level goes beyond gimmicks. “When a country applies to host a Euros they need to have a plan,” he says. “The legacy programme here is about trying to ensure we increase certain standards in the youth and also get financial help for them.“Everyone had a huge hype about the Euros, but hype is for a certain amount of time and we don’t want to be the hype; we want to be sustainable and long term.”There has also been an increase in interest in the national team. At their first home game after Euro 2025, a 1-0 win over Canada in Lucerne in October achieved via Alayah Pilgrim’s goal, there were 10,025 in attendance, Switzerland’s second-highest attendance for the year outside the tournament.View image in fullscreenSwitzerland fans declare their commitment to the national team at Euro 2025.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images“We are seeing a steady increase in interest and attendance figures for our matches,” says the Swiss FA. “The attendance figures for the match against Canada in Lucerne are part of this positive trend. We will now be looking at ways of improving the fan experience for the World Cup qualifiers in order to continue to make use of the rise in interest for women’s football.”What, then, needs to be done to ensure attendances keep growing at club level? ”We saw at the Euros, it was so nice. The atmosphere was super friendly, super welcoming,” says Sanginés. “But then a lot of those people [now] stay at home on a Saturday afternoon. So this is something for society; when you say you want to support you should actually go out and support. People need to go to the matches.“It’s the same for the companies. If you have been a sponsor for the Euros now might also be the time to be sponsoring a local club. This is what keeps us running and improving.”Recommended listeningJoin Faye Carruthers and the Women’s Football Weekly squadfor the latest edition of our podcast.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Expanded tournaments have removed a ­considerable element of jeopardy and there is an acceptance that ­fundamental changes must be implemented to reignite interest.England to begin Euro 2028 at Manchester City’s Etihad StadiumRead moreEngland havecruised to qualificationfor the 48-team 2026 World Cup with two games to spare, theirmatch against Serbiaon Thursday night barely relevant after they won an uninspiring group that also includes Albania, Latvia and Andorra. It has become a procession for bigger countries and the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, believes it is time to refresh the model.“I think it’s really important to overhaul it,” he said. “I think we need to keep looking at ways to make international football even better and there’s genuine appetite to do that. Uefa are clearly leading that, but I’m one of a group of countries that’s helping them to look at options.”Bullingham sits on a Uefa ­working group examining ­alternative ­formats. One potential move is to adopt a ­version of the Champions League-style Swiss system model where, rather than face a handful of sides twice in one smaller group, a range of opponents are faced once and teams are placed in one league table. It would mean Europe’s giants ­potentially encounter at least one similarly ranked team. An ­alternative could be that the Nations League, which has proved attractive to supporters and television companies, holds greater sway in ­deciding who qualifies.The FA chair, Debbie Hewitt, ­echoed Bullingham’s stance. ­“Football changes, the world changes, the number of tournaments changes, the number of teams playing in those tournaments changes,” she said. “So if we stick with the same model of qualification it’s probably going to get bent out of shape. I think we have to keep looking at challenging.”Hewitt suggested the existing group format would be retained forEuro 2028and ruled out a pre-qualifying event for lower-ranked teams.In October the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, confirmed discussions were under way. “There won’t be any more matches but a more interesting format,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One is not dynamic ticket pricing, and the other one is that approximately half of the tickets will be in category three, and also the fan first category, which is the category below that.

His seven-year career at Elland Road was ended by mutual consent in August.One of Bamford’s final notable acts as a Leeds player was to lead abusive chants about Wilder during the club’s promotion celebrations in April. Now the one-cap England international will be playing for Wilder as the Blades’ manager looks to pull his beloved club out of the relegation zone.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The pair had history before Leeds won promotion back to the Premier League last season and United lost the playoff final to Sunderland. Wilder described Bamford as “a muppet” when the roles were reversed in 2018-19 and the Blades won automatic promotion while Leeds missed out in the playoffs.All appears to have been forgiven and forgotten with United, the Championship’s lowest scorers, in desperate need of improvement up front and Bamford looking to revive his career.The Wilder chant went viral in April. A repentant Bamford and the Leeds manager, Daniel Farke, phoned Wilder the following day.Wilder said at the time: “Had a conversation with Pat yesterday and I’ve no issue at all with it. I’m not sure about the words used from a fellow pro! But I appreciated and respected him giving me a call.“We had 20 minutes and the same again I spoke to Daniel as well and had a half-hour chat with him and he is a super guy, a top guy. When I was playing we used to give it and take it and that’s part and parcel of the game at every level, even on a Sunday morning. I have absolutely no issue. I am cool with it and I said that to Pat.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eze rounded off a brilliant move involving fellow substitutes Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham in the 90th minute to confirm the victory, which was England’s seventh in succession without conceding in qualification.Tuchel was delighted with his side’s professionalism given that they had already made certain of their place at the World Cup last month and stressed the importance of having a strong bench going into next year’s tournament.Five pointers for Thomas Tuchel: England’s race for No 10 hots upRead more“This is not about building a starting XI, it’s about building a team,” he said. “And that means that sometimes, they’re all big players in their club, they’re all used to play, they’re all disappointed. This is normal, but they buy into this idea of building a team and this is what we want, this is what we need, there is no other way around it.“Only if we’re a strong group who can put the ego behind, who can put the disappointment behind and then contribute and give the coach a headache [about] what to do in the next match, that’s the only way. And I like it because it’s natural for this team.”Tuchel added: “The atmosphere after the matches, during the matches is the right energy and I think everyone is treating everyone with respect. The ones on the pitch know that they can rely on everyone who comes from the bench to finish the game. You could see the impact today and it has to stay like this.”Foden was outstanding in a false 9 role after replacing captain Harry Kane in a quadruple substitution after 65 minutes and Tuchel says he is excited to work more with the Manchester City forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was in a very, very dark spot.“I could tell you that I hated the sport. Now here we are two days later, and I’m feeling great about myself. It’s incredible.”So, against all odds, De Minaur finished second behind Alcaraz in the Jimmy Connors Group, qualifying for the semi-finals. He’s only the third Australian ever to do so after John Newcombe (1973-74) and Lleyton Hewitt, the 2001 and 2002 winner and 2004 finalist.Such a scenario had looked wholly improbable after world No 7 De Minaur had been left completely dejected, losing after he had served for the match against the weary but inspired home favourite Musetti on Tuesday.But on Thursday, with a sympathetic crowd right behind him, the 26-year-old Sydneysider showed magnificent resolve to down big-serving world No 6 Fritz.It didn’t come easy. He was locked at 4-4 and down 0-30 on his serve in the opening set, with the big-serving Fritz threatening to win the set which would condemn him to an early exit.Instead, he rebounded in that game, went on to dominate with a brilliant tie break and then asserted his supremacy in a fairly one-sided second set to finally win anATP Finalsmatch at the sixth attempt, after having gone winless on his debut in Turin last year and then losing to Alcaraz and Musetti earlier this week.After triumphing in an hour 34 minutes, De Minaur looked to the heavens and shook his hands in joy before going over to the courtside TV camera and scrawling “Finally” alongside a smiley emoji on the lens.Good things come to those who wait 😈A brilliant@alexdeminaurdazzles his way to a first ever win at the#NittoATPFinals, defeating Fritz 7-6(3) 6-3!pic.twitter.com/ajfCQKgop5— ATP Tour (@atptour)November 13, 2025“I’ve dealt with a fair bit of heartbreak recently,” he said. “It was good to finally get a win here in Turin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I kind of make peace with it, and I just committed to my game from the first point to the last.“I was gonna leave everything out there today and I ended up with a really good match from the start ‘til the end. I’ve worked really hard, so it was good to get some positive reward for that hard work.”Alcaraz dismissed Musetti in straight sets later on Thursday. Like many involving Alcaraz, the first set was tight until it wasn’t, Musetti serving well until, down 4-5, he lost an 11-minute game and with it the set.It was one-way traffic thereafter, an exhausted Musetti, who played through the Asian swing and lost a marathon final in Athens to Novak Djokovic, just last Sunday, unable to cope as Alcaraz upped his level.And though he needed three match points to finish off, the outcome was never in doubt. Next for him: Felix Auger-Aliassime or Alexander Zverev.“I had to handle my nerves the best I could and I was happy the way I did it,” said the Spaniard, who has had an incredible year with eight titles and two grand slam titles in Paris and New York.Explore more on these topicsAlex de MinaurATP FinalsTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

On three occasions last year he was part of teams narrowly edged out in the final stages by the All Blacks in Dunedin, Auckland and London but says England are now significantly better placed to seal the deal on Saturday.Scott Barrett fit to return and captain All Blacks against England at TwickenhamRead more“I think we’re ready,” said Itoje as England put the finishing touches to their big game preparations at their hotel base in Bagshot. “New Zealand are a good team, no doubt about that. They possess enough talent, accuracy and power to hurt any team but I think we’re ready to take that next step.“I think we have a clearer understanding of how we want to play and more belief in what we do and how we do it. The quality of the playing squad has improved and with the experiences we’ve all had over the last year or so we’re just more equipped to take advantage of opportunities at hand.”Itoje’s optimism is also based on England’s growing strength in depth, particularly off the bench, compared with 12 months ago. They were leading in the second half of all three of their Tests against New Zealand last year, only to fail to score a point in the final quarter of all those contests.In Dunedin theylost 16-15after Marcus Smith’s goalkicking radar deserted him, while in Auckland they were in front 17-13 beforegoing down 24-17, missing out on a possible late penalty try which might have secured them a draw.Then there was the frustrating24-22 home reversethis time last year when George Ford narrowly missed a late penalty and a drop-goal opportunity which could have yielded a first triumph over the All Blacks at Twickenham since 2012. Add everything together and there is no escaping England’s desire to go one better now.Itoje, though, is fully aware there will inevitably be twists and turns along the way: “Playing against the All Blacks, you need to be sharp mentally and you need to execute when you get your opportunities because you don’t get many of them. So when they come we need to make sure we execute. We need to have a physical intensity as well as an accuracy to what we do.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand players show their delight at winning at Twickenham last year.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images“I think we had the belief we could do it last year and if maybe one or two things went the other way, it could have been a different conversation we’re having now. But throughout this year we’ve had a number of challenging games and a number of challenging experiences, and I think we’re beginning to learn from them.”England, however, have managed only eight wins over New Zealand in the long history of this fixture. In Japan they famously stood in a V-for-victory formation to face the All Blacks’ pre-game haka but what Itoje remembers most is the pre-match feeling of certainty in the winning dressing room.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was one of those weird games where they had periods on top but it felt like there was only one outcome. Hopefully we can do something similar this weekend.”Advantage England? Emma Raducanu gives tips to squad for All Blacks clashRead moreTo that end, England’s focus in camp has been on keeping as calm as possible at pivotal moments. More broadly, it would also underline the progress Steve Borthwick’s side have been making this year, which has so far yielded nine successive wins – several of them secured late on – since their loss to Ireland in Dublin in February.“For me, it’s all about mental clarity,” stressed Itoje, who is set to win his 96th cap for England. “If you’ve played the whole game there’s a fatigue element in there but the ones who are able to see it through … there’s a toughness, there’s a mental clarity which gives you the ability to execute.“A number of Test matches are going down to the last quarter or the last 10 minutes, if not even less than that. In the last 15 minutes it’s the teams that can execute, keep their composure, don’t do erratic things, stick to task but also do all that at an incredibly high intensity that tend to be the ones that follow through and win.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Barretts must have some good skin.” His older brother Beauden will start at fly-half again, but younger brother Jordie is back in New Zealand having treatment on the ankle injury he suffered in that same match against Ireland.England play Generation Game against All Blacks with overhaul of traditional order of selection | Robert KitsonRead moreThe wing Caleb Clarke is also out injured, so Robertson has moved Leicester Fainga’anuku into the back three, and brought Billy Proctor in to play at outside-centre. Up front, Simon Parker comes into the back row, and Robertson has kept Wallace Sititi on the bench in a clear attempt to provide a counterweight to the strong set of replacements picked by his opposite number, Steve Borthwick. As well as Sititi, he has Anton Lienert-Brown and Damian McKenzie among the subs, too.Robertson says he has no concerns about picking Fainga’anuku on the wing: “Did you see him play the second Bledisloe Cup match?” Yeah, he was pretty handy on the left wing, he’s got power, he’s a left-footed kicker, and he’s playing good footy, so it’s his spot.”The All Blacks’ debrief after the Scotland game focused on the way the hosts had taken control of the match in the third quarter, when they came back from 17-0 down.“We looked at the momentum swings, and how they put pressure on us,” Robertson said. “The ability to get out of our own end cleanly was key for us, it just took longer than we’d planned for so we’ve done a bit of work on it this week and how to get the momentum back.”Quick GuideEngland v New Zealand teamsShowEngland:Steward; Roebuck, Lawrence, Dingwall, Feyi-Waboso; Ford, Mitchell; Baxter, George, Heyes; Itoje (c), Coles; Pepper, Underhill, EarlReplacements:Cowan-Dickie, Genge, Stuart, Cunningham-South, Curry, Pollock, Spencer, Marcus SmithNew Zealand:Jordan; Carter, Proctor, Tupaea, Fainga'anuku; Beauden Barrett, Roigard; De Groot, Taylor, Newell; Scott Barrett (c), Holland; Parker, Savea, LakaiReplacements:Taukei'aho, Williams, Tosi, Lord, Sititi, Ratima, Lienert-Brown, McKenzieWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The All Blacks are also preparing for an aerial contest. “England have got a great aerial game, Alex Mitchell’s a quality kicker,” Robertson said. “He puts it on the spot.

Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another.

Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36.

The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

But as AI software develops, it is increasingly being used to produce sometimes misleading photos and videos.“I think what’s really broken through in this election cycle has been the use of generative AI to produce content that goes directly to voters,” said Alex Bores, a New York state representative who has been at the forefront of introducing laws to regulate the use of AI.“So whether that was the Cuomo campaign thatused ChatGPT to generate its housing plan, or Cuomo and many others making AI-generated video ads for voters, that is, I think, felt very new in the 2025 cycle, or certainly, just much further than we’ve ever seen before.”Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who dropped out of the race in September, used AIto create robocallsto New Yorkers featuring him speaking in Mandarin, Urdu and Yiddish, and also producedan AI videoshowing New York as an apparently war-torn dystopia to attack Mamdani.Cuomo, meanwhile, was accused of racism and Islamophobia after his campaigntweeted a videothat showed a fictionalized version of Mamdani eating rice with his fingers and a Black man shoplifting. The advert also featured a Black man, wearing a purple shirt and tie and a fur coat and carrying a silver cane, appearing to endorse sex trafficking. The Cuomo campaign later deleted it and said it had been sent out by accident.Bores, who is running to represent New York in the House of Representatives, said many of the AI-generated ads in the last election cycle were “more likely” to “veer into what might be perceived as bigoted territory”.“I think that’s another thing that we need to track: is this either because the algorithms are playing up stereotypes that are in their training data, or [is it] because it’s so easy to manipulate. You don’t have to tell an actor of a certain race to do a certain thing, you just change it in the computer,” Bores said.“You don’t have to say to someone’s face to portray themselves in a certain way. Does that make it easier for people to put out content that, you know, really, I think polite society should be frowning upon.”In New York state, campaigns are supposed to label AI ads as such, but some – including the ad Cuomo posted and deleted – did not. The New York board of elections is in charge of potentially pressing charges against campaigns, but Bores noted that campaigns might be willing to bite the bullet on any punishment, particularly if any punishment comes after a campaign has finished.“I think you’re always going to find campaigns that are willing to take that trade-off. If they win and then they pay a fine afterwards, they’re not going to care, and if they lose, it doesn’t matter,” Bores said. “So you want to try to find an enforcement regime that can take things down quickly before an election, as opposed to just punish afterwards.”Robert Weissman, co-president of the non-profit advocacy group Public Citizen, which has been involved in passing many AI laws around the US, said that trying to fool people is now illegal in more than half the states, with campaigns required to post disclaimers on generative AI ads saying they are not real. Still, he said, regulating AI use in campaigns is a pressing issue.“Lies have been part of politics since time immemorial. This is different than lies, and it’s different than saying your opponent said something that they didn’t say,” Weissman said.Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine sign voice deal with AI companyRead more“When someone is shown an apparently authentic version of a person saying something, it is very hard for that person to then contradict it and say ‘I never said that’ because you’re asking people to disbelieve what they saw with their own eyes.”While AI is now capable of generating believable videos, some campaigns haven’t quite nailed it. A“Zohran Halloween special” videoposted by Cuomo – this ad did state it was AI-generated – showed an extremely sloppy rendition of Mamdani, complete with out-of-sync audio and an incomprehensible script.With the midterm elections approaching and the 2028 presidential election looming, AI-generated political videos are likely to stick around.They’ve already been used at the national level. Elon Muskshared an AI-generated videoof Kamala Harris in July 2024, after she became the de facto Democratic nominee for president. That video depicted Harris claiming she was the “ultimate diversity hire” and saying she doesn’t “know the first thing about running the country”.While states may be making progress on regulating the use of AI in elections, there seems to be little appetite to do so at the federal level.During the No Kings protests in October, Donald Trump shared an AI video that showed him flying a fighter jet anddropping brown fluid on Americans, just the latest of his AI video posts.With Trump apparently approving of the medium, it seems unlikely that Republicans will attempt to rein in AI anytime soon.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Andrew CuomoDonald TrumpZohran MamdanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

That in turn affects the newspaper.“We are concerned that Google’s policies do not allow news publishers to be treated in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner in its search results,” said Teresa Ribera, the executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition policies at the European Commission.Officials will ask publishers to submit evidence of any impacts to its traffic and revenues as a result of suspected breaches of fair practices in the coming days, the commission said.Ribera added: “We will investigate to ensure that news publishers are not losing out on important revenues at a difficult time for the industry, and to ensure Google complies with the Digital Markets Act.“Today we are taking action to ensure that digital gatekeepers do not unfairly restrict businesses that rely on them from promoting their own products and services.”Google hit out at the EU’s investigation, calling it “misguided” and “without merit”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today we have Cambridge-based Arm, a quiet titan designing more than 90% of the chips powering phones and tablets globally.​With such a pedigree, it is not idle daydreaming for British companies to win a significant chunk of the AI chip market; 5% is a conservative, achievable ambition. World-class universities, a thriving foundational AI company in DeepMind, and a robust ecosystem for innovation give the UK the practical tools it needs to compete.​The rewards of success are staggering. By 2033, the global AI chip market is projected to reach $700bn (£620bn) a year, outstripping the whole of today’s semiconductor market. Capturing that 5% means $35bn in new revenue and thousands of high-paying jobs.AI will reshape not only our economy but also our society and its security. Yet so many misunderstand where its true value and strategic power lie.In today’s gold rush, the real fortunes belong to those who build the shovel, not just those digging for digital gold. I saw this first-hand when I was on the Intel board in California between 1997 and 2006 as Gordon Moore and Andy Grove built that company. They built the “back end” of tech’s first revolution just as Nvidia is building the much bigger “back end” now.British engineers, British brains, British business and British investors are world-class at this stuff. But we will need the government to get on board.Consumer eyes are dazzled by OpenAI’s generative marvels. But it really is Nvidia, the company that supplies the advanced chips that make such feats possible, that reaps the market’s largest rewards. OpenAI looks as if it’s worth only a 10th of Nvidia. AMD, a semiconductor company that designs chips, is a distant second, while startups such as Cerebras and Tenstorrent jostle for a small piece of the pie.Every AI model and application, from autonomous robots to real-time translation tools, depends on advances in chip technology. Chips are the new oil in the digital economy, determining how quickly and efficiently future applications come to life. At present, theonly truly profitable giants in the AI sector are chipmakers.Some fear that China will commoditise AI chips just as it did with solar technology, causing prices to crater and incumbents to fall. The reality is more nuanced. US export controls prevent China from accessing the world’s advanced chip manufacturing technology for the next decade, severely limiting the country’s capacity to dominate high-end AI chip markets. For now, this leaves the US as the key player, with strong opportunities for Britain as its closest ally adept at chip design.The UK has already generated a few companies such as Fractile, Flux and Oriole working in this area. But we lack the scale to match the opportunity. We should not compete with Nvidia for the compute power of datacentres but in specialised applications that break new ground: robotics, factory automation, medical devices and autonomous vehicles.These sectors offer open terrain for innovative architectures and fresh competition.​skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This must change. First the government must strongly promote our determination to compete in AI chips.Second, within a decade we must double our chip design workforce from today’s 12,000, providing incentives for more talented students to study electrical engineering and computer science with generous bursaries. A target of 1,500 new students a year is realistic. Universities must offer the courses and the government must step up with practical financial support.​Third, the UK must use its investment levers: sovereign AI funds, the British Business Bank, the National Wealth Fund and the mandate to “buy British” by the Ministry of Defence.Fourth, the UK’s strategic relationship with the US must be a platform for deep integration with leading US chip manufacturers and access to their advanced sub-3 nanometer fabrication technology. Building robust supply chains and innovation pipelines with US partners is indispensable.​If the UK leans in fully, the new age of AI may be written not just in code, but in silicon, bearing a very British imprint.Lord Browne is the co-chair of theCouncil for Science and Technology.

The Snap cuts are no exceptionPriya Fielding-SinghEven after Snap benefits return, damage will have been done: scarcity leaves trauma in its wakeThu 13 Nov 2025 14.58 ESTFirst published on Thu 13 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareWhen I was 13, a pair of foster siblings, Carla and Rodrigo, came to live with my family. For the two of them, the move brought a period of much-needed stability – and, for the very first time, reliable access to food.Yet scarcity had already left its mark.The day she arrived, Carla began hoarding. She stuffed bags of cookies beneath her clothes and hid cans of Chef Boyardee under the bed. I’d sometimes find her on the couch late at night, the faint glow of the television lighting her face as she ate the ravioli cold straight from the can. My mom, mindful of Carla’s past, filled our cupboards with the red-labeled cans – a small gesture of reassurance. Carla stockpiled them under her bed anyway.Food scarcity, I learned, can haunt you.This month, as millions across the US have seen their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits (Snap) benefits lapse or be significantly reduced, I’ve been reflecting on the experience of both Carla and the many food-insecure families I spent time with while researching my book, How the Other Half Eats: The Untold Story of Food and Inequality in America. For most of these families, who lived extremely close to the bone, Snap was a lifeline. Far from supplemental, it was how they put food on the table, day after day, year after year.The food stamp fight signals an era of unprecedented cruelty in America | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreUnderstandably, much attention has focused on the immediate impacts for families of these critical benefits not being disbursed in time, creating immense uncertainty and concern about how they will make ends meet.But the longer-term consequences are just as devastating. Because even once benefits are restored, this experience will almost certainly leave trauma in its wake. The millions of parents and kids who get through this will, my research shows, never forget.Mounting evidence supports this, revealing how even brief disruptions to food access cast long shadows. For pregnant women, food insecurity increases the risk of premature delivery and having a baby with low birth weight and developmental delays. Early hunger can alter how infants’ bodies regulate stress and store energy, raising the likelihood of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension later in life.For older children, the consequences are similarly physical and psychological. Kids who grow up with food insecurity are more likely to struggle in school and experience developmental delays, and theyface higher rates of anxiety, depression, and behavioral challenges that can persist into adulthood.And the toll doesn’t end with children. For parents, having to struggle to perform the most basic, primal act of care – feeding a child – is crushing. Caregivers facing hunger report sharply higher rates of depression and anxiety. And, in my research, I’ve seen first-hand how these experiences reshape families’ relationships with food for years to come. The mothers in my book who endured deprivation – whether in childhood or parenthood – never outran it.Indeed, the experience of not having enough to feed themselves or their children shaped how mothers approached feeding even during periods of relative stability. The mothers I met hoarded cans of beans and soup into cupboards as deep as the eye could see and bought extra freezers to store pounds of frozen meat. That’s because they had learned, often the hard way, that food today never guaranteed food tomorrow.These earlier experiences with scarcity also made mothers determined to never tuck their children into bed at night with growling stomachs. For these moms, their kids’ satiety became a key measure of maternal success.But I saw how a focus on children’s fullness often came at the expense of their nutrition. To ensure children would eat enough, food-insecure moms often worked to feed their children the foods they liked and would reliably eat, which were generally comforting, familiar and less healthy. Within a context of such precarity, the ability to prioritize nutrition became a luxury these moms simply couldn’t afford. But this meant that compared with wealthier families, lower-income kids often consumed fewer fresh foods at home.Reductions and delays in Snap benefits not only exacerbate hunger at the bottom, but may also deepen these nutritional divides. If food-insecure families already struggled to get healthy food on the table before, this crisis made it even harder – both in the immediate term, as budgets have shrunk, and now in the long term, as the experience of scarcity leaves lasting emotional and behavioral imprints.That’s why now, as the government reopens, restoring benefits immediately is essential.Yet this isn’t enough. We must also ensure that a funding freeze never happens again. One way to do that is for Congress to set up an advance appropriation – like it does with many other entitlement programs, including Medicaid – to ensure that Snap is never again at risk during a shutdown. Doing so would protect the nation’s most effective anti-hunger program and ensure that no parent has to wonder how they’ll feed their child because lawmakers failed to act.The sad truth is that for millions of families across the US, hunger will remain a daily reality even once Snap benefits are fully restored. But we must prevent this particular trauma from repeating itself in the future. If we do, we might spare the next generation from learning, as my foster sibling Carla did, that food today doesn’t always mean food tomorrow.Priya Fielding-Singh is the director of policy and programs at the Global Food Institute at the George Washington University and the author of How the Other Half Eats: The Untold Story of Food and Inequality in AmericaThis article was updated on 13 November 2025 to reflect the end of the US government shutdown.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025OpinionFoodUS federal government shutdownsUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

The question is not only what Epstein’s associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that hehad “no idea”about Epstein’s crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats’release of emailsin which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn’t barked”, adding that “[victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the lateVirginia Giuffre, who told lawyersthat “I don’t think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief –abruptly changed their mindsthis year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of theMaga far rightjoining Democrats.The Republicans took a drubbing inoff-year electionslast week, and Mr Trump’s approval rating isthe lowest of this term. Theending of the longest government shutdownin history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll’ssuccessful civil suitagainst him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) andtwo dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein’s circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it’s hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such asAndrew Mountbatten-Windsorand Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims anddogged reportingto make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Well then, you’re in luck, because that just about sums up the state of the housing market right now. Housing, particularly in places with a decent job market, has become increasingly unaffordable in the US. That’s partly thanks toquantitative easingduring the pandemic, which supercharged housing inflation. The median American home price in January was $418,000,about a 45%increase from $289,000 five years ago, per Redfin data. Wages haven’t gone up at the same rate, and housing prices compared to income have reached anall-time high.In post-pandemic America, there are three groups of people. First, there are those who own their home outright and those who bought a house before the pandemic, then refinanced during the historically low interest rates we saw in 2020 and 2021. Many of those homeowners are now sitting on large piles of equity.I was on New York’s rent board. Zohran Mamdani’s ideas aren’t pie in the sky | Leah GoodridgeRead moreThen you’ve got the people who bought their first home during the pandemic, with super-low interest rates. They’re not quite as fortunate as group one, but having a 30-year-mortgage that is under the rate of inflation (currently about 3%) means they are also in a very privileged position.Finally, you’ve got group three: people who are completely and utterly screwed. Unless you’re earning big bucks, have generous parents, or want to live in the middle of nowhere, good luck buying a first home right now. Indeed, nearly a quarter of millennials say they expect torent forever. Prices are historically high and mortgage rates, while still far lower than they have been in the past, are about 6.3%. The difference between buying a $500,000 home with a 6.3% mortgage v a 2.5% interest rate (which some lucky people got during the pandemic) is about $900 a month. And things will only get worse; Trump’s tariffs, including a50% tariff on steel,could raisethe cost ofbuildingand renovating a home.But don’t worry. You’re not going to have to rent a$700 sleeping pod(yes, these are a thing in San Francisco) for the rest of your life. Our great president is on it. Donald Trump has a plan – or perhaps more accurately, “concepts of a plan” – to fix housing affordability: 50-year mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director, Bill Pulte, who reportedlypromoted this genius ideato Trump, called the proposal “a completegamechanger”. You know what else is a complete gamechanger, Bill? Jumping in a pile of toxic waste.Even many of Trump’s allies are said to be aghast at the idea of a 50-year mortgage. This week, Politico reported that the White House was furious Pulte planted the idea in Trump’s head.Per Politico, “one of the two people familiar [with the situation] said there is more fallout from this idea than almost any other policy proposal of the second term, including from the MAGA base.” Another source told Politico: “During Trump 2.0, the last time anything got as much pushback as this was over the ‘Epstein Files’.”A year on from Trump’s victory, resistance is everywhere | Rebecca SolnitRead moreThe problem with a 50-year mortgage, to be clear, is that it does nothing to solve the root issues. Yes, you’ll have a lower monthly payment since the timeline is longer, but it’ll take you longer to build equity and you’ll paydoublethe amount of interest as someone with a 30-year mortgage, according to one analysis. Fifty-year mortgages could alsoincrease housing pricesin the long run by encouraging people to buy more expensive homes.If you’re reading this from somewhere that isn’t the US, even the idea of a 30-year mortgage might seem odd. The US is an outlier when it comes to mortgages. In most countries you can only get a fixed rate for a few years before it adjusts according to current interest rates.President Franklin D Roosevelt helped usher in 30-year mortgagesafter the Great Depression, when about 50% of mortgages, which were then only fixed for a short term, were in default. The Roosevelt administration wanted to ensure this didn’t happen again in the future by helping people become homeowners via more predictable repayment plans with reduced risk. Trump, it would seem, fancies himself another Roosevelt. Over the weekend he floated his new housing idea with aTruth Social posttitled “Great American Presidents”, which included the words “50-year mortgage” above a photo of himself and “30-year mortgage” over a photo of Roosevelt.Thirty-year mortgages have worked out very well for a lot of individual homeowners in the US. However,many experts believethey exacerbate inequality by creating a system of winners and losers. Lock in a low interest rate for 30 years and you are, to a large degree, insulated from many economic headwinds. If you’ve got a low interest rate, it’s also hard to give it up when rates are rising. That means people who might otherwise downsize will stay in place. Or they might rent out a house they would normally sell in order to keep their interest rate. Long-term fixed-rate loans help contribute to a frozen housing market, which helps erode housing affordability. A 50-year mortgage would make these issues even worse.Trump is threatening the basic needs of poor Americans. How low he has sunk | Robert ReichRead moreIt’s unclear whether the 50-year-mortgage idea will ever progress to more than just a social media post. However, the fact that we’re even discussing it says a lot about the short-term thinking that plagues modern politics. And it speaks volumes about Trump’s focus on flashy bandages rather than long-term solutions.You can see all the same issues, for example, in Trump’s recent plan to send Americans tariff rebate checks. “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trumpposted on Truth Socialon Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” Like 50-year mortgages, this would be a quick fix that might give people some immediate relief while exacerbating higher pricesin the long term. Trump has also brainstormedsending Americans money to help with health insurancerather than doing anything substantial to fix the US’s broken healthcare system. Turns out that electing a showman whose companies have filed forbankruptcies multiple timesmight not have been the best idea.Anyway, since hare-brained ideas seem to be all the rage in American politics right now, let me take the opportunity to introduce my own plan to increase housing affordability: we kick Trump out of the White House and we turn it into condos.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationHousingUS politicsUS mortgagescommentShareReuse this content"

Good luck with thatJudith LevineTwo problems stand in the way of the party’s efforts: their policies and their presidentThu 13 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 15.06 ESTShareTry as they might to presentZohran Mamdanias the exemplar of their opponents’ radical-left lunacy, the platform the New York mayor-elect and other Democrats won on was affordability – the same platform on which Trump ran, and has spectacularly failed to deliver.So in their panic,Republicansare scrambling to reclaim affordability.They have only two problems: their policies and their president.On 4 November, as soon as election results were in, the entrepreneur and erstwhile presidential wannabe Vivek Ramaswamy posted avideoon the lessons the party should learn. “Our side needs to focus on affordability. Make the American dream affordable,” he said. “Bring down costs. Electric costs, grocery costs, healthcare costs, and housing costs. And lay out how we’re gonna do it.”The next morning, JD Vance, the vice-president,weighed in, bucking up the losers in the administration’s usual fashion: denying reality and making excuses. “The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country.”Democrats should be taking the fight to Trump – the problem is, he’s got them battling each other | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreOther Republicans agreed on the political challenges the party faces, but were more honest about what it is, or is not, doing about affordability. During the shutdown, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a US representative from Georgia, railed against her colleagues for abandoning their constituents. In aninterviewon Real America’s Voice, she both denounced the Affordable Care Act and suggested that with no alternative in place, the GOP should not allow a lapse in the tax credits on health insurance premiums purchased through the ACA marketplace, which were enhanced during the pandemic.If “regular innocent Americans’ health insurance premiums double, they’re not gonna be able to pay their rent”, Greene said. “Food prices have gone up this year,” an economic slowdown looms, “and I pray to God not a recession”. She continued: “So this is extremely serious. And here’s where I’m upset: Republicans are doing nothing.”Nothing is what they intend to keep doing. In return for eight Democrats’ votes to end the shutdown, the Republican majority leader, John Thune, discussed taking up the healthcare question by mid-December – a week before Congress’s winter recess, which ends on 1 January, the day the credits lapse. In other words, they will lapse, and24.3 million ACA enrollees,three-quarters of whom live in red states, will see their premiums soar.In fact, the party is doing worse than nothing. Ramaswamy wants it to show how it will bring down electric, grocery, housing and healthcare costs. How’s that going?Electric costs: the low-income home energy assistance program (Liheap), which subsidizes the utility bills of low-income households, escaped the president’s axe. But the appropriation has always been drasticallyinadequate, and this year’s is still up in the air. Also, the program’sentire staff was firedin 2025’s purge of health and human services, so it couldtake weeksto restore subsidies now, just as winter approaches.Grocery costs: Trump’s tariffs are ballooning the prices of everything fromricetoHalloween candy. Agricultural labor shortages exacerbated bymass deportationhave boostedfruit and vegetable prices 15%this year, according to the agriculture analysis company Farmonaut.Housing costs: proposed new rules at the Department of Housing and Urban Development threaten the rental assistance of4 million low-income Americans, according to ProPublica. Meanwhile, potential funding cuts to a permanent housing program could drastically increasehomelessness.Healthcare costs: oh wait, didn’t the government just shut its doors for 42 days because the GOP refused to extend the tax credits that make healthcare affordable for millions?Besides policy, the Republicans’ other problem is their president. Before this month’s election, he was ranting nonstop on Truth Social about the cost of living.“VOTE REPUBLICAN for massive Energy Cost reductions, large scale Tax Cuts, and basic Common Sense! Under President Trump, ME, Gasoline will come down to approximately $2 a Gallon, very soon!”he postedon 2 November. “VOTE REPUBLICAN FOR A GREAT AND VERY AFFORDABLE LIFE.”He spent the day after the votecelebrating the anniversaryof his election and the prosperity he’s creating: “Our Economy is BOOMING, and Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal. Love to the American People!”But he’s evidently vexed. First heclaimedthat Republicans were not talking enough about affordability. Then he called it a Democratic “con job”. Then he flew into a snit: “I don’t want to hear about the affordability.” At anews conferencewith Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, after a contretemps with reporters over the cost of living, he pulled out the all-purpose culprit: “The reason I don’t want to talk about affordability is because everybody knows it is far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden,” he said, falsely.While alleging there is no affordability crisis, the president tosses out dumb ideas to address it: a $2,000tariff dividendto everybody except “high-income people”;50-year mortgages; direct payments to people to buy health services, instead of the“bad healthcare provided by Obamacare”. The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has been left toplay downsome proposals, telling ABC on Sunday that “we don’t have a formal proposal” on the healthcare payments and that the tariff dividend “could come in lots of forms” and “could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda”.The optics look bad. To force the Democrats to surrender on the ACA, the Trump administration moved to halt benefits to the 42 million recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), or food stamps; officials later allowed they would release half-payments. While food pantries stocked their shelves for the coming crisis, the president ate truffle dauphinoise and pan-seared scallops at a Great Gatsby-themedHalloween partyat Mar-a-Lago andposted photosof the renovated marble-clad Lincoln bathroom.And even as the shutdown appeared to be ending, the administration wasasking the supreme courtto stay a lower court’s order to distribute full Snap benefits immediately. Trump’s implicit message to the hungry and the sick – which might be summarized as “I’m starving you because the Democrats won’t let us take your healthcare away” – did not play well.Fortunately, the GOP has its gentle House speaker, Mike Johnson, to communicate from the party’s heart: “Any hardworking American in any place who has missed a paycheck; anyone who has been made to suffer because [of interruptions in] the health services you rely upon, or the food and nutrition supplement for your family,” hecooedinto the cameras last week. “Anyone who is hurting: you have a home in the Republican party.”Come home, America! The Republicans will give you a cardboard box to sleep in and a nice hot bowl of gruel.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Vanity may play a part, but there’s a more pragmatic – some might say sinister – reason.If you’re a multibillionaire, you might view democracy as a potential threat to your net worth. Control over a significant share of the dwindling number of media outlets would enable you to effectively hedge against democracy by suppressing criticism of you and other plutocrats, and discouraging any attempt to – for example – tax away your wealth.You also haveDonald Trumpto contend with. In his second term of office, Trump has brazenly and illegally used the power of the presidency to punish his enemies and reward those who lavish him with praise and profits.So perhaps it shouldn’t have been surprising that the editorial board of the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post defended the razing of the East Wing of the White House to build Trump his giant ballroom – without disclosing that Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon is a major corporate contributor to the ballroom’s funding. The Post’s editorial board also applauded Trump’s defense department’s decision to obtain a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors, but failed to mention Amazon’s stake in X-energy, a company that’s developing small nuclear reactors. And it criticized Washington DC’s refusal to accept self-driving cars without disclosing that Amazon’s self-driving car company was trying to get into the Washington DC market.These breaches are inexcusable.It’s much the same with the family of Larry Ellison, founder of the software firmOracleand the second-richest person in the world. Ellison is a longtime Trump donor who also, according to court records, participated in a phone call to discuss how his 2020 election defeat could be contested.In June 2025, Ellison and Oracle were co-sponsors of Trump’s military parade in Washington. At the time, Larry and his son David, founder of Skydance Media, were waiting for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve their $8bn merger with Paramount Global, owner ofCBSNews.In the run-up to the sale, some top brass at CBS News and its flagship 60 Minutes resigned, citing concerns over the network’s ability to maintain its editorial independence, and revealing pressure by Paramount to tamp down stories critical of Trump. No matter. Too much money was at stake.In July, Paramount paid $16m to settle Trump’s frivolous lawsuit against CBS and canceled The Late Show WithStephen Colbert, much to Trump’s delight. Three weeks after the settlement was announced, Trump loyalist Brendan Carr, chair of the FCC, approved the Ellisons’ deal, making David chief executive of the new media giant Paramount Skydance and giving him control of CBS News.In October, David made the anti-“woke” opinion journalist Bari Weiss the CBS News editor-in-chief, despite her lack of experience in either broadcasting or news. Earlier this month, it was revealed that CBS News heavily edited Trump’s latest 60 Minutes interview, cutting his boast that the network “paid me a lotta money”.I’m old enough to remember when CBS News would never have surrendered to a demagogic president. But that was when CBS News – the home of Edward R Murrow and Walter Cronkite – was independent of the rest of CBS, and when the top management of CBS had independent responsibilities to the American public.It is impossible to know the full extent to which criticism of Trump and his administration has been chilled by the media-owning billionaires, or what fawning coverage has been elicited.But what we do know is that billionaire media owners like Musk, Bezos, Ellison and Murdoch are businessmen first and foremost. Their highest goal is not to inform the public but to make money. They know Trump can wreak havoc on their businesses by imposing unfriendly FCC rulings, enforcing labor laws against them or denying them lucrative government contracts.And in an era when wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals who have bought up key media, with a thin-skinned president who is willing and able to violate laws and norms to punish or reward, there is a growing danger that the public will not be getting the truth it needs to function in this democracy.What to do about this?At the least, media outlets should inform their readers about any and all potential conflicts of interest, and media watchdogs and professional associations should ensure they do.A second suggestion (if and when the US has a saner government) is that anti-monopoly authorities not approve the purchase of a major media outlet by someone with extensive businesses that could pose conflicts of interest.Acquisition of a media company should be treated differently than the acquisition of, say, a company developing self-driving cars or one developing small nuclear reactors, because of the media’s central role in our democracy.A third suggestion is to read and support media such as the Guardian, which is not beholden to a wealthy owner or powerful advertiser and does not compromise its integrity to curry favor with the powerful.To the contrary, the Guardian aims to do what every great source of news and views should be doing, especially in these dark times: illuminate, enlighten and elucidate. This is why I avidly read each day’s edition and why I write a column for it.As the Washington Post’s slogan still says, democracy dies in darkness. Today, darkness is closing in because a demagogue sits in the Oval Office and so much of the US’s wealth and media ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few people easily manipulated by that demagogue.We must fight to get our democracy back.Supporting the Guardianis one good place to begin.You can support the Guardian’s year-end appeal here.All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution – even a small monthly amount – is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead.

When Tony Abbott’s governmentabolished the Climate Commissionin 2013, I knew it was a political act of climate vandalism. Abbott simply didn’t want to hear the facts: that pollution fromcoal, oil and gas were cooking our planet.For a decade after, denial evolved: from shouting that global heating wasn’t real, to claiming it could be solved later.While the LNP wallows in denial, the Albanese government is rewriting Australia’s most important environment law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It’s critical that the PM doesn’t try to cut deals on this law with the same climate deniers who dismantled Australia’s climate ambition last time.The last few weeks we’ve seen on display a Liberal National Coalition dominated by climate vandals, repulsed by renewables and trapped in a toxic relationship with expensive, polluting coal and gas. For years they have pretended that denial is debate. Now the Liberal party has openlyabandoned net zero emissions by 2050altogether, essentially saying let climate disasters rip, and to hell with our kids. It is the same approach that tore down a carbon price, dismantled the Climate Commission and wasted a decade in which we could have been getting a head start on building Australian jobs in renewables, electric vehicle batteries and green steel.Let’s be clear: there is no credible reason to scrap our net zero target. The Liberal party’s decision would be laughable if it were not such a callous act of recklessness. Reaching net zero by 2050 or before has the overwhelming support of scientists, economists, industry, energy experts and governments around the world motivated by indisputable evidence. A sweeping majority of Australians, alongside peak business and civil bodies, back the target. All that is left is the stubborn ideologues shouting at the tide as it floods their front door.2:17What does net zero emissions actually mean? And is it different to the Paris agreement? – videoTo hand such wreckers a say over the future of Australia’s environment laws would be madness. These are the same forces that unleashed a lost decade of climate inaction. The lesson from that period could not be clearer: when denialists set the terms, progress burns. That failure is only reinforced by the fossil fuel industry’s hold on our politics.For two years Labor has promised that this reform will be a once-in-a-generation fix to Australia’s broken nature laws. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced the sixth mass bleaching event in a decade, but the package will allow new coal and gas projects to be approved without any consideration of their climate impacts. Under the government’s plan, fossil fuel corporations would need to disclose only a fraction of their pollution and an unverified plan to reduce it, and even that information would not be used to influence a decision.The Albanese government has approved 32 new or expanded coal, oil and gas developments, includingthe North West Shelf expansion, Australia’s most polluting project in a decade. Together, these approvals will pump up to 12.8m tonnes of climate pollution into the atmosphere in Australia, making it harder for Australia to meet its own targets. The global impact is in the order of billions of tonnes of pollution.And 42 more projects are in the pipeline. Many would run well into the second half of this century, some even beyond 2100.Climate pollution is the biggest threat to our reefs, forests and wildlife. Any credible environment law must tackle it at its source. To claim the Safeguard Mechanism will sort it out later is folly. The Safeguard only applies after a project has been approved. It is like letting the arsonist start the fire, then hoping the firefighter can control it later. By then, the damage is under way.Climate-sceptic IPA refuses to reveal funders in fiery Senate inquiryRead moreWe cannot afford more delay. Every fraction of a degree of heating harms our environment – and all of us that rely on it. Every new tonne of pollution makes the task harder. Australia’s laws must ensure that high-polluting projects cannot be waved through.There is a better path. The government can still implement credible reform that increases protection for climate and nature, and without the now rejected ‘climate trigger’. That means three simple things. First, require all projects to fully disclose their climate pollution, including the emissions when fossil fuels are burned overseas. Second, make sure this information is independently assessed and used in decision-making. And third, allow the environment minister to put limits on projects that are incompatible with Australia’s climate targets, policies and international commitments.Canada requires analysis of both direct and downstream emissions. The EU and the UK have similar standards. Last year, the UK supreme court ruled that ignoring the climate impact of new fossil fuel projects was unlawful. Australia is on the frontline of climate damage. We must not be shirkers.When I look back on 2013, what stands out is not just that the Climate Commission was scrapped, but that the science was ignored. A decade later, the same political forces that tore down that work are trying to drag us backwards again. If the government cuts a deal with them, it risks repeating the mistakes of the Abbott era, sacrificing truth for expedience and progress for politics.Australia has a choice. We can keep approving new coal and gas projects that push us further from safety, or we can finally pass a law that protects our magnificent environment, creatures and people.Prof Tim Flannery is a climate councillorExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionAustralian politicsFossil fuelsLabor partyAnthony AlbaneseGreenhouse gas emissionscommentShareReuse this content"

This feels like a government losing touch and escaping from dismal circumstances in the real world. The ricochets damaged the PM and Morgan McSweeney, whoever organised these orchestrated briefings. If the briefers are not “found” and fired, No 10 looks either weak or guilty.The health secretary shrugged it off with wit and agility in a host of interviews and left for Manchester to speak to the NHS Providers conference. There, he addressed grim-faced managers confronting the hardest of times. Resident (formerly junior) doctors go out on a five-day strike from 7am on Friday. Their timing aims at maximum disruption in what will be “one of thetoughest wintersour staff have ever faced” according to NHS England’s CEO, Jim Mackey. An exceptionally virulent flu strain has arrived early, with cases already several times higher than normal. Last month, flu hospitalisations were up74% week-on-week.The latestNHS figuresout this week show that in October 54,000 patients waited more than 12 hours for a bed in emergency departments, nearly 10% more than the same month last year. With the elective waiting list now at 7.39 million,Health Foundation analysishas suggested that on current trends, the government will fall just short of its headline pledge to restore the 18-week elective care standard by the end of this parliament. In the 49 days of strikes over the last two years,1.5m appointmentswere rescheduled across England.In their ballot, covering both their July action and this week’s, 90% of doctors voted in favour of striking, on a55% turnout. No one, including the health secretary, doubts they have deep grievances about their working lives in a system that damages the NHS and detaches young doctors from the hospitals where they briefly work. After hard student years, leading to debts of up to £100,000, they have to rotate between different specialist training posts around the country, never a part of the team where they work, always anxious about their next rapid placement, treated roughly, often goingwithout hot meals, chairs, beds or holidays.But Streeting has set about improvements. He has pledged toease the bottleneck by giving UK-trained doctors first choice of training places. The BMA resident doctors committee says some30,000 doctors apply for 10,000 places. But Streeting’s office says that now only 8% of UK-trained doctors who apply for a post fail to get one. That’s eight percentage points too many, but they’ve been promised that further reforms are on the way.Their pay claim is greeted with a lot less sympathy. As soon as he was appointed, Streeting settled generously with a22.3% riseover two years and anabove-inflation average of 5.4%this year, making an average increase of 28.9% across three years. The doctors got by far the most; nurses, midwives and physiotherapistsare offered 3.6%. The doctors ultimately wantanother 29%, to restore their pay to where it once was before the bankers’ crash. There is dispute over which measure of inflation should be used in the calculations, RPI or CPI, but either way the entire public sector has has had its pay ruinously diminished since 2008. Paul Nowak of the TUC says thatreal wages would be£217 a week morehad they kept rising at pre-2008 rates.The doctors have done better than others, which is why Streeting can’t and won’t give in. He’s no headbanger wanting to prove his worth fighting with unions; on the contrary, he has been eager to settle with them but has been snubbed by the BMA’s ungracious haste to strike. The committee hasrefused his requestto meet them.Under the Tory government, the public backed the striking doctors. Polls have nowswung the other way, with 51% against and 40% in support. Even so, 40% is still quite high, considering the widespread anxiety about waiting lists. But 51% currently say doctors shouldnever be allowed to strike, a contrast with attitudes to nurses,where 53% saythey should be permitted. But there is no general turning against trade unionism: attitudes towards trade unionsremain positive, by 33% to 28% negative.Slipping support for resident doctors may come fromhearing more about their pay, at £38,000 for beginners, rising to £109,000 as a first-year fully trained consultant, which reaches £145,000, with bonuses for some and private practice for others. Given these hard times, the cost of living and stagnant pay for most, these are not the most obvious candidates for public sympathy.I couldn’t find anyone to talk on the record, but I spoke to resident doctor “Martin” on Thursday between busy clinics. He will not be striking. He says he knows others who won’t either, because they’re worried about patient safety. He does think those starting out in training posts are badly treated, but that hospitals are now hurrying to improve conditions. Pay, he says, is less of an issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now Labour is paying the priceThu 13 Nov 2025 12.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareWes Streeting was always meant to be their Labour prime minister. The plan, hatched by a tiny clique of rightwing faction fighters, was this: find a candidate on whom they could fake a continuation Corbynism project to win the leadership. Then kick the ladder away from the people who backed them and the promises they made. At the next general election, given the scale of the Tory majority after 2019, get Labour back in the ring with more MPs and then hand over to Streeting. The real grownups would then be in charge and the subsequent election would be secured.But no one reckoned with Covid, Tory turmoil and thecollapse of the SNP. Suddenly Keir Starmer wasn’t going to just lead Labour to a better defeat and a springboard for victory next time. Against the odds, he was going to win. Just as Jeremy Corbyn was Labour’s accidental leader in 2015, Starmer was the party’s accidental prime minister in 2024.It was not a marriage made in heaven. Starmer and the Blairites made awkward bedfellows. Under their breath, the Blairites despised Starmer because he had aligned himself with the Corbyn project. While Streeting and Rachel Reeves stayed firmly on the outside, right up until the protracted Brexit negotiations that began in 2018, Starmer had remained loyal to the party leader, whom the Blairites loathed even more than him. But they needed Starmer as the only person who could break the grip of Corbynism precisely because he had promoted it. What the membership wanted was a professional version of Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer was the man. But it was only meant to be a temporary deal.Having worked closely withLabourTogether while it pretended to do what it said on the tin, and been courted to support the Starmer leadership bid, I reluctantly concluded early on that this project was doomed.It was always going to unravel, and not just because of the shotgun marriage. Neither Starmer nor the Blairites had done their intellectual homework. There was no vision on why they wanted to win and how they would govern. They just arrogantly assumed thatthey would be good at it. Add into the mix the hyper-factionalism that enabled them to secure total control of the party once they had the patronage of the leadership, and we now have a government with no breadth, no depth and none of the constructive challenge that any administration needs to manage the complexities of the polycrisis faced in office.The same coercive discipline the Blairites imposed on the party was deployed for the general election. But the Tory meltdown and the split vote on the right with Reform meant victory was already in the bag. They didn’t need to make the “cast iron pledges” on tax that are nowcoming back to haunt them. Starmer won the 2024 election by default. The project was already doomed.Despite a169 seat majority, Labour is finding it impossible to govern, because it has no vision of where it is taking the country and no ability to deliver on it even if it did. Because successful governments today don’t just rely on majorities at the top, but support, participation and advocacy throughout the country. A better future can only be negotiated, not imposed.Now the vultures are circling Starmer. He is weak and getting weaker. His self-proclaimed denial of anything that could be called Starmerism means there are few if any troops to defend him because there is nothing to defend him for.Maybe, in a sliding doors moment, the “true” path of history will out and Streeting, as it was always meant to be, will wear the crown? As they run around inpre-budget panic mode, Labour MPs need to stop and think, not just about changing the party leader but about changing the party’s whole policy and cultural direction. Nothing less will do. What economic policy will in time deliver the right kind of shared growth? How is the state to be rewired to pass power and resource down and out to the whole of the country? And how is the hyper-factionalism of the party to be ended and a positive culture of pluralism instilled that makes Labour more agile and resilient?Labour’s crisis is not a temporary blip. It is structural and fundamental. As things stand, recovery looks unlikely and the party could follow the same fate as its counterparts in France, who went from government to the margins almost overnight.Any potential new leader who helped get the party into this mess will not, no matter how much they “red wash” themselves, get the party out of it. Candidates who will say anything to win and mean none of it just dig a deeper hole for the left. In the absence of a shared vision and values, they’re just pumped-up personalities who will fight like cats in a sack to come out on top. There is no loyalty to each other because there is nothing to be loyal to, other than self-belief. They have all the cunning, skills and cynicism to make it to the top of the greasy pole, but none of the awareness, the boldness or the humility to lead Labour or the country to a better place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is painful to watch. In difficult times like these, it is important to try to find silver linings.For me, the brightest of these linings shines from Elon Musk, who is one of the worst contributors to today’s “world vibe”. He hasan unbelievable amount of money, and therefore power. He has the president’s bandaged ear. He bought Twitter, made it horrible and now spends a concerning amount of time on there, like a guy who brought alcohol for the party so you have to let him hang out.It’s annoying for such a derpy dweeb (scientific name) to have this much power but there is one thing that soothes my bitter heart. It’s that I know for a fact that Musk will never feel truly satisfied. Because no matter how much money he has, how many people he buys to do what he wants, how many bootlickers he keeps around – he will never, ever be funny.What Musk really wants his billions can’t buy: being able to get a true laugh. Here is a clip I saw of him trying to tell a joke on Joe Rogan’s show.The only silver lining in all this is that Elon desperately wants to be funny and have people laugh at his jokes and being funny is one thing you simply cannot buy even if disgusting sycophants like joe Rogan pretendpic.twitter.com/4V1BHxPxs0— Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch)November 3, 2025Watching it gave me the same feeling as watching a visceral horror film, or a cringe comedy that makes you want to depart from your own skin. If you can’t watch the clip (and I wouldn’t blame you), the setup is about two economists. One pays the other $100 to eat a pile of shit, then the other one pays the first one $100 to eat another pile of shit.Then they said, look, wait a second. We both just ate a pile of shit and we don’t have any more extra money. We both just gave the $100 back to me and we both ate a pile of shit. This doesn’t make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy, because that’s $200 in the economy, basically, eating shit would count as a job.I am generally against comparing a joke spoken out loud with a joke written down, because so much is in the delivery. In this case, it’s doing him a favour. Those words come from the mouth of a man who can’t even say the word “shit” – coughing and stumbling over it like a child who knows it’s naughty – on his way to ruining the punchline because he can’t remember it. Whoever came up with this joke (because you know it was not Musk) should sue for butchery. He chuckles the entire time, to mostly complete silence, until at some point Rogan forces out a laugh, like a custom-made sycophant doll who pushes out air if you squeeze him hard enough.What do you need to do to ‘earn’ a trillion dollars in this economy? | First Dog on the MoonRead moreThis is emblematic of Musk’s comedic stylings. He wants to be charming and engaging but he is simply incapable of it. Even when he stands next to Donald Trump, he comes off as a black hole of charm.The people who willingly listen to Musk telling a story all have ulterior motives. If you took away his money, we all know (including Musk himself) that most people would run from him so fast they’d leave human-shaped holes in the walls.Musk isn’t self-aware enough to become funny, he isn’t self-aware enough to put his ego away and figure out how to endear himself to us – but he isself-aware enough to know that nobody is genuinely laughing at his jokes.There are many different ways to be funny and fun to be around. Musk has dodged every one. It’s not just that he is one of the worst joke deliverers to have ever existed – maybe he’ll find someone worse in space! It’s not awkwardness; some of the funniest and most charming people I know are awkward.Nathan Fielderis one of our best comedians.Musk is not (just) awkward – he seems empty. Being funny generally requires being engaged in the world. It requires thinking about others, what they will relate to. It requires having empathy, being open and expanding your point of view.Joyce Carol Oatesjust eviscerated him on this score on X.So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates— scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s…https://t.co/xMxQGSVqEt— Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates)November 8, 2025He reacted predictably, calling Oates mean and wrong, and then going to comment “great movie” on several tweets about films. He felt insecure about what she said because he knows it’s true. He has no curiosity about the world outside himself – yet he is still desperate for validation.Of course, even if you are funny, not everyone will find you so. But for Musk, it’s literally nobody. He might build himself a computer wife or an AI robot who is almost indistinguishable from a real person, and set her to SITCOM LAUGH TRACK mode, but deep down he will know it’s not real. To save face, to try to brush it off – he doubles down. He will post rolling laughing emojis and pretend he doesn’t care what people think.But I think he cares more than most people on Earth (and also in space, if he goes into space). He has access to everything he wants, he can buy the internet and the president. But, no matter how powerful he gets, he can never have this. That’s the silver lining for me. He can’t deliver the punchline because he is the joke.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionComedyJoe RoganJoyce Carol OatesXcommentShareReuse this content"

But spend any time among the young people in these places, and you’ll notice an unmistakable similarity: a generation alienated from mainstream parties, with a vocal minority who find Reform’s message appealing.Despite differences in demographics, young people in both areas are politically apathetic on the left as well as the right. At the University of Bath, the Conservative Associationhas welcomed Reform sympathisersbut remains tiny. Far more students support the Left Union, but it still finds it difficult to channel that support into organised struggle. At Your Party meetings in both locations, meanwhile, turnout from young people is sparse.It’s not that young people are flocking to Reform, but that parliamentary politics itself feels exhausted. Whether it’s the cost of rent in Bath or the scarcity of permanent work on the Isle of Wight, people see problems piling up and Westminster seems increasingly ineffective at resolving them. For some, Reform offers a narrative of rebellion, a way for people to vocalise their frustration, even if its targets are misplaced. But for most, disengagement is the name of the game. This isn’t to say that political energy has disappeared altogether. For example, local debates and campaigns around public transportation – ferries on the Island and buses in Bath – draw intense passion, including from young people. What’s dying isn’t politics per se, but faith in a parliamentary system that feels detached from people’s actual lives.The answer won’t come from rebranding the same parties or lamenting extremism. We must rebuild politics where people are already fighting: in workplaces, universities and community campaigns. These are the spaces filled with potential, where we can organise together to improve our conditions. This won’t reach everyone – some will remain drawn to Reform’s simplistic answers – but it offers the only credible alternative: a politics rooted in solidarity rather than scapegoating.Enough theory! It’s time for the left to tell a compelling storyTalia WoodinTalia Woodin, 26, is an environmental activist based in north-east LondonHow can we convince people to change their minds about political and social issues? In the years I’ve spent campaigning, I’ve realised that the most effective strategy is storytelling. A compelling narrative is often the best way of encouraging people to look anew at an issue, or of winning them round to your way of seeing the world. Terrifyingly, the far right often does this most effectively.Its straightforward and digestible narrative cuts through because it speaks directly to feelings of neglect and disenfranchisement that are particularly widespread among young people. Its messaging offers apparent solutions that don’t require a deep understanding of political theory to grasp. Meanwhile, the left gets tangled up in internal debates and abstract theories of change, losing sight of the need to meet people where they are – recognising their immediate material and emotional realities, and building up from there.True change emerges from the ground up. We only need look at the recent controversies around Your Party to illustrate how party politics more often than not leads to disappointment. Even so, the remarkable recent performance of the Green party highlights the power of narrative. Zack Polanski has reached people through his simplicity and sincerity. In a recent interview with Channel 4, Polanski stated: “Nigel Farage is a one-man show, if I’m a one-man show I’ve absolutely failed as a leader.” It was the perfect encapsulation of what politics should be about – a statement about representation and participation that was almost impossible to refute from any end of the political spectrum.In today’s climate of increasing social and economic instability, reimagining what it means to be British could be a starting point for challenging the divisive and persecutory language of Reform and the hard right. A video released by the Trades Union Congress last weekthat highlighted a workplace friendshipbetween third-generation Irish and first-generation Pakistani colleagues was an effective example of this. By telling these sorts of stories, we can begin to replace fear and exclusion with empathy, connection and a shared sense of belonging.We must be proactive in exposing Reform’s failuresMaebh CareyMaebh Carey, 19 and based in Gateshead, is an organiser for the Youth Equality CoalitionFor the past five months, I’ve been working with the Youth Equality Coalition (YEC), which unites leftwing young people against far-right activism. We put young people in contact with one another and help them organise demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine and asylum seekers, and we’ve been removing flags that were put up by the campaign group “Operation Raise the Colours”.Much of the anger we see in modern Britain stems from a sense of isolation. Cuts to youth clubs and the more recent effects of the cost of living crisis have robbed young people of the opportunity to socialise, feeding into a collective sense of apathy about politics. Given how fragile the social fabric feels in Britain, it’s no wonder that so many people are now retreating online, where conspiracies and far-right content flourish.Yet community-building alone isn’t enough. To stop the ascendancy of the hard right, it’s important to show the public what it would mean in government. The YEC has highlighted stories about the resentment synonymous with Reform, such asprotests against Durham county council, a Reform-led council that recentlyabandoned its climate pledges. As the hard right achieves power and subsequently flounders, reporting its ineptitude will allow voters to make informed electoral choices.Crucially – and this is where national politics comes in – it’s vital that we address the grievances that the right has so deftly exploited. Reform performs well in areas that areeconomically stagnantand oftendeindustrialised, and those voting for the party often see no solutions in mainstream politics. To counter its rise, our government should be properly funding public services, tackling the scourge of poverty and creating opportunities for young people in work and education. We all deserve better than the current status quo.Young people just don’t take Labour seriously any moreRohan SathyamoorthyRohan Sathyamoorthy, 20, is a student from south-west LondonThe recent news that Conservative student societies arestrugglingin the face of competition from Reform is just one sign of young people’s growing disillusionment with mainstream politics. Faced with sky-high rents, soaring tuition fees andcollapsing graduate job opportunities, is it any wonder that they are defecting from the UK’s formerly dominant parties?It’s worth remembering that this exodus is mostly to parties on the left. A recent YouGov poll of those aged 18-24 showed that 36% of young peoplewould vote for the Green partyin a general election, while only 8% would vote for Reform.Labour is just as much a victim of this growing disillusionment as the Conservatives. In some university campuses, left-leaning societies have replaced Labour Students: over the summer, the Manchester, Newcastle and Warwick Labour societies allsevered ties with the Labour party.This disaffection has been building for years, as mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions that tangibly improve young people’s prospects or quality of life. During the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris showed the world what happens when the establishment relies solely on chastising the right while offering little in the way of an alternative. A fatigue has set in among young people. We’ve been ignored and told that our demands – whether it’s a reduction in tuition fees, or political recognition of Israel’s genocidal crimes in Gaza – are too radical to be taken seriously. Only this month, for example, the liberal heroine Hillary Clinton said that students opposed to Israelwere “deeply misinformed”and falling for TikTok propaganda on behalf of the Chinese state.The resulting political vacuum will be filled by whoever dares to try. Ultimately, today’s young people reflect the political realities of a society in a state of terminal decline, and won’t be stopped by any amount of condemnation or intimidation from established institutions. As long as the status quo works against their interests, young people will keep looking for alternatives.Labour’s stale messaging ignores young people who need a futureXavi MesquitaXavi Mesquita, 20, is a student at the University of Edinburgh and a freelance writerReform has exploited the sense in which everything, from work to relationships, is now precarious. Ever since the pandemic, young people have been spending more time alone, scrolling endlessly through other people’s lives. Farage meets their alienation head-on. The Reform “doers and achievers” promise change for a stalled generation, while Farage rhapsodises about entrepreneurial ambition on TikTok feeds and self-help podcasts. He has positioned himself as the straight-talking champion of the left behind, strategically turning their alienation into a story of pride, grievance and aspiration.Labour’s leadership, by contrast, feels managerial and airless. Ministers speak of “missions”, “foundations” and “working people” – abstract platitudes remote enough to convince anyone under 30 that nothing ever really changes. Whether it’s red or blue in power, politics appears washed out. That’s not only a political problem, but a cultural one. “Politics is downstream from culture,” or so the Breitbart doctrine goes. If so, Labour must reclaim the zeitgeist in a way that it is failing to do. The far right is growing not because of policy suggestions, but because its story is simple, emotional and everywhere.Rather than condemn young people turning to populism, progressives should see hope in their desire for alternatives and build from it. That starts with visible investment – in social housing, youth services and spaces where community can exist. The adults may be back in charge, but early retirement looms unless they discover what it means to speak to a future, not just manage decline.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe panelReform UKLabourGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday morning, Wes Streeting was on the Today programme, trying to sound urbane, unflappable, but most of all, loyal to Keir Starmer – only to the most casual listener, however. When he said he hadn’t spoken to the prime minister, the implication was clear: if this briefing were done without Starmer’s sanction, then surely he would have contacted his health secretary, if only to blow off a bit of steam?What would happen, in such a challenge? Would Streeting reap the benefit of the rule change of 2021, in which a candidate would need 20% of the parliamentary party to nominate, rather than 10%? All the rumours back then were that this change was specifically designed to favour Streeting, by keeping mavericks, outliers, lefties – or, let’s give them their umbrella description, any MP the membership didn’t actively loathe – off the ballot. Would other candidates step aside, leaving Wes to waltz in? Would the voices that were subdued in 2020 come back in a cacophony of “Come on, guys, we cannot seriously have another leader who isn’t female, this is meant to be the party of equality”?It’s all utterly fascinating, except for the fact that it’s completely meaningless. If Streeting replaced Starmer tomorrow, he would have exactly the same problems by the end of the week: a fixation with process over project; an absence of any determinable values; and maybe not by Friday, certainly by Christmas, you would know him by the trail of broken promises.Starmer campaigned to be leader on an explicitly left ticket; he amplified his hinterland, as a friend to the striker, the protester, the activist, as a human rights lawyer; he portrayed himself as Jeremy Corbyn in a suit. It didn’t fool all the members, but it fooled enough, and the job was done. What has followed has stunned a lot of people, as this passionate believer in human rights defended Israel’s right to starve a population, as this doughty environmentalist suddenly couldn’t stand tree-huggers. But they were dumb to be stunned, because the message was clear from very early on in his victory; those leftwing elements of the party, far from being persuaded or even encouraged to be a little quieter, were insteadsidelined and expelled. I was self-recriminating (I backed Starmer) to a friend who also supported him, from within Momentum, recently – she said: “I refuse to live in a world where it’s my fault when people lie to me.” So there’s that.There’s plenty that is unknown about that 2020 period – whether or not the future prime minister chose Morgan McSweeney, or in fact it was the other way around. If he was the plaything ofLabourTogether, whose only legible project is to excise the party of anyone who doesn’t agree, without anyone knowing exactly what they’re supposed to be agreeing with, what was the plan? Was Starmer a placeholder, to do a bit of spring cleaning, lose the 2024 election, pitch-roll for the next guy? And was that next guy Streeting all along? Again, that was the chatter, and when the Tories themselves imploded and made Labour’s loveless landslide inevitable, everyone adjusted to the new normal. Starmer would be prime minister until a crisis meant that he wasn’t.Some of this was idle gossip, and some of this was real, and again, it fundamentally doesn’t matter: because Streeting is cut from the same cloth. He explicitly toldthis newspaper, in an interview with Simon Hattenstone, that that’s just the way it was, you feint left to win the membership, then you go full-steam ahead to the right, to gain the nation.It remains unclear, to what end? I struggle to believe it’s all personal ambition. But when you’re dealing with politicians who will happilyjettison their principleson command, the problem is twofold: obviously contradictions and U-turns destroy trust in politics; but more practically and immediately, it makes it flat impossible to predict what they’ll think next. How far will they go to meet Reform? Even if it’s only halfway, when Nigel Farage cares nothing for restraint, halfway to what?Labour won’t recover its purpose or its popularity with a shopping list of policies, still less a new leader with all the same faults as the last. It will only recover when it believes in something, and by then – I don’t say this apocalyptically, it is challenged by the Greens as well as Reform, of course – it may be too late.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What unites them is a desire for something differentWho supports Reform and why? The charts that show who favours Farage’s partyThu 13 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 07.50 ESTShareWho are Nigel Farage’s army, the voters who want him as our next prime minister? Few questions are as important in British politics. Were an election called tomorrow, the favourite for No 10 would be Farage, whose immigration policies are in some ways more extreme than those of the BNP were. His party’srole model for governmentwould be Donald Trump’s US: Elon Musk-style cuts to our public services and masked agents snatching families off the streets.A few months ago, many in Westminster and across the country would have considered this a cautionary nightmare, a catastrophe that would unfold if Keir Starmer failed. But in the week of another red-on-red assault and after 150 opinion polls in a row topped by Farage’sReform UK, it’s no longer a scare story. It’s the most likely prospect.And still the question of who actually supports Farage meets cliches and bluster. He is “a tribune of working-class rage against the elites”,claims Downing Street adviserMaurice Glasman, while the BBC’s Chris Masoncatches an “insurgency vibe”. An ex-City trader turned Brussels politico is now Merrie Englande incarnate, the teller of inconvenient truths from our bombed-out post-industrial heartlands. See our Nigel go hard-hatted into a steelworks! Watch him sink pints with ex-miners, or gambol along an Essex pier!That’s the sales pitch; the actual customers are vastly different. I can exclusively reveal here the results of the largest-ever survey of Reform voters: more than 11,000 people who would vote for Farage tomorrow, were the polling booths open. Yet far from a single bloc marching under one ideology, they form a large, diverse and fragile coalition.They stretch from Surrey to Sunderland, from affluent homes with mortgages long paid off to the hard-up. They disagree with each other and with Reform leaders. The results should be studied by anyone in politics, the unions and beyond wondering how to win back Reform voters and stop Farage from running Britain. A spoiler for those in Downing Street: waving flags won’t cut it.The analysis comes from Hope Not Hate, the respected anti-racist organisation, based on extensive recent polling by Focaldata as well as focus groups. The summary report is available now, and the Guardian analysis is based on extensive access to the background data and focus group responses. What did they find? Well for one, the “red wall” voters usually vox-popped by TV crews as the Farage faithful now make up a distinct minority of his supporters: only one in four of the Reform base. This is who analysts mean when they talk about Reform voters who go left on economics but right on social issues. They’re from towns, not cities, from the north and east of England, and very worried about getting poorer.Contrast them with another lot dubbed by Hope Not Hate “hardline Conservatives”. They’re about one in five of all Reform voters, often southern and well-to-do, and children of Thatcher. They clash with the first group on workers’ rights and wages and the NHS – and the tensions are growing.InfographicFarageism is a curious dish of microwaved Thatcherism, seasoned with a big dash of old Labour. He’s about slashing taxes and partially re-nationalising water, more manufacturing as well as plans to “bring crypto in from the cold”. It’s a mush of right and left economics, trying to glue together his disparate base. When heboasted last weekabout forming the “most pro-business, pro-entrepreneurship government this country has seen”, he was speaking to his hardline Conservative voters. But as an election looms, and he has to cobble together an actual platform, he’ll have to pick a side.But what’s most striking is that most of the Farage vote – much more than half – is not nearly as ideological. Starmer, Boris Johnson and David Cameron have all let them down so badly that they’ve drifted into Reform’s arms.“The NHS waiting list is still awful … housing crisis not getting any better,” one focus group member says. “I just feel the country was in jeopardy … andLabourhasn’t done anything to get us back on our feet.”All party leaders are “a load of rubbish”, another focus group member says. “They just spout whatever to get in.”This is why Farage poses as the anti-politician – even though he’s spent 20 years as a professional politician in Brussels and Westminster, more than double than Starmer’s time.Yet even among his own voters, Farage is no saviour: he’s a last roll of the dice. Their very lukewarm support is suggested by the terms Hope Not Hate use for the other groups of Reform voters they identified: “reluctant reformers”, “squeezed stewards” and “contrarian youth”. Each is motivated by a distrust of mainstream politics, but otherwise have little in common. To top the ballots they need to get into power; the turquoise brigade can no longer be a single-issue party, blaming “darkies” for all that ails the UK. Reform voters are easily the most hostile to migrants and yet there are significant chunks for whom immigration isn’t the number one issue. What is? Well, there’s a reason why Reform’s campaign leaflets say cost of living is the party’s number one priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The single biggest group of Reform voters, “squeezed stewards”, are middle-income (though anxious about the cost of living)and really care about the environment, even if for them it means getting poo out of rivers rather than following the latest Cop summit.What this analysis of Reform voters shows you is not Farage’s strength, but the political mainstream’s weakness – in two areas above all. First, the majority of Reform’s base are people who have been failed by Thatcherism, even while backing a party leader who is a true believer in the Iron Lady.Even so, Reform voters’ hopes for fulfilled lives – owning their homes, not worrying about food and energy bills, retiring at a decent age while still healthy to enjoy it – have run aground on the UK’s economic model. Yet the government that promised “change’ has delivered no such thing. Starmer and Reeves now give as their main reason for keeping their jobs the stability of financial markets. What’s their offer? Vote Starmer for PM; get bond traders for your government. Britain deserves far better.Knowing he has to fend off Farage, Starmer has chosen to festoon himself with flags and to spout poisonous rubbish about an “island of strangers” and a “one-nation experiment in open borders”. He has not opposed racist politics; he has normalised it. And the preachers of racist politics are getting more strident and more influential. Last year, Farage opposed mass deportations. Twelve months of Tommy Robinson calling for it on the hard-right social media channel renamed X and Farage has adopted the policy against people who have already got all the proper paperwork to stay – while Starmer has promised his own crackdown on people applying to remain here. From the extremists’ lips to the voters’ ears within a year.Yet what’s the message of this vast, detailed study? So many Reform voters want an alternative; they stay with Farage because the other parties only offer more of the same.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The Italian government should be funding public servicesThu 13 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTShareAdozen or so times each day, as Italy’s southbound Intercity rail service arrives in the Calabrian town of Villa San Giovanni, the journey comes to a dramatic halt. The train is lifted from its tracks, carefully loaded on to the deck of a ferry, and secured in place. The entire cargo then eases out into the Strait of Messina en route to Sicily. Invariably, this 25-minute crossing becomes an impromptu community moment. Passengers abandon their carriages, flocking to the ship’s top-deck snack bar to share freshly fried arancini, trade anecdotes, and admire the vista towards Mount Etna’s distant peak, before returning to continue their journey by rail.For tourists and itinerant visitors like myself, the ferry crossing is a charming novelty. For local people, however, it has long been a defining part of their identity. In his 1941 novel, Conversations in Sicily, the writer Elio Vittorini describes a group of fruit pickers congregating on the boat’s deck, feasting on large chunks of local cheese and enjoying the view. As the narrator joins them, he is transported to “being a boy; feeling the wind devouring the sea”, while gazing out at “the ruins along the two coasts”, separated, poetically, across the water.Soon, though, this sentimental voyage may become a relic of the past. For the past few months, Italian officials have been in advanced talks to sign off ona new bridgeconnecting Sicily to the mainland. In August, the Italian governmentconfirmed it will invest€13.5bn and commission the Webuild Group to begin construction. If it is ever built, it will be the longest single-span bridge in the world.The Sicilians I know are sceptical. After all, this is not the first time the Messina Bridge has been mooted, only to be shelved. While plans for the crossing date back to Roman times, the modern saga truly began in the late 1960s, when successive Italian governments championed the project as crucial for tackling regional inequalities. For the original architects, the bridge offered an obvious solution to the glaring infrastructure gap between the industrial north and the agricultural south. By closing that space, they reasoned, Sicily could finally attract the kind of international investment that other parts of Italy had long enjoyed.But the bridge has never materialised. Over the decades, hurdles such asseismic viability, environmental concerns, and the pervasive risk of mafia fraud have repeatedly halted the plans, making it seem impossible. Even a few months ago, when the government announced its “final” approval, my Sicilian friends told me they’d believe it when they saw it. They were right. Last month, Italy’s court of auditorsblocked the projectdue to concerns about the legality of the financing, and at the time of writing, the project is frozen once again.In the meantime, an old public debate is re-emerging, which reveals a lot about Italian politics today. On one side are the pro-bridge advocates, who see the project as key to the future, pointing out that it would provide as many as120,000 new local jobs per yearand improve prospects for growth. On the other side are the protesters, from across the political spectrum, who dismiss pro-bridge advocates as nefarious opportunists concerned only with profit. For them, the bridge is synonymous with the shortsighted exploitation of the island.If you’ve ever been to Messina, you’ll know these vague ideological stances quickly rub up against reality. While the city’s life and culture are as exciting as anywhere on the island, Messina is unfortunately afflicted by some of the worst social problems in Italy. The local municipality is infamous for its financial mismanagement, characterised by mysterious losses of public funds and active criminal and civil court cases ongoing against various politicians, including two former mayors. Organised crime is prevalent, and cases of infrastructure-related fraud are already common among businesses, including those with interests in the Strait. Poverty is a huge problem. The health service is on its knees, and the school system is on the verge of collapse, suffering from some of theworst drop-out rates in the country.This reality makes the rhetoric of political proponents hard to swallow. Recently, Italy’s transport minister, Matteo Salvini,called the bridge“the most important public work in the world”, but he didn’t always feel this way. A decade ago, in fact, he was arguing the exact opposite. In a2016 TV interview, which is now being widely reshared online in Italy, he judged the bridge unfeasible from an engineering standpoint and argued that regular closures due to the notoriously strong winds would render it useless. Given the state of public services in Sicily, he argued, spending billions on such a project would be a waste of money, and it would be better to dedicate such limited funds to bolstering local services.Ironically, the very arguments Salvini made in 2016 have only gained greater relevance as the effects of the climate crisis intensify. Over my years of taking the ferry, I’ve witnessed first-hand how the annual wildfires are getting worse. I’ve made small talk with local farmers on the ferry’s top-deck bar, watching flames lick the sky, illuminating the charred hillsides. I’ve heard accounts of the fatal spring and summer of 2024, when the province of Messina experiencedits worst droughtin decades. Crops failed, livestock died. Reservoirs ran empty and aqueducts began to fail. In some areas, tap water failed to arrive for days on end.Webuild presents the Messina Bridge as a historic opportunity. Residents, though, don’t seem to see it that way, and a recent survey indicates70% are against the project. And you can see why: if you were living in a drought zone, would the prospect of having an estimated15-20% of your local water supply divertedtowards the project really seem like an opportunity? If you lived near the seafront, would you want years of noise, wildlife destruction and pollution, all for the eventual aim of a giant public work that is not guaranteed to benefit you? If you were one of the 4,000 people on either side of the Strait who would be forced to abandon their homes to demolition, would you be ready to pack your bags?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I, for one, hope he backs down. At a moment when the climate crisis is creating new emergencies and worsening an already dire economic situation, the bridge is simply not a priority. Sicilians are desperately in need of political investment in public services, of leaders who can inspire collective action to ensure government funds are properly spent. Until then, Sicilians remain defiant and continue to enjoy one of the world’s most spectacular ferry crossings: preferring conviviality and arancini to a costly steel panacea.Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in FlorenceExplore more on these topicsItalyOpinionConstruction industryPovertyInequalityMatteo SalviniEuropeSocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

It has all the right ingredients for a thriving, globally competitive green iron industry. In addition to low-cost energy, there is plentiful magnetite ore – ideal for making green iron.Combine these inputs with the available port and the existing skilled workforce, and you have perhaps the best location for making low-cost green iron in the world.The administration process for the Whyalla steelworks’ assets could be a defining choice about the future of Australia’s industrial production capability in a changing world. The opportunity to secure lasting prosperity, leveraging the natural advantages of the region, looms large. And that advantage is based in green production, not gas.While the administrator of the Whyalla steelworkshas given Bluescopea right of last refusal in the tender to run the facility – which in commercial terms is usually a licence to operate – this does not mean the amazing opportunity for Whyalla to be a green production facility is over.What went wrong at Whyalla steelworks and will it end with SA government in legal fight with UK billionaire?Read moreYes, Bluescope has been clear that it has no interest in green iron, even going so far as to say that green iron technology is not proven (which is clearly untrue); and yes, Bluescope’s status has deterred competing bidders who are seeking a green pathway.But the success of the Whyalla facility is in the hands of the commonwealth and South Australian governments. We will now discover whether or not they are committed to a green transition and the Future Made in Australia (FMIA) policy.In Februarythe South Australian government forced the Whyalla steelworks into administration and appointed advisory firm KordaMentha as administrator, given that creditors were owed over $1bn. Around that time the commonwealth and South Australian governments announced a joint rescue package of $2.4bn.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Whyalla steelworks is comprise mining (in particular magnetite ores), a blast furnace and a basic oxygen furnace to make crude steel, a downstream fabrication facility and a port to load and ship the product.The South Australia government has long talked of the state being a leading green iron centre and has backed this up with legislation and funding. The main focus of the commonwealth’s FMIA policy, meanwhile, is on the net zero transformation and on the policies and legislation to achieve this.These policies have often been said to ideally suit green iron; indeed, they were likely formulated with green iron in mind.The administrator’s choice is between a technology utilising gas – which can never be competitive in Australia – and one using green hydrogen that likely will be. Both technologies require significant initial government support; only green iron will get to the stage where this support is no longer needed as the world decarbonises.Why can’t using gas to make iron and steel be competitive in Australia? Gas on Australia’s east coast costs about $12 to $13 a gigajoule, or around four times that of prices in the Middle East and the US. High gas prices have seen Australia lose many industries that use gas as a feedstock.It is insanity to start a new industry which you know can never be profitable and which will always rely on continuing taxpayer support to subsidise high gas prices. Further, taxpayers would be subsidising more fossil fuel use into our economy when government policy is to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels.Then there is the question of timing. Using gas requires significant expansion of a small pipeline, which will cost many hundreds of millions and take considerable time. Wind and solar construction could be completed in the time it will take to construct the much larger pipeline.The Spencer Gulf, where Whyalla sits, has excellent solar and wind resources that will see some of the lowest-cost green electricity prices in the world. Backup can come from a connection to the grid, batteries – whose prices are continually falling – and low capital-cost, high operating-cost peaking gas – rarely needed but always available.Modelling by the Superpower Institute suggests the Whyalla region is well suited to making green iron and can produce at costs that are competitive with fossil fuel-made iron, especially once the environmental impacts of fossil fuels are factored in.It must be asked: if not now, when? And if not here, where?Rod Sims is the chair and Baethan Mullen is the CEO of the Superpower Institute.

Predominantly, that is, by Angelina Jolie, whose movie-stealing turn as one of Ryder’s fellow patients at a late-1960s US psychiatric hospital won her an Oscar. Don’t discount Goldberg’s contribution, though. Soothingly understated as Valerie, the chief nurse, she and fellow staff members, played by Vanessa Redgrave and Jeffrey Tambor, provide the emotional grounding over which their younger co-stars (also including Elisabeth Moss and Brittany Murphy) can soar.9. Made in America (1993)View image in fullscreenHate at first sight … with Ted Danson in Made in America.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarGoldberg is the owner of an African bookstore whose daughter (Nia Long) tracks down her sperm-donor father (Ted Danson). It’s hate at first sight for the parents, but antipathy turns to amorousness. Despite plenty of histrionics, and some regrettable slapstick involving a runaway elephant, Goldberg somehow clings to her dignity. There are bizarre moments, such as Danson gazing at a photograph of his daughter as a baby and saying softly to himself: “Funny thing, sperm.” Or Goldberg commanding him to “smell me” before they first lock lips. But the smooch itself is not to be sniffed at. Even in 1993, interracial romance was all but taboo in US cinema: a love scene between Goldberg and Sam Elliott was cut from Fatal Beauty only six years earlier.8. Boys on the Side (1995)View image in fullscreenBringing the goods … Goldberg with Drew Barrymore in Boys on the Side.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarA sugar-and-spice road movie, the former ingredient provided by director Herbert Ross (Steel Magnolias), the latter by screenwriter Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex). Goldberg plays Jane, a musician leaving New York after breaking up with her girlfriend, and hitting the road with Robin (Mary-Louise Parker), who has HIV, and Holly (Drew Barrymore), who is fleeing an abusive relationship. This is the 1990s, so Jane can’t simply be a lesbian: her sexuality must be mulled over by the straight characters. No matter: Goldberg brings the goods.7. The Long Walk Home (1990)This patronising film set in 1950s Alabama is part of Goldberg’s maids-and-housekeepers trilogy (see also: Clara’s Heart and Corrina, Corrina). But she gives a fine, subtle performance as the dutiful servant in a household whose matriarch (Sissy Spacek) is only just waking up to racial inequality. Behind the scenes, Goldberg successfully fought to keep footage of her character’s family in the final cut. On screen, she deploys stoicism brilliantly, especially when waiting on a white dinner party at which the guests are openly racist. “People have told me it’s a very restrained performance,” she later said. “It’s restrained because that’s what those women had to do. They were mad, but they had to work to support their families.”6. Monkeybone (2001)In the role of Death, stationed behind a desk in the purgatory-like Down Town where a hapless cartoonist (Brendan Fraser) finds himself stranded, Goldberg wears an eye patch, headgear that crosses a tricorn with a stovepipe hat, and a breast pocket overstuffed with pens. It is no impediment to her duties when her head explodes: she simply demands another one be taken from the shelf, Return to Oz-style, and screwed on to her neck. An unusually wacko project for Goldberg but just another day at the office for Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline.5. The Deep End of the Ocean (1999)Michelle Pfeiffer is the distraught mother whose three-year-old son has gone missing, Goldberg the tenacious detective who sticks with the case and becomes a family friend as the years tick by. Her most complex scene occurs early on, when she recoils suddenly from Pfeiffer’s affectionate display of gratitude, then offers an explanation: “Look, I’m Black, I’m a woman, I’m a detective supervisor, and I’m gay. Did you know that? So I always feel like the eyes of Texas are on me.”4. Sister Act (1992)View image in fullscreenNun so fine … as the singing Deloris in Sister Act.Photograph: Touchstone/AllstarMany of Goldberg’s roles have been castoffs from other actors: Jumpin’ Jack Flash was intended for Shelley Long, Burglar for Bruce Willis, while Fatal Beauty was rejected by Cher and Tina Turner. Even Sister Act only came her way after Bette Midler turned it down. But it became her second biggest hit, grossing $231m worldwide and spawning an inferior sequel and stage version. She plays Deloris, the singer causing havoc among the wimples when she hides out in a convent after witnessing a murder. Pluses include a lively soul soundtrack (My Guy is tweaked to My God) and her rapport with the British acting legend cast as Mother Superior. “You’reMaggie Smith!”Goldberg saidon the first day of shooting. “What are you doing in this fucking movie?”3. The Color Purple (1985)What a start: Goldberg’s Oscar-nominated movie debut, in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel about the woebegone lives of African American women in early 20th-century Georgia, could scarcely have been meatier. She had told Walker that she was willing to play any part, even if it was just “the dirt on the floor”, though she landed the lead role of Celie, the abused and exploited young woman who flickers to life in the company of the singer Shug (Margaret Avery), even if Spielberg goes light on the novel’s lesbianism. In fact, it is the director, tackling his first self-consciously grownup material, who feels like the tentative newcomer, while actual newbies such as Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey seem like seasoned pros. (The former has a cameo as a midwife in the 2023 version, which Winfrey produced.)2. The Player (1992)Robert Altman’s Hollywood satire, with Tim Robbins as Griffin Mill, the studio executive who murders a screenwriter, deploys its star wattage in stroboscopic fashion: A-listers including Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, Cher and Susan Sarandon appear as themselves, flashing past the camera almost subliminally. Goldberg is one of the few playing a character, and she is a riot. Her sceptical, unfazed Pasadena police detective is perpetually amused by the shifty Mill, and given to blithely swinging her tampon around in front of him. Goldberg’s casting alone is a way for Altman to subversively undermine the plot’s suspense, just as he later would by hiring Stephen Fry to play the ineffectual police inspector in Gosford Park.1. Ghost (1990)View image in fullscreenIrreverent … with Patrick Swayze in Ghost, the film for which she won an Oscar.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarThis was the film that won Goldberg an Oscar, making her only the second Black female performer to do so (Hattie McDaniel had been the first, half a century earlier in Gone With the Wind); the prize also put her on the path to Egot (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) status, which she finally achieved in 2002. But the role of Oda Mae Brown, the bogus medium who finds herself an unwitting conduit for the murdered Sam (Patrick Swayze) to communicate with his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), nearly passed her by. Auditions were already under way, with Tina Turner the clear favourite for the part, when Goldberg heard about this unlikely stew of thriller, comedy and love story, and wangled a meeting. The film’s screenwriter, Bruce Joel Rubin, was aghast: “Anybody but Whoopi,” he pleaded. Later, he ate his words: “I mistakenly thought she’d be too broad. But nobody in the movie is more perfect than her.” Indeed, Ghost would be dangerously earnest without her irreverence, vitality and nutty line readings, not least the translation of Sam’s warning into Oda Mae’s own vernacular: “Molly, you in danger, girl.”Explore more on these topicsRankedWhoopi GoldbergfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a sense, it was just the latest in a series of guest appearances on the Brat tour: a string of collaborators from the album and its ensuing remixes – Lorde, Billie Eilish, Troye Sivan and Addison Rae among them – had turned up at different shows to perform their parts live. But as well as contributing her verse to their remix of 360, Robyn also took centre stage, performing her peerless 2010 single Dancing on My Own. Released when at least some of Charli xcx’s audience were still in nappies, it didn’t sound remotely like a throwback even in the context of a gig based around one of 2024’s most acclaimed and agenda-setting pop albums: the star of the show’s willingness to cede the spotlight to her felt like evidence of Robyn’s influence over contemporary pop.You can see why the Swedish singer-songwriter carries so much clout among pop stars of the mid-2020s. When she opened an album with a track called Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do, she wasn’t joking: after launching as a 90s teen-pop star produced by Max Martin, she rejected the usual strictures placed on female pop – walking away from not one but two major label deals due to lack of artistic control – and seemed intent on following a more idiosyncratic, complex, messy path. She never saw being in the centre of mainstream pop as antithetical to making music with depth, or that touched on contentious issues. Despite the worldwide success of her debut, Robyn Is Here, her second album, My Truth, went unreleased outside Sweden because her US-based label baulked at Giving You Back, a song about an abortion she’d had in 1998: when asked to remove the song, Robyn refused.Robyn: Dopamine – videoGaining her independence, she went on to collaborate with both Sweden’s blue-chip pop factories and a succession of experimental electronic artists, the Knife and Röyksopp among them, at a time when blurring the boundary between mainstream pop and the musical left field was far from commonplace. A 46-year-old who released her first single in 1995, a year before the Spice Girls were launched, she seems to have more in common with pop artists half her age than with most of her peers.How Robyn transformed popRead moreSo you would say that her first solo release in seven years was arriving at an opportune moment, were it not for the fact that Robyn doesn’t seem to do anything in a particularly opportune way. Either way, Dopamine is a striking return. Its sound is jubilant and dancefloor-focused: a four-to-the-floor house kick drum accentuated by a relentless rhythmic vocal sample, chattering Giorgio Moroder-esque synths, Daft Punk-like robotic voices, euphoria-inducing bursts of arpeggiated electronics, a killer earworm chorus. It’s noticeably a more neon-hued than her reflective last album,2018’s Honey, but just beneath its bright exterior lurks something more complex.It’s a song ostensibly about the first rush of falling in love, but tempers its giddy enthusiasm with a weird hint of desperation (“I just need to know that I’m not alone”) a further dash of fatalism (“it’s going to be whatever and that’s cool”). There’s also a curious tension between trying to explain attraction away as something scientific – an excess of the titular chemical – and something more spiritual and intangible: “Something here’s opening deep inside of me / And I can finally feel it.” The lyric never quite declares its hand: you could read it as emotion triumphing over rationality, or you could equally read it as tempering a standard pop cliche with a stark realism. It’s complicated and messy: it’s also an unequivocal pop banger. Which of course, makes it very of the moment, but also makes it very Robyn.Explore more on these topicsRobynPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

His latest installation is literally an exhibition of 10 tons of old rope, accumulated by him over months, and left in towering mounds in this swanky gallery in London’s Mayfair. Most of it is marine rope, destined for landfill. It’s hard to recycle this stuff, it seems, and there’s an endless supply of it dumped around the world. So Shrigley scooped up as much of it as he could find, piled it up and put a massive price tag on it.The work can be yours for £1m. And that’s the point of the show: this is literally money for old rope. It’s not that deep – it’s just an idea taken to its logical conclusion, an idiom taken too far, a pun taken too literally.It’s obscene, ridiculous and funny. I want to pick it apart, untangle its conceptual threadsShrigley made his name with deadpan, easily intelligible, visual one-liners: simple paintings with simple phrases written across them, just a bunch of glum, self-deprecating but often funny non-sequiturs. And that’s exactly what this is, a non-sequitur, a joke with no punchline. Just an idea and a price tag.And it looks great! Largely because it looks pretty much like any other conceptual art installation. Piles of discarded rubbish have been a common sight in art galleries for decades, but this is the first one to do it quite so sarcastically and knowingly. It’s like Shrigley is gamely admitting that, well, this is all a bit stupid.View image in fullscreenSalvaged from climbing schools, tree surgeons, offshore wind farms and scaffolders … the new artwork.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThe issue here is that, at its root, this is art about the value of art, about what people are willing to pay for an idea, about which ideas have value and which don’t. But I don’t think the financial value of art is all that interesting. Who cares if someone wants to pay millions for adirty old bed, or alight going on and offor arotten banana taped to a wall? What rich people do with their money is about as relevant to me as what they have for breakfast.Making a snarky comment about the value of art in a gallery that’s struggling to survive financially (SFGannounced some pretty huge lossesearlier this year) does feel a bit awkward, too. It’s like Shrigley is saying: “You lot would buy any old crap, wouldn’t you?” Yet this is a gallery that’s having quite a hard time selling any old crap.Maurizio Cattelan, the artist now famed for making agolden toiletthat was stolen, made a similar point – in a more aesthetically impactful way – when he taped a banana to a wall at an art fair in 2019 and sold it for more money than anyone should ever spend on a banana. But that was then, when the art world was a lot more boomy. These days, when things are so much more cautious, I don’t think ideas about the financial value of art are as clearcut or obvious as they once were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I want to pick it apart, untangle its conceptual threads and prove that they don’t weave into anything sensible – butobviouslythey don’t. The conceptual threads are just a big pile, a mess. Part of me wants to go all lyrical and describe the colours and fabrics, the smell, the history implied in each strand, the narratives of the hands that once pulled these ropes and yadda yadda yadda.But I don’t think that’s the point.

Narges Rashidi and Joseph Fiennes reveal how they brought their nightmare to the small screenZoe WilliamsThu 13 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 05.04 ESTShareWhen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Iran in 2016, it wasn’t immediately obvious what had happened – but within 100 days, we had the contours of the story. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, held a press conference. He had amassed 780,000 signatures on a petition for her release, anddelivered a letter urging the same thing to former PM David Cameron. This, it transpired much later, was after murky meetings with the Foreign Office in which civil servants insisted that the best thing, both for Nazanin’s release and the safety of her parents and brother in Iran, was to lay low and let diplomacy take its course.“It was state hostage-taking,” says Joseph Fiennes, who plays Richard Ratcliffe in the BBC’s four-part dramaPrisoner 951. “It clearly goes on, and innocent people and families are completely disrupted and tarred for life. And now I’ve told this story, I look at anyone that might be accused of something, and I don’t quite believe it.”After six years, the UK announced that it would repay the £400m Chieftain tank money. She was released that dayBack in July 2016, it was plain that something had gone terribly wrong. A dual national, Nazanin was held in jail on spying charges, separated from her two-year-old daughter. She was accused of attempting to overthrow the Iranian regime, of working for MI6, “empowering women” (in one interrogation) and earning money illegally. It sounded fanciful. She worked for Thomson Reuters – not its news-gathering arm, rather its charitable foundation – and she had legitimate business in Iran, taking her daughter to see her parents.If the charge sheet sounded dodgy to an unschooled audience, it rang louder alarm bells still in the Iranian diaspora, as Narges Rashidi, who plays Nazanin and was born in Khorramabad in Iran (moving to Germany when she was seven) attests. “We were all very aware that there was no truth to the made-up reasons they said she was being held.”But the UK was fresh from Brexit, and the day after that letter went to Cameron, Theresa May took over as prime minister. The news agenda only had eyes for constitutional chaos, and Boris Johnson was suddenly foreign secretary, with dire results. Probably the most attention the Zaghari-Ratcliffes got in this period was whenJohnson made his egregious remarksthe following year, that she’d been “teaching people journalism, as I understand it”, which was untrue and gave heft to the Iranian state’s trumped up allegations, making her position even worse.For all the information and intermittent debate, which Richard Ratcliffe worked so hard to keep alive while Nazanin fought to maintain her will to live, the human reality of this kidnapping is utterly shocking to see brought to life in Prisoner 951. Rashidi, who was inGangs of London, sounds so much like Zaghari-Ratcliffe it’s uncanny. She says that’s all testament to her dialect coach: her real English-speaking accent is mid-Atlantic and she lives in LA.Rashidi watched everything: interviews with Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and the heartstopping but understated reunion with her daughter. There is also surprising footage available: somehow the moment of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s capture at the airport has made it online. “A little tiny bit of footage; she wasn’t aware that she was being filmed.”I now look at anyone who is accused of something and I don’t quite believe itIn the drama, she is on a tightrope, suspended between the confidence of her innocence and the uncertainty that, if you can be arrested over nothing, who knows where that ends? Knowing what we know now, that she would be in prison for six years, it is absolutely mortifying to see all this play out in the emotions on her face. Her battle not to overreact; her futile attempt to resist the chaos of arbitrary state power. “To me,” Rashidi says, “that is a very different Nazanin to six years later. I saw somebody extremely petrified and extremely soft, not knowing what is happening to her. I met her strength later, after this whole ordeal.”View image in fullscreen‘He was lied to’ … Joseph Fiennes as Richard Ratcliffe.Photograph: BBC/Dancing Ledge Productions/Rekha GartonFiennes “had the privilege of sitting with Richard”, he says. “You don’t always get that with the person you’re playing, and he’s a forensic accountant. The tenacity, where you get to the place of ‘Show me the bloody receipt’, is in his DNA.” That makes it a painful watch too, as this pretty establishment guy slowly and then swiftly loses his faith in the things he used to trust: experts, officials, the government, other establishment guys. “He felt the British government would have it in hand, but that wasn’t the case. He was just lied to, lied to and lied to.”Richard Ratcliffe went through five foreign secretaries during the period of his wife’s imprisonment: Johnson, Hunt, Raab, Truss and Cleverly. He and his wife would always be the last thing on the minister’s to-do list after they’d settled into the post, and by the time they examined the predicament, their tenure was up. In Prisoner 951, it takes Ratcliffe a while to see that “there’s a military industrial complex at play here,” Fiennes says, “and it’s not transparent. It lives beneath the government, and this is a family that got caught up with that.”View image in fullscreen‘Tenacity is in his DNA’…the real Richard Ratcliffe, on hunger strike in 2021.Photograph: Aaron Chown/PAThere’s a bit in which Ratcliffe storms into Cleverly’s office (he was then the minister of state for the Middle East and North Africa), “and just rants at him. He really does unravel. He’s unkempt. He’s onday 18 of a hunger strike, he’s at rock bottom. But it takes a lot for Richard to get to that place. He’s not liberated until he’s pushed to the brink.” Plainly, starvation was messing with his brain, but equally plainly it’s an incredible testament to his self-control that he didn’t lose it with any of the other four foreign secretaries.The Ratcliffes’ imposed separation, and the separation of both from their daughter, are agonisingly drawn in the drama. At one point Nazanin’s brother holds two mobile phones next to each other, one connected to her in prison, the other to Richard in London, so that they can speak to each other for the first time since her arrest. Their attempts to reassure one another, when both are so flattened by geopolitics, are excruciatingly moving. The original working title for Prisoner 951 was “Love Story”.“That certainly doesn’t reflect the pain and the horror that Nazanin went through,” Fiennes says. “It’s not really a love story. But then it is, in terms of the profound nature of love as a sort of salve, if you like, to survival. I’m thinking of Richard’s family, hugely supportive to him, and Nazanin and her family. Her love of her daughter, his love of his daughter, the love they have for each other – all these components, in the face of this horrific political situation, kept them alive.”Rashidi says she found “their bond as a couple extraordinary. To a point where, when I was reading it, I was saying to my husband [Christian Straka, a former German tennis pro], ‘You’d better fight for me this hard.’”View image in fullscreen‘They went through pain and horror’ … the Zaghari-Ratcliffes at the time of their reunion in 2022.Photograph: Victoria Jones/PAThe real reason for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s arrest was in the public domain all along. Richard Ratcliffe started saying it out loud as early as 2018. As described in the BBC documentary podcast Nazanin, the Shah of Iran had made a payment for 1,500 Chieftain tanks and other armoured vehicles in 1971, but the deal was cancelled when his regime fell. The British government wouldn’t refund the partial payment, citing sanctions. However in March 2022, Liz Truss announced thatthe United Kingdom would repay nearly £400mto Iran, and the same day, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was allowed to fly home.You can imagine another world in which this repayment had been negotiated within a week or a month. You can also imagine a world in which she’d stayed in prison for ever. “You wonder whether there are others who don’t have her visibility,” Fiennes says, “who don’t have her sense of confidence, and whose families are in Iran and can’t say anything. I imagine there are poor souls out there who are going through this and have spent decades in prison.”Fiennes has just finished filming another real-life role: Gareth Southgate, in a TV adaptation of the hugely successful play about the England football team,Dear England. Southgate and Richard Ratcliffe almost feel like bookends of heroism, defined by their tenacity and decency in the face of such different pressures. Fiennes also refers wryly to his stark performance as the monster patriarchFred Waterford in The Handmaid’s Tale: “That’s probably why I’ve gravitated towards Gareth and Richard. I think this is all part of a cleansing act that could go on for ever. I mean, it could conceivably take the rest of your career trying to wash that away.”“Growing up in the diaspora,” Rashidi says, “always comes with the guilt of having certain freedoms, and not having certain struggles that the Iranian people have. So every time I get the chance to shine a light on those struggles, humanise them, show the real people and their real emotions, that is a gift, and it is something that I feel obligated to do.”Prisoner 951 is on BBC One and iPlayer from 23 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeFactual TVDocumentaryJoseph FiennesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Set in a secure hospital in Birmingham – walled off from the rest of life – occupational therapist Naomi (Aimée Powell) starts hosting weekly Caribbean cooking classes. Believing in the meditative power of food, she hopes to engage the men with memories of home-cooked meals and maybe even provide a space for difficult conversations to flourish. But, with Ty, Leroy and Daniel’s simmering histories at play, the room can tip into conflict with one wrong step.Over the course of the sessions, the men’s pasts gradually become less hazy. The youngest, Ty (a witty, bravado-infused performance from Corey Weekes), is desperate to get out and return to prison. Leroy (David Webber) has been on the ward for what feels like for ever and fears leaving as much as he longs for freedom. The newest arrival, Daniel (Darrel Bailey), just wants to get fixed quick and reconnect with his family. Griffin holds back the details of the characters’ offences until just the right moment, letting us get to know them first. When we finally hear snippets of them, it feels like a punch to the skull.Big Ange review – divided Britain faced down by a dinner ladyRead moreThat’s because each of them is shaped into a figure of depth and substance, and Griffin’s play zooms in on what it’s actually like to exist in an environment like this. Banter and tension bubble between the group, and what seem like small things on the surface become monumental – such as the idea of cooking for loved ones on the unit’s friends-and-family day. There are some exceptional performances too, especially from Webber, whose voice wobbles and cracks as Leroy attempts to craft a letter to his estranged daughter.Breathwork is central to Corey Campbell’s direction, which sees the men reaching violently forward in movement sequences between the scenes. With sound composed by XANA, the potential for full-blown rage hangs thick in the air. We remain hungry to stay with the men at the play’s close, with the final scene feeling unresolved. But Griffin paints a vivid picture of a system in crisis. Driven by Naomi’s impossible battles with the people higher up and a desperate want for things to get better, it stings.AtBush theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Will it be as successful as in its heyday?Mark LawsonThu 13 Nov 2025 09.24 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Nov 2025 11.24 ESTShareIn March 1977, BBC One screened Spend, Spend, Spend, a single drama about a woman whose husband won the pools, a weekly competition to guess football scores. This week, Channel 5 will show Big Winners, a one-off play about the national lottery turning a couple into multimillionaires.The parallel, intentional or not, is appropriate. Jack Rosenthal’s Spend, Spend, Spend, which won a Bafta, was one of the standout successes of Play for Today, the prime-time drama strand that ran on the BBC’s main channel from 1970 to 1984. Big Winners, written by Martha Watson Allpress, is included in 5’s four-play revival of the Play for Today franchise.With only three channels available for watching (until the arrival of Channel 4 in 1982), the original BBC series reached many millions. It is often remembered as a slot for new TV writers and did develop several – including David Hare and Stephen Poliakoff – but also drew on established TV dramatists (Dennis Potter, Alan Plater), famous stage playwrights (John Osborne) and novelists (Fay Weldon, Ian McEwan, William Trevor). From its opening sample, the new run showcases newer writing talent.Under Ben Frow, its director of programming, 5 has taken to rebooting shows from the last century to court an older audience that the first four British terrestrial channels may be neglecting. Remakes include All Creatures Great and Small, Dalgliesh and Challenge Anneka. But while those revivals looked very similar to the originals, Play for Today’s relationship with its ancestor is more complicated. As well as Spend, Spend, Spend/Big Winners, each of the 2025 quartet has a twin in the earlier collection.View image in fullscreenA joy … Anita Dobson and Nigel Havers in Never Too Late.Photograph: Dan Fearon Designs/5/Vertigo FilmsThe four new dramas start on 13 November with Never Too Late, written by Simon Warne and Lydia Marchant, in which Anita Dobson plays a widow encountering flirtation in a rest home. It’s a more mature version of the plot of Colin Welland’s 1973 Play for Today, Kisses at Fifty. David Whitehouse’s new drama A Knock at the Door, which casts Alan Davies as a “national treasure” visited by a young, accusatory male, has a tense premise similar to Barrie Keeffe’s 1977 Gotcha ,in which a pupil locks his bully of a PE teacher in a cupboard and threatens to set him on fire. And Special Measures by Lee Thompson, with Jessica Plummer as a teacher juggling extreme pressures on the day of an Ofsted inspection, might be a grandchild of John Challen’s Headmaster (1974), in which a traditional head tries to adapt to a changing education system.If not a deliberate shadowing, these parallels most likely arose because any shortlist of mainstream viewer concerns, then and now, includes money, sex, violence and education. And there is a significant difference between yesterday’s Play for Today and today’s. The first version was politically ideological to the degree that rightwingers satirically called it “Plays for Trotskyists”. Several memorable editions – Jim Allen’s The Spongers (1978) and United Kingdom (1981), and Trevor Griffiths’ All Good Men (1974) and Country (1981) – were explicitly socialist critiques of British society.Admirers of the original series will crave plays about asylum seekers or a group of Tory voters who have defected to Reform. But the days of such narratives in peak-time TV are probably over. The four new plays focus on the well-heeled middle classes and feel essentially apolitical. That reflects a broader change in culture; political drama tends more towards even-handedness, as represented by the work of James Graham.View image in fullscreenCash grab! … Paul Copley and Sue Johnston in Big Winners.Photograph: Joel Pammenter & Karl Livingstone/5 Broadcasting/LA ProductionsTwo of the four new plays –Big Winners and Never Too Late – count women among their writers, a proportion that differs significantly from the original. Play for Today’s writers were predominantly male, although some women – Paula Milne, Julia Jones, Carol Bunyan, among others – made significant contributions when allowed.Another potential departure from the BBC series is the possibility that this is not focused solely on one-off plays. Certainly, the opener, Never Too Late, ends with a plot twist, moving the story to a new location, that could seed a six-part comedy-drama at the very least. And viewers might be lured to it, given the cast attached: Dobson, Nigel Havers and Tracy-Ann Oberman, the latter in a small role with potential to expand. Big Winners and Special Measures also have series potential, although they would bump into the memory of ITV’s At Home With the Braithwaites (2000-03) and the BBC’s Waterloo Road (2006-15, 21-present). Perhaps, though, Frow wants to add versions of those to his nostalgic roster of old hit shows.The original Plays for Today certainly featured a few shows that went on to have a longer life. Among the 300 or more instalments were John Mortimer’s story of a shabby barrister, Rumpole of the Bailey (1975); Alan Bleasdale’s story of Liverpudlian road-layers, The Black Stuff (1980), and his teenage drama Scully’s New Year’s Eve (1978); Philip Martin’s Gangsters (1975), featuring civil war between Brummie thugs; and Challen’s Headmaster, an early warning of Britain’s dangerous educational inequalities. All became series, with Rumpole running to seven seasons, although on ITV rather than the BBC.Curiously, two Plays for Today later became West End musicals: Spend, Spend, Spend and Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976), both by Rosenthal, a colossus of the slot who also wrote the poignant wartime piece The Evacuees. And the most revered Play for Today ever – Mike Leigh’s Abigail’s Party (1977) – started as a stage play, as did another Leigh contribution to the series, almost as popular: Nuts in May (1976).View image in fullscreenJuggling it all … Austin Haynes and Jessica Plummer in Special Measures.Photograph: Joel Pammenter & Karl Livingstone/5 Broadcasting Limited/LA ProductionsIf the aim is for the four new Plays for Today to remain as one-shot dramas, it would be daringly contrary to the prevailing TV culture. Streamers want “long content” to sustain subscriptions and feed multi-season box sets on websites. Even a four-parter, such as Adolescence, was considered worryingly short by Netflix until that quartet of episodes made such a spectacular impact.The original Play for Today was remarkable for its scale: 20 or so dramas a year for 14 years. Inevitably, with that volume, the “right to fail” – a popular concept in culture at the time – was frequently claimed. This was how TV worked in those times of financial and artistic freedom, and it was important: if each series producer had been asked in advance to pick the six from each annual 20 that were really good, plays now feted would never have been made, because hits are often unpredictable.View image in fullscreenMenacing … Nikki Amuka-Bird in A Knock at the Door.Photograph: Joseph Conway/Vertigo Films/Channel 5However, if Frow announced he was making 20 single plays in 2025 or 26, his bosses would send him to a doctor. The four we have are an impressive start: in particular, the acting and writing in Never Too Late are a joy, and A Knock at the Door has a menacing premise.Given 5’s positioning as 1980s TV in exile, it’s unsurprising that two of the main characters are octogenarians and two septuagenarians. This is demographically sensible and a commendable stand against ageism – although, if it persists, it may become a limitation. Cinematography is also frank about the realities of some older bodies. Davies in A Knock At The Door and Michael Fenton Stevens in Never Too Late boldly take their shirts off, camera angles sparing nothing, the latter scene leading to a lovely punchline.As long as not too many of the scripts are pilots in disguise, the revival of a strand that was once a symbol of British television drama’s ambition and confidence feels welcome.Play for Today: Never Too Late airs on Channel 5 on 13 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first half, prepping us for the gameshow, lacks tension, nonetheless. “We are just hours away from being mortal enemies,” Katniss says. But you don’t feel the dread.Arifa Akbar, the GuardianMia Carragher, daughter of ex-footballer Jamie, is an energetic central presence as Katniss Everdeen, the warrior who fights off rivals in the gory contest that’s the ratings equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing in Panem, the grim state ruled by a foppish elite. But the fact that she’s required to narrate much of the story while sprinting here and there is a distinct flaw.Clive Davis, the TimesPlaywright Conor McPherson and director Matthew Dunster have set this dystopian tale in a drab, delicately evoked version of Depression-era America, where the inhabitants of District 12 eke out a living amid coal-mining disasters and food shortages. A chorus of townsfolk sway like sun-bleached clothes on a washing line, powerless and adrift, in choreographer Charlotte Broom’s evocative movement sequences.Alice Saville, the IndependentIn the chrome-and-glass dystopia of Canary Wharf in east London, most of the money looks like it’s been blown on creating a hi-tech colosseum. Eight vertiginous banks of seating – some of which move during the performance – open out into a runway, or close in to form the killing fields … Martial arts, modern dance, and hand-to-hand combat are what drive the pageant, heightened by strobe lighting and nasty white noise.Patrick Marmion, Daily MailView image in fullscreenIndefatigable … Mia Carragher in The Hunger Games: On Stage.Photograph: Johan PerssonSet pieces rise up from beneath the arena-like stage, and props are lowered from above. Ian Dickinson’s sound design sends the flutter of birds’ wings around the auditorium, bringing us closer to the action; Kev McCurdy’s fight direction orchestrates gasp-worthy duels; and Chris Fisher’s illusions send arrows flying into the bullseye of their targets.Holly O’Mahoney, the StageDunster and McPherson’s unexciting production fails to reimagine and revitalise its source material. Moreover, they don’t critique the queasy subject matter. There’s simply never enough sense that we, the audience, are complicit in what we are seeing … Given that the story is about children killing each other in the name of TV entertainment, the failure properly to characterise the tributes themselves is almost a moral problem.Claire Allfree, the Telegraphskip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It turns out to be an AI-generated video created by Butters as revenge against his former crush, Red, who cruelly manipulated him in a recent episode by pretending to like him in exchange fora rare Labubu doll. After learning of the video, Red decides to fight fire with fire, making her own AI footage of Butters molesting beloved Studio Ghibli character Totoro.A South Park Halloween: latest episode destroys Trump over White House demolitionRead moreThis kicks off a war of attrition amongSouth ParkElementary’s student body, who use the Sora 2 OpenAI video generator – a real-life tool that allows users to create customised videos – to churn out videos of one another engaging in all manner of sexual and scatological behaviour with the likes of Popeye, Bluey and Droopy Dog (who poos in Kyle’s mouth). The adults of South Park can’t distinguish between AI and reality, so the town’s hapless police force think they have stumbled on a vast child sexual abuse ring.View image in fullscreenKids churning out sexual deepfakes starring Popeye and Bluey? It can only be South Park.Photograph: ParamountAs all this is happening, we catch up with Eric Cartman, last seen two episodes back being abducted by billionaire and antichrist expert Peter Thiel after undergoing some kind of demonic possession. Thiel’s plans for Cartman are still unclear, but in the meantime, he uses Sora 2 to throw Cartman’s worried mother off their trail, sending her AI videos of her son pretending to have a blast in the nation’s capital.Also in Washington DC, Donald Trump has uncovered the still-murky plot between Thiel and JD Vance to kill his forthcoming love child with Satan. The diminutive Vance convinces his boss that he was only acting in his best interests before seducing him. The president and vice-president then engage in a sensual bout of lovemaking inside the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom. The use of Trump and Vance’s actual faces in the throes of orgasm make for some of the most disturbing visuals in this or any season. It is gut-bustlingly funny and stomach-churningly gross.(The real Vance has tried to play the good sport about the show’s caricaturing him over the past few months, but it is doubtful that he’ll approve of this latest development.)View image in fullscreenGetting peed on by Santa? … Red rages at the AI revenge video about her.Photograph: ParamountThe episode’s threads converge when the South Park detectives trace one of the Cartman deepfakes to Thiel’s hideout. They arrest Thiel and rescue Cartman, who berates his mother about falling for the deepfakes. Searching Thiel’s laptop, the police uncover illegal surveillance footage from inside the White House of Trump and Vance’s sexual tryst. The public release of this footage initially causes the team at Fox News (who have been as constant a target this season as the president and his inner circle) to freak out, before Trump succeeds in convincing them, as well as a sceptical Satan, that the footage is – what else? – an AI fake.It is only fitting that this episode, which features damning proof of Trump’s sexual misconduct and connections to widespread child sexual abuse in the world of South Park, would come out the same day that Congress released thousands of pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including several emails in which he states outright that Trumpknew about “the girls”and had a lengthy engagement in the company of one of the victims. This wasn’t necessarily planned – South Park’s last-second production schedule is good, but it’s notthatgood.Meanwhile, the latest episode, Sora Not Sorry, can be read as a mea culpa from series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who have a personal stake in and history with its subject matter. In 2020, the duo founded Deep Voodoo LLC, a production studio powered by deepfake technology. So far, their output has been limited to oneKendrick Lamar music videoand a series of web shorts released during the pandemic calledSassy Justicewhich revolved around a news reporter who bore a striking resemblance to none other than Donald Trump.The first episode of this season of South Park – or last season, since Stone and Parker decided to split up this 10-episode run as part of a meta “six-seven” gag – ended with what many viewers thought was a fully AI-generated scene of a naked Trump wandering the desert. It turns out said scene was mostly real footage, with deepfake tech being applied only to the human actor’s face.This has all come full circle now, as this episode not only condemns AI for degrading other people’s’ hard work (as one Studio Ghibli representative angrily proclaims: “[We] make Totoro with pencil and paint, not by typing sentence on stupid Sora app”), but also sounds the alarm for how this ever-evolving tech can and will be used to trick people into believing lies as well as denying the truth. Whether Parker and Stone act in accordance with their convictions and shutter Deep Voodoo remains to be seen.As far as South Park goes, the pieces continue to fall into place for what promises to be a wild finale over the course of the remaining two episodes, although it will be as hard for them to top the horrific Trump-Vance sex scene as it will be for the rest of us to scrub it from our brains.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionUS televisionAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In some cases, touts have used bots and specialist browser software to maximise the number of tickets they can obtain,leading to prosecutions and prison sentences.The consumer group Which? published further details on Thursday of exorbitant prices charged by touts on such platforms in locations such as Dubai, Singapore and the US.Oasis tickets for Wembley Stadium shows were listed for £3,498.85 on StubHub and £4,442 on Viagogo, while aColdplayticket, also for Wembley, was £814.52 on StubHub. The most extreme example Which? found was a ticket for All Points East festival in London’s Victoria Park, headlined by Raye, listed for £114,666 on Viagogo.The consumer group also found evidence of alleged “speculative selling”, building onevidence of the same practice previously uncovered by the Guardian.“Spec” selling, as it is known among touts, is a fraudulent practice in which a tout advertises a ticket they do not actually have, pockets fans’ money and then attempts to source a real ticket cheaply, banking the profit.Which? found that tickets for a Busted vs McFly show in Glasgow had not yet been sold on Ticketmaster – the original seller – but were already listed on Stubhub and Viagogo at double the price.Viagogo and StubHub both said they did not permit this practice on their websites.In total, 38 artists signed the letter to Starmer, including Iron Maiden, Johnny Marr, Robert Smith of The Cure, Sam Fender, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, PJ Harvey, the Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, Mogwai and New Order.“For too long certain resale platforms have allowed touts to bulk buy and then resell tickets at inflated prices, forcing fans to either pay above the odds or miss out entirely,” they said.“This erodes trust in the live events sector and undermines the efforts of artists and organisers to make shows accessible and affordable.”Viagogo and StubHub have both said that capping resale prices would lead to an increase in outright fraud, as fans turn to unregulated sales on social media and offshore sites. Some banks, which would incur the cost of processing chargebacks on any such fraud, have raised similar concerns.But the artists – backed by organisations including UK Music, FanFair Alliance and the Football Supporters’ Association – disputed this, saying the removal of for-profit resale would make it “easier for fans to spot illegal behaviour”.Viagogo and StubHub both told Which? they were fully compliant with UK regulations and did not permit or condone the use of bots.A spokesperson for the government said it was “fully committed to clamping down on touts” and would reveal its plans shortly.Explore more on these topicsTicket pricesMusic industryConsumer affairsViagogoRadioheadDua LipaColdplaynewsShareReuse this content"

They must spend their lifetimes battling it, facing horror after horror in the process.This is the plot, roughly, of Stephen King’s novel It (his best; no arguments). It is also the plot, roughly, of King’s son Joe Hill’s new horror doorstopper, in which six friends summon the ancient, infinitely malicious dragon King Sorrow from the Long Dark to help them defeat some baddies. Needless to say, their supernatural ritual backfires.Joseph Hillström King started his career making great efforts to avoid any connection with his famous father, publishing under the pen name he still uses today and avoiding meeting his agent in person (he bears a striking resemblance to his dad). But in this latest novel, he leans into it. There are lines that deliberately echo some of King’s most famous (“The man in black fled across the desert …”); a moment that brings to mind a King plot point (a riddling contest). In this whopper of a novel, Hill is delighting in his family connection, and we delight along with him. King Sorrow is huge, sprawling – and absolutely fantastic.Back to those friends: five of them are students at the fictional Rackham College in Maine. There’s Arthur, bookish and brilliant, solving Old English riddles in his spare time; Colin, rich, sharp, and prone to trampling anyone who stands in his way; twins Donna and Donovan; the beautiful Allie. And there’s Gwen, who doesn’t study with them, but becomes a key part of their group as they dabble, half believing, half not, in the occult.Arthur is, for reasons we don’t need to go into here, forced into stealing rare books from his beloved college library by a bunch of local criminals. This tears at his bookish heart, especially when he’s made to take the library’s most valuable and disturbing title: the journal of occultist Enoch Crane (executed “for trafficking with the devyll in 1703”; the book’s jacket is made from his skin). Our Scooby gang read the journal, discover they could summon what Crane describes as a “proud worm, cunning serpent, armoured devil” to help Arthur out with his blackmail problem – and spend the rest of the novel reaping the consequences. King Sorrow will indeed rid them of those troublesome local drug dealers, but they’ll have to choose a new sacrifice each year or become his victim themselves. As Arthur later puts it: “You sow dragon’s teeth, all you get is more dragons.”Moving through four decades, Hill also moves with effortless ease between genres: as the friends attempt to deal with the situation they find themselves in by, variously, picking people who are obviously evil to sacrifice, or hunting down ways to kill the dragon themselves, we go from thriller to dark fantasy, black-ops torture to romance to horror. My favourite genre switch was to a quest story, deep in the caves below Cornwall, a section sprinkled with JRR Tolkien that was gloriously terrifying.There are trolls – bridge-dwelling ones and online ones, properly scary and perfectly brought to life. There are magical swords and betrayals, heart-stopping scenes of courage and ones of dreadful evil, both human and otherworldly. It’s a tour de force: a horror novel that is above all a paean to the imagination, and to love and friendship. “We needed a story to believe and now we’ve got one,” says Colin as the friends sit around the table, preparing to summon their dragon into being with the force of their minds.As Hill puts it in his epigraph: “Hic sunt dracones”.

In Feminist History for Every Day of the Year, Kate Mosse, the bestselling author ofLabyrinth, celebrates can-do women and gives history’s trailblazers their due. Aimed at teenage readers but just as enjoyable for adults, this anthology comprises bite-sized stories of female achievement and the centuries-old fight for equality. As Mosse notes in the introduction, it is about women “who refused to accept the limitations put on them, who campaigned and marched, battled and challenged the status quo to change the world for the better”.The book features a mixture of famous and lesser-known figures: artists, writers, scientists, academics, sportswomen, educators and politicians. There’s primatologist Dian Fossey; avant garde painter Amrita Sher-Gil; Britain’s first black headteacher Beryl Gilroy; Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai; Ethiopian politician and humanitarian Senedu Gebru; racehorse trainer Florence Nagle; computer programmers Ada Lovelace and Dorothy Vaughan; and actor and music hall star Josephine Baker, who was also a pilot and agent in the French resistance during the second world war. Not all the assembled achievers are straightforwardly heroic – Marie Stopes may have founded Britain’s first ever birth control clinic in 1921, but she also believed in eugenics.Theft by Abdulrazak Gurnah audiobook review – coming-of-age saga in TanzaniaRead moreMosse and the Bridgerton actor Adjoa Andoh are our narrators, their delivery brimming with curiosity and passion.

Is it a movie borrowing bits from a TV show? A TV show dressed up as a movie? Does it matter? It certainly doesn’t, if all you need is spectacular and imaginatively staged battle sequences – though for non-initiates, it’s difficult to see it adding up to much more than that.One thing that would be very helpful – and is regrettably lacking – is a Star Wars-style scroll plainly laying out the backstory in simple terms for unfamiliar viewers. Sure, the TV show compilation does a bit of that, but it also feels like trying to download a thousand years of lore into your head, while simultaneously having your mind boggled by wild visions of conflict in the underworld. A bit more context for the long-running struggle between good and evil, involving sorcerers and “curses” (which seems to mean something closer to “demon” here), would be of great help to the normies over here.Where Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution absolutely excels for both fans and the uninitiated is in its visuals and sound design. Intense, bombastic showdowns incorporate everything from gore to monsters to visual design of earth-shattering beauty. The apocalyptic cityscapes, ominous sunsets and genuinely eerie subway battle sequences pulsate with off-the-wall creatures and grotesque villains.The soundtrack is genuinely banging, accompanied by really top notch voice acting. If this is your first dip of the toe in the water of the Jujutsu Kaisen universe (which ultimately derives from a bestselling manga), you can’t expect it to make all that much sense, but you can certainly buckle up and expect a stimulating trip.Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution is out on 14 November in the UK, 4 December in Australia, and 5 December in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAnimeTelevisionMangaJapanreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s plenty of amusement and wry, sophisticated sadness here, though co-writer and director Gaby Dellal has confected what is, in the end, a pretty middleweight movie.Shaw plays Kit, an elegant and wealthy widow living in a handsome apartment on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, known for her witty disdain for those less stylish than herself and about to publish a memoir of life with her late husband, a collector of Chinese art. Out of the blue her grown up daughter Charlotte (Waterston) appears, having run out on her abusive rancher husband; she intends to stay for a while with her mother in her childhood Park Avenue home while she figures things out.Charlotte instantly regresses to her teen self, all to the satirically polite dismay of her mother, who appears to suggest that it would be better if Charlotte simply returned to her husband and somehow made this marriage of hers work. As things progress, the mother-daughter odd couple relationship becomes spikier and more intense as Charlotte realises that Kit’s airy, haughty detachment and imperious, droll mannerisms mask a deeper pain – although it’s quite extraordinary that Charlotte hasn’t guessed what’s physically wrong before this.This is an agreeable, diverting spectacle with classyNew Yorklocations and scenes that haven’t been fashionable since the middle period of Woody Allen. There is sweetness and melancholy here, with an interesting cameo from British author Hari Kunzru, though it’s also unclear if all this adds up to anything very substantial. Great stuff from Shaw, however, who is fearless and direct in a way that very few actors can match.Park Avenue is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFiona ShawNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

In truth, apart from the bare bones of the plot (culminating in that famous Mexican standoff), there’s little comparison. No wisecracking about Madonna lyrics or torture scenes set to 70s soft rock here; instead, you get gritty, often bloody violence in the bustling streets and night markets of Hong Kong (which look splendid in this new restoration), and an effective tale of cops, robbers and divided loyalty. (And to be fair, Lam in turn was inspired by 1970s Indian thriller Gaddaar.)You also get Chow Yun-fat in his prime, as an undercover police officer charged with infiltrating a gang of jewel thieves. Unlike Reservoir Dogs, though, we know he’s a cop from the outset, and the story contrasts his own force’s infighting and inhumanity with the relative honour and camaraderie he finds among the criminals – that even includes the one who killed his colleague (Danny Lee). In his undercover persona Chow is cool and clownish, but he also effectively conveys the toll and turmoil of his double identity. Chow’s work in John Woo’s operatically flashy action movies such as A Better Tomorrow, The Killer and Hard Boiled put this era of late-80s and early-90s Hong Kong cinema on the global map, but this is a more brutal and realistic kind of movie, full of grubby locations, tough choices and sudden deaths as well as some thrilling foot chases and shootouts.City on Fire is in UK cinemas from 14 November, and on UHD, Blu-ray and digital platforms from 1 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

It also draws on the talents of a cracking roster of supporting players, who add a substantial amount of texture and colour to the proceedings, not least among them the film’s own director Alex Winter, best known for playing Bill opposite Keanu Reeves’ Ted. In a peripheral but significant role, Winter plays a sad-sack stoner, the kind of tragic loser Bill might have grown up to be if he and Ted had never encountered George Carlin and his most excellent time machine.That said, something feels a bit undercooked here, perhaps due to Winter’s direction or Michael MB Galvin’s script, which seems to lack a little torque in the last turns of the screw. The set-up is simple enough, a quite relatable for anyone who has an ageing parent and shiftless siblings. Meg (Kaya Scodelario) has outsourced the care of her widowed mother Judy (Ingunn Omholt) to home-help Grace (Billie Lourd, gloriously trashy) while Meg raises her kids and tries to get her business selling stuff on Facebook up and running. When Judy has a stroke, Meg’s wannabe screenwriter brother Noah (Josh Gad) arrives in town and the two siblings must prepare for their parent’s death and the division of assets.But while sifting through the junk in Judy’s basement, Meg and Noah discover a corpse, seemingly dead for many years, walled up down there. They suspect that the dead person might be a neighbour who went missing; this throws up new problems, including how to deal with a blackmail attempt from Grace. Further complicating the estate-planning, crime-covering maths is the needy variable that is cousin Bodie (Anthony Carrigan, best known for playing NoHo Hank on TV show Barry), who just wants to be part of his cousins’ lives again. Carrigan, as he was in Barry, is a serial scene stealer and you can’t stop watching his distinctive charming-repulsive shtick.On the down side, the noir-necessity that dictates that Meg and Noah sink to new depths to protect themselves doesn’t quite feel set up sufficiently and ultimately their characters are both somewhat cipher-like, less well drawn than even Judy who hardly has more than five words in the whole film. But the package has a nasty little swagger that makes it a nice counterpoint to all the holiday cheer coming our way.Adulthood is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a wonky analysis but you can see where she is coming from.Her confusion is partly the point. Playwright and director Jamie Eastlake wants to make sense of a country pulled to Stephen Yaxley-Lennon’s far-right protests and to Just Stop Oil’s civil disobedience. In a complex world, we are reassured by simple answers, but what is the actual cause of our discontent?View image in fullscreenAll-scoring … Big Ange.Photograph: Von Fox PromotionsAngela is the Good Fairy of the piece. Twenty years in the north-east with her Tottenham accent intact, she has a heart-driven sense of right and wrong. She is all community spirit. After an epiphany seeing football manager Ange Postecoglou, she reinvents herself as Big Ange and helps turn the school team into a winning squad.Meanwhile, the forces of good and evil are lining up to fight for the soul of 18-year-old Steven Mooney (Curtis Appleby), a Blyth boy distressed by his Northumberland town’s economic decline and eager to find someone to blame. Will he go with big sister Caroline (Erin Mullen) who has taken her socialist values south for a comfortable life of middle-class protest? Or will he throw in his lot with the charmingly sinister fascist with no name (Lucy Eve Mann) who encourages his Islamophobic online videos?It is close enough to Christmas to guess how this morality tale will play out, but that is not to underestimate the importance of the playwright’s questions. Eastlake, who continues to enjoy success with his adaptation of Jonathan Tulloch’sGerry & Sewell, has some uneven writing, underdeveloped themes and the odd misfiring joke as he swings between his parallel stories, but he also has a keen sense that all these issues – deprivation, justice, radicalisation – need to be discussed openly with empathy and humour.As a director, his fielding of an all-dancing, all-scoring chorus of eight, in defiance of the small stage, is a shrewd move. Their synchronised exuberance gives theatrical life to questions affecting us all.At Live theatre, Newcastle,until 22 November.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

As we turn into the drive, the house reveals itself, a handsome limestone edifice framed by a steep ridge of wooded hills, ablaze with autumn colours, and fronted by rolling parkland where sheep graze on the riverbanks. Despite its bucolic aspect, this is a landscape that has been carefully honed and crafted over centuries by successive generations of the Cavendish family, who have lived in this beautiful corner of Derbyshire for more than 450 years.Some of the most significant alterations were made in the 19th century by the 6th Duke of Devonshire (also known as “the Bachelor Duke”), an extravagant character who had the estate village demolished and rebuilt over the brow of a hill because he felt it was spoiling the view from the house. His perfectionism paid off; as the long queue of cars snaking up to the ticket office on a beautiful October morning attests, Chatsworth is one of the most popular stately homes in the UK today, welcoming more than 600,000 visitors a year.Opening its doors to the public is just one of the ways that this grand old pile keeps the show on the road. The estate is a sprawling enterprise that covers a sizeable chunk of thePeak District national parkand has grown to encompass theChatsworth Farm Shop, dozens of holiday lets – ranging from shepherd’s huts to a 16th-century hunting tower – two pubs (theBeeley Innand thePilsley Inn), and theCavendish Hotel.View image in fullscreenThe Hide has doubles from £80 and good value meals made with produce from the estateThe latest addition to the fold is the Hide hotel, which is being pitched as an affordable, family-friendly alternative to some of the pricier accommodation in theChatsworth Escapesportfolio, with doubles from £80 a night, room only. Previously known as the Highwayman hotel, it sits on the A619 road from Chesterfield to Bakewell and was run as a Premier Inn and Beefeater restaurant for many years (“lots of orange and pictures of cows”, as one staff member described it to me). It reopened in October after a refurbishment overseen by Laura Burlington, daughter-in-law of the current Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. We’re among the first guests to stay in the new-look hotel.After completing the automated check-in (there’s no reception desk, but staff are on hand in the bar/restaurant next door), we settle into our family bunk room, which has a kingsize bed and built-in “cabin bunks”. The decor is simple but cosy, with soft woollen blankets and carpets, furniture made from reclaimed wood and modern artwork from the Cavendish family’s private collection.View image in fullscreenA family bunk room at the Hide hotel.Photograph: Anna BatchelorWe’re booked in for dinner at the Hide Grill and Pizzeria, which offers a “campfire-inspired menu designed for sharing and cooked over an open flame”. Fears of being marched outside and forced to sing Ging Gang Goolie quickly dissipate as we’re shown to a fireside table in a quiet corner of the large and sprawling restaurant. The menu offers a long list of crowd-pleasers from fish and chips to wood-fired pizzas and barbecued spare ribs, as well as kid-friendly desserts such as s’mores sharing boards. The food isn’t the only thing that’s designed with families in mind. There’s a dedicated play corner, with books, toys and a miniature kitchen to keep younger diners entertained while they wait for their food. It’s a Sunday, so we order from the roast menu – a choice of rotisserie chicken, Chatsworth estate-reared beef or lamb with all the trimmings, followed by ginger parkin with custard. The food is great, the portions generous and, at £18 a person, it’s incredibly good value.When the tapestries in the state drawing room were removed, they found chocolate wrappers dating to the 1930s stuffed behind themEntry to the house and grounds is not included in the room rate, but multi-entry tickets are available, which give unlimited access for the duration of your stay. Hotel guests can buy a day pass to theChatsworth Health and Fitness Club, a couple of miles away, with its pool, gym, tennis courts and treatments, and can book conservation tours during the winter when the house is closed to the public. Another perk is having direct access to the estate’s 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of park and moorland.In our room is a booklet of circular walks that start from the hotel or the nearby village of Baslow. One route takes you from the hotel’s back gate across the fields to Chatsworth House, a walk of around 5 miles; another takes you up toCurbar Edge, one of the Peak District’s distinctive gritstone escarpments. Walkers and cyclists are made to feel welcome here with bike and boot wash stations, cycle storage and an outdoor dog bath and shower for those bringing a four-legged friend. There’s also abus servicethat runs from Chesterfield to Chatsworth with a stop outside the hotel, making this a viable base for exploring the national park without a car.We’ve arranged to have a private tour of the house, and our guide, Martin, proves to be a mine of fascinating facts about the17 generationsof Cavendishes who have called this their home. He leads us through the breathtaking Painted Hall with its colourful frescoes, the regal State Rooms, the chapel, the cosy library (where a huge Christmas tree is being installed) and the purpose-built Sculpture Gallery, pointing out some of the artworks, which range from Roman and Egyptian sculpture to old masters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Martin tells us the house was used as a girls’ boarding school during the second world war. When the 17th-century tapestries in the State Drawing Room were removed for cleaning, they found Cadbury’s chocolate wrappers dating back to the 1930s stuffed behind them.We spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the grounds – the greenhouses, grotto, maze and spectacular Emperor Fountain, built in 1844, another addition by the 6th duke, who wanted to build the tallest fountain in the world to impress Tsar Nicholas I. In the event the tsar was a no-show, although Chatsworth has had its fair share of illustrious guests, from King Edward VII to novelist Elizabeth Gaskell and political philosopher Thomas Hobbes. There has been speculation that Jane Austen based her descriptions of Pemberley on Chatsworth, although there is no evidence that she visited. Nevertheless, the house stood in for Mr Darcy’s grand estate in the 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. “There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire,” wrote Austen in that same novel. If you’re looking for an affordable, comfortable and friendly base from which to explore the county, the Hide is a very decent place to start.The Hidehas doubles from £80 a night, and bunk rooms sleeping two adults and two childrenfrom £125, both room-onlyExplore more on these topicsDerbyshire holidaysWeekend breaksEngland holidaysDay tripsShort breaksCultural tripsUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, when there’s a chill in the air, I like to eat food than leans towards smoky and earthy flavours: charred vegetables, stews, sausages and mushroomeverything.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For this type of cooking and living, I tend to turn to north-west Italian reds, particularly those from Piedmont. You’ll find a range of wine styles in this region – Gavi di Gavi and moscato d’Asti are both made here – but there’s something about its red wines that I find helplessly alluring and seductive. The word Piedmont means “at the foot of the mountain”, a reference to its proximity to the Alps, and its wines are of international renown, even though they make up only a tiny fraction (less than 5%) of Italy’s total production. Demand for them is high, so expect prices to start a little higher, too (apologies in advance).Nebbiolo is perhaps Piedmont’s most famous red grape, and it’s often compared to pinot noir on account of it being similarly tricky to grow and its susceptibility to disease; it can also possess a pinot-like lightness in colour, with an expressive, complex nose. I’m very sensitive to its smell of rose petals, which seem to jump out of the glass. Derived fromnebbia, the Italian word for fog (perhaps due to the fact that, in winter, especially, mist collects in the hills of Piedmont), nebbiolo makes up 100% of the globally celebrated barolo and barbaresco wines.You’ll also find barbera, the most widely planted grape in Piedmont, with some of the most iconic examples found around Asti and Alba. Barbera is just as capable of producing age-worthy, elegant and earthy wines, but even so you get a sense that it tends always to play second fiddle to nebbiolo. That said, that’s also why barbera is often a fair bit cheaper.The dolcetto grape is even more under-appreciated, but in my book it offers just as much as its two more lauded siblings. You’re more likely to find and drink dolcettos when they’re young, being low in both acid and alcohol, because they’re not generally considered as age-worthy (though there are exceptions to every rule). Their finely meshed tannic structure makes them a great food match, though.Speaking of food matches, I asked Liam Colucci ofRaeburn Fine Winesfor advice, not least because he’s a) Italian and b) a lover of a fine wine BYOB. “Piemonte is blessed with perfect hazelnuts, truffles and mushrooms, and it’s as if the local wine is made for such dishes. For barolo, I love agnolotti with a guinea fowl filling, married with fresh ceps and a glossy sauce made from reduced stock. Barbera, meanwhile, pairs wonderfully with vitello tonnato – the like-for-like acid is electric.”Four Piedmont reds to whet the appetiteM&S Araldica Barbera d’Asti£9.50 Ocado, 14.5%. Oak adds spice and complements the fruity cherry notes. Made by a winemaking cooperative in the Asti region that works with 230 growers.GD Vajra Dolcetto d’Alba£16 The Wine Society, 12%. A core of blue fruit brings a graphite coolness.Il Poeta Barolo£22 Laithwaites, 14%. For affordable barolo, you’ll struggle to do much better. Perfumed and aromatic.Cantina del Nebbiolo Nebbiolo d’Alba£14 Waitrose, 14.5%.

Instead, she told her husband to put the kids to bed so she could get in the car, drive to Wegmans and “panic buy” $100 worth of Rummo pasta.Kelly, a 42-year-old product manager who lives outsidePhiladelphia, has celiac disease, which means that eating gluten triggers an immune response that leads to digestive issues. She saw fellow gluten-free people on Reddit and TikTok freaking out over the fact that the US is mulling a 107% tariff on Italian pasta imports. According to the Wall Street Journal, the hike could lead to those companies withdrawing from the US market as early as January.That means American shoppers might not see their favorite brands in the Italian aisle come January – including Rummo, which Kelly and other celiacs claim makes the “best” gluten-free spaghetti, out of a corn and brown rice mixture. (Kelly did not want her last name used for fear of retaliation fromDonald Trumpsupporters. Representatives for Rummo did not respond to a request for comment.)Trump weighs giving Americans $2,000 from tariff revenues in bid for supportRead more“The idea of not having any pasta that I can safely eat and won’t cost an arm and a leg was a little terrifying,” Kelly said.Despite the Trump administration’s manytariffs, this news hit harder for Americans who love Italian food. Cue fears of a pasta shortage. “I’m now a one issue voter,” the MSNBC host Chris Hayeswroteon X. “This is the attack on italians in the USA that conservatives *think* ‘cancelling columbus day’ is,”wrotea Reddit user. On TikTok, a userquotedTony Soprano’s son, AJ: “What, no freakin’ ziti now?”Ninety-two per cent of the tax has been newlyproposedby the US Department of Commerce (DoC), which alleges that Italian producers have been selling their pasta at unfairly low prices; the other 15% comes from the existing Trump tariff on European Union imports. The Wall Street Journalreportedthat Italy is responsible for $770m worth of annual pasta sales to the US.However, the elimination of those sales would not necessarily make the food scarce stateside. “Most of the pasta sold in the United States is already domestically produced,” said Scott Laing, a clinical assistant professor of finance at the University at Buffalo School of Management.Barilla’s blue-and-red boxes are ubiquitous in US grocery stores, where it has a 34% market share. That’s an Italian company with production factories in the US as well as Italy, so experts predict families will still be able to buy a $2 box of Barilla spaghetti come January. A representative for the company declined to comment to the Guardian, “since the matter is still under evaluation by the DoC”.Those most likely to experience sticker shock are celiacs like Kelly, or pasta snobs who only buy premium imported items. “Maybe a $5.99 box of gluten-free pasta is going to become $11 or $12,” Laing said. “I don’t think most consumers are going to notice it.”That is, as long as US producers do not use the tariffs as an excuse to raise their prices, too. “News stories are going around about the tariffs that are already starting to train consumers to think, ‘Oh, pasta prices are going up,’ without realizing that the majority of their pasta isn’t actually an Italian import,” Laing said. “So the stores can raise their prices just a little bit, making this off-brand pasta box $1 more, even though there is no tariff on it.”Scott Ketchum, who founded the US-produced, artisanal pasta brand Sfoglini, agreed that US manufacturers will “take advantage” of the news and slightly raise their prices. “That’s just business,” he said.Sfoglini pasta prices are higher than most grocery store brands – a 12-ounce box goes for about $6 – due to its use of organic wheat pasta that’s imported from Italy. Ketchum says he’s already paying tariffs on that ingredient. “You never really know what Trump’s going to do until it’s done,” Ketchum said. “The tariffs on wheat were 10%, but then after negotiating, he actually increased them another 5%.”As an Italian-American, Katie Gia eats a lot of pasta. “It’s a quick thing where I can reheat it, and that’s convenient,” she said. Gia, who is 29 and lives in Florida, has a gluten allergy. But she cannot afford to stock up on pasta like Kelly did. “Gluten-free pasta generally is also limited stock,” Gia said. “I’ll buy a couple bags of the brands I like, but I also know there’s a lot of other people who are going to want to do the same thing.”The pasta tariff comes asgrocery prices are risingfor families across the country. The Yale Budget lab estimated in September that tariffs would cost households an extra $2,400 a year. Snap benefits have been delayed due to the government shutdown, leaving those who rely on food stamps hungry and anxious. Though Trump has angrily squashed concerns over the cost of living – tellingreporters“inflation is way down” earlier this month – grocery prices have increased under his administration.Kelly said she left plenty of boxes of her favorite gluten-free pasta on the shelves at her local Wegmans: “I did not completely clear it out.” And she understands that there are worse things going on in the world than missing out on spaghetti.“I feel so petty saying, ‘But my pasta!’” Kelly said. “But when you have celiac disease, so much of your brain power is constantly consumed by food. What can I eat? What is safe? It’s a low-level anxiety that always hangs with you. The idea that a staple food you can eat might just go away is one more dig that we have to deal with.”Explore more on these topicsPastaTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We love the vaguely folk-horror animatronic trees, witches and giant sea monsters lurking within a labyrinthine real forest. We love the anthropomorphised talking bins that plead (in a haunting, perpetual sing-song) for crumpled pieces of paper to be shoved into their suction-powered mouths. We love the inventive rides that, variously, judder along rattling wooden tracks, plunge cursed pirate ships into water, or nudge gondolas serenely through sylvan scenes of bum-flashing goblins showering beneath waterfalls.But our very favourite thing about the place might well be thepoffertjesstand, a perennially busy kiosk where exhausted families gather for dinky paper boats filled with these yeast-puffed and sugar-dusted miniature buckwheat pancakes that are a Dutch institution. Made to order in a vast, uniformly indented pan, speared through their light, custardy middles with toothpicks and served with a thick swoop of pale butter, they always prompt an acute, grunting sort of shared pleasure and succour. Poffertjes (pronounced a little like “poffeh-tyuss”) are the dangled prize for the four of us; a reliable salve to the jittery overstimulation-loop that only themed leisure environments can provide. When we cajoled the blubbering eight-year-old on to a haunted house attraction that then promptly broke down (I imagine this tale will be tearfully described to a therapist one day), a shared portion of a dozen, ethereally warm poffertjes was how we chose both to apologise and collectively soothe our jangled nerves.Flash forward to a year or so after my first encounter with poffertjes, and I was back in our south-east London kitchen, trying to contrive a way to make Nigerian puff-puff without deep-frying. This, for the uninitiated, is a quite different, almost-soundalike snack that nonetheless delivers a similarly potent hit of pleasure. West African in origin (and also known asbofrot), puff-puff are the bulbous, gratifyingly chewy Nigerian version of the yeasted drop doughnuts that many different food cultures seem to have a beloved version of. Puff-puff are peddled at Lagos roadsides, and are often whipped up to toast births and commemorate deaths. They are a spongey, sugar-glistened mainstay among the “small chop” snacks at a lavish Nigerian party; the thing my mother rarely leaves the house without the rudimentary ingredients for. Ask about the oil levels in her car and you could easily be referring to the giant bottle of Crisp ‘N Dry that has permanent residence in her boot.Puff-puff are always deep-fried: a sticky, aerated dough that’s plopped into a generously poured, roiling pan of oil with either a wooden spoon or (if you are a proper West African matriarch) a dextrous hand. This wouldn’t do for my specific puff-puff purposes – a cooking demonstration where deep-frying wasn’t possible – so I had to think laterally. And that is when I thought of poffertjes or, rather, a hybrid version of puff-puff pancakes, too good to be eaten only at breakfast or, for that matter, in the hallucinatory wilds of a Dutch amusement park.Puff-puff pancakesServes84 tsp dried active yeast(about 13g)120g granulated sugar, plus 1 tbspextra350ml warm water, or warm milk for a deeper flavour380g plain flour½ tbsp salt¼ tsp ground cardamom½ tsp grated nutmegNeutral oil, for frying75g icing sugar½ tsp ground cinnamonWhisk the dried active yeast with a tablespoon of granulated sugar and the warm water, then set aside for 10 minutes, until fully bloomed and foamy.Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the plain flour, salt, the remaining 120g granulated sugar, ground cardamom and grated nutmeg. Make a well in the middle, pour in the foamed yeast mix and stir to make a smooth batter. Cover with a couple of clean, damp tea towels and leave at room temperature for about 45 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size (it should be quite wet and tacky).Put a dribble of neutral oil in a wide, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat, then, working in batches, fry tablespoon-sized dollops of the mixture for two to three minutes per side, until puffed into chubby, golden-brown pucks. Set aside on a large, warmed plate while you cook the rest.Finish by mixing the icing sugar and cinnamon, then dust this mix over the top of the pancakes with a sieve.
