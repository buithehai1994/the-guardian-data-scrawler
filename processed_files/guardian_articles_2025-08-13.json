Everything in it is tinged with wistfulness–a goodbye to cherished characters and a farewell to a stately home that was a sturdy presence in a transient world.When the ITV series started in 2010, wasn’t life … better? Did Elizabeth McGovern feel this too, the sense of time passing? After all, her character, Cora, is now ageing out of custodianship of Downton along with her husband, Lord Grantham, in favour of a younger generation and a changing era as the 1930s dawn.“No!” says McGovern, snapping me out of my melancholy. “I feel very excited that I’m going into a gratifying new phase in my career.” As well as reviving Cora, there is the play she has written, Ava: The Secret Conversations. Starring McGovern as Hollywood actor Ava Gardner, it will run in New York, Chicago and Toronto, having madeits debut in Londonin 2022. There is also a new album ofher folk-inspired music. “I feel like I’m just beginning,” she declares as we meet at her publicist’s London office. At first glance, McGovern, fine-boned and composed, seems delicate – but if you only go on first impressions, you’ll miss her rebellious spirit.I was never desperate. I could walk away. A lot of young women weren’t so luckyNot that making Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale wasn’t emotional. “You don’t have to work very hard, as a film-maker, to touch on that depth, because we’ve been working on it for so many years,” she says. McGovern worried that the absence ofMaggie Smith– who died last year after giving the show the brilliantly scathing Dowager Countess – would feel like too big a loss to the Downton world. But she says Smith’s presence “permeates” it. “She’s still very much in the atmosphere. I don’t feel there’s a big hole. In fact, in some ways, it sort of freed up the rest of the narrative to have a flow, because it’s not stopping for her moments. But everything she represents is there. She’s in every room, in every interaction, so it’s not like she’s not there. It’s a weird thing.”View image in fullscreenHeroine heiress … as Cora (centre) in The Grand Finale.Photograph: Rory Mulvey/Focus FeaturesThe women of Downton, whether the steely Lady Mary or spirited young cook Daisy, are gratifyingly tough, but Cora, usually quietly supportive in the background, never seemed that robust, even though it was her money – as an American heiress – that was running everything. Was that difficult to play? “At times, yes,” says McGovern. “I think as a contemporary woman, it is hard to feel the straitjacket of that period.” Did she ever fight for Cora to have more agency? “I wish at times she could have had more interesting stories,” says McGovern, but adds that it wouldn’t have been appropriate for her to have had “any more political or social power, because it just wouldn’t be accurate to the time”.Cora, though, is a vision of an exciting America; the daughter of a Jewish immigrant installed at Downton with her bags of new money and her progressive outlook. Were Downton set now, instead of Cora coming here to shake up Britain’s class-ridden ways, she would be a wealthy liberal refugee, a bit likeEllen DeGeneres, fleeing Trump’s America. McGovern, who grew up in California, has lived in the UK for the past 32 years. She is shocked and disappointed at modern US politics.“I mean,” she says, “it’s a reality that must have been bubbling away under what I thought was America. It can’t have come from nowhere.” But, describing herself as a positive person, she adds: “I think it will be painful, but we have too much successful history as a free country for us to let it go. It’s all of our responsibility to peacefully make sure we hold on to everything that I was confident – and complacent about – that America represented.”View image in fullscreenBig time … with Robert De Niro in Once Upon a Time in America.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyMcGovern had huge success early on. Her debut was in Robert Redford’s 1980 film Ordinary People, and she won an Oscar nomination for her role in her second film, Ragtime. This was followed by a part in Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America, opposite Robert de Niro. “I think I did feel like, ‘Gosh, this isn’t as hard as people say.’” She smiles. “Until I later experienced how difficult it is. My experience early on was just trying to keep my head on straight, do job after job, and do what most people are doing at that age – try to grow up. I only realised later how difficult it is to sustain a career.”Hers wasn’t a showbiz family: her parents were teachers. And although she has loved acting since she was a child, it was never about becoming a star. As a young woman in an often dangerous industry, this probably protected her. “I was never desperate, so I could always just walk away. A lot of young women didn’t feel they could. I think I was very lucky.”It also made her see the downsides of fame. “I think I did manage to avoid it myself, but the price you pay for fame is that it becomes really hard to have any relationships of intimacy, because you are collateral. Your whole being has sort of been sold, and that creates a tension about what people want from you.”A lot of McGovern’s early roles were as the girlfriend to the male lead. Then, she says: “I went from being the girlfriend to the perfect wife, and that I found frustrating. Most movies, television – it’s always the man’s point of view. It’s such a deep, subliminal thing that audiences are not even aware of it. I wasn’t even particularly aware of it. I knew my job early on was to fulfil a man’s fantasy of the woman they wanted. It never occurred to me to even question it.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve done my own thing’ … with Brad Pitt as her boyfriend in The Favor; now she thinks she would be cast as his mother.Photograph: Orion Pictures/AllstarBrad Pitt played McGovern’s boyfriend in the 1994 comedy The Favor. We joke – bitterly – that were she to be in a film with him now, she would probably be cast as his mother. This says a lot about what’s still considered desirable in a woman even though, at 64, McGovern is only three years Pitt’s senior. “I really don’t think that, just because society is viewing something that way, we have to. I try to have this discussion with my daughters. We can have a feeling independent of the consensus in society. I’ve just done my own thing and just kept doing it.”She bristles, not unreasonably, when I point out that her embracing her silver hair seems rare in her business. Was that a political decision? “Not really. But once again, I feel like a woman my age – that’s what we’re asked to talk about. I regret that about society.”There is something bracing about the way McGovern carves her own path. She left Hollywood and moved to London to start a family; she has two grownup daughters with her husband, the film-maker and producer Simon Curtis (who directed The Grand Finale). Approaching her 40s, she started a band, Sadie and the Hotheads, and started releasing music. “I have to remind myself,” she says, “that people will either like it or they won’t – and whatever they feel is fine with me. It’s about doing it.”In her 50s, she wrote her play about Gardner, drawn to the actor’s independent spirit. Now in her 60s, she is writing a screenplay, although she won’t say what it’s about. “It’s my next obsession. I really want to write stuff. I’m really excited about that.” Doing so is partly a way to create interesting work for herself as an older actor. There has certainly been plenty of talk about this – does she think the situation has improved? “Not that I’ve noticed.”View image in fullscreenIndependent spirit … with Aaron Costa Ganis in Ava: The Secret Conversations in New York.Photograph: Jeff Lorch/APShe loved the recent showDying for Sex, in which Michelle Williams plays a terminally ill woman in her 40s who embarks on a last attempt at sexual exploration. “It’s such a female story. I found that to be really encouraging, but it’s not going to be about someone my age.” Why? Is it because society considers the thought of older women having a sex life shocking? “I think possibly, yes. I mean, what can we do as women, except just keep going and not buy into it? We have no other choice.”If it takes a bit of effort, the pay-off is surely worth it – if McGovern and her outlook are anything to go by. “It’s a daily exercise in getting your head tuned into the right thing. It’s not that I blame anyone for accepting the status quo, but it doesn’t mean I have to. No way.” She laughs. “No way.”Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is out on 11 September in Australia, and 12 September in the UK and US.Ava: The Secret Conversationsis at New York City Center until 14 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDownton Abbey (Film)Downton Abbey (Television & radio)Period drama (TV)TelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But here we are, absorbing astory from the New York Timesthis week in which Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are discovered to have been running a private school out of their compound in Palo Alto, California, in violation of city zoning laws. More pertinently, the school of 14 kids, which includes two of the couple’s three daughters, is less than a mile from the school for low-income families that the couple founded in 2016. Guess which school the world’s second-richest man and his wife are shutting down?Say the word “zoning infraction” to a certain stripe of American and the effect is equal to using “queue jumper” on a Briton, but of course the broader point here isn’t one about permits. (A spokesperson for Zuckerberg and Chan told the newspaper that the family was unaware about the zoning laws and that the private school, or “pod of home schoolers” as they put it, is now moving to another location.) It is, rather, about Zuckerberg’s perceived retreat from progressive social causes, starting with the shuttering of the school and ending with the announcement in May this year that the pair’s charitable foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), will bepulling fundingfrom almost all the affordable housing and homeless charities it supports in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as slashing diversity programmes.Officially, the reason for these changes is that after a decade spent learning the ropes of effective philanthropy, CZI has decided that its money is best allocated to science and medical funding. Unofficially, of course, the switch from amission statementabout “advancing human potential and promoting equality” to a foundation that now calls itself a “science-first philanthropy” seems in keeping with more localised changes in the Zuckerberg household. Namely: the Meta head’s swing from the kind of guy who, during the Biden administration, might have worn a This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T-shirt, to his Trump-era guise as someone who goes on Joe Rogan to argue for more “masculine energy” in the workplace and appoints aTrump allyto the Meta board.Zuckerberg’s politics are clearly as flexible as the next tech leader’s, but I suspect there are other things in play here, too. Unlike science research, the specimens in philanthropy-funded social experiments have a nasty habit of talking back. In 2010, when Zuckerberg gave $100m to overhaul the Newark public school system, some educatorscalled him outfor what they saw as the application of startup values and glib quick fixes – charter schools, anyone? More “parental choice”? – to the vast, interlinked challenges of the US’s struggling public school system. You can imagine how this might have gone down at HQ. We’re trying to help them; why are they giving us shit? Why aren’t these nobodies tugging their forelocks like a billionaire at an autocrat’s inauguration?Another thing about billionaires: they get bored very quickly. One of the alleged reasons that Zuckerberg and Chan are shutting their charitable school in East Palo Alto, is that,reportedly, Chan was frustrated by the slow pace of progress. It is baffling, isn’t it, given the geniuses involved; and yet these kids seem determined to stay poor and not get into Harvard. The rock-solid certainty among certain tech leaders that their skills are infinitely transferable is, however, a hard one to unseat. Consider theBezos Day 1 Academies Fund, in which the world’s third-richest man promises to “operate a network of tuition-free, Montessori-inspired preschools in under-resourced communities”, rather than, say, compel his $2.36tn company to pay itsfair share of taxesto fund state education coffers.Meanwhile, back in the Zuckerbergs’ Crescent Park community, things are getting a bit tense. In an area popular with Stanford professors, the Zuckerbergs bought 11 properties, turned them into a compound, and like low-rent oligarchs in Holland Park, west London, promptly put in a pickleball court and dug out the basement. Years of noise, construction and traffic from the school – oh, boy, were neighbours ready when the New York Times reporter came calling. “No neighbourhood wants to be occupied,”said one, whose home is surrounded on three sides by Zuckerberg properties. “But that’s exactly what they’ve done. They’ve occupied our neighbourhood.” Substitute “neighbourhood” for “world” and he’s summed it up nicely.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMark ZuckerbergOpinionMetaPhilanthropyCaliforniaWest CoastcommentShareReuse this content"

As the industry slowly recovers from the decline of audiences during the pandemic – there were 126.5m admissions in 2024 compared with 176.1m in 2019, the rise in younger people returning to cinema may be due to anewfound love for filmdeveloped during the lockdown years. Although figures are yet to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, admission rates are continuing to increase, and it is younger audiences in particular who are showing significant enthusiasm, with figures from the Cinema Advertising Association suggesting that under-35s make up 50% of cinemagoers across the board.The younger audience discovered the depth of the history of cinema in lockdownThis is a proportion, which includes all cinemas including mainstream multiplexes, has held steady over the last few years but the effect appears particularly marked on the independent cinema circuit. Curzon, which operates 16 venues across the UK, reports there has been a clear shift over the past six years in young people overtaking older audiences. In 2019, the biggest age demographic of Curzon attendees was 65+, followed by 55-64. In 2025, however, the dominant age group is 25-34 – rising from 16% in 2019 to 31% in 2025 – followed by 18-25 (growing from 17% to 24% over the same period).The same goes for Bristol independent venue the Watershed, where the percentage of tickets sold to under 25s went from 19% (at reopening after lockdown in 2021) to 27% in 2024. (For comparison, the share of tickets sold to over 60s also increased, but by only by a single percentage point.)Steph Read, programmer at Watershed, says: “We find young people are quite adventurous with their taste, especially when it comes to older films and rereleases.” This year, Chungking Express from 1994 and 2004’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did well with younger audiences. “Over 50% of the audiences for both of those films were 24 and under,” Read says.View image in fullscreenGlasgow Film Theatre says young people connected with old films during the pandemic.Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamyPaul Gallagher, programme manager at Glasgow Film Theatre, attributes this new generation of filmgoers to “a growing appetite for cinema in general” that took off during lockdown. “Streaming became such a lifeline for lots of people, and there was definitely a younger audience who discovered the depth of the history of cinema at that moment.”“Gradually, in the years since then, this younger audience is now starting to join the dots and see that there are cinemas around that play stuff from the history of cinema. It’s not just new films, but that whole rich history of cinema.”Social media has clearly played its part. Gallagher says that screenings of films such as 1995 French social message thriller La Haine, as well as the works of directors such as Céline Sciamma and Wong Kar-Wai, have garnered much interest for their visual style and Instagram-friendly aesthetic. “We showed a couple of screenings of La Haine, and it was hugely popular, it sold out both of our biggest screens, which have just under 400 seats, and there was a visibly younger audiences.”View image in fullscreenScreenings of the 1995 French film La Haine have attracted younger audiences.Photograph: Ronald GrantFilm-dedicated appssuch as Letterboxdhave opened up access to a rich history of cinema, once the preserve of older film buffs, to a younger generation. “We’re Letterboxd fiends. That’s the first thing I do after a movie, I go to Letterboxd,” says Isiah Robinson, 22.Micha, 20, prefers to watch reruns of older films. “I don’t really go to the cinema to watch blockbusters, I want to watch films that already interest me,” she says. “The independent cinemas are usually cheaper anyways.”The cost of going to the cinema is another thing that young people factor in when deciding whether to see a film on the big screen. “We’re balancing the cost of living as well, so it’s a bit of a luxury,” says Isaiah Robinson, 22.According to the UK Cinema Association, the average price of a cinema ticket in the UK is £7.73, only a slight increase on 2018, when the average price was £7.22. Adjusted for inflation, the price is actually cheaper today than it was seven years ago.View image in fullscreenCurzon says social media is driving younger film fans to the pictures.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyAdele Agwu-kalu, 20, isn’t dissuaded by the cost as she says it is similar to what she would spend going out for a drink. “A ticket is basically the same price as a drink,” she says. “So the price is not really a factor.”For other younger people, the cost is worth it as the big screen provides a “no-distractions zone”, as opposed to the experience watching a film at home. “It’s nice to switch off,” says Sophia Crothall, 23. “I don’t touch my phone the whole time I’m in the cinema. At home I’m probably scrolling.”Greg Walker, cinema manager and programmer at Manchester’s Cultplex suggests that “cinema etiquette” is one of the reasons that smaller venues in particular benefiting from the rise in younger people going to see films. “More often than not, independent cinema audiences are the ones who are more respectful. They’re not on the phones constantly, they’re not talking.”“A lot of young people get pigeonholed into being those kind of people at cinemas, but I think a lot of them are actually the ones who want to go and watch the film. It’s not just a social area.”However, Ben Luxford, director of UK audiences at the British Film Institute, says that this new wave of film fanaticism is “still quite a small pocket of people ultimately”.“It might be fuelling a change in the audience at places like the BFI Southbank or in cinemas in university towns across the country, but it’s not happening everywhere,” he says.Cinemas are also benefiting from the rising popularity of music films by big-name artists whose fanbase is typically younger.Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which was released in 2023, has become the highest-grossing concert film of all time.Films spark and go viral – people want to be part of the conversation“Taylor Swift was a gamechanger,” says Eduardo Leal, group director of screen content at Vue. “The Eras Tour completely reset the ceiling for what a music film can do theatrically. Since then, we’ve had a bunch of successful K-pop titles such as J-Hope: In the Box and Seventeen: Power of Love.”“Social media has played a really big role in driving younger audiences to the cinema,” says Susie Bould, director of marketing at Curzon. “Films just spark and go viral. Saltburn, a few years ago, had a huge social virality, which gave it a life that it might not otherwise have had. I think people want to be part of the conversation.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryTaylor SwiftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy’s surprise arrival in Berlin to sit in on the calls underlined Merz’s starring role in the diplomatic efforts.He has often cut a sure-footed figure on the world stage since taking office in May, includinglargely holding his own in an Oval Office face-offwith Trump in June, but Germans remain unconvinced by their leader’s performance overall.A poll this week showed the far-right Alternative für Deutschlandovertaking Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc by two points, making it the strongest party with 26% support in a fractured electoral landscape. The CDU/CSU, which won February’s general election with nearly 29% of the vote, now claims only 24% of voter intentions.The last time the AfD came out on top in the Forsa poll was in April, in a period of political limbo between the election and Merz’s new government taking office.“Mr Merz has already become unbearable after just 100 days – it’s time for an AfD government!” the party’s co-leader Alice Weidel crowed on X.The junior coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), received just 13% support, down three points from February, meaning that if an election were held this weekend, the current governing alliance, which is already showing significant cracks, would fail to win a majority.Merz, a divisive figure in German politics for decades with a long-nursed grudge against his fellow Christian Democrat Angela Merkel, has struggled to reverse a deep pessimistic streak that has taken hold in Europe’s top economy.GDP growth has failed to show a significant turnaround and isexpected to flatline again this year.The government’s decision in June not to deliver a reduction in electricity tax for households and small businesses also angered many voters, and adivisive debate about the pension agehas taken a political toll.On migration, which Merz has attempted to wrest as an issue from the AfD, his government has shown mixed results with a series of court setbacks and asimmering dispute with Polandover migration complicating his efforts to appear decisive.Even before taking office, he had spearheaded amajor spending packagefor domestic defence, infrastructure and aid to Ukraine. But fiscal hawks in his own camp, who trusted him to safeguard German budgetary rectitude, were appalled by a measure they saw as a violation of his previous campaign promises.Merz, who had no experience in government before becoming chancellor, has won the respect of many western allies for his staunch support forUkraineas Trump’s backing has wavered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voters,many of whom are criticalof Israel’s escalatiing military action in Gaza, welcomed the move.Merz’s effort to convince Trump not to sign off on a deal with Russia at Friday’ssummit with Vladimir Putin“over the heads of the Europeans and Ukrainians” looked to be another high-wire act of statesmanship, having failed to secure a seat at the table in Alaska for Zelenskyy.Matthias Gebauer, the security correspondent for the influential weekly Der Spiegel, said the European approach had been to “shower Trump with praise and deference and try to teach him a little about how to seal a peace deal”.“The best-case scenario as seen in Berlin would be the Europeans convincing Trump not to act hastily” and to keep up the pressure on Moscow, he said.“But everyone knows that chances aren’t very good. Trump is very impatient when it comes to Ukraine, and he cares much less about European interests than he does about the prospect of a quick deal with Putin.”Explore more on these topicsFriedrich MerzGermanyUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In the stern of a narrow wooden boat, 23-year-old Mustafa Hashim scans the marshes’ shallows, cutting the motor and switching to a traditional pole to avoid snagging on invasive roots or thickening mud.It takes him about half an hour to push through the shrinking marshes to reach Um al-Nea’aj,once a vibrant lake teeming with boats and birdsong. Now, the water is about half a metre deep.“Two years ago, there were families and fishermen everywhere,” Mustafa says, leaning out of the boat. “You could hear laughter, the splash of fish. Today, there’s nothing.”View image in fullscreenMustafa Hashim, 23, steers his boat to Lake Um al-Nea’aj. With the changing climate, drought and water extraction, navigation is becoming increasingly difficult.Photograph: Daniela SalaOn the horizon, flames from the Halfaya oilfield flicker.Iraq’s southern wetlands – known collectively as the Mesopotamian marshes – are among the world’s most endangered ecosystems. Their expanse is believed by some to have contained the biblical Garden of Eden. Recognised as aUnesco world heritage sitein 2016 andprotectedsince 2007 as awetland of international importanceunder the Ramsar Convention, the marshes once stretched nearly 120 miles (200km) from Nasiriya to Basra, forming a rich and vast aquatic world.But beneath the surface lies another kind of wealth: oil. Three strategic oil concessions overlap with the protected area: Halfaya, Huwaiza, and Majnoon. The latter,Majnoon, takes its name from the Arabic word for “crazy”: it is considered one of the world’s “super-giant” oilfields, with estimated reserves of up to38bn barrels(5.2bn tonnes).View image in fullscreenThree generations at home in Abu Khussaf village: Hashim Kasid, Mustafa Hashim and Kasid Wanis.Photograph: Daniela SalaBut the processes used to extract that oil have a voracious appetite for water. In a land already threatened by drought and desertification, the wetlands are being sucked dry.Mustafa’s grandfather, Kasid Wanis, 87, once took his boat from Hawizeh to Basra (about 70 miles) using nothing but a pole and his memory of the route. “We didn’t know what cars were. We didn’t need them. We were a people of water,” he says.His 41-year-old son Hashim, Mustafa’s father, grew up fishing these waters. But four years ago, he packed his nets away. “There’s not enough water to live,” he says quietly.Crude oil is Iraq’s economic lifeline, accounting for more than95% of its total exports and 69% of GDP. The country is the world’ssixth-largest crude producer, and the fate of the Hawizeh marshes is tightly bound to that of the oil industry. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe hassought alternatives to Moscow’s crude, with Iraq becoming a key source.The connection between oil extraction and water scarcity is direct and devastating. The Halfaya oilfield – in which the French energy company TotalEnergies alsoholds a stake– is operated by a consortiumled by PetroChina.Spanning an area three times the size of Paris, it includes 300 wells, three oil-processing plants, a water-treatment facility, and its own airport to transport foreign workers between the site and international airports. It is state-ownedPetroChina’s largest overseas project.View image in fullscreenFishermen from Qarmat Ali with the Nahr Bin Umar oilfield across the Shatt al-Arab River. They complain that due to pollution and the river’s increased salinity, they often pull in dead fish.Photograph: Daniela SalaAbout a decade ago, shortly after PetroChina began operations in the region, six water-pumping stations were built along the Tigris River – the lifeline that feeds the marshes.Every day, they extract about 60,000 cubic metres of water, roughly the daily consumption of a mid-sized city. That water is diverted to the oilfields, where it is injected into wells to boost crude extraction – a standard practice across the region.The pumping stations are drawing from already diminished reserves. Dams built upstream in Turkey and the Kurdish region of Iraqhave reduced water flow into southern Iraqby more than 50% since the 1970s, while Iranian dams on the Karkheh River – which feeds the Hawizeh marshes – have also reduced the region’s water supply. Now, feeding this industrial oil complex is costing residents their environment and their way of life, they say.These days, Hashim is less worried about dwindling fish stocks than about the military checkpoints. The canals that once led deep into the wetlands are cut off and patrolled. Armed guards control access, requiring local fishers and buffalo herders to hand over their ID cards to enter.The marshes have become a militarised zone. Authorities say the heightened police and military presence is meant to prevent smuggling and secure the nearby border with Iran just a few miles away. But according to residents, it also serves to suppress local protests.“The occupation follows the oil,” Mustafa says. “They want to cut us off from our land so they can exploit it without resistance.”View image in fullscreenA water buffalo’s carcass lying where Basra’s northern marshes once were. They dried up after a water-pumping station was built to supply the oilfields of the Italian firm ENI.Photograph: D SalaAs the marshes dried, Mustafa did what many others have been forced to do – he joined the industry he blames for their destruction. In 2023, he and his father worked as subcontracted labourers for PetroChina. “I saw it up close,” he says. “They call this development, but it’s destruction disguised as progress.”Saddam’s troublesome marsh dwellers left high and dry by drainageRead moreBy the summer, he had quit. That same year, drought peaked andprotests erupted across the region, and Mustafa joined them, organising blockades of oilfield access roads. “At first I told Mustafa to stop,” Hashim says. “But then he made me see it: this is political, and we can’t stay silent.”As well as its thirst for water, oil extraction in the region has been linked to devastating pollution. “This economy is literally killing people,” says Majid al-Saadi, director of the agriculture department in Maysan province. In late 2024, Saadi and his team compiled a confidential local government report into the effects of oil extraction on the region.The report, seen by the Guardian, documents alarming concentrations of hydrocarbons and heavy metals, chemicals into drinking water, and the collapse of local agriculture. “This is not just pollution – it’s expropriation,” Saadi says.View image in fullscreenWastewater and polluted foam pour into Basra’s Ashaar canal, next to the Shatt al-Arab River. Basra was once known as the ‘Venice of the Middle East’ but the canals are now full of sewage.Photograph: Daniela SalaIn early 2025, Saadi delivered the report to Iraq’s environment ministry, and says that officials promised to open talks with the oil ministry. But he is sceptical that any action will follow.For now, the expansion of oilfields in the area continues. Leaked photographs and videos, geolocated by the Guardian, now show excavators, pipelines, and workers digging directly into the heart of the protected zone – where the new Huwaiza oilfield is now under development.The exploration has been confirmed by satellite imagery analysis carried out for the Guardian by Placemarks, an independent geo‑analysis studio that uses satellite imagery and data to map environmental changes.View image in fullscreenFish sold in Nahr Bin Omar.

The new excavations would directly violate Ramsar protections. But the pact is not legally binding, and depends on states complying voluntarily.Iraq’s oil and environment ministries did not respond to requests for comment. In July, the interior ministry’s federal security affairs agency said in a social media post that environmental police had “conducted a field inspection … to monitor potential environmental violations resulting from the activities of oil companies in the Hor al-Huwaiza area”.It continued: “The field visit revealed that the pond had completely dried up, with no ongoing drilling, extraction, or disposal of oil waste at the site. However, there were excavations … being carried out by local companies contracted with the Chinese company Geo-Jade for exploration purposes and the future installation of oil rigs.”View image in fullscreenThe Basra water resources directorate.

Hundreds marched near the Halfaya oilfield, denouncing new drilling permits. “This isn’t just about today’s drilling rights,” Mustafa said. “We’re fighting so the next generation can know the wetlands our ancestors protected for thousands of years.”The unrest comes as Iraq boosts oil production amid a worsening water crisis. With another scorching summer under way, the head of Basra’s Human Rights Commission has called for a state of emergency to be imposed, warning of a looming humanitarian disaster from scarcity, pollution and rising toxicity.What remains in the marshes is a quiet war – over land, water and memory. “The government and the companies have turned us into a cake to be divided,” Mustafa says. “They treat these waters like a business opportunity.

He is to meet Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. The meeting will reportedly be held at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, a military facility crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the height of the cold war.Asked ifRussiawould face consequences if Putin did not agree to stop the war after the Alaska meeting, Trump said: “Yes, they will … very severe consequences.”1:21Trump says Putin faces ‘very severe consequences’ if no Ukraine truce agreed – videoThe president’s remarks followed what he described as a very good call with European leaders in which he consulted about the goal and strategy for his summit. He pleased Europe’s leadership by giving reassurances that a ceasefire was his priority and he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement.Trump’s approach at the video conference, as described by France’s Emmanuel Macron, appeared to reassure some of the leaders, who were making a final collective plea to the unpredictable US president that he had a duty to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty – and European security – at the talks.The European leaders spoke to Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, in a hastily convened one-hour meeting in an effort to shape Trump’s negotiating strategy. Zelenskyy and European leaders have been excluded from the summit and fear that Trump, intent on fulfilling his election campaign guarantee that he could easily end the bloodshed in Ukraine, will make concessions that compromise Ukraine’s future sovereignty.But Trump underlined his promise that the summit was not in itself a substantive negotiation and was what he described as a “feel-out” to test Putin’s terms to sign a temporary ceasefire that would then lead to talks with Kyiv. Trump said it had been a very good call, and that he rated it 10 out of 10.Britain, France and Germany, co-chairs of the so-called “coalition of the willing”, later laid out their position on the talks, reiterating that international borders must not be changed by force, and insisting that Ukraine must have “robust and credible security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.The three countries repeated that meaningful negotiations could happen only with a ceasefire in place, and called for Russia to face further economic sanctions if it did not agree to cease hostilities at the summit.Speaking alongside Zelenskyy in Berlin, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe wanted Trump to be successful in Alaska but that it had made clear to the US president that Ukrainian and European interests had to be protected at the summit.Merz called for a 30-day ceasefire, and then substantive talks. Putin has resisted a ceasefire for months.Setting out the key principles on which Europe is united he said: “Negotiations must be part of a common transatlantic strategy. Then they can ultimately be most likely to succeed. This strategy must continue to rely on strong support for Ukraine and necessary pressure against Russia. This also means, if there is no movement on the Russian side in Alaska, then the United States and we Europeans should … increase the pressure.”He added that there could not be any Russian legal ownership of Ukrainian territory. “President Trump knows this position, he shares it very extensively and therefore I can say we have had a really exceptionally constructive and good conversation with each other.”Macron said no serious discussions had taken place about Russian-Ukrainian land swaps involving the ceding of Ukrainian territory, and Trump had anyway underlined that any such discussions could only be negotiated with Kyiv. He said Trump would fight for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US and Russia and that such a meeting would be held in Europe.Graphic showing Russian advances in UkraineRussian advances in UkraineOne European diplomat said: “Overall the meeting was reassuring in that our points came across, but the question remains whether Trump will stick to the agreed script when he gets into the room with Putin.”Trump met heads of state and government leaders from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Poland and Finland, as well as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The issue of security guarantees for Ukraine was raised in the call with Trump, but no breakthrough was made in the US offering to provide practical support to the coalition.But the Europeans’ main objective had been to seek reassurances from the notoriously fickle Trump that he would not be lured into making irretrievable pledges requiring Ukraine to make concessions of land as the price for securing Putin’s agreement to a ceasefire. They also tried to extract assurances that Trump was still prepared to deploy as yet unused economic levers that could damage Russian revenues.Trump alone in a room with Putin is a recipe for disaster – just look to their last meetingRead moreEuropean leaders have been careful in public to welcome Trump’s summit but in private fear Trump is bent on improving US-Russia relations and sees a loss of Ukrainian sovereignty as a necessary and unavoidable price to secure that objective.Trump has been vague about his strategy, including the terms he will offer to induce Putin to agree to a ceasefire.Zelenskyy has vowed that the Ukrainian military will not voluntarily surrender territory in Donetsk and Luhansk, but Russia is insisting at least four Ukrainian regions will become Russian either at the negotiating table or through force.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump vented his fury at media reporting of his meeting with Putin, writing on Truth Social: “The media is being really, really unfair about my meeting with Putin. They keep quoting fired losers and really stupid people like John Bolton, who just said that even though the meeting is on US soil, ‘Putin has already won’. What the hell is this? We win EVERYTHING.”The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said further sanctions or secondary tariffs could yet be placed on Russia’s trading partners if the Alaska meeting did not go well.A confident Moscow dismissed the importance of Europe’s consultation with Trump. The foreign ministry spokesperson Alexei Fadeyev said: “We consider the consultations requested by the Europeans to be politically and practically insignificant actions. Verbally, the Europeans support the diplomatic efforts of Washington and Moscow to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but in reality the European Union is sabotaging them.”Russia says the Alaska meeting is likely to address the full gamut of Russian-American bilateral relations, and not just Ukraine. “We hope that this meeting will allow the leaders to focus on the full range of issues, from the crisis in Ukraine to the obstacles that hinder normal and constructive dialogue, which is crucial to ensuring international peace and stability,” the spokesperson said.The veteran Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will be present at the talks.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That is only the tip of the iceberg, however, with Fifa finding that female footballers were 29% more likely to face online abuse or threats at the Women’s World Cup in 2023 compared with their male equivalents at Qatar 2022.Numerous female athletes from tennis, athletics and across sport have also spoken out against misogyny, threats and abuse online. When Sheffield Hallam and University College Birmingham scrutinised policies of clubs in the Women’s Super League, Women’s County Championship and women’s rugby union championships, as well as governing bodies such as the Football Association, they were concerned about how little focus there was on combating abuse of female athletes.“Clubs lack adequate protection against social media and are failing to manage the increased attention on female athletes,” they say. “Given that female athletes face three times more online abuse than their male counterparts and are gaining more online visibility, this is especially concerning.”“No clubs or organisations differentiated the support or protection of social media policies for women’s sports, and female athletes were only explicitly mentioned in the FA’s Game Changer Objectives for the women’s game,” they add.The study, published this week in theCommunication & Sport journal, acknowledges some bodies have launched campaigns, but adds: “These acts are superficial and performative, lacking genuine care and protection, yet organisations are commended for them.“Campaigns often focus on racism while under-representing other forms of discrimination primarily targeting female players. This illustrates the lack of specificity regarding the protection of female athletes. Furthermore, it demonstrates how organisations and clubs are shirking their duty of care, shifting the responsibility onto athletes to safeguard themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

False information about the killer’s nationality, religion and asylum statusfuelled widespread unrestthroughout the country.But race campaigners believe the move may encourage focus on the racial background of suspects, and will lead to further rightwing conspiracy theories when information is not released to the public.Disclosing suspects’ ethnicity and migration status is dangerous | LettersRead moreEnny Choudhury, the co-head of legal at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “Releasing the ethnicity of everyone suspected of serious crimes will … simply fuel mistrust, deepen divisions, and make Black and brown communities more vulnerable to prejudice and harm.“Some point to cases like Southport, where rumours were quashed by releasing specific information. But building a blanket policy around this is dangerous. It turns race into a variable in policing and public debate – when we know the vast majority of serious crimes, including sexual offences, are committed by white men.“The role of the justice system should be to unite communities in pursuit of justice, not to single people out because of their ethnicity.”Peter Herbert, from the Society of Black Lawyers, questioned the role of the police around issues of ethnicity and nationality when forces still face allegations of institutional racism.He said: “The disclosure of ethnicity in particular is especially sensitive. People have never committed crimes on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality, and therefore the whole premise about releasing this information in certain cases sets a dangerous precedent.“One only has to remember the misinformation the surrounded the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes to understand the police themselves are often guilty of putting out misinformation which exacerbates public concern and fear.“Conspiracy theorists are rarely satisfied by official announcements and therefore tagging ethnicity and nationality, even in a limited amount of cases, opens a dangerous door to widespread xenophobia and racism, enabling the criminal justice system to be used for dog-whistle politics.”The guidance, which comes into immediate effect, was developed by the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council in recognition of “public concerns”, and to ensure police processes were “fit for purpose in an age of rapid information spread”.This monthReform UK accused authorities of hiding the identitiesand immigration status of two men, reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire.In May, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s winning of the Premier League title, Merseyside police disclosed in the public interest that the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a terrorist attack.Decisions on releasing such information will remain with police forces, with wider legal and ethical considerations also taken into account, the NPCC said. Verifying a suspect’s immigration status will be up to the Home Office, not the police.Diana Johnson, the policing minister, said the government will want police to release these details in “most cases”. She told the BBC that disinformation was a “bigger problem for society” and said that the government was working with social media providers to tackle the issue.The former Metropolitan police chief superintendent Dal Babu has warned of the “unintended consequences” of the new guidance, which he said could lead to more online speculation in cases where these details are not released.“The danger is there will be an expectation for police to release information on every single occasion,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The Home Office will not be encouraging the release of ethnicity and immigration status in all cases, and there are notable occasions when it has not. One such incident is the case of Rhiannon Whyte, from Walsall, West Midlands, whodied three days after being stabbedlast October. The ethnicity of the arrested man was not disclosed at the time by the police or the Home Office despite demands on social media. Deng Chol Majek, 19, an asylum seeker from South Sudan, has pleaded not guilty to her murder.Officials plan to consult police and other agencies whenever a request for information about a suspect’s ethnicity or immigration status is received. Ministers are said to be well aware of their responsibilities to the wider community and have already had to deal with a steady flow of requests for information about suspects.Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeUK criminal justiceShareReuse this content"

A government source said the announcement was likely to take place before then but that the timing was not yet confirmed.Political and industry figures in the north of England have urged Starmer for over a year to revive the Manchester leg of HS2 and to build Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), an east-west connection linking Liverpool to Hull.NPR is seen by some as critical to rebalancing the UK’s economy as it would connect potentially five of Britain’s major cities – including Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield – on a route that for decades has been choked by trundling old trains and the overloaded M62. A DfT source said the exact route had not yet been formally agreed.The NPR plan requires part of the HS2 construction between Crewe and Manchester to go ahead, raising hopes that ministers would also commit to some form of HS2 running to Birmingham and London.Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, has lobbied Starmer’s government extensively for both new rail networks. He has also warned, however, that any HS2 service that was high speed to the Midlands and a slower service in the north would be a “monument to the British mentality”.Hopes about imminent rail plans were raised last month when Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, left open the possibility of reprising a form of HS2 to Manchester, a route killed off by Rishi Sunak in October 2023.The government spent more than £500m buying up land and property north of Birmingham under the original plans of HS2 travelling north along two legs, one to Leeds and the other to Manchester.Alexander confirmed last month that the land for the Leeds leg would now be formally sold off after that part of the project was axed by Boris Johnson in 2021.However, she left open the prospect of a new rail project on the Birmingham to Manchester land, which is still owned by the government.Reeves said in June that she would “take forward our ambitions” for NPR in the coming weeks and it appears on the infrastructure pipeline quietly published by the Treasury last month.While NPR has effectively been costed by the Treasury, the huge sums involved in funding a northern HS2 mean that it would almost certainly only be viable through a form of private investment.Starmer and Reeves began a series of meetings earlier this month to prepare the budget, likely totake place in mid-to-late November. They will begin to prepare the ground for tax rises and reforms from next month.Government strategists believe that the budget should be a moment to argue that Britain must now make serious choices on growth and productivity. They say Starmer must forcefully rebut the charges that the poor state of the economy is down to individual tax and spend choices, saying it is instead a sign of the weakness of the economy’s fundamentals.Explore more on these topicsRail industryNorth of EnglandKeir StarmerEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I will set out the decisions I take in the responsible manner.”The chancellor’s comments come as the government braces for gloomy official figures that are expected to show the economy narrowly avoided flatlining in the second quarter.WithLabourunder mounting pressure over its management of the economy, City forecasters predict that Thursday morning’s update from the Office for National Statistics will find that GDP rose by 0.1% in the three months to June.The UK outpaced its G7 peers in the first quarter with growth of 0.7%. However, experts have blamed tax increases announced by Reeves in her first budget, last October, andDonald Trump’s trade warfor a marked hit to activity.The chancellor, aiming to shrug off the anaemic performance, argued the government was taking steps to break a “cycle of low growth” in which Britain had become trapped under Conservative governments.Laying out one of the central themes of her budget, which could be held in November, Reeves said the government would aim to boost the productive capacity of the economy by allocating investment for infrastructure projects and ripping up planning rules.“If renewal is our mission and productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our tools,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, progress to drive up the measure of output per hour of work has stalled in recent years.The chancellor’s renewed focus comes as the Treasury braces for a potentially devastating downgrade in productivity forecasts from the OBR, which could blow a £20bn hole in the chancellor’s tax and spending plans.With the shortfall made worse by a weak growth outlook,higher debt interest payments, and a series ofU-turns on welfare cuts, Reeves and the prime minister are laying the groundwork for tax rises and changes from September, before the autumn budget.The Guardianrevealed on Tuesdaythat the Treasury was looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax to reduce the deficit. Labour MPs have been pushing the idea of a wealth tax, but changes to inheritance tax thresholds could be similarly controversial.Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was “hardly surprising” that inheritance tax was “back in the frame”.It is among a limited suite of taxes that can be changed, despite the government’s commitment to not increase the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.“The system is so fiendishly complex that there are an enormous number of rules, and therefore tweaks, that the government could consider,” Coles added.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesBudgetLabourEconomic policyEconomicsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

TheBBCsaid it had removed “some of the language used” by Kandiah from a version posted online, saying it was not appropriate for the faith-based radio segment.However, Alf Dubs, a Labour peer who came to the UK as a child refugee, said he believed xenophobia was an accurate description of Jenrick’s comments in the Mail on Sunday last weekend in which Jenrick said the arrival of asylum seekers on small boats made him fear for his daughters’ safety and that he would not want them as neighbours.Speaking on Wednesday’s episode of the Today programme, Kandiah quoted from the Mail on Sunday. “[Jenrick] said: ‘I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.’ These words echo a fear many have absorbed. Fear of the stranger. The technical name for this is xenophobia.”He said such fears were irrational and that most arrivals on small boats were fleeing “war, persecution and famine”.Kandiah argued there was no evidence that migrants posed a greater danger to children than others, noting that most offences against children were committed by people they already knew.While the segment was cleared in advance, it is understood that BBC staff decided to review the programme and edit the language without being prompted by an external complaint. The corporation then apologised to Jenrick.In his Mail on Sunday article, Jenrick listed a series of crimes, including sexual offences, in which the suspects were migrants, saying: “It’s no wonder fair-minded people are furious.”2:01Refugee charity founder calls Robert Jenrick ‘xenophobic’ – videoHe wrote: “When I see these stories, I can’t help but think that it could have been one of my three young daughters. I certainly don’t want my children to share a neighbourhood with immigrant men with backward views who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing. And I don’t want anyone else’s family to have this forced on them either.”He added: “My eldest daughter is 14 and already I worry about her safety as she starts to do things independently. It’s challenging enough without this to contend with.”Shortly after Thought for the Day was broadcast, Jenrick posted on X: “On BBCRadio 4this morning listeners were told that if you’re concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you’re racist. Wrong. You’re a good parent.”Kandiah is understood not to have been banned by the BBC from returning on the show. It is believed that his intention was to make inclusive points about community cohesion and welcoming the stranger and that he is distressed about the row.A BBC statement said of the item: “While its reflection on fear in society from a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion.”Items for Thought For The Day are approved by two BBC staff, the producer working on the item and someone else more senior, although the latter group can be very busy, with decisions potentially delegated.

Sometimes, one can trust people to make the connections without naming names”.She added: “Thought for the Day presenters have to tread a narrow tightrope. As the only slot on the Today programme with no right of reply, it’s vital to maintain balance and to avoid partisan politics, while trying not to be banal or platitudinous.“It takes many hours to produce the short script, working with producers who in my experience are highly professional and understand the boundaries and restrictions around what can and can’t be said.”Lord Dubs, who came to the UK from Prague, said: “I think anything that encourages hostility and is undermining mutual respect, undermining compassion, is xenophobic in its intent and xenophobic in its consequences. And that’s not the sort of thing we would expect a senior politician in the Tory party to be talking about.“I think it’s a shabby comment and it’s very dangerous, because what it does do is to lessen the likelihood of local communities being supportive of refugees.”The row comes amid rising tensions over asylum accommodation, with protests held outside hotels housing migrants and refugees. There were demonstrations in Epping, Essex, after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with a sexual offence against a schoolgirl.Additional reporting byHarriet SherwoodExplore more on these topicsRadio 4BBCRadio industryRobert JenrickConservativesImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham should have been able to announce themselves kings of the continent here in Udine, flimsy though any grand statements after a Uefa Super Cup win might be. Thomas Frank had challenged them to back up theheroics of Bilbaowith a statement in the Friulian heat and, by the evening’s end, he should have been basking in the kind of start that can define a new manager’s tenure.‘Very, very proud’: Thomas Frank hails Tottenham players after PSG defeatRead moreInstead he received a reminder that there is no quick fix to some deep-rooted habits. For long periods Spurs, faced with a lethargicParis Saint-Germain, resembled a perfectly imprinted version of the Frank playbook. They pummelled their ­opponents in the air, their two-goal lead owing much to well-executed free-kicks and plenty more havoc arising besides. On top of that they looked at ease with a three-man back line that gave a stellar attack little encouragement. With five minutes of regulation time left there was no sign they would be subjected to penalty-inflicted torment.Then the PSG substitute Lee Kang‑in rifled past Guglielmo Vicario from 20 yards and, for the first time, theChampions League holderslooked clear-eyed. By contrast ­Tottenham had sunk back and there was a familiar yawning dread when, simply unable to find a way out by now, they saw six added minutes held up on the touchline.In the fourth of them Gonçalo Ramos glanced in a cross from the otherwise quiet Ousmane Dembélé and Frank will be aware of the surgery still needed on a squad whose backbone is too accustomed to splintering.Not that anyone could judge too harshly. There will certainly be no recriminations for Micky van de Ven or Mathys Tel, who both erred in the shootout and rendered a Vitinha miss irrelevant. Van de Ven was denied by the highly scrutinised PSG debutant Lucas Chevalier, who had a mixed night, and Tel wafted his spot kick wide. It left Nuno Mendes to score the clincher and leave a resounding message that the best in class are never really down and out.View image in fullscreenGonçalo Ramos scores Paris Saint-Germain’s injury-time equaliser from close range.Photograph: Dénes Erdős/APUsed correctly it is a lesson that will serve Spurs and Frank admirably. They looked well ahead of schedule for the majority, even allowing for the fact PSG appeared addled by a calendar that leaves them neither rested nor match sharp. Frank wants to add at least one big ticket signing to their attack but will have been enthused by the ball carrying of Mohammed Kudus, who was both tireless and effective, and some of the Ghanaian’s combinations with Richarlison. When Tottenham expressed themselves it was because, full of running, they had earned the right.But it was their booming, dominant presence from crosses that caused the most unrest. In the warm-up Frank’s players had lined up en masse to practise attacking set pieces, an unusual sight in time usually given to rondos and shooting drills. It foreshadowed what would follow. Kevin Danso’s long throw was utilised from the opening minutes and, the first time Spurs won a free-kick on halfway, Vicario was called to launch it boxwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vicario unloaded another of those long, deep deliveries and Cristian Romero connected beyond the far post. The ball ricocheted and, after Chevalier brilliantly touched João Palhinha’s strike onto the bar, Van de Ven followed up. Frank referred afterwards to a “special operation” from such routines and, at that point, Spurs were delivering on their mission.Three minutes into the second half a deep Pedro Porro free-kick found Romero, announced before kick-off as the new captain, peeling around the back to plant a downwards header across Chevalier. In truth the keeper should have saved, applying a painfully weak hand to Romero’s attempt.

People with ADHD are also disproportionately represented within the criminal justice system.Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that for many patients, medication can help alleviate hyperactivity, impulsivity and the inattention. But there has been more limited evidence on whether these improvements translate into benefits in everyday life, at a time when the increasing number of people being diagnosed has fuelled a debate about the possibility of “overdiagnosis”.The number of prescriptions being issued in England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medicationhas risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic.The latest study, which the researchers say is the largest and most rigorous of its kind, used Swedish national registers from 2007 to 2020 to examine the effects of ADHD drug treatment in 148,581 individuals aged six to 64 years with a new diagnosis of ADHD.The team used a technique called target trial emulation, which aims to apply the design principles of a clinical trial to existing medical records through the use of strict inclusion criteria, follow-up timeframes and the use of statistical techniques to compensate for the fact that people were not randomly assigned to “treatment” or “placebo” arms.Dr Zheng Chang, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and senior author of the research, said: “It’s now considered one of the most rigorous methods for analysing observational data. However, since we don’t have the real randomisation data it is not bias-proof.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among people with recurrent events, there were statistically significant reductions linked to all five outcomes,the paper in the British Medical Journal reports.“When clinicians discuss the possible use of medication with families, oftentimes there is not a focus on what are the risks if you don’t treat,” said Cortese. “If left untreated, there will be unfortunately some risk. Now we have evidence that medication can reduce this risk.”Prof Adam Guastella, of the Children’s Hospital Westmead Clinical School at the University of Sydney, said: “Such benefits have been shown repeatedly in previous studies, but the large sample size, use of a national registry, and more sophisticated analysis give greater confidence in these results that findings aren’t explained by something else other than medication use.“People should know that if ADHD medications work for them and their child, that there will likely be many other positive impacts on life from treatment. Such effects will not work for everyone and there is still a need to understand why many individuals benefit from ADHD medication and some do not.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disordernewsShareReuse this content"

Anglers aged 13 and over must hold a rod licence to fish for freshwater species such as carp in England and Wales. Lammy failed to land a catch, but “all of my kids did”, Vance said.The Foreign Office said an “administrative oversight” meant licences had not been obtained in advance. Lammy bought them as soon as he was made aware, and wrote to theEnvironment Agencyto acknowledge the breach. “He also thanked them for their work protecting Britain’s fisheries,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said.The agency confirmed the licences had since been bought. All fish caught during the visit were returned to the water.The fishing trip formed part of a wider UK tour by Vance, who was on holiday in the Cotswolds with his wife, Usha, and three children. The visit has combined family time with private political meetings and a heavy security presence in the normally quiet Oxfordshire countryside.Vance’s stay at Dean Manor, an 18th-century Georgian home, reportedly arranged by the former chancellor George Osborne, led to road closures, police checkpoints and the installation of a temporary helipad. Pippa and Johnny Hornby, who own the property, later apologised to residents for the “circus” caused by the vice-president’s security detail.0:54Cotswolds residents protest against JD Vance visit – videoProtesters from the Stop Trump Coalitionheld a “Vance not welcome” party in nearby Charlbury, attended by about 100 people carrying placards and cakes mocking the Republican politician.

Here’s how it could affect youTreasury targeting inheritance tax changes to help plug UK deficitHilary OsborneWed 13 Aug 2025 08.40 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 18.52 EDTShareThe Treasury is looking at waysto increase the money it collects through inheritance tax(IHT), sources have told the Guardian.Ideas on the table include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one possibility being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual can donate.Any changes would come on top of other moves the government has already made to close IHT loopholes.What is inheritance tax?IHT is a tax paid on someone’s assets (property, possessions and money) after they die, but only if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold.The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold – currently £325,000 for an individual.However, the rules are complex and the threshold is different if a property is involved and can be higher if you are married or in a civil partnership and your partner did not use all of their allowance when they died.What could be changed?You can currently give away all of your money and assets to your spouse or civil partner, charities or political parties, or to anyone else as long as you time it right. Otherwise, there could be an IHT bill for your estate when you die.One idea reportedly being considered is a lifetime cap on how much individuals can give away – anything above which would attract tax. This is the case in lots of other countries, including the US.What do you mean about timing it right?There is a currently a seven-year rule on gifts. If you give something to someone other than the exempt group, IHT may be due if you die within seven years of doing so. These gifts are called “potentially exempt transfers” because if you live long enough they are IHT-free.The rule is designed to stop you giving away lots of assets at the last minute.Anyone dealing with an estate – the executors or a solicitor employed by them – will be expected to declare anything the deceased has given away in the seven years before he or she died. The gifts are added up – starting with the earliest in the seven years – plus the rest of the estate. If the total comes to more than £325,000, it passes the IHT threshold.View image in fullscreenAnyone dealing with an estate will be expected to declare anything the deceased has given away in the seven years before he or she died.Photograph: DNY59/Getty ImagesFor the first three years after you have made the gift, if you die it could attract a tax bill of 40%. After that the potential tax bill goes down incrementally each year, so in the last of the seven years it is 8%.An alternative to a lifetime cap could be a change to the seven-year rule – the period in which you can make potentially exempt transfers could be reduced, and the taper made less generous.Currently not everything you give away will be included in the tax department’s calculations: there are allowances you can use to make gifts.What allowances are available?Every tax year you can give away up to £3,000 without there being a potential for IHT. The money can go to one person or many.You can also make “small gifts” of up to £250 a year to as many people as you want, as long as you have not used any of the £3,000 allowance on them.Birthday and Christmas presents do not count towards these allowances.There are also allowances for wedding and civil partnership gifts, of up to £5,000 if it is your child who is tying the knot.Regular payments – for someone’s rent or into a savings account, for instance – could also be tax free. For these to qualify as non-taxable they need to be paid out of your monthly income and leave you with enough money to live on. These are called “normal expenditure out of income”.I’ve received a gift from someone who died, will I have to give part back?Gifts are counted first before the rest of the estate, so most IHT will be paid for via other assets. However, in those cases where the total value of qualifying gifts is over the IHT threshold, the recipient may have some tax to pay.It’s a wise idea for the donor and the receiver to keep records of large gifts, particularly if they are purposely part of IHT planning. This will make it easier for the executors to work out what, if anything, must be paid.What changes has the government already made?In last year’s budget it made changes to the allowances around businesses and agricultural land. From April next year a 20% tax rate will be applied to the value of farms and businesses worth more than £1m when they are passed on. Previously it was possible to pass these on with no IHT bill.Another change announced thenwill bring unused pensions into IHT. From April 2027 any unused fund that is being passed on will be included in the estate for IHT calculations. Currently pension money can be passed on without a bill.The government this weekconfirmedthat the pension rule will apply even if the person saving into the fund was too young to access it at the time of their death.View image in fullscreenSince April, a 20% tax rate has been applied to the value of farms and businesses worth more than £1m when they are passed on.Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images Group/GettyHow much does IHT raise?Only 4.6% of deaths resulted in IHT being paid in the tax year 2022-23, according to thelatest figuresfrom HMRC. The average effective tax rate for estates was 13%, after accounting for all the different reliefs and exemptions that might apply depending on the individual circumstances. That compares with the headline rate of 40%.It is impossible to predict how much closing loopholes will bring in as changing the rules tends to lead to a change in behaviour. Not long after the pension change was announced there weresigns that wealthy investors were starting to withdraw moneyfrom their funds.A lifetime limit might change people’s behaviour as it could encourage people not to give away money early in their life. What difference it makes to the ultimate tax take will depend on the level it is set at and how it is applied to people who have already given away large sums under the current system.Explore more on these topicsInheritance taxTaxHMRCConsumer affairsPensionsexplainersShareReuse this content"

What will happen this time?Wed 13 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 18.50 EDTShareThe lessons of Helsinki are clear: putting Donald Trump alone in a room withVladimir Putinis an unpredictable – and often dangerous – affair.It was 2018 whenthe two leaders met at the invitation of Sauli Niinistö, the Finnish president, to discuss a collapse in US-Russia relations, accusations of elections interference, and the grinding war in east Ukraine, among other topics.By the time he came out of the room, Trump looked dazzled by the Kremlin leader. Asked at a press conference about the conclusions of the US intelligence community that Russia had interfered in the elections, Trump said:“President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be.”Fiona Hill, Trump’s senior Kremlin adviser on the US national security council, later said that she had considered pulling a fire alarm or faking a medical emergency to end the press conference.Mutual inconvenience: why Alaska for the Trump-Putin summit on Ukraine?Read moreSomehow, the stakes are even higher asTrump and Putin plan to meet on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, where Trump has said the two will discuss “land swapping” in Putin’s first meeting with a G7 leader since his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. European leaders are fearful that Trump could once again emerge from a closed-door meeting preaching the Kremlin gospel.The White House has been lowering expectations for the summit – a sign that no concrete deal is on the table.“This is really a feel-out meeting, a little bit,”Trump said during a news conference on Monday. He said he would know within the first few minutes whether or not Putin was ready for a ceasefire and would pass that on to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. “I may say, ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting.’ Or I may say, ‘We can make a deal,’” he said.But Putin will still try his luck to shape Trump’s image of what a peace deal could entail in a way that will bring maximum benefit to the Kremlin. Putin “wants a deal with Trump that will be presented to Kyiv and other European capitals as a fait accompli,” wrote John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and a former ambassador toUkraine. The lack of invites for European leaders “has the smell of the Yalta Conference in 1945 … where the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom decided the fate of half of Europe over the heads of those nations”.Europe and Ukraine have pushed back. Ahead of the summit, Zelenskyy said thatUkraine would not cede Russia territory that it could use to launch a new offensive, effectively ruling out Trump’s predictions that “there will be some [land] swapping”.The ad-hoc nature of Trump’s approach to foreign policy can play into the hands of the US’s foreign adversaries – but it has frustrated them too. Leaders such as Xi Jinping, the president of China, are said to prefer more advance work before getting into the room with Trump specifically because of his unpredictability.Russiatoo has become frustrated with the lack of process in the Trump administration.But that has not stopped Putin from taking his chances by stepping into the ring with Trump for their first one-on-one meeting of this administration.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the meeting between Trump and Putin would be one-on-one, and a “listening exercise” for Trump during which he could suss out the Russian point of view.“That’s the way Trump does it. He just wings it,” said Hill, the former presidential aide.“And Putin likes sparring … he prides himself on being able to be light on his feet in these kinds of settings,” she said.The lack of advisers in the room has raised a key question: will any agreements made in a private setting, even if interpreters or other notetakers are present, lead to lasting outcomes?“It’s kind of like a meeting falling in the forest,” said Hill.A similar event took place during the Helsinki summit, when Trump exited the room and said that he had made an agreement with Putin for US law enforcement to have access to the GRU operatives accused of influencing the US elections. Putin later said in turn that he would have access to Americans responsible for pushing for the anti-corruption Magnitsky Act.“Of course, that went nowhere,” Hill said. “Trump hadn’t fully understood what Putin had said to him.”“In other words, [just because] there is a meeting doesn’t [mean it will] solidify into something,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussiaUS foreign policyUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The attention has only led to more raids being reportedWed 13 Aug 2025 12.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 19.50 EDTShareFor many undocumented immigrants living in the US, the constant threat of Ice raids has turned their homes into prisons. Leaving the house to go to work, school, buy groceries or the doctor’s office all carry unthinkable risks.It’s a problem that Joshua Aaron wanted to tackle. A former indie musician (he played bass in 2000s buzz band The Rosenbergs and later fronted his own group Stealing Heather) turned app entrepreneur, he set about making an app that could spot Ice and alert people, the same way drivers let other drivers know about traffic stops on Waze.Launched without fanfare and with no intention of profit in April 2025, IceBlock offers real-time alerts about the presence of agents – while, Aaron claims, fiercely guarding the anonymity of its users. Within two months, the app had soared on the charts in Apple’s app store – prompting the US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to attack the app and its founder, claiming they were “obstructing justice”. She claimed she wanted to work with the Department of Justice to try to prosecute CNN for reporting on the app.I don’t care about people’s data … I care about keeping people safeJoshua Aaron, IceBlock founderNoem’s intervention ensured the app topped the charts for a number of days (although it has since fallen out of the top 100). Then last month Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, was fired from her Department of Justice job in Austin, Texas. The couple believe it was clear “retaliation” for the app, despite Feinstein not being involved in the app’s creation or promotion.Aaron is an unlikely figure in this space – he has a brash, rock’n’roll demeanor and not much experience in immigration activism. His background has led to some questions about how well the app protects its users, especially as it asks you to keep your location data on at all times. But a number of independent investigations have shown he is managing to keep users anonymous.Aaron spoke with the Guardian a week after his wife’s firing.First of all, what happened to your wife? Why was she fired?They fired her as retribution against me. They can’t do shit to me. I’m not going to be afraid. So they fired her.View image in fullscreenThe IceBlock app.Photograph: Courtesy of IceBlockWere they explicit inwhy they were firing her?No, that’s the crazy part, in her termination letter, she got accused of lack of candor but they didn’t mention the app. Butthe Department of Justice responded to every journalist that reached out in, like, five minutes. They had a prepared statement for an auditor in Austin? In the US trustee department? They have nothing to do with immigration. They have nothing to do with anything else with the DoJ, they’re a whole separate division that handles bankruptcy.What did they say?They had this prepared statement, they accused her of threatening law enforcement officers and endangering the lives of Ice agents and all this horrible shit. It was very different from her termination letter. The whole thing started when LauraLoomer doxed her on Xand then said that she spoke to Tom Homan.Homan goes on Newsmaxand says that he spoke to the DoJ, which obviously is [headed by] Pam Bondi. Twenty-four hours later, my wife gets a termination letter from the deputy director of the DoJ. It was pretty obvious that it went from Loomer to Homan and to Bondi to “You’re fired.” That was it.[A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said they discovered his wife, Feinstein, has a sizable interest in All U Chart Inc, the company that holds the IP for IceBlock. In a statement, they said: “ICEBlock is an app that illegal aliens use to evade capture while endangering the lives of ICE officers by disclosing their location. This DOJ will not tolerate threats against law enforcement officers.”Aaron acknowledged that his wife always owns a 20% share in any company he starts. He describes this as a security precaution: if something were to happen to him, Feinstein would have the legal ability to take over the company without complications. He says she had no involvement in the development or operation of the IceBlock app.]It must be tough for your family.She worked there for almost a decade. She has decades of experience in the private sector, and she’s really, really good at what she does, and was honestly beloved by everyone she worked with. They just basically fired her and accused her of all this horrible stuff, and none of it’s true. It really, really sucks. She misses it terribly.Are you worried about other ways theTrump administrationmight retaliate?Well, you have Pam Bondi accusing me andsaying, I better “watch out.” Please, come on. I better watch out? Why? I’m protected under the first amendment. This is perfectly legal, and I made sure of that – I checked with multiple constitutional attorneys and criminal attorneys before I released this app, because I was concerned about whether I’m protected. And everyone agreed 100% this is protected speech.Can you explain briefly how IceBlock works?Well it can only be downloaded from the US app store, and people can only report sightings within a five-mile radius of where they are currently. Then all sightings get deleted after four hours. So let’s say there are 100 people in a five-mile area, and one person sees Ice – they’re walking down the street, whatever – and they go, “Oh, shit.” And they report it. All the other users in that five-mile radius get an immediate notification that shows up on their phone.The app has been live for quite a few months. Do you get the sense it’s actually being used to by people who are worried aboutIce?I have no idea, because it’s 100% anonymous. We don’t track those metrics. I get asked all the time: “Where are most of your users?” I have no fucking idea. “How many sightings do you get per hour?” I don’t know. We don’t track this. It’s so hard to answer these basic questions that normal apps would be able to answer because there is the whole core principle of anonymity. We don’t have that data, and I don’t want it. The only thing I can tell you is that currently on the app we have 445 sightings nationwide [likely over a four-hour window due to the fact that sightings stay up for four hours once reported] and we have just about 1 million users that have this installed on their phones right now.But is it being downloaded by well-meaning liberals who support what you’re doing? Or is it doing its practical job and helping undocumented people as a practical tool in their lives? Maybe we just can’t know that yet?I would say this, most people who download the app are doing it to keep themselves safe, so they want to know what’s going on around their five-mile radius. So yes, I think it’s very much being used for how it’s intended to be used. I didn’t want to have to build this, but it is a necessity. It is a tool as this early warning system that does keep people safe, and it is, I think, giving people peace of mind, especially those who are most affected by it or most at risk. It allows them to go to that restaurant or walk around that neighborhood with a little bit of peace of mind.View image in fullscreenThe IceBlock app.Photograph: Courtesy of IceBlockWhat were the initial fears and challenges? Did you worry about whether the Apple app store was going to allow it on?How confident was I I could do it? I don’t want to sound egotistical – and don’t print this so I sound like a fucking asshole – but, dude, I can fucking do it. Of course, I could do it. Even with my music career, I built audio studios, and I was a producer and a mix engineer, and I designed gear. So I’ve always kind of been on that tech engineering side of things like, that’s just how my brain works. And I’ve been coding a healthcare app for the past four and a half years. So as far as could I write the code? Could I make it happen? This is a crazy easy app. Would it be approved by Apple? That was an interesting one, because nothing like it has ever been done before.When I brought it to Apple and I submitted it to the app store, it got pushed back, and it took three weeks of going back and forth with Apple’s legal department and higher-ups in Apple’s app review, and there were conversations almost on a daily basis with senior people there saying: “Is this even legal? Can we do this? Are we going to get in trouble for having this?”Apple had a hard time wrapping their head around it, because they were like, “What do you mean you’re never going to make money? What do you mean you’re never going to track anything?” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the point. I don’t care.” I don’t care about people’s data as far as, like, being able to get analytics or track them or sell their data. I don’t care about any of that. I care about keeping people safe. That is literally the whole point. Eventually they allowed it on.Because there are no user accounts, and no way of you seeing what’s happening on the app, there’s no way to block bad actors. Does that mean there is a possibility of people reporting false sightings?I can’t verify the sightings without driving to rural Indiana and seeing if they’re there. I’ve put in safeguards: you can only report a sighting once every five minutes so you can’t just spam the database; all sightings are deleted after four hours; it has to be a real address – you can’t type in 123 Main Street; and you can only report within your own five-mile radius. So with all of those safeguards – are there any false sightings? Yes, of course there are. Are they prevalent? No, because it would be too time-consuming. And what’s the worst-case scenario for a false sighting anyway? That a user gets a notification on their device and says: “Hey, I’ll stay away from that address for a couple hours?” Who gives a shit.How Trump has supercharged the immigration crackdown - in dataRead moreSo beyond helping people – what’s your personal interest in developing these apps? You’re also working on a healthcare app, which is also focused on keeping patient data private.Yes, my whole thing is very, very privacy-focused. I don’t use Gmail. I run my own mail servers. I run my own web servers. I have always done that because I just don’t trust these companies who are reading all of your messages, and they’re doing it to harvest your data and market to you. I want myself to be private. I’m an individual. I think that lent quite a bit to the way that I thought about IceBlock.I’ve had myIceBlock openwhile we’ve been on the phone, and there’s been one reported sighting in myarea.Yeah, isn’t that nice to know that? I mean, you’re British right, obviously you are not a native-born American. So now you know maybe don’t go over in that area for the next couple hours. Not a big deal.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarityThis article was 13 August 2025; a previous version incorrectly said that Carolyn Feinstein was arrested, not fired.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationinterviewsShareReuse this content"

As the film is set in 1593, the reference by screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard is clearly to The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which romances overcome deceit and disguise and the clown Launce has a canine companion, Crab, who is prone to steal the show.During times of tight cultural budgets, such as now, there is an old theatre joke about the RSC being forced to put on One Gentlemen of Verona. Joanna Bowman’s revival doesn’t quite go that far but has radically cut the text (removing some but not all smut, the antisemitism and some sub-par poetry) for a running time advertised at 80 minutes but in performance 90. The aim is to attract younger audiences: the evening show time is a bedtime-friendly 5pm.View image in fullscreenFull production numbers … The Two Gentlemen of Verona at Stratford.Photograph: Helen MurrayParents and teachers will perhaps advise their charges not to find templates for future relationships in the ruthless trickery between friends Valentine (Jonny Khan) and Proteus (Lance West) when both fall for Sylvia (Siân Stephens), prompting Proteus to fool cruelly current girlfriend Julia (Aisha Goodman). As Stephens is making a professional stage debut and the other three are also early in their careers, this confident and engaging quartet suggest the RSC has access to a flow of future talent.And, as ever, they do well to compete with the bit with the dog. Bowman and stage-handler Launce (a gamely upstaged Stu McLoughlin) completely fail to make Lossi, a silver haired lady lurcher, the “sourest-natured dog that lives” as Crab is called in the text. Lossi draws an instant “Aaaah!” from young and some older throats, especially when giving a presumably impromptu wide yawn during one of the longer speeches.View image in fullscreenYawning on cue … Lossi as Crab with her stage handler Stu McLoughlin as Launce.Photograph: Helen MurrayAlthough some scholars make rigorous cases for the play being underrated, it seems reasonable to infer that Shakespeare was relying on Crab to divert the audience from sections that might have done with a refill of the quill. The director follows suit by adding other hectic distractions when the dog is not on. Actors slide down poles on Francis O’Connor’s two-tier scaffolded set and, in the multitalented cast of 10, only Lossi doesn’t play an instrument. The act four song, Who Is Sylvia?, usually a solo, becomes a full production number (composer John Patrick Elliott, music director Dan de Cruz) with guitars, violin and chorales.In Shakespeare in Love, the dramatist informs an appalled Henslowe that there will be “no dog at all” in Romeo and Juliet. But, if there were awards for onstage dogs (the Bonies?), Lossi would win one and the RSC should probably check out the possibility of walkies-on roles elsewhere in the canon. Until then, she and her human co-stars provide a late summer afternoon’s dream.AtThe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreWilliam ShakespeareRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It turns out Ben Stokes is cool. England’s Test captain could be seen wandering towards the Utilita Bowl, cap pulled down, an hour into the opening instalment of the Southern Braves versus Northern Superchargers women-men double-header. It was here that the good thing happened.Stokes spotted the pair of gawping kids across a mini-roundabout, went across, said hello, signed a piece of paper, then kept on trudging past the otherwise oblivious passersby, leaving a couple of very happy pre-converted fans.He is, in his own words, “milling around” the Hundred during his injury layoff, present to offer aura, optics, star power.

To be fair, this was based on an extended totting up of its silly format, cult-like tone, failure to meet its own aims, and the destructive nature of its subsidised scheduling.But yes, obviously the Hundred isn’t as bad as rebel tours or concussion. It’s better than the recently collapsed Caymans Max 60 League, described as “the Fyre festival of cricket”, as unpaid players fled the islands. So yes. Better than that.But the article was enough to draw accusations of curmudgeonliness, not getting it, being insufficiently progressive-by-rite and so on. “Yeah. I saw your piece,” was the verdict in the Utilita Bowl press room from one of the Hundred’s warmer followers. Not enjoyed. Read. Let us be clear.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes put his star power to good use by spending time with young fans, taking selfies and signing autographs.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe punishment is this. A day at the Hundred. Or at least, the requirement to talk about the other stuff too. Because the fact is, plenty of people do seem to like this, or are at least willing to consume it. At times here the Rose Bowl was close to four-fifths full, this for a non-international match between two recently invented teams. What is happening here? And is it good?Even on a grudging lime-green August morning the Utilita is a lovely venue, from woodland rising up behind the tented main stand, to the groovy raised walkways around its sides plastered with wrap stalls and hog roasts and ale bars.People came rolling into the stands from 10.27am, an orderly conga of bags and shorts and hoodies, the complete English summer day defence system. The stage looked shiny, epic and coherently glammed-up, with the DJ stage cranked at one end and the Sky Sports commentary hutch primly in place, like the world’s most illustrious kebab van.“Let’s get at it, the Utilita Bowl! Come on let’s go. I can’t hear you! Pump it up!” To be fair to the in-house DJ, who was pretty good all day, 10.56am isn’t the ideal timeslot for the purveying of vibes. But the crowd was still good here, close to 4,000 for the start of the women’s match, and family-dominated, reflecting the school holiday scheduling. What else is going on in Hampshire anyway? What’s On Hampshire recommends Portsmouth Cathedral, the Fordingham reptile exhibition and a Jane Austen tour of Basingstoke.For once, everything is in favour of this thing actually working, which is not a flaw or a gotcha or evidence of betrayal, but a rare instance of good cricket planning. The lesson is: if you sell it, they will come. If you make it dead cheap, they will come. Why didn’t anyone care enough to work this out before?From the start the vibe was super-maxed, super-happy, super-up. But the women’s game was also sabotaged by its early start time and by a slow, tired pitch. This is a recurrent problem: 10 for one off 15 balls became 26 for three. Phoebe Litchfield, a brilliant young batter, played one thrilling slash through covers and then chopped on a ball that veered in late.Cue tongues of fire, booming music, and a slight haze of disappointment. Annabel Sutherland, who has three Test hundreds, scratched about as the ball nibbled and stuck. Hollie Armitage played a late blinder, but also one of those knocks that tells you conditions have eased and you’re about to lose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crowd seemed happy enough, engaged enough, jabbed and nudged along by the in-house soundtrack. Is this good? It felt good. It’s hard to argue with a plan being executed.The issues with the Hundred are the format itself, which is too cramped, too breathless, too mega-dumbed for players to really excel. The gushing tone could be dialled back from desperate and alienating to simply encouraging. Crowding out every other format from the centre of the summer for this still seems strange.View image in fullscreenLaura Wolvaardt was in swashbuckling form as Southern Brave brushed aside Northern Superchargers.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe good things are also pretty obvious in the flesh. The England and WalesCricketBoard has been obliged by its own jamboree to fund and showcase the women’s game properly. People are watching it, consumers rather than fans, who may or may not learn to love this thing, but people all the same.And this has always been the underlying tension here, a question of ownership. Who is this actually for anyway? A clue arrived the same morning as the Braves versus the Superchargers in the form of an email to every Hundred subscriber warning that “as part of the change of ownership” the Hundred would now be passing your personal data to the franchise owners as part of the sale.Oh. OK then. But then, this was always the deal. The month of August in England now belongs to a different class of person, not families and virgin eyeballs, but tech titans, investors, finance bros. Taking the money now for a slice of your own tomorrow: this is not a free hit. Something is lost with it, control ceded.View image in fullscreenGraham Clark of Northern Superchargers roars with delight after smashing a six off the last ball to beat Southern Brave.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ECB/Getty ImagesIn reality the Hundred is still in its chrysalis phase. It has always been a gateway, if only for private equity to make its way into the summer. How long will the Hundred be the Hundred? How long before the thing itself is junked, expanded and formalised in other directions.But this was still a good Hundred day. Fun was had, cricket delivered, that weirdly shallow, bolt-on Hundred vibe revved up to 11. By late afternoon the men’s game had produced a genuine thriller, won with a last-ball six from Graham Clark. And in that moment it did feel cool; or at least like a strange, plastic format, product-sport, finding its own kind of moment.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two performers of Emergency Chorus open with a curious duet, striking a series of poses like human semaphore signs. Hard to know what it is all about, but it is the start of the show and they do it with poise and concentration so you give them the benefit of the doubt.Indeed, things then seem to come into focus with a scene about barometers and the pioneering days of weather forecasting. The Victorians knew they were on to something when they realised they could measure changes in air pressure, but it took time to interpret the signs. A jokey scene much later on, in which Potter-Sweet plays an earnest and garrulous interviewer at a science conference quizzing Kulvichit as a taciturn, long-bearded mystic hermit, confirms Ways of Knowing is about attempts to predict the future.Pickled Republic review –  a curious cabaret of jarring vegetablesRead moreBut this raises two questions. One is what the intervening scenes are supposed to add. There is a vigorous dance sequence in which the two stamp out a syncopated beat for rather a long time, which could mean anything, and a gloomy section crawling around a coal mine – a reference, perhaps, to deep time and the bedding down of carbon over centuries. Or perhaps not.The other question is, even if we could puzzle out a meaning from this deliberate collision of scenes and styles, what do Potter-Sweet and Kulvichit have to say about it? It is true that in this time of climate emergency, artists find it hard to conceive of a future. But this introspective show, one of the winners of the 2025Underbelly Untapped award, seems nervous about even doing that much.

Tim Dowling’s week in the world’s most divisive shoesTwenty years after they first hit the shelves, five-fingered shoes are apparently having a big fashion moment. But what is it like to wear them in public?Tim DowlingWed 13 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 07.04 EDTShareBack in January, Vogue madea bold headline prediction: “This Freaky-Chic Shoe Will Be Everywhere in 2025”. It had already been spotted on models and rap artists, and all over TikTok and Instagram. By summer,Grazia declaredthat “The split-toe trend that’s been quietly bubbling for years just hit the mainstream”, citing shopping app Lyst, which named the shoe as one of its top five most-searched items.The freaky-chic shoe in question is the toe shoe – a lightweight, thin-soled trainer with separate, articulated toes. They come in a number of brands and styles, and while they may be popular, I can safely say they are not “everywhere”. Walking in them in public every day for a week, I never ran across another person wearing them. Anywhere.The original toe shoe is the Vibram FiveFingers, which has actually been with us since 2006. The model I’ve chosen, the V-Alpha Hydro, has a 3mm rubber outsole and a 2mm foam insole, offering a close-to-barefoot walking experience. They’re primarily designed for outdoor training, hiking, barefoot running and general fitness, but they are not designed to look cool. The five separate pockets allow one’s toes to splay out more naturally, if not more attractively. Not for nothing did Vogue call FiveFingers “the fitness world’s most divisive shoe”.Vibram is the market leader in a complex footwear category – not all toe shoes are barefoot shoes, and not many barefoot shoes have articulated toes. Some have only a separate big toe, for a more cloven-hoofed look. But they’re all meant to represent an improvement on traditional footwear.View image in fullscreenTim takes his shoes for a walk.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe putative benefits listed for my FiveFingers include “zero heel drop keeping you naturally planted to the ground”, “fantastic proprioception and feedback from the feet to the brain” and “as much natural foot movement as possible”.The FiveFingers may provide a more natural fit, but that doesn’t mean they fit naturally. My toes don’t automatically slide into their corresponding pouches; they have to be coaxed and prodded in. And yes, if you’re going to wear socks, you’ll need toe socks, adding another layer of complexity to getting dressed in the morning. Even after I think I have my left shoe all the way on, a cursory squeeze of each toe pocket reveals that the second one along is empty. Where did that toe go? It turns out it’s sharing a pouch with its nextdoor neighbour.The overwhelming sensation is one of horrifying self-consciousness – these are very weird-looking shoesWhen both shoes are finally on properly, I take them for a brief trial spin. At first, I feel like a circus clown. My splayed toes look like two hands of miniature bananas, and the rubber soles slap against the pavement like duck’s feet. New wearers are advised to transition gradually from regular shoes, because it’s a different style of walking (or running, if that’s your intention). After a cautious 50 metres or so, I settle into a more barefoot stride – mid-foot strike rather than heel strike, and less noisy. Meanwhile, I’m very in touch with the ground beneath me: my toes grip the pavement; I can feel every tiny bump and crack.The overwhelming sensation, however, is one of horrifying self-consciousness – these are very weird-looking shoes. No one comments as I walk down a busy shopping street, and after a while I begin to hope no one has noticed – after all, I don’t tend to notice other people’s shoes when I’m out and about. Then I look down and think: yeah, but I would notice these.Any remaining hope that my toe shoes are unremarkable is dispelled as soon as I walk into my own kitchen, where my middle son is sitting at the table.“What the hell are you wearing?” he says.“On my feet, you mean?” I say.View image in fullscreen‘The fact that I have them on keeps catching me by surprise.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“Yes, on your feet,” he says.“The hot girl shoe of summer,” I say.My oldest son walks in with his girlfriend.“My God, what are those?” she says.“The future,” I say.“They’re hideous,” he says.“They come in other colours,” I say.“What are they like to walk in?” she says.“Honestly?” I say. “They’re exhausting.”They’re so difficult to put on that I’m reluctant to take them offThis is true: after just a few hours my feet are incredibly tired – not sore or achy, just bone-weary. It takes three days to build up enough tolerance to wear them from morning until night. After that, I hardly notice them. The fact that I have them on keeps catching me by surprise: hey! I think. I’m driving in toe shoes! I’m in a supermarket in toe shoes! I am at one with the earth, intensely aware of tiny changes in the terrain – the grout between the tiles, the dry grass poking between my toes. I’m also getting used to the idea that everyone –everyone– notices.Provocative? Polarising? Or just plain weird? Welcome to ugly shoe summerRead moreMy wife is not happy, though, especially when she sees me wearing them just as we’re about to set off for a restaurant.“You said a week,” she says.“Today is a week,” I say.“You really don’t have to wear them tonight,” she says. “You’re just being perverse.”The truth is, toe shoes are a little bit addictive: comfortable and light, while also offering a Spider-Man-level of grip. They’re also so difficult to put on I’m reluctant to take them off.Once we’re in the restaurant, the shoes stay under the table, and I feel perfectly normal. It’s only as we’re leaving, when I pass a waitress and smile, and she smiles back and looks down, and I see her face change, that I know I can’t go on like this.The next day, as I’m posing for Alicia the photographer in my local park, a man comes running over to stop his dog getting into the shot. He apologises, and then looks over at me: a middle-aged man sitting on a bench in the watery morning light.“Is it about the shoes?” he says.“Of course it’s about the shoes,” I say.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They have their ownbratwurst museumcelebrating their distinctively average 15- to 20cm-long sausages.But what about age? How old, exactly, is the bratwurst?That’s hotly contested: an early written reference is found in a 1404 bill for bratwurst casings, levied in the Thuringian city of Arnstadt.So bratwurst was invented in Thuringia some time before 1404.Not so fast. The world’s oldest sausage shop –the Wurstkuchl in Regensburg, Bavaria– claims to have been selling bratwurst since at least 1378.So bratwurst was invented in Bavaria in the late-14th century, or thereabouts?Wait. Some years ago the Bavarians unearthed their own documentation: a decree from Nuremberg council declaring that only pork loin could be used to make sausage – from 1313.So the bratwurst was legislated into being in Nuremberg in 1313?Well, the Thuringian version of bratwurst has protected geographical status under EU law.So it’s the real thing, and therefore takes precedent?It’s messy, because the Nuremberg version – which is only 8cm long – also has protected status.Eight centimetres – you call that a sausage! I’m guessingNurembergwins though, as it has the older sausage.Well, there’s a new document in town: researchers in the Thuringian capital of Erfurt recently discovered a reference to abrathütte(a meat-roasting stand) doing business on the Merchants’ Bridge in – get this – 1269.Rubbish.That’s more than 40 years before Bavaria’s oldest claim – history must be rewritten!A meat-roasting hut is not evidence of someone inventing bratwurst.That’s certainly the view over at the Bratwurst Museum. “I consider it very bold to conclude from this that bratwursts were cooked there,” says managing director Thomas Mauer.To be honest, I can’t believe I’m even pretending to have an opinion.Mauer also insists the 1404 document contains the earliest unambiguous reference to bratwurst.I don’t care.But this debate has been raging for 25 years.It can carry on for another 25, as long as it’s without me.Aren’t you concerned about the decline in Bratwurst consumption, which has fallen to just 2.4kg per German per annum?I am not.Fair enough.Do say:“Despite its obscure origins, the bratwurst deserves to be celebrated as a product that’s truly German and deeply ancient.”Don’t say:“Not these though.

Is it simply a case of trying until something sticks? Or isacceptinga lack of talent a relief over chasing an impossible dream?EvolAnthWell, it’s not necessarily a lack of talent. I think everybody has talent, but you have to hone it. The more you do it, the more you like it. And when you have talent, you want to do it, you know?You signed my copy ofChristinewith the words“Keep on screaming for vengeance” because I was wearing aJudas Priestbadge. Is music still important to you?RobFramptonYeah, music is still important to me. I’ve moved on from Judas Priest because I couldn’t get the rights to use the lyrics from You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ for my [2008] novel, Duma Key. So I’ve moved on to Rancid, Nazareth, Anthrax andMetallica. I don’t listen to music if I’m composing directly from my head to the page. When I’m rewriting, I like to listen to club music, disco or something with a repetitive beat that flows through my head and goes in one ear and out the other. Today I was listening to some zydeco music, and LCD Soundsystem.

I last did it at a bookstore down the road from me in western Maine and signed some copies of Never Flinch and You Like It Darker. I don’t really like book signings because you can’t do everybody. On my last book tour, I had to sign 400 books that were sifted at random from 1,000, so you only had a chance of getting one. But it was better than facing a line of people that never ends, where they all have two or three books. That’s tough.The word “prolific” is often overused, but not for your output. Is not stopping a choice, oris it because you can’t stop?JamesZZZIt’s hard to decide what to do with those two or three extra hours a day between 9am and noon. You can only watch so many gameshows on TV. I can go for a walk, but then I’m still thinking about the next thing. Basically, man, I’m entertaining myself.Do you still write all your books onMicrosoft Word?otterleyAs a matter of fact, I do. Sometimes I will sit and write in the mornings in longhand and then transcribe it. But mostly I use Word because you can go back and fix things. I’m not much of a computer geek, so if I have a problem, I get my IT guy on the job.Why is something scarier the more legs it has?biscoffThere is some truth to that. I just finished reading a British fantasy novel called City of Last Chances by Adrian Tchaikovsky. In it, there’s a monster in a hole in the ground, which is like a centipede and has all these legs. When they dump somebody into the pit, it grabs them with all its legs, punches through the flesh and chews off their head. So that was really scary. The thing is, they’re not like us. They don’t look like us. They are basically alien creatures, so it’s a little bit scary.Who do you read for lighter moments while on holiday? I re-readPG Wodehouse.LowerColonI don’t read PG Wodehouse. I have a tendency to read British mysteries. I’m reading one now called The Ending Writes Itself by Evelyn Clarke that’s set on a Scottish island. The people can’t get out and it’s pretty good.I’m studying for amaster’s in English and my dissertation is onHolly Gibney’s transformation from walk-on character to heroine, covering allsevenbooks. Can you help?Norahseel56View image in fullscreen‘I sort of fell in love with her’ … Justine Lupe as Holly Gibney in the TV adaptation of Mr Mercedes.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyI sort of fell in love with her. She was supposed to be almost a joke character; a walk-on, so to speak. She was obviously hen-pecked by her mother. Her mother was very overbearing and her father was a dishrag kind of person. There came a point in that first book, Mr Mercedes, where one of the characters, Jerome Robinson, goes to Holly because she understands computers and they kind of click. That was the point where she started to become three-dimensional. The more I wrote about her, and got interested in her, the more she started to become confident and interesting. She’s still got a lot of inferiority, and she’s not married and doesn’t have a boyfriend or anything. I think she might be a virgin. I’m not sure about that. I haven’t explored her backstory enough, but she became very interesting to me. By the third novel she was in, she just walked in and stole the book.Whatis the furthest youhave got into writing a bookand thought: “Nah, that’s no good,”and chucked it away?stinkyThere was one called The Cannibals that was set in an apartment building and these people couldn’t get out. It was sort of interesting, but I didn’t know what to do with it, so I just shelved it and went on to something that seemed more doable. It was probably about 200 pages. You go until you can’t think of anything else to say, and that’s the end.DoesRoland Deschain[the main character in King’sThe Dark Towerseries] wear a hat? In my mind, he doesn’t. My partner disagrees. Please settle this argument!jackbumbyIn some of the pictures he wears a hat. But I never really saw him in a hat, no.I’m going to an arts school and am thinking about becoming a horror writer. What part-time job would be good to get someinspiration?EagleDogCatI got some inspiration when I worked in a mill. We had to clean the place out and there were a lot of big rats in the basement. I wrote a story about that, and then I was off and running. I think any kind of a job that is manual labour – what in the US we call a blue-collar worker – is good experience for a writer. You don’t want a job where you can sit down in a clean, well-lit room and not have to clean up shit.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t really like book signings because you can’t do everybody.’Photograph: Jerod Harris/WireImageIf fear was a colour,would it be monochrome orhave different shades?SimotherI think it’s dark blue shading to black. You’ve got to have some colour because you have to be able to see a little bit. You’ve got to sense something and get an idea of what’s in the shadows, so to speak. So yeah, I’d say dark blue shading to black.If you had to invent an ending forTrumpian America, what would it be?hereroI think it would be impeachment – which, in my view, would be a good ending. I would love to see him retired, let’s put it that way. The bad ending would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It’s a horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?When I first sawStranger Things, it felt much like a Stephen King novel. Do you agree?MeckastemeduckI don’t see it as a Stephen King story as much as some other people do. I thinkthe Duffer Brothersgive me more credit than I deserve. Like a lot of talented people, they grew up with my material. When they were young and malleable, they read a lot of Stephen King and said: “We wanna do something like that.” But they’re very talented guys and the story they have developed has a lot more to it than Stephen King. It’s got a lot of Duffer Brothers in it. It’s good. I’ve seen all the episodes. I like it a lot.If someone was to make a film of your life, who would play you?MorganFox77I would love to have a good-looking leading man, but I don’t think Brad Pitt would do it.

But there is more to doRachel Reeves is the chancellor of the exchequerWed 13 Aug 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 19.48 EDTShareThese past few weeks I have met dozens of businesses from across the United Kingdom. Pub and restaurant owners in Cornwall and Kent. Defence manufacturers in Belfast and Moray. Investment opportunities in Aberdeenshire and Port Talbot.I have seen an economy that has the ingredients for success – a skilled and committed workforce, world-class universities, innovative businesses. You don’t hear Reform or the Conservatives talk of this success. They want you to believe the economy is broken. That our best days are behind us and that the path of decline is inevitable. I fundamentally reject that. It is not the country I see around us, and it is not the future I believe in. Britain’s economy is not broken, but I know that in recent years it has got stuck.Austerity, a chaotic Brexit andLiz Truss’s disastrous mini-budgetled to more than a decade of stagnation. Our economy became trapped in a cycle of low growth, repressed investment and stagnant income that weakened our competitiveness on the global stage.The months and weeks before any budget are filled with people speculating about – or claiming to know – what tax and spend decisions I will take or what the Office forBudgetResponsibility will conclude. This budget is no different – I get that. I will set out the decisions I take in a responsible manner.But just as my focus over the past 12 months has been about kickstarting economic growth for the benefits of working people, so will my next. BecauseBritain’s productivity problemis not an abstract, technocratic one – it directly affects every working family in Britain who feel they are squeezing every penny to make ends meet. When businesses can’t grow, wages stagnate and there is less money in the pockets of working people. When infrastructure is inadequate, costs rise, and opportunities are lost.When skills do not match economic needs, potential goes unfulfilled. With lower productivity, tax revenues go down and our public services face cuts. And with the world changing, Britain has been left too exposed to global shocks.Working people across Britain are striving and grafting, but they haven’t had the tools they need for the job. They have not seen their incomes rise as a reward for their hard work. There is that sinking feeling that families and businesses across the country feel at the end of every month that they are working hard, but getting nowhere. There is nothing progressive – nothingLabour– about an economy that is not productive and does not reward those who contribute. Since I became shadow chancellor and then chancellor, I have known that breaking this cycle will require our sustained effort across many fronts.Because if renewal is our mission and productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our tools. It’s investment into our infrastructure, from the train lines and roads that connect businesses and communities to each other to the building of new houses that working people need to fulfil the dream of owning a home. It’s investing in British workers and raising skills in this country, so we end business reliance on cheap migrant workers.We are providing that investment and unblocking the barriers to it too. Breaking down the planning systemto get Britain building, cutting the unnecessary red tape that has stifled innovation rather than enabled it, and filling the skills gaps that are leaving businesses unable to expand and working people unable to progress.We are making progress: wages grew faster in our first 10 months in power than the first 10 years of Conservatives,384,000 more jobs have been created, trade deals now struck with theUnited States,Indiaand theEuropean Union, the cost of a representative new variable rate mortgagelower than when we were elected, and millions of working people getting a pay rise from aboost to the national minimum wage.But I know there is more to do – and that is what this autumn will be about. Because I do not accept decline as inevitable. If Labour’s first year in power was about fixing the foundations, then the second year is about building a stronger economy for a renewed Britain. A renewed economy that works for working people – and rewards working people. That is my priority. That is my mission. That is what I am determined to deliver.Rachel Reeves is chancellor of the exchequerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But that’s not all that’s going onWed 13 Aug 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 15.06 EDTShareIn a dangerous new escalation of his authoritarian rule,Donald Trumphas placed the police ofWashington DCunder federal control and announced that he will deploy the national guard to the country’s capital. According to the president, crime in the city is “out of control” – no matter thatcrime numbersare down significantly, including for violent crimes. But, of course, this power grab is not really about facts, it is about distraction and perception, and a chance to reconnect and refocus his base.Like all the other outrageous things Trump has been doing in the last weeks, the DC takeover is, first and foremost, an attempt to deflect from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Aspreviously demonstratedby his demand to rename the NFL team to the (racist) Washington Redskins, his attacks on the Wall Street Journal, or his calls to prosecute former president Barack Obama (“Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him?”) that he will do anything to get the Epstein case out of the political and public debate.But it is not just a deflection, it is also an attempt to bring the attention of his base back to the core of their bond with Trump, namely authoritarianism and nativism (which are, as always with the far right, closely connected). There is a clear pattern in the cities Trump links to disorder and violence. Cities like Baltimore, DC and Oakland are broadly identified as Black cities in the US, while cities like Los Angeles (Hispanic) and New York (the quintessential melting pot) are also often excluded from the “real” America in rightwing narratives.Of course, in the racist mind, Black and multiracial is connected to crime, danger, disorder – as are “the city” and “urban” centers (both deeply racialized concepts in the US). This racist fear and rejection of the multiracial city has a very long history in the country, but also for Trump himself too. Just remember his response to the infamousCentral Park Five, a multiracial group of teenagers accused of raping a white female jogger in 1989. Before the facts were known, Trump published an open letter in four local newspapers, in which he described New York City as a city out of control, called for the teenage boys to be “executed”, and demanded that the city’s leaders “Bring back the death penalty. Bring back our police.” Attacks on multiracial cities were also a major part of his deeply racist 2024 campaign. For example, he claimed that Philadelphia was “ravaged by bloodshed”, and comparedDetroitto a developing country.Trump’s aversion for multiracial cities was undoubtedly strengthened by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, which were successfully “vilified” in the rightwing media – today, only22%of Republicans support the BLM movement, compared to 84% of Democrats. Moreover, multiracial cities vote disproportionately for the Democrats, which is another sore point. And it is another crucial aspect of Trump’s authoritarian power grab.By targeting multiracial cities like DC and Los Angeles, Trump not only plays into the widespread racist association of these cities with crime and violence, but he also strengthens the belief that these “Democrat-run cities” are “out of control”. The message to his base is clear: Democratic rule in the (Black) cities is “weak” and endangers the (white) “Heartland” – all, of course, ultimately linked to the alleged “open border” policies of former president Joe Biden.Finally, the power grab is part of a broader agenda to create a deeply authoritarian and personalized state, in which the monopoly of violence rests exclusively in the hands of Trump. If implemented, thenew budgetwill transform the US into a deportation state, centered around the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and itsImmigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which is increasingly operating as a presidential militia that is not justabove the lawbut alsoabove otherlaw enforcement and even military agencies.It is crucial that liberal democratic actors take this authoritarian power grab seriously – without letting it distract them, or the wider public, from the Epstein case. As long as the courts still work, at least to some extent, the Trump administration should be challenged in court – despiteinitial setbacks, the court case over Trump’s power grab in California remains open. Media have a responsibility to inform the public of the real facts, includingreal-time factcheckingof Trump speeches.But, most importantly, media and politics must stop treating the various actions as “incidents” and connect the dots – for themselves and for the broader public. While each individual action might not be anti-democratic, they are all connected andtogetherconstitute a clear and consistent attack on democracy. And while all the institutions still stand, they represent less and less the liberal democratic values they were founded on.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

But in a world where rumours travel faster than facts, this new approach will have profound consequences for justice – and for the people who will live with the consequences.Thenew national guidancesays that “police forces should consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects when they are charged in high profile and sensitive investigations and operations”. It comes after Reform UKaccused policeof a “cover-up” over two men who have been charged in connection with the alleged rape of a child in Nuneaton. Prior to this, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, hadexpressed her viewthat guidance should change to allow “more transparency”. She was joined in this opinion by the chief inspector of constabulary, who warned that withholding such detailscould feed “two-tier policing” claims(the allegation that the state polices majorities more harshly than minorities, contrary to the overwhelmingbody ofevidencethat shows otherwise).The idea that identity characteristics should feature, after arrest, in what information is publicly released during police investigations has been circling for years. Until very recently, officials and criminal justice practitioners had mostly resisted. Their concern was simple: routine publication of these details would invite the public to see suspects as examples of a group rather than as individuals in a case.The current approach is embedded in force policies that explicitly root decisions over what to share with the media in “policing purpose” – releasing only what is necessary to protect life, prevent and detect crime, bring offenders to justice and maintain public confidence, rather than what satisfies curiosity or advances a political argument. It is reinforced by national professional guidance designed to prevent pre-trial publicity from straying into prejudice, including the longstanding norm that suspects should not be identified before they have been charged, except in clearly justified circumstances. This sits alongside thepress regulator’s rule, established after histories of press stereotyping playing a role in public incitement, that race or ethnicity should not be mentioned in reporting unless it is “genuinely relevant to the story” (there is not even a public interest override to that clause).Together, these norms made early disclosure of ethnicity and immigration status the exception rather than the default. Now the explicit decision has been made to alter this in standard police disclosures and reporting. So, what has changed?The answer, simply put, is that there is a perception that the politics and the information environment is now different. The impact of theonline falsehoodsabout the Southport killings in late July and early August 2024 – that the attacker was an asylum seeker who had recently arrived by boat – ricocheted through social media and spilled into street violence. In this instance, the police could not initially name the suspect because he was under 18.Subsequently,parliamentary committees,researchersandreportershave traced how rumour and identity claims fuelled disorder, while newsrooms and police forces were left firefightingconspiracy theories at speed. That crisis has bolstered the argument that withholding details such as nationality or asylum status can create a vacuum in which malign actors thrive, and that more routine disclosure will puncture misinformation.The problems with this argument are profound. First, conspiracies thrive on distortion, not on the careful absorption of official communications. A parliamentary committee concluded that social media’s business models incentivise the spread of misinformation, which helped trigger last summer’s violent disorder. In this climate, baking identity into the first telling of crime stories – before a suspect has been charged –is not transparency, it is kindling.Second, once an identity is put at the front of an update, the search for evidence gives way to the hunt for a “type” ahead of the facts. It steers attention from what happened and what can be proved to who the person is said to be and what that is taken to mean. In that climate, each new detail is read through the label, and the space for careful judgment shrinks. The history of policing and ethnic minorities in this country has illustrated this in numerous moral panics.Third, the new disclosure regime lands in a political and media environment that routinely associates migrants and Black and ethnic minorities with illegality. The Runnymede Trust’srecent analysesof millions of words in news articles and parliamentary debates documents how such groups are persistently paired with words about illegality. That pattern helps normalise hostility. These are not abstract academic points – they are the context in which the criminal justice system is brought into perpetual, manufactured culture wars that harm minorities and leave everyone less safe.Fourth, there’s a very basic problem of data quality. Police forces are famously bad at this. Ethnicity can be recorded as self-defined by the person involved or as “officer observed” using broad visual codes. Completion rates for self-defined data vary sharply between forces, and missing or mismatched records are common.National standardson ethnicity are also under review because the categories are contested and context-dependent. Now add the fact that “ethnicity”, “nationality” and “immigration status” are different things. Nationality may be known at the point of charging a suspect if documents are checked. Immigration status often is not – indeed, the police guidance confirms that, “It is not the role or responsibility of the police to verify a suspect’s immigration status” and that, “It is for the Home Office to decide if it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confirm immigration status.” Turning anysuch labels into front-of-house communications is an open invitation to error, before a correction that is too late to catch up with the narrative.The truth is that the demand for default disclosure of ethnicity or immigration status is not about transparency but advancing a political narrative. This is why the scriptscarcely needs factsto run. If police hold back, it is proof of concealment; if they disclose the information and those details fit the stereotype, this is used to indict the wider group. If the details do not fit, attention moves elsewhere.The new guidance might reconcile pressure for “transparency” with established privacy and contempt protections, and the ability to explain reasons for restraint (for instance, to safeguard a fair trial; to protect victims and witnesses; to avoid inflaming tensions). These too are a service to transparency as they tell the public that the police understand the rights of suspects and the realities of community safety.The real question, however, is not whether the public should be trusted with information. It is whether the state should normalise ethnicity and immigration status as the organising facts of crime reporting – and burden already marginalised communities with more suspicion.Nasar Meer is a professor of social and political sciences at the University of GlasgowDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s why fascist leaders have constantly demanded that their populations venerate all violence performed in the service of the state and revere the apparatuses of state violence, such as police forces and the military. In this scenario, state violence is not only necessary for the nation’s survival. State violence is understood as even beautiful, something the public can and must believe in.Buying into state violence this way produces something historian Robert Paxton has called a “mobilizing passion”. In his book The Anatomy of Fascism,Paxton described how “the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will” is produced and then mobilized by fascists by creating “a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of traditional solutions”. In other words, there’s always a grave, existential threat lurking around every corner, and only fascist violence can restore order to a lawless world. To the fascist, as Umberto Eco once put it, “life is a permanent war”.Enter Donald Trump. Whether it’s anexistential threat of “wokeness”run amok in American universities, or theextraordinary dangerof unauthorized immigrants picking our vegetables, Trump is prepared to battle everyone and everything, including his own windmills, to restore the country to some illusory past glory that we are all supposed to believe in, and be willing to sacrifice ourselves for.But the sad truth is that many, if not most, of Trump’s justifications for his policies, are unsurprisingly based on bald-faced lies or gross exaggerations simply to further his pursuit of absolute power. Yet it doesn’t seem to matter. With each new announcement, Trump continues to prove how excellent he is at crafting the illusion of problems where there basically are none and leading his followers down an often-violent path of retribution. (Remember January 6, DC’smost violent dayin recent history?) By doing so, he seeks to constantly expand his authority while also deflecting from all the substantial problems that are staring him in the face. And these problems are not insignificant. Think of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal or the continuation of global conflicts that he promised months ago he would uniquely be able to end.The federal takeover of theWashington DCpolice department, announced with loud fanfare by Trump on Monday, is the latest example of this phenomenon. About 800 national guard troops will be deployed in the nation’s capital because, according to the president, “our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs, and homeless people.”This does sound rather frightening. Fortunately, it’s not true. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to matter.First, the facts. Crime in DC is at historic lows. “Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years,” the justice departmentannouncedearlier this year. And crime numbers for 2025 are even better, substantially lower than 2024. Violent crime in 2025 isdown 26%compared with 2024.The DC council understands this. The council responded to Trump’s announcement with an angry jointstatement: “This is a manufactured intrusion on local authority. Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we’ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the DC police is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency. Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard’s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.”Such facts ought to matter. So why don’t they to Trump?Facts don’t matter for Trump because facts have always operated as nothing more than an inconvenience for him. Just ask Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She was recentlyfiredby Trump after accurately reporting employment statistics, and those specific numbers contradicted Trump and his policies. But with every new policy enacted by this administration, Trump’s fact-free worldview becomes a lot more worrisome.That’s true for this policy, too. Owing to its historically limited autonomy, the District of Columbia is governed differently than other parts of the county. And under the Home Rule Act of 1973,the federal government can take over its policing functions for a period of 30 days. Congress would probably then have to extend that time limit if needed. But to think that Trump is focused on federal policing authority solely to deploy it to Washington DC is to also believe thatDonald Trumphas never seen a spray tan machine.Hereis Trump: “We have other cities also that are bad, very bad,” he said at his press conference. “You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York is a problem. And then you have of course Baltimore and Oakland. We don’t even mention that any more, they’re so far gone. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to lose our cities over this. And this will go further. We’re starting very strongly with DC.”Now, here are the facts. InChicago, homicides are down 33% in 2025.Los Angeleshad the “lowest homicide total in nearly 60 years” in 2025.New York’s police department is reporting that “from January 2025 through May 2025, New York City experienced the lowest number of shootings and murders in recorded history.” TheBaltimorepolice department has stated that 2025 “continues to see double-digit reductions in gun violence, including a 22% decrease in homicides”. And the Oakland police departmentreportedlast week “that overall crime in Oakland has dropped by 28% in the first six months of 2025” including a 24% decrease in homicides.Donald Trump wants to take over all forms of law enforcement in the United States, from local policing to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency that is now pumped up on budgetary steroids. (Under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill, Ice will now expand to become thelargestfederal law enforcement agency in US history, with abigger budgetthan most nations’ militaries.) Trump’s desire to control all forms of state power, and to expand them beyond belief, is a move straight out of the fascist playbook. And it’s completely dependent on the production of both extraordinary fear and blatant lies.The first way of fighting such an obvious power grab is not to give in to the fear and not to believe the lies. But what is less understood about Trump is that he doesn’t even care if we believe his lies. Like all such leaders, what Trump really wants is just that we no longer believe in the truth. The difference between not believing the lies and believing in the truth may sound slight, but it’s exactly in that distinction where some people are allowed to live and others must die. It’s where democracy is found or democracy is lost. And it’s why holding on to the very concept of truth ultimately matters so much more than just arguing over the lies.Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

That boastrang holloweven before the current war. Now, it’s not evenpretending. On Sunday, Israel openly and brazenlykilledsix journalists as they were sheltering in a tent that housed reporters and media workers.Israelaccusesone of those journalists – Al Jazeera’sAnas al-Sharif– of being aterrorist. It has not said what crime it believes the others have committed that would justify killing them. The laws of war are clear: journalists are civilians. To target them deliberately in war is to commit a war crime.The Guardian view on Anas al-Sharif and Gaza’s journalists: Israel is wiping out the witnesses | EditorialRead moreIt is hardly surprising that Israel believes it can get away with murder. In the two decades preceding 7 October, Israeli forceskilled 20 journalists. No one has ever been held accountable for any of those deaths, including that of the Al Jazeera journalistShireen Abu Akleh, whosekillingin 2022 sent shock waves through the region. Abu Akleh, a dual US-Palestinian citizen, was a household name in the Middle East, just as al-Sharif became a familiar face for audiences for his coverage of Israel’s assault on Gaza.Israel first began makingthreatsagainst al-Sharif shortly after the start of the war. The journalist reported receiving multiple phone calls from officers in the Israeli army instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza, as well as voice notes on WhatsApp disclosing his location. In December 2023, an Israeli airstrike hit his family home, killing the journalist’s 90-year-old father.A year later, the Israeli armyalleged publiclythat Anas al-Sharif was a terrorist – claims itrepeated last monthshortly after Anas al-Sharifexposedthe rampant levels of starvation throughout Gaza as a result of Israel’s refusal to allow in sufficient food aid. AnIsraeli spokesperson accused al-Sharifof lying about thefamine– despite corroboration of widespread starvation by independent and international groups.The Committee to Protect Journalists had seen this playbook from Israel before: apatternin which journalists areaccusedby Israel of being terrorists with no credible evidence. Indeed, we were so concerned that al-Sharif was being targeted that weissueda public statement urging his protection.To date, Israel has provided no independently verifiable evidence that any of the journalists whom it has admitted deliberately targeting were terroristsInstead, al-Sharif was killed alongside his colleagues in an attack that Israel has openly admitted was aimed at killing the journalist. Al-Sharif is the 184th Palestinian journalist to have been killed by Israel since the start of the war and one ofat least 26 journalistswhom CPJ believes to have been deliberately targeted for their work as journalists. The others have certainly been killed by Israel but whether Israel did so in full knowledge they were journalists we have not been able to determine.Israeldeniesit deliberatelytargetsjournalists. But the evidence shows otherwise. To date, Israel has providedno independently verifiable evidencethat any of the journalists whom it has admitted deliberately targeting were terrorists. In one case, that of the Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, the documents producedallegedly showedthat al-Ghoul became the leader of a Hamas battalion – when he was 10 years old. The documents Israel has shared on al-Sharif, which itposted on X, show al-Sharif as receiving a Hamas salary in 2023. The documents do not provide evidence that he was an active member of the terrorist group although Israel said it had “current intelligence” – which it did not publish – indicating al-Sharif was an active Hamas military wing operative.It is no wonder thatIsraelis now so confident about killing journalists that it can admit to killing six journalists and media workers while only one was allegedly its target. The international community has been woeful in its condemnation of Israel’s actions.On Gaza’s killing fields, journalism faces its darkest hour – but that won’t stop us reporting | Asef HamidiRead moreAnd that includes our own journalism community. Whereas the Committee to Protect Journalists received significant offers of support and solidarity when journalists were being killed in Ukraine at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the reaction from international media over the killings of our journalist colleagues in Gaza at the start of the war was muted at best. In some high-profile killings – such as that of the Reuters journalistIssam Abdallah– some governmentstrotted out well-worn defencesof press freedom, but stopped well short of seriously censuring Israel. And few took any concrete steps – such as the halt of arms sales or the suspension of trade agreements – that might have forced Israel to change course.Now, with more than 192 journalists and media workerskilledsince the start of the war – the deadliest conflict for journalists that we have ever documented –condemnationfrom individual journalists and some newsrooms has grown more vocal. But it is hard to see, if Israel can wipe out an entire news crew without the international community so much as batting an eye, what will stop further attacks on reporters.Already our window intoGazawas becoming more and more limited.

What followed seemed inevitableWed 13 Aug 2025 12.06 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.36 EDTShareWhat is the role of journalism when Palestinian reporters are treated as criminals and left to die? Last October, I spoke with the journalist Hossam Shabat. He described families packing what little they had left in northern Gaza as Israel began implementing its “generals’ plan”. Six months later,Shabat was dead– killed by Israel, accused of being a Hamas operative.Israel does not try to hide these killings. Instead, it often smears its victims in advance – branding journalists as “terrorists”, accusations that are rarely substantiated. These labels serve a clear cause: to strip reporters of their civilian status and make their killing appear morally acceptable. Journalists are not legitimate targets. Killing them is a war crime.The latest round shook the world:five Al Jazeera journalistswere assassinated in a press tent in Gaza City,among them Anas al-Sharif, whose face had become familiar to anyone following Gaza up close. Both the UN and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)had warnedthat al-Sharif’s life was in danger. Weeks later, he was dead.Meanwhile, a growing consensus recognises Gaza as the site of a livestreamed genocide. Yet in Germany – a country that prides itself on havinglearned the lessonsof its own genocidal history – some of the most powerful media institutions have played a part in enabling Israel’s actions. Some German journalists have even justified the killing of their Palestinian colleagues.The clearest example is Axel Springer, Europe’s largest publisher and owner of Bild, Germany’s biggest newspaper. Hours after the killing of al-Sharif became public, Bild splashed his imageunder this headline: “Terrorist disguised as journalist killed in Gaza” (which was later changed to “Journalist killed was allegedly a terrorist”). Let that sink in.About a week before, Bild had publishedanother piece: “This Gaza photographer stages Hamas propaganda.” The article targeted the Palestinian photographer Anas Zayed Fteiha, accusing him ofstaging imagesof starving Palestinians as part of a Hamas campaign, despite the evidence that the subjects of the photos were indeed starving and waiting for food. In the article, Fteiha’s title as journalist appeared in quotation marks, implying he wasn’t a real journalist, and that images of starvation were exaggerated fabrications.The Bild story – along with a similar piece in the liberal Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) – wasswiftly amplified on Xby Israel’s foreign ministry, which cited them as proof that Hamas manipulates global opinion. Fteiha was branded an “Israel- and Jew-hater” serving Hamas. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundationquickly piled on, joined by rightwing influencers.In this case, German media had become a direct pipeline for Israeli talking points, quickly recycled into the international arena and repackaged as “evidence”. Fteihasaid in response: “I don’t create suffering. I document it.” Calling his work “Hamas propaganda”, he continued, “is a felony against the press itself”.Just days before the Bild and SZ articles were published, one of Germany’s largest journalists’ associations, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband (DJV),issued a statementwarning of “manipulation” in press photography. It specifically cast doubt on images showing emaciated children in Gaza, claiming their condition “apparently is not attributable to the famine in Gaza”. The DJV offered no evidence for this claim – largely because no such evidence exists.Facing backlash online, the associationcited a July articlein Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, whose author had speculated whether images of emaciated infants were really the result of starvation – or rather of preexisting conditions such as cystic fibrosis. The piece suggested that publications had been either negligent or manipulative in publishing these photos without further detail. Omitted was the fact that hunger and preexisting conditions can’t be neatly separated and that no preexisting condition alone could produce such extreme emaciation.Bias isn’t new in the German media landscape. At Axel Springer, support for the existence of the state ofIsraelis secondon the list of thecompany’s guiding principles, its so-called essentials. In September last year, Bild helpedderail ceasefire negotiationsby publishing an“exclusive” report– excerpts from a Hamas strategy leaked to Bild by Benjamin Netanyahu’s aides. In it, Bild claimed Hamas was “not aiming for a quick end to the war”, which neatly absolved Netanyahu of any responsibility for the breakdown in talks at the time. (In response to queries about the story, a Bild spokesperson told +972 magazine that the publication does not comment on its sources.)As it turned out, the Hamas document had beenbroadly misrepresentedby Bild. The timing couldn’t have served Netanyahu better: the story landed as mass protests put pressure on his position. Shortly after the Bild report was published, Netanyahu cited it in a cabinet meeting to cast the demonstrators as pawns of Hamas. The Bild article remains online, uncorrected.We published a photo of a malnourished child in Gaza. It made an impact globally – and created controversy | Elisabeth RibbansRead moreThe problem, however, extends far beyond Bild and Axel Springer. Across legacy German media, failures to provide fact-based, balanced coverage of Israel and Palestine have been far reaching – and became glaringly obvious after the 7 October attacks. Fabricated claims, such as thatHamas had beheaded 40 babies, along with various other pieces of deliberate misinformation,remainuncorrected.Outlets across the political spectrum in Germany routinely omit historical context, frame Palestinian deaths in passive, depoliticised terms, and display a near-blind faith in Israeli military “verification” – while ignoring a well-documented record of misinformation by Israeli state sources. In January, the ostensibly leftwing Die Tageszeitung ran a piece headlined: “Can journalists be terrorists?” The article cited the Israeli military four times – and did not quote a single journalist in Gaza.Across the German media landscape, such narratives contribute to stripping Palestinian journalists of credibility, and – in the worst case – handing Israel readymade justifications for targeting them.Germany’s “never again” pledge should carry weight given its deeply genocidal history. Yet it rings hollow when the country’s dominant outlets launder or supply propaganda to legitimise mass killing in Gaza. This is not journalism in the service of truth – it is journalism in the service of violence. Breaking this cycle would require a serious reckoning with the editorial cultures and political loyalties that have enabled German journalism to be weaponised in this way.The killing of journalists inGazamakes one thing painfully clear: Israel does not want a record to be left. When the history of this genocide is written, there will be chapters on the media’s role. Germany’s section will be uncomfortably large. No one should claim they didn’t see it happening.Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and author.

I grew up with a water-stained copy of a dictionary of quotations by the toilet and, for the most part, by the toilet is where these things belong. But there is one saying by the American philosopher and yoga teacherRam Dassthat has always cheered me: “If you think you’re enlightened, go and spend a week with your family.”I have no idea if Ram Dass really said this. Just as I’m not sure if the Dalai Lama ever said: “Don’t let the behaviour of others destroy your inner peace.” Or whether Oscar Wilde believed the words he put into the mouth of Lord Illingworth in A Woman of No Importance: “Children begin by loving their parents; after a time they judge them; rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.” But as someone in the middle of a family holiday, I can certainly attest that any delusions about maturity, levity and inner tranquility are thrown firmly down the proverbial U-bend the moment you embark on a BigFamilyTrip.If you are lucky enough to have living parents, siblings and children, then the chances are that at least some of your summer will be spent sharing a sofabed with someone who has your eyebrows, if not your surname. A survey by Legal and General found that 46% of those asked think it is important to go on a multigenerational family trip (including immediate and extended family), although 30% of respondents said they feel “stressed” by the prospect of a family holiday – rising to 47% of parents and guardians of children aged under 18.I can practically smell the Sudocrem, polyester sleeping bags and cheese-and-onion crisps coming off those statistics as I type. Yes, we hire cottages by the sea; yes, we pitch up in fields full of thistles; yes, we slither into new cities, laden down with phone chargers and spare sandals, but we are stressed, sad and sulking while we do it. This is August; this is what we do.Which is where the faltering sense of identity comes in. As inevitable as red wine slopping on to a white carpet, the moment you are in the midst of your family (whether it is the one you grew up with, your chosen family or the ones you have created), you will find yourself reverting to a personality that you thought you had shed decades ago. Perhaps that means standing by the fridge, eating a cold sausage 20 minutes before lunch. Maybe it is taking your sister’s T-shirt without asking and promptly covering it in blackberry juice. It could be leaning out of a toilet window overlooking your uncle’s water butt, secretly smoking a cigarette and wondering if you should text that person you once snogged outside Morrisons but never slept with. Whatever the details, you will regress. Your temper will shorten. Your healthy eating regime will be blasted to smithereens by custard creams and Kellogg’s variety packs.Of course, not everyone aspires to enlightenment. I may have grown up in the sort of family where astrological charts, transcendental meditation and yogic breathing were as much a part of daily life as EastEnders and Anchor butter, but I’m not interested in becoming enlightened, and never have been. Instead of devoting myself to a journey towards universal consciousness and inner peace, I spent much of my 20s and even 30s hoping to one day be cool. And let me tell you, family holidays pretty much scupper that too. Nobody looks sexy on a water slide; it’s impossible to feel elegantly rebellious while washing up in a bucket; and you cannot retain an air of mystique when your mum is loudly insisting that she should be given a free pot of hot water in a cafe because she has “brought a teabag from home”.So, this August, forget inner peace and outer sophistication. If you are going on holiday with your family, my advice is to add some people you are not related to (our best holidays by far have always included friends, their children, partners and other couples) or take up a labour-intensive cleaning schedule. For, as Zinedine Zidane* once said: “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”*It was either Zinedine Zidane or Zen Buddhism – the pages of my dictionary of quotations are stuck together.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Previously the argument was whether there would be rises in an autumn budget. Now the only question is which levies the Treasury will raise.The shift has been a two-stage process. First, economic data made it look highly improbable that Rachel Reeves could fulfil existing spending pledges, while also sticking within her self-imposed fiscal rules, on current revenue projections. She needs money. Second, the chancellor and the prime minister stopped denying that this was the case. They have not confirmed that taxes are going up, but theyno longer pretendthat isn’t a reasonable expectation.One option under consideration, asrevealed by the Guardianthis week, is to change the inheritance tax (IHT) regime. The range of reliefs that currently limit tax on gifts made in the years prior to death could be replaced by a lifetime cap. This would bring more high-value assets into the scope of IHT. Only a wealthy minority would be affected. The most recent HMRC data shows thatfewer than 5%of deaths lead to any required payment of inheritance tax. While the headline rate is 40%, various reliefs and exemptions bring that down to aneffective rate of 13%.A common argument against most taxes is the disincentive impact they might have on investment and aspiration. That hardly applies to a levy on unearned, hereditary windfalls. In utilitarian terms, this is just the sort of pot that an enterprise‑oriented exchequer should target.But the public does not see it that way. IHT isunpopulardespite its negligible impact on most household finances. Partly that is a function of wishful thinking. Surveys show voters vastly overestimating the likelihood that they will one day inherit or bequeath an estate that is taxed. But distaste for IHT also has a deeper emotional resonance. It is deemed unfair, as a “double” taxation because estates might consist of savings accrued from earnings that were taxed earlier in a working life. This is not an exceptional case. Many items and activities fall under overlapping tax purviews, but people feel there is something particularly mean about the Treasury dipping into the finances of grieving families.Failure to address similar reservations led the government into a storm ofprotest last yearwhen very generous IHT reliefs on farmland were made slightly less generous. The damage from that furore was out of all proportion to the financial gains.The government is right to look at raising more money from IHT, but the lessons of past battles must be learned. Myths need robust debunking, while other issues around inheritance – the instinct of parents to help children – need handling sensitively. There is a powerful argument for intergenerational fairness in a society where inheritance, especially of property, dictates life chances, dividing ever younger cohorts into landowner and tenant classes. Taxing inheritance is a modest but necessary levelling mechanism.That case needs making well ahead of the budget. The tone of the conversation around tax may have changed, but the mechanism involved a prime minister and chancellor reluctantly conceding a reality only once it had already been widely acknowledged elsewhere. If they want their plans to gain public favour, they must rise out of that reactive, defensive crouch and make bigger arguments for a fairer tax system.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That was then. A contemporary reworking would need to start from a radically different premise.Notwithstanding the contribution of a large migrant workforce, the modern construction sector is underpowered and dramatically understaffed. Annual job vacanciestotalabout 38,000, half of which cannot be filled due to a shortage of skills. For a government committed to sustainably building 1.5m new homes and environmentally upgrading the existing housing stock – as well as renewing national infrastructure more generally – that is a serious problem. The Construction Industry Training Board hasestimatedthat between now and 2029, about 240,000 new hires will be needed.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, hopes that some of them will be alumni of 10 “new technical excellence colleges”, whose locations wereunveiledthis week. The government has already pledged to invest £600m in the training of 60,000 construction workers by 2029. The 10 colleges are being handed another £100m to enhance the skillsets of a future generation of bricklayers, electricians, carpenters and plumbers.“New” is stretching it a bit. All the colleges already exist and have a track record in offering construction courses. Whether the scale of the government’s intervention is adequate to the size of the challenge is, to say the least, moot. But Ms Phillipson’s apparent determination to prioritise the sector is both necessary and welcome. One in eight young people arecurrentlynot in education, employment or training; making vocational career paths accessible and attractive is a social as well as an economic imperative.Sadly, there is a vast amount of lost ground to make up. Overall investment in skills hasdroppedcalamitously since 2010, and a myopic ministerial focus on universities has seen further education colleges treated as second-class institutions. The apprenticeship levy scheme introduced by the Conservatives in 2017 was a dismalfailure, as employers invested in already skilled employees rather than entry-level opportunities.Via Skills England – the new body it hascreated– Labour has moved toreformthe levy. But comparisons with Germany’s longstandingvocationaleducation system, which enjoys high status and delivers a rounded learning environment to students, remain deeply unflattering.The construction industry also has its own issues to resolve. Cultural expectations have transformed since the days when Auf Wiedersehen, Pet was broadcast. In a recentsurvey, more than a third of young people did not view a job in construction as a respected career path. More than half considered the sector not welcoming to women. Many employers are failing to invest in training. And as the use of migrant labour has become increasingly prevalent, there has been concerningevidenceof exploitative practices.If hugely ambitious Westminster targets are to be met, foreign workers and new native talent will both be required (a home truth that the government is depressinglyreluctantto acknowledge). Rendering the construction sector fit for purpose should be viewed as a national mission. The reward would be a viable vocational path for tens of thousands of young people. Labour is at least making a start.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is astonishing, however, that the debate continues without any acknowledgment that the very attempt to classify people by racial origin is a founding principle of the worst governments of the past century.Urged to self-classify, as we are in many official forms for seemingly good reasons, no one seems prepared to say simply that the very attempt to classify people by “racial origin” is in itself an abhorrent first step on the road to apartheid, “remigration” and worse.John StubbsBridport, DorsetThe nonsensical notion of “transparency” has raised its ideologically loaded head again in the latest front to be opened up in the culture wars (Routinely disclosing the ethnicity of police suspects is a very dangerous step to take, 13 August).If “transparency” is really the most important motivating factor here rather, than, say, appeasement of unpleasant far‑right views, surely the annual earnings of the accused, or their highest level of educational attainment, would be more significant in helping to portray a profile of those who are accused or suspected of criminal activity.Eddie DugganIpswich, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, it should be made clear that the machinery of government – in which I work as a senior civil servant – is not a “machine”, as many current leaders assume.In his 2024 book On Leadership,Tony Blairsays leaders often make the mistake of believing that the machinery of government is “like an instrument in their hands” that they can learn how to use. It is not an instrument, he points out, but “a living organism [with] a mind and a temperament”.This common misunderstanding of the nature of the system underpins the government’s consistent inability to deliver. Anne Owers’ independent prison capacity review is just the latest example. Machines can be mastered with manuals, precise plans and predictable cause-and-effect levers, but living organisms behave differently. As anyone who has raised a toddler or a teenager can attest: predictability and cause-and-effect do not apply.Linear approaches suitable for the “machine”, such as plans and targets, are ineffective, serving only to increase bureaucracy. Meanwhile, all remains quiet on the delivery front. Owers’ review evidences this, describing the prisons-capacity response as bureaucratic and repetitive, with too much discussion and too little action.Treating the machinery of government like a complex organism, rather than a machine, is the only way it will be effectively deployed. The UK government’s own guidance on “systems thinking for civil servants”, as well as research by the Institute for Government, acknowledges this, with the latter noting that the machinery of government cannot be “controlled through plans and ‘levers’”.Yet time and again, leaders fall back on the same familiar levers, expecting different results. They deploy tools suitable for the “machine”, including endless plans and committees. Bureaucracy begets bureaucracy, while delivery is missing in action. Breaking this cycle will remain unsuccessful for as long as leaders continue to treat government as a “machine”.Name and address suppliedMartin Kettle correctly identifies the stranglehold that Treasury orthodoxy has on government, but does not go far enough in identifying the source. Supply-side theory claims that growth comes when entrepreneurs are given incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies. Private businesses will employ people and the wealth they create, the taxes they pay, will allow government to improve public services. Forty years of failure has not dented faith in this flawed doctrine. Perhaps because those who administer the policies do not suffer the effects.Instead of giving money to rich businessmen, much of which finds its way into tax havens, why not try using it productively through existing channels? Public spending is not a dirty word. Creating a safe, healthy and prosperous society is the essence of government.Local authorities, especially in poor areas, are desperate for funds to keep their communities in a half-decent state: give them money to rebuild and repair, perhaps with encouragement to source locally. Bring in a local income tax instead of rates. Reverse the increase in employer’s national insurance contributions, which is a tax on jobs. When demand increases, supply will follow. In this way the economy will grow organically, sustainably and all around the country.Hazel DaviesNewton-le-Willows, MerseysideHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with Trump, 1 August), Rashid Khalidi announces that he will not teach his scheduled course in the fall term, “specifically […] in light of Columbia’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism”. The IHRA definition, Khalidi explains, “deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews”.The IHRA is an intergovernmental body with a mandate to address contemporary challenges related to the Holocaust and genocide of the Roma. It has 35 member countries, including every member of the EU except Malta. So this is a serious allegation. But what does the IHRA definition actually say?Prof Khalidi does not quote a sentence of it, and perhaps we can see why.It saysthat “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. But the following “could, taking into account the overall context” qualify as antisemitic: “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination”, “requiring of [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”, “using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism to characterise Israel or Israelis”, “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”, or “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel”.It must be obvious to Prof Khalidi that these things are sometimes antisemitic. No doubt, antisemitism and anti-Zionism are sometimes tendentiously conflated. Equally, antisemitism is sometimes cloaked in political discourse or mixed with political criticism, and that is what the IHRA calls out. Denying that this happens is absurd. Here, for example, is theHamas charter: “In their Nazi treatment, the Jews made no exception for women or children. Their policy of striking fear in the heart is meant for all. […] The Zionist Nazi activities against our people will not last for long. […] The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the ‘Protocols of the Elders of Zion’.”The IHRA definition has been a target in anti-Zionist campaigns for years, in the same way as Black Lives Matter became a target for the right during Donald Trump’s first term. A question about how to recognise antisemitism has been weaponised by anti-Zionists, just as antisemitism is weaponised by some on the Israeli right.John HymanGrote chair in philosophy of mind and logic, University College LondonAnthony JuliusChair of law and the arts, University College LondonExplore more on these topicsAntisemitismIsraelReligionColumbia UniversityEuropean UnionlettersShareReuse this content"

They wereultimately defeated on penaltiesafter squandering a two-goal lead and their new manager was left to rue an inability to bend the outcome to their will in the shootout.Goals from Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero appeared to have rocket-launched Frank’s tenure before Lee Kang-in and Gonçalo Ramos curtailed the celebrations. But the Dane saw plenty of encouragement in the way his players dominated their star-studded opponents for the first three quarters of the match.Nuno Mendes gets PSG party started in Super Cup shootout win against SpursRead more“Very, very proud of the players, the team, the club, the fans,” he said. “I think the players gave everything against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best. I think for 75 to 80 minutes we were perfect, almost ­giving nothing away.”Tottenham were decisively undone when Van de Ven and Mathys Tel missed in the shootout but Frank was in no mood to apportion blame. “It’s down to the smallest of margins, like the flip of a coin,” he said. “I’d like to thank all the players who stepped up, were brave and took responsibility.”Frank had set Spurs up with a back three and placed a heavy emphasis on set pieces, which they practised in the warm-up and deployed effectively for both goals. It recalled some of his best work with Brentford but he said the tactics had been honed specifically to trouble PSG. “It was a special operation,” he said. “In medical terms the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very close to succeeding.”There were signs of a greater flexibility than Spurs had tended to exhibit under Frank’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou. “We showed that we can be adaptable and pragmatic, and we needed to be against a team like PSG,” he said. “The way we wanted to defend, high pressure and low defending, was top, almost perfect, and also the set pieces were very good and dangerous.”A Premier League opener with Burnley awaits on Saturday and, in the meantime, Spurs are attempting to sign the Manchester City forward Savinho and the Crystal Palace ­talisman Eberechi Eze. “We’d like to strengthen the squad, no doubt about that,” Frank said. “We do work very hard to see if we can do that. In general I am very happy with the squad but in any transfer window we try to see if we can make the squad stronger before the window closes.”The PSG manager Luis Enrique praised Lucas Chevalier, the debutant goalkeeper, who replaced the seemingly outbound Gianluigi ­Donnarumma. Chevalier should have done better for Romero’s goal but saved from Van de Ven in the shootout.“He’s shown personality and we want him to integrate with the team immediately,” he said. “Everyone was talking about the situation, his wasn’t easy, but he showed great character.”Explore more on these topicsUefa Super CupTottenham HotspurParis Saint-GermainnewsShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Sesko’s arrival atManchester Unitedwas third time lucky for last season’s Europa League finalists, having attempted to make a deal for the Slovenia striker when he was leaving Domžale in 2019 and again when he agreed to fly the Red Bull Salzburg nest in 2022, eventually joining up with RB Leipzig a year down the line.Now United havetheir still-only-22-year-old manand if Sesko has been feted in the inner circles of European football since his mid-teens, one could suggest the wait has not only be worthwhile but that it could work in favour of Ruben Amorim as he attempts to author a dramatic uptick in the fortunes of the English game’s premier fallen giant.Marcus Rashford claims Manchester United are stuck in ‘no man’s land’Read moreAnd now, the time for talking and for contemplating is done. United have wanted their headline No 9, and Sesko has wanted his chance to shine in England. Both have had their wishes come true and both need to prove that their partnership can be a fruitful one because, beyond the hype, club and player have a lot staked on this, and really need it to work. Sesko’s debut is expected to come at home to Arsenal on Sunday.Ever since Sesko arrived at Leipzig in 2023, it was strongly suspected this moment would come. From even earlier, perhaps. Sesko arrived in the Red Bull universe in 2019, signing his Salzburg deal a few days after turning 16, less than a year after Erling Haaland had done the same.Haaland is a figure who frequently comes up when discussing and describing Sesko; not just because of entrusting his development to Red Bull’s finishing school but because of their comparative athletic profiles. Both men are 6ft 5in, both have the build that would suggest they would be traditional target men and both have lightning pace that one doesn’t expect from a player of that stature.Yet from there, they diverge. If the physical characteristics of Haaland and Sesko are slightly misleading, so is the suggestion that they are similar players. The Norwegian, from his first steps in the Salzburg first team, had looked like the goal machine he has proved to be so emphatically in Dortmund and Manchester. Sesko, his successor, never really looked like doing the same, even if he struck 16 times in 30 Austrian Bundesliga games in his final Salzburg season.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko celebrates scoring for RB Leipzig against Bayern Munich last season.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesWhat Sesko lacked in sheer goal volume, though, he made up for in his all-round game, which outstripped that of Haaland when he was in Austria (or Germany for that matter). In terms of running the channels, linking with teammates in the final third and being an authentic part of the team rather than just a penalty box predator, Salzburg-era Sesko was clearly the brighter bet. It was entirely legitimate, however, to wonder how regularly he might score in Germany after making the move to Leipzig.The big success of his time with Leipzig was his arrival as a consistent goalscorer in a top European league. A pair of six-week droughts, one in autumn, another in early spring, meant he ended up with a lower Bundesliga tally last term than in his debut season, 13 compared with 14, but his ability to be decisive and make proper use of his natural gifts – strength, speed, a thunderous shot, the ability to peel away from defenders with the adroitness of a smaller man and ability in the air when required – has been clear.Sesko’s spell in the Bundesliga, like Haaland’s, always felt like a loan in all but name and contractual detail. More than a finishing school, it was more a waiting room until an inevitable move to the Premier League.Mikel Arteta’s longstanding interest in Sesko was no secret but the arrival of Andrea Berta at Arsenal (with his record of going big on established centre-forwards) shifted the club’s focus to Viktor Gyökeres, which opened the door for United to try again for Šeško.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Højlund and Zirkzee are two among countless examples of talented players who have arrived at Old Trafford and not become the players they were expected to be.One could argue that Newcastle were Sesko’s safer bet, given that his aim will be for his Premier League trajectory to mirror that of Alexander Isak, transforming strong potential into all-conquering product. Amorim has successfully developed players beyond their wildest dreams (Gyökeres being the most famous example) so perhaps he can do so again, with a pre-season behind him and a squad more shaped to his liking.Sesko’s temperament gives him a great chance; throughout this summer’s transfer saga he behaved in an exemplary fashion at Leipzig, with the sporting director, Marcel Schäfer, underlining this week that “his move is a loss both from a sporting and a personal perspective”. His success in the Premier League would be a significant corner turned for this latest United rebuild.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That, to be fair, is an estimate, because the football presenter and broadcaster has always been a grafter. From Setanta Sports to Channel 5 there are few places where she has not applied her blend of deep knowledge and emotional warmth, and as of this weekend she will be the face of the BBC’s and Sky’s coverage of the Premier League.The action gets under way at a second home, Anfield, from where Cates will host Sky’s Friday Night Football coverage of Liverpool v Bournemouth. This follows two preview shows for the BBC, and precedes her first shift onMatch of the Day.Premier League to test Ref Cams on first weekend with view to permanent rolloutRead moreAsked whether her schedule might be daunting, Cates appears almost bemused. “I’ve just got busy weekends, but I work in sports so I expect to have busy weekends,” she says. “It’s not as complicated as you think – there’s a very fast train to Manchester.”Cates, speaking at Sky’s HQ, says she doesn’t want to sound cliched but “it’s good to keep doing new things”. Her new roles are a chance to “keep things fresh”. Having worked in the industry for 27 years, starting with a presenting role on the opening morning of Sky Sports News, “to get a chance to do something new and still have the live football and have so many live games, it’s just really lovely to have that balance”.For many years Cates had to endure questions that her colleagues don’t; from being a woman in a man’s world to being the daughter of a football legend, Sir Kenny Dalglish. She has long since carved out her own place in sports broadcasting, however, so when she was approached for the role of Match of the Day host, alongside Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan, Sky immediately brokered a deal that would keep her on its roster too.While her male colleagues may get more attention, usually adjacent to some controversy, Cates’s less combative approach has helped to shape contemporary coverage of football on TV (and radio). Her more approachable and conversational style is suited to the age of podcasting and long‑form interviews.“I think that the tone generally has changed to become more conversational on air, and I think that’s probably because that’s come from digital,” she says. “A lot of that was fan-led and a lot of it was just people starting up on their own at the beginning. But I think you can have a conversational tone without having a conversation, and you can still interview somebody while having a conversational tone.”View image in fullscreenKelly Cates has little social media presence. ‘There’s a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they don’t care about it,’ she says.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty ImagesCates offers another distinction from many of her peers; she is not an avid user of social media. She has no account on X and tends to use Instagram to promote her work rather than share her worldview. “I haven’t ever really used my social media for that, so it isn’t something that I’m going to have to change,” she says.“I think that in a lot of cases, I’m not the best-placed person to talk about some of those issues. And I think there’s a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they don’t care about it. I think it’s perfectly possible to care about something and keep quiet and let experts talk about it, which I think is a lot of the time better. I always feel like if I couldn’t cope well with being challenged heavily on it, then I shouldn’t be putting my opinion out publicly.”That she should be asked about her posting reflects the Gary Lineker-shaped presence in the room. Cates, Chapman and Logan are being asked by the BBC to team up to replace a broadcasting legend, with all the public scrutiny that entails. Cates says she has not spoken to Lineker about the job, but defends his reputation despite his being a “controversial” figure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We just don’t know each other that well. I think [Chapman] was saying that Gary said: ‘Why would I tell three broadcasters how to do their job?’ Which is very lovely of him because he was brilliant at the job. And as much as he was a controversial character at times, any focus group that researched these things would tell you how much he was adored in that role.”On how she will approach following in the footsteps of yet another football legend, Cates is matter of fact.“I don’t want to be Gary. I think there’s a temptation to try and be someone else, and I think that you get a job because of yourself. If then you try to be someone else, it can all just get a bit confused.

That brought the game to life and Huddersfield reacted best, with Roosken awarded a penalty after Choudhury brought him down. Dion Charles’s spot-kick was saved but the 19-year-old midfielder Dan Vost headed home the rebound in the 65th minute for his first senior goal.Leicester restored their lead three minutes later, Stephy Mavididi squaring for his fellow substitute Harry Winks to curl the ball into the bottom corner. Again Huddersfield found a response, with the youngster Cameron Ashia claiming his second goal in two games by curling a fantastic effort into the top corner.That sent the game to a shootout, where Huddersfield prevailed 3-2 as Bilal El Khannouss hit a post and Nicholls saved efforts from Jordan Ayew and Kasey McAteer.

But Hamer’s introduction off the bench early in the second half breathed fresh life into the Blades and he stunned the home crowd with a magnificent drive from 50 yards. The midfielder picked up a loose ball in midfield before sending a shot beyond James Beadle, a debutant, who had strayed marginally off his line.However, with spot-kicks beckoning, Stansfield twisted and turned inside the area, firing off a shot which was diverted past Adam Davies by a slight touch from a covering defender.View image in fullscreenBirmingham’s Jay Stansfield fires in close to full time to send his side into the second round.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAPierce Charles saved twice and Liam Palmer scored the winning spot-kick as the Championship crisis clubSheffield WednesdaybeatBoltonof League One 4-2 on penalties.Charles, the only player to retain his place from Sunday’s league defeat at Leicester, kept out efforts from Aaron Morley and Max Conway before Palmer booked a home derby with Leeds.Victory was well deserved for Henrik Pedersen’s young guns despite Wanderers going down to 10 men after the defender Sam Inwood’s 30th-minute red card.

The experienced left-back Reinildo played Champions League football for Atlético Madrid last season and the Chelsea loanee striker Marc Guiu comes highly recommended.Even so last season’s star, Jobe Bellingham, now at Borussia Dortmund, will be missed and the manager, Régis Le Bris, faces quite a challenge in blending so many newcomers into a cohesive unit. The left-sided Paraguay central defender Omar Alderete – who finalised his £10.4m move from Getafe on Tuesday morning – looks a smart addition, but disappointing pre-season results reflect a squad who possibly still barely recognise each other if they pass on the street.If Sunderland are not quite copying Nottingham Forest, who spent £142m on 21 players after being promoted in 2022, they would be very happy to emulate Forest and ensure Premier League survival before starting to thrive. Re-establishing themselves in the top tier after an eight-year absence will be tough but the club are certainly throwing everything at the challenge. Stadium of Light regulars will hope first-team roles are found for much-loved players of last season’s promotion including the striker Wilson Isidor and, above all, the talented local-born midfielder Chris Rigg. Harmony off the pitch and unity on it were formidably strong last term; can that glorious spirit be recreated at a time when a series of playoff winners seem set for the exit or the bench?A graph of Sunderland’s finishing positions in the past five seasonsThe managerThe 49-year-old Le Bris ended his first season on Wearside by choreographing Sunderland’sdramatic Wembley triumph against Sheffield Unitedin May’s playoff final. A former Rennes and Laval defender, the Frenchman holds a doctorate in physiology and biomechanics and a diploma in the mental training of elite athletes. He spent a decade as a youth coach at Lorient in his native Brittany before taking charge of the first team in 2022, with his love of trigonometry underpinning a coaching philosophy that sees football as being all about triangles. Le Bris began learning English, almost from scratch, the same year. He has just signed a lucrative, long-term contract.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has presided over a strategy of recruiting gifted, if raw, young players from across the world. The successful implementation has been masterminded by the sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman. The latter has been joined this summer by the former Nice and Roma sporting director Florent Ghisolfi, who has assumed the same role and has been restocking the squad. The club’s gradual gentrification continues with the Michelin-starred chef Tommy Banks opening a decidedly upmarket restaurant, Banks on the Wear, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light.A horizontal bar chart of last season’s resultsStar signingThe much decorated Xhaka, the 32-year-old Switzerland captain and former Arsenal central midfielder, has joined for a fee that could reach £17m after a successful stint at Bayer Leverkusen. “I feel I’m ready to help Sunderland with my experience but also with quality as well,” he said. His recruitment constitutes quite a statement because it is a significant deviation from the board’s policy of acquiring promising youngsters with high resale potential. The intensity of Xhaka’s tempo-setting game should appeal to fans and the raucous Stadium of Light looks a perfect stage for his well-calibrated passing range and committed brand of leadership.Stepping upAfter scoring six goals (all in the Conference League) in 16 first-team appearances for Chelsea Guiu arrives on a season’s loan. The talk in west London is that the former Barcelona forward could prove as good as Cole Palmer and Sunderland fought off considerable opposition to borrow the 19-year-old for a season. “I see myself as a powerful striker who can make a big difference on and off the ball,” he said. “I pride myself on being a natural goalscorer. This year at Sunderland is a huge opportunity for me.”Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26SunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inter had hoped to reunite Leoni with the formerParmacoach Cristian Chivu but were unable to match the financial offer from Liverpool.Liverpool consider Leoni one of the most promising young defenders in Europe and, having agreed a package with Parma, he is expected to go straight into the first-team squad. A deal for the 6ft 5in defender would not end the Premier League champions’interest in Marc Guéhi. Negotiations with Crystal Palace over the England international are continuing.Newcastle close to signing Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa for £40mRead moreDominic Calvert-Lewin is undergoing a medical atLeedswith a view to sealing a free transfer to the promoted Premier League club. The 28‑year-old centre-forward has been a free agent sinceleaving Evertonin June after nine years. He scored 71 times in 273 appearances for the club and described his departure as “incredibly difficult”.Moving to Elland Road, where he is poised to become the eighth recruit of a busy summer, would bring the former Sheffield United player back to his native Yorkshire. Calvert-Lewin would compete with the former Wolfsburg forward Lukas Nmecha and Joël Piroe, the Championship top scorer last season, for a place in Daniel Farke’s XI.Calvert-Lewin’s arrival would be expected to accelerate Patrick Bamford’s exit from Leeds. Farke has told Bamford he has no future at the club. His fellow forward Mateo Joseph has joined Mallorca on loan. Calvert-Lewin, like Bamford, has struggled with injuries in recent seasons. He has 11 England caps, scoring four goals, but last played for his country in 2021.Newcastle are among a clutch of clubs who had considered Calvert‑Lewin, scorer of three goals last season, but they decided he was too injury‑prone.The Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz had ranked high on Farke’s attacking shortlist but, providing Calvert‑Lewin’s medical proceeds as planned, Leeds seem unlikely to continue that pursuit.Fulham are anxious to retain Muniz but he has recently been the subject of a near-£35m bid from Atalanta and is another option considered by Newcastle as Eddie Howe reshapes his frontline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Too many managerial changes and different strategies had undermined the playing principles established under Ferguson, said Rashford, and prevented any meaningful transition. He believes United will not be serious contenders for the Premier League again unless they keep faith with a clear plan.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 14: Manchester UnitedRead moreUnited endured their worst top-flight campaign since being relegated in 1973-74 when finishing 15th last season. Ruben Amorim, who sidelined Rashford before his loans to Aston Villa andBarcelona, is United’s sixth permanent manager since Ferguson stepped down in 2013, the last time the club won the title. Rashford came through United’s academy while Ferguson was in charge.“Show me a successful team that just adapts,” Rashfordtold the Rest is Footballpodcast with Gary Lineker and Micah Richards. “When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team, the whole academy set-up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?“You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles. Whereas at times I feel like United have just been … we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.“If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.“So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect? People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.”No United manager in the post-Ferguson era has been given three years. Rashford said the club could learn from their fierce rivals Liverpool, who ended a 30-year wait for a top-flight title under Jürgen Klopp in 2020. Klopp joined in October 2015 and secured his first trophy in 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So this is the thing that I feel – it’s not easy. But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is.

Fast forward several decades and while the standard of officiating remains much the same, advances in the fields of both technology and vanishing foam dictate that Premier League refs are now forced to include spray cans, headsetsand now body camerason the list of items to be ticked off their pre-match checklists before they can lead teams out on to the pitch.The news that several of those tasked with dispensing on-field justice will be testing Ref Cams in selected matches throughout the first round of fixtures this weekend was broken by Big Website earlier, meaning some or all of Jarred Gillett, Anthony Taylor and Chris Kavanagh will be joining assorted other frontline workers who are forced to go about their business wearing an electronic all-seeing eye to record their professional activities. However, unlike the police, Wetherspoons bar staff and some of their grassroots brethren, these members of the PGMOL match officials will not be using them for safety and security measures, but in the interests of further enhancing the viewing experience of TV viewers at home.This latest televisual wheeze has been approved by Ifab, self-styled “independent guardians” of the rules of association football, a body you’d think might be better served sorting out the increasingly impenetrable shambles that is the handball law, rather than greenlighting new and innovative ways to show everyone how utterly unfit for purpose it continues to be. Already used in Copa Gianni, where it offered viewers the shaky and largely unhelpful on-pitch POV of a wheezing man struggling to keep up with elite athletes while running around a furnace, this new technology has apparently been embraced by broadcasters who, with the exception of one that happens to sponsor this email and is therefore beyond reproach of any kind, are always looking for new ways to try to justify the increases in their already exorbitant monthly subscriptions.The PGMOL, whose employees will be wearing the Ref Cams, is also understood to be wholeheartedly in favour of this innovation, having arrived at the misguided and almost certainly incorrect conclusion that in providing fans with further insights into how difficult a referee’s job can be, it will help reduce the amount of abuse to which they are subjected.

But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect? People say we’ve been in a transition for years.

Former Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen was also among those named.Two prosecution witnesses, Chan Tsz-wah and Andy Li, also accused Lai of financially backing the advocacy group “Stand With Hong Kong” to run overseas newspaper ads supporting the 2019 protests.Lai has denied calling for sanctions againstChinaand Hong Kong and said he never advocated separatism.Four other people who held senior roles inApple Dailywere called upon by prosecutors to testify about how Lai shaped the outlet’s political stance.The mogul said his newspaper championed democracy and freedom, adding that he had always disavowed violence.“The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong... (including) rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly,” Lai said on the first day of his testimony.Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 after police raids and the arrests of its senior editors.Lai is a British citizen and his son Sebastien reiterated in March calls for British prime minister Keir Starmer to do more, saying: “I don’t want my father to die in jail.”Judges have indicated that a verdict could be reached by October.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Critics sayRussiais trying to expand its control over the country’s internet space.Vladimir Putin has authorised the development of a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, as Moscow seeks to establish what it calls digital sovereignty by promoting homegrown services and reducing its dependence on foreign-owned platforms.“In order to counteract criminals … measures are being taken to partially restrict calls on these foreign messengers,” the Interfax news agency quoted the communications regulator Roskomnadzor as saying. “No other restrictions have been imposed on their functionality.”Russia’s digital ministry said: “Access to calls in foreign messengers will be restored after they start complying with Russian legislation.”In a statement, WhatsApp’s owner, Meta, said: “WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people. We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.”Telegram said it “actively combats misuse of its platform, including calls for sabotage or violence, as well as fraud” and removes “millions of pieces of harmful content every day”.Reuters reported that voice calls on Telegram had barely functioned since 11 August and that WhatsApp calls had been rendered impossible due to intermittent sound and a metallic buzzing.The digital development ministry said Telegram and WhatsApp had ignored repeated requests to take measures to stop their platforms being used for activities such as fraud and terrorism.Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament’s information technology committee, said the platforms would need to open legal entities in Russia and cooperate with Roskomnadzor and law enforcement as part of their compliance with Russian law to lift the blocking measures.Meta was labelled an extremist organisation by Moscow in 2022, but WhatsApp, widely used in Russia, was allowed to remain. The messenger has received some penalties for failing to remove information banned by Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump alluded to other options for extending control of the police department, saying “if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress”.The president spoke after national guard troops appeared on the National Mall on Tuesday evening as officers from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies appeared in neighborhoods across the city. Videocirculatingon local media showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person that evening in Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic population. Other videos showed traffic stops near Kennedy Street in north-west Washington, which in years past has been the site of gang activity.The administration argues the steps are necessary to fight what Trump has called an “out of control” crime problem in the nation’s capital, but local officials have disputed that characterization.Data showsthat crime rates plunged last year to the lowest levels in three decades, though the capital does have higher rates of some violent crimes compared with cities with similar populations. Trump ordered federal assets into the capital after a staffer with the so-called “department of government efficiency” was attacked early in the morning in an upscale entertainment district.A White House official credited Tuesday night’s deployment with a total of 43 arrests, twice the total of the previous evening. It was unclear how much more that was than a typical night. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police department said a total of 76 arrests were made throughout the day citywide on Tuesday; the agency’s data showed they made an average of 56 arrests per day in 2024.More than 1,450 officers participated in the deployment, about half of whom were from the city’s police department, while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 whom defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission.A White House official said to expect a “significantly higher” presence of national guard troops over the days to come, as well as round-the-clock patrols by federal agents, which have thus far only been present in the evenings.Democratic lawmakers have condemned Trump’s incursion as an authoritarian move intended to distract his supporters from outrage over his refusal to make public files related to the disgraced financierJeffrey Epstein, aone-time friendwho has become a fixation of conspiracy theorists.Trump on Wednesday accused the Democrats of being “afraid to do anything because they don’t want to be criticized. But fighting crime is a good thing.” He warned that he would seek changes to Washington DC’s crime laws that he expected other cities to adopt, pointing to a cash-bail reform lawmakers in DC approved in 1992.“We’re going to go for statutes in DC and then ultimately for the rest of the country, where that’s not going to be allowed,” Trump said, singling out New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, all cities governed by Democrats. He also criticized the city government’s long-term push to be made a state, saying it was an attempt by Democrats to get two more senators. “Statehood is ridiculous. We want to straighten the place out,” Trump said.Washington DC is the second US city to which Trump has deployed troops since taking office in January. In June,he orderedUS marines and federalized national guard troops intoLos Angelesto quell protests over his immigration crackdown.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seven illegal firearms were also recovered.In anopinion piecepublished in the Washington Post, Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News personality recently confirmed as Washington DC’s US attorney, said she would push the city council to change laws around criminal sentencing, particularly for the juveniles she blamed for violence.“Young criminals have been emboldened to think they can get away with committing crime in this city, and, very often, they do. But together with our local and federal partners, our message to them today is: we will identify you, prosecute you and convict you,” Pirro said.The 700,000 residents of the federal district have no voting representation in Congress and the president and federal lawmakers have the power to meddle in laws passed by the city council.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationUS crimeUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Stephen Doughty, a junior Foreign Office minister,said ministers would continue to work towards the target in March, even after the government had announced it was cutting international aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP tospend more on defence.Under the target, 80% of aid spending must go to programmes that have gender equality as a component by 2030, though it does not need to be the main focus.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, told MPs last month that he could not “commit to decisions made by the last government” and it was “for us to look at this afresh”.The government spent £15.3bn in aid in 2023, the latest year for whichfinal figures are available. Of this, £10bn was bilateral aid spent directly on projects in developing countries, rather than multilateral institutions such as the UN.Provisional figures suggest the UK’s aid spending fell to £14.1bn in 2024, an 8% decrease on the previous year, with £11.3bn going to bilateral aid.A government impact assessment said in Julythat the government’s aid cuts meant that in Africa – which receives half of the UK’s bilateral aid – spending was being reduced in women’s health and emergency response in countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.The assessment warned that “reductions to health spending risk an increase in disease burden and ultimately in deaths, impacting in particular those living in poverty, women, children and people with disabilities”.It said there would be cuts to girls’ education programmes in countries including Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and to projects encouraging women’s participation in peace processes, with conflicts including Ukraine and Sudan supported at a reduced scale.Critics warned that scrapping the 80% commitment could compound the impact of the US and UK aid cuts and exacerbate what feels like “a global war on women”.Labour has promised to prioritise women and girls in government including by promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights abroad, and tackling gender-based violence. Harriet Harman, the former acting Labour leader, was appointed UK special envoy for women and girls in March 2025.Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international aid committee, said: “The UK’s commitments to women and girls are not just words on a page, they’re a lifeline that gives hope to some of the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet.“The Trump administration immediately cut all international maternal and reproductive health support, and just last month, burned contraception it had bought for low-income countries. Now is the time for the UK to step up our commitment to gender programming, not step away.“When we look at conflicts, climate impact and nutrition it is always women and girls who bear the brunt. Our aid programming gives them hope and opportunities in what feels like a global war on women. We can’t take that away from them now.”Alex Farley, a policy manager at Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said that “at a time when women’s rights globally are under attack and the US has been gutting all gender equality and diversity programming, it’s definitely very worrying to see the UK following suit.”“Gender equality programming has already been put at disproportionate risk in the government’s cuts to UK aid. Upholding the 80% commitment, alongside stand-alone gender programmes, is really important for the UK to send a signal showing that it’s committed to tackling gender inequality rather than stepping back.”Amelia Whitworth, head of policy, campaigns and youth at Plan International UK, said: “Anti-gender movements are growing, humanitarian and climate crises are intensifying, and girls and women are being hit hardest. In a world where girls’ rights are being rolled back, the UK has to hold the line.“WithUSAIDslashing over 80% of its programmes – including funding for gender and DEI initiatives – and European donors retreating, the need for the UK to uphold its gender equality commitments has never been greater.”A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that the government was “carefully reviewing the viability of existing commitments” after cutting aid spending to 0.3%.“As the foreign secretary has said, women and girls are a fundamental priority,” the spokesperson said. “From appointing a dedicated special envoy for women and girls to improving energy access for 15 million women worldwide, the UK has demonstrated how integrating gender equality into its international work can transform lives. We will continue to champion the rights of women and girls globally and ensure that gender equality is embedded across all the department’s priorities.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyAidUSAIDGenderWomen's healthWomenDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

This won’t be forgotten.”After the weekend’s arrests, Downing Street andYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said the protesters did not know about the group’s violent tendencies. In response, Defend Our Juries and the Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori pointed to intelligence assessments released in Ammori’s continuing legal battle fighting proscription that they said contradicted the claims.7:04‘I’m retired, and I’m not scared’: hundreds arrested at Palestine Action protest – videoThe Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), agovernment body based within MI5, produced a report on 7 March that said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added.A separate assessment by the Proscription Review Group (PRG) said a ban would be “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”. Nevertheless, the JTAC and PRG recommended proscription.References to violence by Downing Street and Cooper are understood to refer to an allegation of assault against a single person associated with Palestine Action, which they deny and which relates to live proceedings so cannot be discussed fully because of the risk of contempt of court.Anger, fear and a total rejection of politics: the Palestine Action protest was a snapshot of Britain today | Andy BeckettRead moreThe Defend Our Juries spokesperson suggested that even if the allegation were proved, that would not make the whole organisation terrorist, adding: “When the Labour MP Mike Amesburyassaulted his constituent, no one suggested that that made the Labour party a terrorist organisation.”They continued: “The public response to our protests has been overwhelming. Despite (or because of) the legal risks, the government has turned an arrest for terrorism into a badge of honour for resistance to genocide. We have been inundated with offers of support from all quarters … The protest will go ahead as long as at least 1,000 people commit to taking part. That could well be enough for the ban to be lifted. If 5,000 people show up, we’re certain the ban will be gone, and with it, most likely, Yvette Cooper.”The former cabinet minister Peter Hain has said the UK government is“digging itself into a hole”over Palestine Action and that fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting voting to ban the group.Lord Hain, who opposed proscription and was a leader of the anti-apartheid movement, said equating the likes of retired magistrates and serving doctors with al-Qaida was “absolutely wrong” and would “end in tears for the government”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsProtestIsrael-Gaza warLondonYvette CooperEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Many have said toxic chemicals in plastics need to be controlled.The main sticking point at the talks, now in their third year, has been whether to cap plastic production or to focus on issues such as better design, recycling and reuse.But oil- and plastic-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, the “like-minded group” which has reportedly been supported by the US as well as the chemical industry, reject production limits and instead want the treaty to focus on measures such as waste management and recycling.At a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday, many countries rejected the latest treaty text presented by the chair, Luis Vayas Valdivieso. They said they were “extremely concerned” or “disappointed” by the low level of ambition it contained.Colombia’s delegate, Sebastián Rodríguez, rejected the draft text as “completely unacceptable”, while Julio Cordano, head of delegation for Chile, said it contained gaps and shortcomings which did not reflect the scale of the problem.Panama’s delegate, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, also said it could not accept the draft text as a basis of negotiation and that its red lines had been “spat on and burned”.The negotiators had “only 30 hours” to find a solution to end plastic pollution, not “just a political solution”, he added.“This is not ambition, it is surrender,” he said.The UK’s head of delegation, Jane Barton, said the text was the “lowest common denominator”.“We need an effective treaty for our people and for our planet. Time is running out,” she said.The new draft contains one mention of plastic production, in the preamble reaffirming the importance of sustainable plastic production and consumption. An article on production from a previous draft has been removed. There is no mention of chemicals. A reference to the “full life cycle” of plastics in a previous draft has also been removed.Kenya described the draft as a “waste management” instrument, which had “no democratic value” for states seeking to limit plastic, while Mexico said it represented a “crisis in multilateralism”.Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, said: “Some parties, including ours, are not even willing to engage on that text, it’s a step backward.”“It certainly seems like it was very biased toward the like-minded countries [Saudi, Russia, Iran etc]. There’s problems across the board. There’s no binding measures on anything. There’s no obligation to contribute resources to the financial mechanism. There’s no measures on production or chemicals. This text is just inadequate.”Speaking before the release of the chair’s text, Juan Carlos Lozada, amember of the house of representatives of Colombia, said: “If the production keeps growing at the rate it has grown in the last decades, we have no hope for 2050, 2060. So if the treaty doesn’t have those elements, those key elements, there’s no treaty. I’d rather not have a treaty if we’re not going to have a very robust treaty.”Andreas Bjelland, the head of Norway’s delegation and the co-chair ofthe high ambition coalition, also speaking before the release of the text, said: “To keep production as part of the finalised treaty, that is important. If you look at what we agreed on in the mandate … sustainable production and sustainable consumption was explicitly mentioned. So there should be provisions to be able to work with that and develop that over time.”Greenpeace described the new text as a “gift to the petrochemical industry and a betrayal of humanity”.Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation, said: “By failing to address production or harmful chemicals in any way, this text glorifies the industry lie that we can recycle our way out of this crisis, ignoring the root cause: the relentless expansion of plastic production.”The treaty talks will continue on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsGreenpeacenewsShareReuse this content"

But leaks are occurring UK-wide; the largest single leak reported in recent years was inEdinburgh, when 24,000 litres was spilt from a ScottishPower Energy Networks (SPEN) cable.The oil is inside ageing electricity cables that were mainly installed in the 1950s to 1970s. It acts as an insulating fluid and helps to keep the cables cool, but as the cables age they leak increasingly.One scientist who has researched the cables said the leaks presented a huge problem for the environment, while Greenpeace has described the findings as extremely concerning.TheEnergyNetworks Association (ENA), which represents the electricity distribution companies, said heavy oil had not been used in new cables for 40 years and many cables had been replaced. UK Power Networks said it had made investments to reduce leakage and was committed to replacing the cables entirely in the long term.Graphic showing volume of leaks year on year from 2012Dr Susmit Basu researched the underground cables between 2015 and 2018, when he worked at a science and technology company that conducted research and development for a UK Power Networks project focusing on reducing oil leaks from them.He said the leaks presented a “huge problem for the environment” and were slowly contributing to major biodiversity loss over long periods of time.Basu visited one site inNorfolkwhere a cable was leaking oil continuously and had saturated the soil. The oil had seeped into the bodies of trees via the roots, then damaged leaves and caused them to become yellowish in colour and develop spots. The oil-soaked soil had to be removed and replaced with fresh soil. But no one knew “how much of the fluid the rainwater took with it – that was anyone’s guess”, Basu said.Usually an underground oil leak caused no immediate danger, Basu said; it was rarely the case that “this night there was a leak and tomorrow it was a disaster zone”. But with time the oil travelled through the soil into the nearest water bodies including rivers, lakes or the sea, killing useful fungi, bacteria, fish and other aquatic life.Maintenance workers often topped up cables when a drop in oil levels caused them to stop working effectively, Basu said. “Where’s those few thousands of litres going?” He said the leaked oil would “not simply disappear” and would stay in the environment for thousands or millions of years.Basu said companies were introducing solutions to the leaks, but doing so was costly and could be complicated.He also suggested there was little public pressure to act: “The leaking is invisible to the public eye … nobody cares [about the leaks], nobody knows, nobody can see. Those materials should not be in the soil … we need electricity but we also need the environment and our surrounding atmosphere to be clean.”View image in fullscreenCompanies and regulators do not publish information about precisely where leaks have occurred.Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/AlamyCompanies and regulators do not publish information about precisely where leaks have occurred or oil-filled cables are located, though freedom of information requests from environmental regulators reveal leaks have happened underneath cities, residential areas, riverbeds and arable fields.Lily-Rose Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “This is really concerning and is yet more evidence of the urgent need to update our crumbling energy infrastructure. “These cables are at best outdated, but some are virtually antiques and are urgently in need of replacement. The UK electricity grid was designed and built for the energy system of the last century.”map of Great Britain showing areas by severity of the oil leaksUK Power Networks is responsible for more electricity cable leaks than any other company, freedom of information requests to the energy regulator, Ofgem, have confirmed.Electricity North West, Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN), SPEN and National Grid Electricity Distribution (formerly Western Power Distribution) all also own fluid-filled cables.The largest single spill recorded in recent years was underneath Edinburgh. A single SPEN cable leaked 24,000 litres of oil between late 2023 and its being sealed in early 2024. An additional ScottishPower cable leaked a further 6,000 litres in Edinburgh in 2023. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency refused freedom of information requests for details on the Edinburgh leaks on the grounds that an investigation was taking place. SPEN stated at the time: “Neither leak has resulted in oil contamination of watercourses, and no enforcement actions or undertakings resulted from the two incidents notified to the regulator.”A spokesperson for ENA said the electricity distribution companies had not used heavy oil in newly laid fluid-filled cables for about 40 years and now used biodegradable substances, solid insulation and sealed cabling. It said 310 miles of older cables had been replaced in the past 10 years, and oil-filled cables made up less than 1% of the grid around London and the south-east.UK Power Networks said it had made significant investments to reduce oil leakage since 2011, replacing 78 miles of oil-filled cables, and was committed to replacing them entirely. It said it worked with the Environment Agency for reporting and mitigation and adhered to relevant operating codes. It said: “During repairs, the company recovers as much cable fluid as possible.” This included fluid pumped into containers and oil absorbed in contaminated soil, which is removed in sealed skips and disposed of by specialists.Ofgem said it had made it clear to companies that they should do everything possible to mitigate the impact on the environment, including preventing leaks by ensuring their assets were well maintained and reliable.Research for this article was supported by the Dark Green programme, an initiative of the Centre for Investigative Journalism and Journalismfund.euQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And then we were thinking, ‘Oh my God’.”Potvin said she had revealed the results to ornithologist friends. “They were mind-blown,” she said.Concern sex reversal may skew dataAlmost all of the “sex discordant” birds were genetically female but had male reproductive organs, found the research,published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.In one case, a kookaburra that was genetically male had a stretched oviduct – the passageway for an egg – that suggested “recent egg production”, Potvin said.Two genetically female crested pigeons had both testicular and ovarian reproductive structures, the research found.Other birds tested were rainbow lorikeets, scaly-breasted lorikeets and Australian magpies. The lowest levels of sex reversal was 3%, found in Australian magpies, and the highest was 6.3% in crested pigeons.Dr Clancy Hall, the lead author of the research, also at the University of the Sunshine Coast, said sex-reversed birds could affect reproductive success that should raise concerns about the impact on threatened species.She said: “This can lead to skewed sex ratios, reduced population sizes, altered mate preferences, and even population decline.“The ability to unequivocally identify the sex and reproductive status of individuals is crucial across many fields of study.”Experts say chemicals may be to blameThe causes of the sex reversals were unclear, but one factor could be contact with chemicals in the environment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most likely [cause] is endocrine-disrupting chemicals.”Dr Golo Maurer, the director of conservation strategy at BirdLife Australia, said the research was likely to cause a stir in the ornithological field.He said the presence of EDCs and the potential impacts was a “huge concern” given the other crises facing birds, from climate change to habitat clearance and plastic pollution.Some experts were cautious about extrapolating the results to the wider population of wild birds, because the birds were not a random sample but had been admitted to hospitals.Explore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, social media sites that also introduced age checks for material barred to under-18s, such as X and Reddit, did not experience dips in traffic over the same timeframe.A spokesperson for Pornhub said: “As we’ve seen in many jurisdictions around the world, there is often a drop in traffic for compliant sites and an increase in traffic for non-compliant sites.”What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age checks on adult content be enforced?Read moreThe Online Safety Act contains rules on protecting children from harmful content that require sites or apps showing pornography to prevent children from seeing it.Ofcom, the UK watchdog overseeing the act, has backed age assurance measures including: facial age estimation, which assesses a person’s likely age through a live photo or video; checking a person’s age via their credit card provider, bank or mobile phone network operator; photo ID matching, where a passport or similar ID is checked against a selfie; or a “digital identity wallet” that contains proof of age.However, the act also requires online platforms to prevent children from viewing content including material that encourages suicide or self-harm, and to suppress the spread of content such as dangerous challenges, showing serious violence or inciting hatred against people. This has led to the age-gating of content such as an alcoholic recovery forum on Reddit and footage of ananti-migrant protest, which led to warnings that the new law wasalready over-regulating.Ofcom maintains that the act does not suppress freedom of expression and has pointed to provisions that protect free speech. Breaches of the act carry a range of punishments, from formal warnings to a fine of up to £18m or 10% of global turnover or, in extreme cases, the site being blocked in the UK.Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party pledged to repeal the act after the introduction of age checks,sparking a war of wordsin which the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of siding with “people like Jimmy Savile”. Farage described Kyle’s comments as “so below the belt”.The introduction of age-checking has also led to a surge in the downloading of virtual private networks, which allow people to circumvent a country’s restrictions on viewing certain websites. The top five of Apple’s app store have been regularly dominated by VPN apps.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyInternetOfcomChildrenYoung peopleDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

He received a seven-year custodial sentence, while his accomplice, a girl aged 13, was given a three-year rehabilitation order with a six-month curfew and community service. Neither can be named for legal reasons.The solicitor general, Lucy Rigby, who referred the boy’s sentence to the court of appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, said she believed the case’s seriousness qualified the sentence for reconsideration but respected the court’s decision, and that her thoughts were with Kohli’s “friends and family, and everyone impacted by this horrendous crime”.The boy’s defence team attempted to have the sentence reduced.At a hearing on Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, who assessed the case alongside Mrs Justice Cutts and Mr Justice Murray, said the current sentence was neither unduly lenient nor excessive, calling it a “very significant sentence and necessarily so”.She said the sentence was “entirely warranted by the seriousness of the offence. It is unarguable that the sentence was manifestly excessive.”Speaking after the pair were first sentenced in June, Susan Kohli claimed her father had been repeatedly targeted by youths in the area, with the abuse being racially motivated, something that both teenagers denied while standing trial. She also claimed that the police were aware of the problem and should have had a greater presence in the area.Kohli, who was found by his family after the beating, told a paramedic that he had been called slurs during the assault, which resulted in a broken neck and three broken ribs. He was taken to hospital but died the next day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Abedi was jailed for a minimum of 55 years in 2020 for helping his brother to plan the 2017 attack.On Wednesday, Counter Terrorism Policing North East said Abedi had been charged with five offences after the incident which injured four prison officers. It said that in line with interim guidance also issued on Wednesday by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and College of Policing, clarity regarding Abedi’s nationality and ethnicity was available to the media on request. A spokesperson later said: “His nationality is British, and his ethnicity is Asian (self defined).”Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had carried out a “thorough investigation” of the incident with Durham Constabulary and HMP Frankland. Police said the Crown Prosecution Service had authorised charges of three counts of attempted murder, one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and one count of unauthorised possession in prison of a knife or offensive weapon.Abedi will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 September. Police said he remained in custody “within the prison estate”.The attack at a separation unit at HMP Frankland led to questions around prisoner access to cooking facilities.The Ministry of Justice said there would be a full review of how the incident was allowed to happen.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Between 1980 and 2000,nearly 70,000 people were killedand 20,000 disappeared, according to the findings of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Shining Path fighters were responsible for about 54% of the deaths and the military for the rest.Boluarte said: “With the enactment of this amnesty law, the Peruvian government and congress recognise the sacrifice of members of the armed forces, the police and self-defence groups in the fight against terrorism.”She added: “We’re giving them back the dignity that should never have been questioned.”There has been widespread concern about backsliding on human rights under Boluarte’s government. In 2023, theformer president Alberto Fujimoriwasreleased from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release. Last year, Peru’s congress approved a bill establishing a statute of limitations for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed before 2003.The UN Human Rights Commissionexpressed alarmabout the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Peru is now a pariah state from the point of view of international law. It puts Peru on the same level as Venezuela and Nicaragua for their outright disregard for the rulings of the inter-American court and of international law more generally.”She expressed disappointment at what she called a “cynical move”, especially as Peru “for many years did make meaningful efforts to bring perpetrators of serious human rights violations to justice”.Explore more on these topicsPeruHuman rightsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The news was first reported byNBC News.Weinstein faces sentencing next month after being convicted in June of assaulting Miriam Haley in 2006, but that sentencing hearing may only go ahead if there is no retrial on the Mann rape charge.In June, a jury failed to reach a verdict on a charge that Weinstein raped Mann. In 2020, a jury found that Weinstein had raped Mann in 2013, but that verdict, along with the guilty verdict on a charge that he sexually assaulted Haley, wereoverturned.At the retrial, Weinstein, 73, was found guilty on one count of sexually assaulting Haley. He was cleared of assaulting a third named victim, Kaja Sokola, also in 2006, and Weinstein’s lawyers insisted the encounters with all three accusers were “transactional” and “consensual”. The jury could not decide on the case involving Mann.A spokesperson for Weinstein said on Wednesday that the effort to retry Weinstein on a single charge of third-degree rape of Mann was probably an attempt by prosecutors to force his client into entering a guilty plea.“At some point this becomes a little too much,” said Juda Engelmayer. “The prosecution had a hard time making their case last time, and they’ll have a hard time the next time around. Harvey is more than ready for his next day in court if it comes.”Weinstein’s sentencing in the Haley case is set for 30 September, Judge Farber said, but that will not go ahead until Weinstein is tried again on the charge relating to Mann.Weinstein has consistently denied all of the charges against him. He is in custody in New York at Rikers Island jail awaiting a post-conviction hearing scheduled for Friday, at which allegations of juror misconduct may be brought up.Weinstein did not testify at his first two trials in New York, or in a separate trial in Los Angeles on sexual assault charges. That case is under appeal.In 2020, at his original trial, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being found guilty of two sex crimes. The women named have chosen to be publicly identified.He remains imprisoned because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein was acquitted in Los Angeles on charges involving one of the women who testified in the New York case.He denies the allegations against him.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsHarvey WeinsteinUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

This is democracy raised to the nth power … They are being judged based on the plea bargains and statements given by from people who took part in the coup attempt,” Lula said at an event in the capital Brasília.“And I’ve said to President Trump: If what happened in the Capitol had happened in Brazil, he would be put on trial here in Brazil too,” Lula added, rejecting the idea that there was anything “arbitrary” about Bolsonaro’s trial.Lula also rejected US criticism of the human rights situation in Brazil after the state department usedits annual human rightsreport on Tuesdayto accuse his government of undermining democratic debateand “suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians”.Lula said: “There was really no reason to hit Brazil with tariffs and nor will we accept being told that we don’t respect human rights here in Brazil.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead more“Every time that our American friends decide to pick a fight with someone, they try to make the people they want to fight with look like demons,” Lula added, lamenting how the 201-year-old diplomatic relationship between the two countries was “being thrown away”.Lula urged Brazilians not to fear the pressure campaign being waged by Trump, who avoided charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election after his election last year. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to issue“full, complete and unconditional”presidential pardons for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6 storming of Congress. In Brazil,141 peopleare serving prison sentences for taking part in the 8 January 2023 rightwing riots in Brasília, which were allegedly part of Bolsonaro’s coup plot.“We shouldn’t be scared and anxious or get all excited whenever a crisis comes along. Crises exist for us to create new things. Humanity has created great things … in times of crisis,” Lula said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Eras tour became the first billion-dollar tour in history and ended up making more than US$2bn over 21 months.“This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “I’m so proud of it. And it comes from the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, so that effervescence has come through on this record. So as you said, bangers.”Unlike her previous album,The Tortured Poets Department,she would not be dropping a second surprise album right afterwards, she said. “There are no other songs coming … with Tortured Poets Department, I was like, ‘Here is a data dump of everything I have thought, felt, experienced in two or three years. Here’s 31 songs.’ This is 12. There’s not a 13th, there’s not other ones coming.

Swift called the two men “geniuses” and credited them for working on her favourite of her songs including Shake It Off and Blank Space.Fans have long speculated that her next songs will draw on Swift’s relationship with Kelce, which they revealed publicly in 2023.“Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. You couldn’t take one out and it be the same album, you couldn’t add one. It is just right. That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is somehting I have wanted to do for a very long time,” Swift said.“I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it’s a temptation to release lots of music,” she added. “But I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle that these 12 songs for my 12th album – I feel we achieved that.”Her main goals, she said, were “melodies that were so infectious that you’re almost angry at it” and lyrics that were “just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional.”‘Feels bigger than herself’: the importance of Taylor Swift’s latest victoryRead moreSwift is known for dropping hints and clues for her fans before album announcements and her 12th album was no different. On Monday night on Instagram, Taylor Nation – a branch of Swift’s official marketing team –shared a carousel of 12 imagesfrom the Eras Tour, writing in the caption: “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era … ’” Soon after, a countdown to 12.12am eastern time on 12 August appeared on her website, which was transformed to a glittering orange.At 12.12am Swift’s website briefly crashed, before reappearing with scant details about The Life of a Showgirl.The 35-year-old is among the world’s bestselling musicians, selling an estimated 200m records globally, and she holdsthe recordfor most No 1 albums in the US by a female artist in history.Her last album, 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department, seta streaming record on Spotify– 300m in one day and 1bn in five – and made her the first artist in history to secure the top 14 spots on theBillboardHot 100.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

At the end of the project, the full anthology of texts will be printed using paper made from trees from the Future Library forest in Nordmarka, in northern Oslo, where 1,000 spruce trees were planted by Katie Paterson, the artist behind the project, in 2014.Ghosh, whose novels include The Circle of Reason and Sea of Poppies, said being invited to participate in the Future Library project was a “profound honour and a humbling act of trust”. The initiative “compels us to think beyond our lifetimes, to imagine readers who have not yet been born”.“It is particularly significant for me that the project has a forest at its core”, he added, “because for a long time now, I have been writing about a forest, albeit of an entirely different kind – the great mangrove forest known as the Sundarban”. Stretching across the Ganges delta, the Sundarbans are the backdrop to Ghosh’s novels The Hungry Tide, Jungle Nama andGun Island.“It will be an exciting challenge to make a connection between the forests of the far north and those of the tropics, at this time of extreme planetary crisis,” added Ghosh, whose works often address climate disaster. “I am moved to be part of a work that intertwines ecology, literature and patience on such a monumental scale.”Ghosh grew up inIndia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and has a doctorate in social anthropology from the University of Oxford. He has written a number of novels, as well as works of nonfiction and essay collections.Ghosh’s writing “is expansive, urgent, and deeply attuned to the shifting ground of our world”, said Paterson. “His stories traverse oceans and centuries, revealing how the climate crisis is inseparable from histories of empire, migration and myth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

All things being equal, who do you go for? The answer in real life is very different, in fact diametrically opposed, to the answer in a film. Few movie heroines have the candour of Jane Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, who admitted to falling in love with Mr Darcy on seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.But this is the choice, which never quite ascends to the state of a dilemma, in this charming and watchable – yet for me somehow anticlimactic – romantic comedy-drama from South Korean-Canadian film-maker Celine Song: a love-triangle confection to follow the much realer, truer love triangle ofSong’s much acclaimed debut Past Lives. When the decision is made, the final act has an almost morosely elegiac mood, as it must, as various speeches and set pieces reconcile its rather trudgingly earnest direction of travel with the witty, savvy materialism of the movie’s premise.The scene is, of course, Manhattan where Lucy, played byDakota Johnson, is a matchmaker, arranging dates and introductions for professionals who want to get married or, in fact, to settle. The movie begins varnished with a commercial glaze of luxury, that aspirational state of material wealth that marriage underpins and which no one apologises for wanting. Lucy is about to pull off her professional and personal masterpiece; she is unofficial guest of honour at the chi-chi wedding she has masterminded for a tremulous female client who has bagged a rich financial guy. The groom’s unmarried straight brother is hedge-fund manager Harry, played by Pedro Pascal: tall, well built, sophisticated, rocking a non-rental tux, clearly very rich and very interested in Lucy personally. He’s basically a nice, non-psycho version of American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman. In fact, for much of the early stages of the film, the dialogue does have something of Bret Easton Ellis: observations about wealth exchanged on a level of murmuringly subdued rational calm. No one is trying to be funny. This is just the way it is.But just as Harry is putting the moves on Lucy at the reception, her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans) serves her a drink. Humiliatingly, he is a failing actor reduced to side-hustling as a waiter for a catering company, still sharing a chaotic apartment with three other appalling losers in their 30s. And so Lucy’s relationship with the glamorous and stylish Harry proceeds in parallel with this bittersweet and inconvenient reconnection with the broke, lovable (and hot) John – flashbacks reveal that Lucy, now a supercool professional, was once much more vulnerable and emotional with John.The film does not play one suitor off against the other; there is no Mark Darcy/Daniel Cleaver-style punch-up. They are mutually respectful and both supposed to be worthy of Lucy, though Harry does have a certain secret that will have audiences doing some Googling after the film, a secret so startling on its own terms that its vulgar metaphoric potential didn’t occur to me until much later.Song was herself, she has revealed, once employed as a matchmaker. Unlike Lucy – who tells her clients she can’t just magically produce ideal mates or, like Dr Frankenstein, build them – Song can effectively do exactly this in her imaginary world, and place Lucy with an ideal man. The idealism replaces the materialism; the romanticism that comes with it is subdued.Materialistsis in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsDakota JohnsonPedro PascalChris EvansComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a prize-garlanded and Oscar-nominated film that made a serious player of its director and an international name for its then 69-year-old female lead, Brazilian stage and screen star Fernanda Montenegro. She plays a querulous woman called Dora who finds herself travelling across the country, on the edge of poverty and almost on the run, from Rio to the Sertão in Brazil’s remote north-east, in the company of a bewildered, angry, vulnerable little orphan boy whose life she has just (unwillingly) saved.It’s an often unashamedly sentimental movie about redemption in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin and Vittorio De Sica. An ingenious, if glib, final twist gives the tale its solidity, though you can taste some processed sugar in the mix; from a modern perspective it’s possible to compare this to rom-dram pictures such as Message in a Bottle and The Lunchbox. Central Station’s two characters happen to be looking for someone called Jesus; a common enough name inBrazil, of course, but the audience is entitled to suspect more, given that this man is supposed to be a carpenter and his loved ones believe that he will one day return – that is, make a second coming, back into their lives.Montenegro’s Dora is a weary and cynical woman, a retired teacher who supplements her nonexistent pension by setting up a stall at Rio’s teemingly chaotic Central Station – naturally, a vivid image of vast, uncaring indifference – offering to write letters for illiterate people and post them. There’s an endless line of people poignantly dictating their desperate messages, but Dora has lately taken to secretly binning them at the end of the day. Salles at one point also contrives a terrific sequence showing dozens of young guys hurling themselves through train-carriage windows to get the best seats.One day, a stressed woman called Ana (Soia Lira) asks Dora to write an accusatory letter to the man who, before vanishing, fathered her son, who she has brought with her; a moody, unhappy nine-year-old boy called Josué (Vinícius de Oliveira). Josué wants to meet his dad, but when Ana is accidentally killed in traffic outside the station, Dora “sells” this boy to a people trafficker for the price of a new TV. She then thinks better of it, steals the boy back and, avoiding the sinister people who now want to kill her, takes Josué on a desperate mission to track down his fugitive, no-good dad, Jesus, with only the address she has on the envelope to go by.Throughout the film, Salles keeps in play a basic question: what exactly does Dora want? To some degree, she simply wants to escape the now murderous and vengeful traffickers and to annul the grotesquely evil thing she tried to do; an intelligent woman, Dora surely knew in her heart that the people who bought Josué were not froman adoption agency, as they claimed. But we are to be in no doubt that this whole incident has brought to the surface of Dora’s mind long-suppressed and painful memories of her own father, who broke her heart rather as Jesus appears to have broken Josué’s.Salles allows us to ponder a further question: if Dora is sceptical, as we must be, that there can be no good reunion of Jesus and Josué even in the unlikely event of Jesus being found, then what does Dora envisage for herself at the end of all this? To find a new beginning on the road – even love? There is an aborted romance with a sweet-natured truck driver, who senses that joining forces with this woman and this boy is not a good idea. Perhaps Dora vaguely imagines establishing a new family life with Josué far away from Rio.The film’s final twist makes the story close with a satisfying click, though there is something a little smooth about it; for me it works against the story’s social-realist credentials and its evident ambitions for something more mysterious and spiritually resonant. Yet there is great pleasure to be had in those fervent, crowd-pleasing lead performances from Montenegro and de Oliveira.Central Station is in UK cinemas from 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBrazilWalter SallesAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Truffle around the internet and you’ll find a saga to rival the finest in Old Norse about deals signed and projects greenlit and then abandoned over the years, with names attached to direct ranging from X-Men’s Bryan Singer to Transparent’s Joey Soloway. What a shame Soloway’s version never got off the ground because that surely would have been a hoot, and probably more interesting than this soggy, CGI-infused, low-budget confection that’s finally arrived.Little-known actor Matilda Lutz gets the lead role this time around, as well as getting all the hair extensions in the auburn aisle. She presents a Sonja that’s more a pixie-like hippy chick than Nielsen’s Valkyrie heroine, a bit of a loner who mostly kicks around the forest with her beloved horse. Sonja finds herself sucked, at first unenthusiastically, into camaraderie after she is captured by evil emperor Draygan (Robert Sheehan, clearly enjoying himself) and compelled to fight in gladiatorial combats. Sometimes her opponents are the other prisoners, and sometimes they are gargantuan amalgamations of pixels and VFX fairy dust, including a grumpy cyclops roughly the size of a tower block who is controlled by Draygan with what looks like a magic torch. Wallis Day plays another antagonist with bleached eyebrows and agonising visions of all the people she’s ever killed, just to show that baddies have backstories too.Indeed, there’s quite a lot of backstorying going on here, with lashings of flashbacks as we find out how Sonja came to be a lonely child of the forest, how other characters got roped into all this, and even what makes Draygan so mean. The action sequences, which are what made the original Sonja so indelible (especially since Nielsen hadArnold Schwarzeneggeras a co-star), are a bit more rote. But someone somewhere must have done a punch-up on the script, because every now and then a reasonably witty quip arrives out of nowhere before the dialogue reverts to faux medieval speak.Red Sonja is on digital platforms from 18 August, and on DVD & Blu-ray from 8 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsBrigitte NielsenArnold SchwarzeneggerRobert SheehanreviewsShareReuse this content"

(It comes between Sex andDreams.) It is a thoroughly grownup and absorbing drama, acted with such sympathy and warmth, a ruminative and exploratory movie of ideas, and one that pays its audience the compliment of treating them as intelligent beings. Love is about a familiar question: can straight people learn from or even absorb the open and polygamous approach to sex that appears to come easier to gay people (and perhaps younger people of all sexualities), perhaps specifically gay men? Or is that idea stereotypical and naive?Andrea Braein Hovig plays Marianne, a urology consultant whose job it is to give bad news to a succession of men about their prostate cancer. She is single (though her past romantic life remains a mystery); her best friend, Heidi (Marte Engebrigtsen), tries to set her up with a divorced friend. But Marianne finds herself restive with the whole monolithic idea of dating and relationships and she is fascinated with what her nurse Tor (Tayo Cittadella Jacobsen) tells her about his own life. After work, she encounters him on their commuter ferry and he candidly tells her he uses Grindr to set up exciting, ephemeral encounters on this very craft.But it is Tor who is to develop serious feelings for one of his hook-ups – a urology patient at the hospital – and Marianne who experiments with openness, which is to upset others who feel obscurely threatened. Perhaps some of the characters are a bit too good to be true, and Marianne’s shrewd warning to Tor about immediately developing a “nurse” relationship to a partner is something whose implications are not heeded. Haugerud has something of Eric Rohmer, and perhaps a little more of Hong Sang-soo; a readiness to simply talk, and talk and talk some more. It’s surprisingly cinematic.Oslo Stories Trilogy: Love is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsNorwayRelationshipsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Its short, punchy chapters tell the story of plump, hapless Stanley Yelnats, sent to a summer camp for wayward boys, where a terrifying Warden has peculiar ideas about character reformation. The 5ft-deep holes the boys are required to dig turn out to have a surprising purpose. Shifts of time, register and perspective render a simple premise mesmerisingly intricate. It has peril, love, crime, wickedness, redemption and friendship in, well, spades.A quarter of a century later, Sachar has written his first supposedly adult novel, in which many of the same ingredients reappear. A man “dressed like a typical American tourist”, but with an odd habit of storing cake crumbs in the pocket of his hoodie, has arrived at the castle of the title, filled with curiosity to see how much has changed in the past 500 years. He seems to know intimate details about daily life back then in the court of King Sandro, Queen Corinna and the headstrong teenage princess, Tullia. Anatole, the king’s bumbling magician and alchemist, was fast losing prestige due to his abject failure to turn black sand, brought in from Iceland at huge expense, into gold. But the magician evidently achieved one stunning success, for Anatole is our present-day narrator. Grisly legends have built up around the castle, as eagerly related by the tour guide, but are full of errors. Anatole decides to recount the real story.There’s a dash of Patrick Süskind’s Perfume in Anatole’s experiments, but without that novel’s sombre heftThis former contemporary and rival of Leonardo da Vinci, now an immortal wanderer, explains how the near-bankrupt kingdom of Esquaveta depended for survival on a dynastic marriage between Princess Tullia and Prince Dalrympl of wealthy Oxatania; his betrothal gift of a tiger gave the castle its name. But Tullia loved Pito, a young scribe. Incensed, Dalrympl demanded that Pito be beheaded during the wedding feast. Anatole was tasked with ensuring the royal wedding went ahead and thus saving the realm. Timid and compromised, he brewed various bizarre concoctions supposed to inspire love and delete memories, but became embroiled in the lovers’ situation, especially after recognising Dalrympl as the swine who caused the death of Babette, his own sweetheart.The portrayal of science in the period is lightly comical but never patronising. Although he can’t conceive of a building block of matter any smaller than a grain of sand, Renaissance-era Anatole is almost on the point of discovering penicillin via his experiments with mouldy bread. In the present day he has centuries of scientific discovery to call upon; all the same, he muses, is the notion of the four humours any more fantastical a metaphor than the periodic table? Operating at the birth of modern science, Anatole had it both ways, creating effective medicines while also commanding respect as a controller of evil spirits.Despite a daring escape, pursuit and the threat of retribution, the air of whimsy throughout mitigates any sense of genuine peril (and we obviously know Anatole survives). Just as inHoles, Sachar knots plot threads together in unexpected and satisfying ways. There’s a dash of Patrick Süskind’sPerfumein Anatole’s experiments, but without that novel’s sombre heft. If the narration were given over to Tullia or Pito, this would be a standard YA novel; but then we’d be without the pleasures of Anatole’s long view and his gentle scepticism about love, war, human nature and politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It was good, spooky fun until it wasn’t. I recall movement and the start of a message before we recoiled from the board. Later that evening, I learned that my grandfather had died. While I realise now that a boy with a terminally ill relative and a lurid imagination was not the most reliable witness, I remember wanting to believe that I’d had a brush with the uncanny.When Times journalist Ben Machell’s dying grandmother bequeathed him a crystal ball, he began idly searching for mediums and happened acrossthe work of a man named Tony Cornell. Between 1952 and 2004, Cornell worked (unpaid and to the detriment of two marriages) for the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Weeding out deception and delusion from accounts of paranormal activity to find out what, if anything, remained, Britain’s most diligent parapsychologist was more claims adjuster than ghostbuster. His answering machine filled up with pleas to investigate strange happenings around the country: a trawlerman mauled by an invisible hound, a house that bled water, a rural bungalow plagued by fires and expiring pets.Machell has honoured Cornell with an entrancing biography. Drawing on boxes of tapes and documents, an unpublished memoir and interviews with relatives and contemporaries, he hears “the steady voice of a rational man methodically tapping the wall between reality and something else”. Cornell’s approach was approvingly described as “probing-doubt”: curious without being credulous, sensitive yet rigorous. In 1977, he clashed with two SPR colleagues over the infamous Enfield poltergeist: a hoax, he decided, but they got a bestselling book out of it while Cornell’s work, Machell writes, was largely “unheralded, unrewarded and appreciated only by a small group of people”. Machell’s elegantly thrilling yarn encompasses the broad history of paranormal research in the UK. In the middle of the 19th century, the tension between science and religion inspired a craze for “proof” of life after death in the form of spiritualism – seances, clairvoyants,automatic writing– and a subsequent desire to assess its veracity. The SPR was founded in 1882, in a “spirit of exact and unimpassioned inquiry”. Its members, including Lewis Carroll, future prime minister Arthur Balfour and psychologist William James, pioneered concepts such as telepathy and ectoplasm while exposing fraudulent mediums and “spirit photographers”.In the mid-19th century, the tension between science and religion inspired a craze for ‘proof’ of life after deathThe SPR proved so adept at debunking charlatans that Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass exodus of aggrieved spiritualists in 1930. The author’s nemesis was the American researcher JB Rhine, whose new field of parapsychology focused on psychic phenomena rather than the spirit realm. A poltergeist, for example, might actually be “recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis” – the violent discharge of mental energy by the living. Rhine’s secular approach appealed to Soviet materialists, who explored telepathy as a potential cold war weapon. The physiologist Leonid Vasiliev, whom Tony Cornell visited in Leningrad in 1962, possibly at the behest of MI6, claimed that explaining extrasensory perception would be as significant as discovering atomic energy.The more concepts such as telekinesis excited the public, though, the more uneasy the group’s rationalist wing became. In the 1970s, the decade of Uri Geller and Stephen King’s Carrie, Cornell’s mentor Eric Dingwall snapped and repudiated parapsychology for feeding a “new occultism”. Yet Cornell persisted. Even as he exposed numerous instances of mischief, attention-seeking and hallucination, he personally encountered a handful of phenomena that defied rational explanation. It was a mind-boggling experience in postwar India, too good to spoil here, that set him on this path in the first place. He still sought answers.During the 1990s, to his surprise, Cornell’s answering machine fell silent. He wondered whether conspiracy theories had supplanted the paranormal in the public imagination, or perhaps digital distractions had dulled our receptivity to psychic disturbances. But had he not died in 2010, he would have seen a new generation of ghost hunters do a roaring trade on YouTube, where there is no financial incentive for his brand of cautious analysis. As Dingwall feared, entertainment has trumped genuine investigation.Like many a biographer, Machell falls half in love with his subject. Cornell was respected within the SPR for his diplomacy and his “consistent willingness to be wrong”. Parapsychology may not be widely accepted as a branch of science, but Cornell had a true scientist’s commitment to doubt and impartiality. At a time when beliefs leave facts in the dust, it’s easy to share Machell’s admiration for a man who was willing to say: “I don’t know.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

For hours at a time, I trundle along the photorealistic landscapes in my pick-up truck, delivering parcels to isolated communities and building new roads. The only reason I complete the main story missions is to open new areas of the map so that I can meet new people and build more roads. I find it blissfully enjoyable.Of course, I am far from alone in playing video games this way. “Cosy games” have becomea thriving cottage industryover the past five years, led by crossover successes such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley and Untitled Goose Game, but also housing hundreds of smaller titles that appeal to highly engaged communities. On Steam this month you’ll discoverCatto’s Post Office, a delightful game about a feline postal worker, Fruitbus, a cute food truck management sim, MakeRoom, an interior design challenge, and Tiny Bookshop, which is about running … a tiny bookshop. Most of these games are united by the same elements: small teams, often young, often working remotely; short play spans; low-stakes challenges; and highly stylised visuals, as an aesthetic choice and an economic necessity.But why, if the audience for cosy games has been firmly established, aren’t there more lavish mainstream, triple-A examples? It’s clear producers such as Ubisoft, EA and Xbox are finding it tough to come up with fresh ideas – that’s why they’ve all spent (wasted) many millions trying to make the next identikit live service shooter to compete with Fortnite. So why not, I don’t know, try to make a big open-world adventure based around positive interactions and soft drama? The TV, film and book industries are crammed with this sort of stuff.

Like Hollywood, mainstream game development is largely based on minimising risk, and since the dominant cultural strand has always been action, violence and power fantasy, we inevitably end up where we are: with a thousand different combat adventures and not a single big-budget game about the love lives of a witty single mum and her sometimes exasperating daughter. But when we start to talk about culture rather than money, other factors come into play. “I think cosy gamers are a nuanced audience that values stories and mechanics over visual fidelity,” says Moo Yu, creative director at small studioTeam Artichoke, which is making an adorable anti-capitalist puzzle game named Mythmatch. “While I do think big-budget cosy games are absolutely going to be developed, it is an audience that isn’t begging for one and is capable of appreciating a wider range of experiences at a wider range of price points.”This is an important detail – high-end visuals and vast open worlds aren’t necessarily the prize goal, they’re just one aesthetic and immersive option.Untitled Goose Gamewould perhaps not have been so amusing if the lovely village had been photorealistic and the horrible goose constructed from 100,000 texture-mapped polygons. Stardew Valley is beautifulbecauseit resembles a vividly colourful retro game, not despite it. Art is not just about slavish reproduction, thank goodness. Part of the cosiness of the cosy genre is the restriction of both choice and outcome; the game takes your hand and says come this way, you are safe.View image in fullscreenCommunity over authority … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeMy lifelong friend Jon Cartwright is a veteran game developer who mentors small studios in Australia and New Zealand. When I emailed him about all this he replied: “When I think of a cosy game, I think of limited scope/size. And that’s been a function of them broadly being developed by smaller indie teams with limited budgets. But I think with the overload of … well,everythinggoing on in the world, and especially during the stress of Covid, having a small, safe environment with low stakes gameplay was a really untapped market. The fact that the visuals were ‘simple’ was another source of comfort and charm.”Charm is hard to replicate – it won’t materialise because you’ve developed an expensive new graphics engine, or because you have 500 staff working on it for 18 hours a day. You can’t build hi-tech charm centres in the desert. Itcanhappen in big games, just like it can in big TV dramas, but it’s a limited and unstable commodity. And in fact, the whole notion of the cosy game as an identifiable genre or deliberate play metric is still relatively young; games for so long, were mostly about winning. The verbs and adjectives of games about being nice to people have yet to be formalised. There’s a hoary old cliche that games are the opposite of film because explosions are cheap but a closeup shot of a human face showing emotion is wildly expensive. You could say that, in an interactive medium with historically limited visual naturalism, it’s been easier to create drama through having someone shoot at you than ask you on a date. But we have a hundred years of animation history to show us how charm, cosiness and emotional intimacy can be drawn from the most symbolic and stylised palettes.Moo Yu is certain that mainstream, naturalistic cosy epics will happen – in fact, he cites the fashion-focused role-playing gameInfinity Nikkias an example. Until then, I will be in Death Stranding 2, having to fake care about chiral contamination and extinction entities just so I can rescue kangaroos, visit inventors and drive my truck through irradiated landscapes of considerable beauty.

Also here are its decent sequel Operation Thunderbolt, plus two lesser-known greats – cyberpunk flying car shooter Night Striker and Space Gun, a frenetic take on Aliens, complete with face huggers and flame throwers. As usual for modern collections, save functions have been added, and if you get the Switch version, you can use your JoyCon as a makeshift light gun. It’s not very accurate, but it’ll remind veteran arcade dwellers of using Operation Wolf’s original mounted Uzi gun controller.These colourful, fast and ridiculous popcorn games perfectly capture the spirit of the era, with their smooth scrolling 2D backdrops, banging electro-pop soundtracks and monosyllabic, muscle-bound heroes.

How does it impact other publishers?”Well, put it this way: no major games company is going to be putting up its big hope for 2026 in the same launch window as Rockstar’s long-awaited behemoth. When the game was originally slated for a late 2025 launch, three triple-A developerstold industry newsletter the Game Businessthey were giving it a wide berth. This can be hugely disruptive to development teams who may have spent years planning for a specific release slot – it can also create a media and marketing black hole, where for a few weeks, no one is interested in anything else.However, it’s not all bad. WhenGTA Varrived in 2013, it didn’t destroy everything in its path – casual mobile games such asPuzzle & DragonsandCandy Crushdid fine, as did titles with dedicated fanbases such asWorld of WarcraftandCall of Duty. Also, a massive hit like GTA brings wider attention, interest and potentially investment to the whole industry, and there is plenty of money to be made from releasing similar titles in the wake of the original – Grand Theft Auto spawned a whole genre of gangland adventures fromSaints RowtoSleeping Dogs, while also lending innovative new design features to the entire market (GTA Online was, after all, the original live service experiment).So yes, it’s healthy. Kind of. The immediate financial shock can be challenging for other studios, but GTA V showed that casual gamers and dedicated fans of other franchises didn’t abandon everything and flock to Rockstar. Furthermore, the aftermath of a spectacular success can open new opportunities. After all, before Star Wars, no Hollywood studio would have touched a big budget sci-fi flick, but in the following years, we got Alien, Blade Runner, The Thing and the Star Trek movies. Success is inspiring – even when it happens to our rivals.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterDeath StrandingMinecraftCall The MidwifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you wouldn’t bet against this cat with nine lives high-achieving his way to award recognition this year, so confident is his comic voice, so frothy and delightful the hour we spend in his company. Rare is the standup with nary a grump, not a whisper of self-importance nor a scintilla of cynicism – just effervescent joy taken in our company, the world and so many wonderful things in it.And erudition, too, and surprising ideas to undergird the giddy comedy. An act much given to sweeping historico-cultural theses attends in This Must Be Heaven to gluttony, its distinction from greed, and how it challenges the individualism of our age. Tothill’s case study is the Georgian-era guzzler Edward Dando, who ate oysters by the barrowload and refused to pay for them. What a hero, argues our host – at least once he’s dispensed all the absolutely essential gossip that forms the first third of the show.Comedian John Tothill: ‘My second near-death experience? I blame the bedtime cheesy chips’Read moreHow much of that is extemporised, who knows, as the Essex man riffs ecstatically on how his audience is dressed, on a trip to the Margate Crab Museum, and on a dread experience he recently had gigging aboard a cruise ship. (“It made the House of Lords look like Love Island.”) No one is better at making this stuff seem as if it’s tripping apropos of nothing off his tongue, and few bring to it such vivacity.A buffet interaction on that fateful cruise gives the show its moral, which is to be grateful not grizzly at the abundance life puts our way. You might ascribe that life-affirming credo, shot through the entire act, to the most recent of Tothill’s brushes with death: he gives us a lurid account here of the exploded appendix that up-ended his 2024 fringe. Perhaps the “stupid and immature” (his doctor’s words) recklessness that risked ending it all is the flipside of Tothill’s zest for life, this committed self-indulger’s paradoxical negation of the self.

It’s incredible what they lived through.” The mother in question was, of course, Anne Boleyn, and the royal cousin losing her head was Mary, Queen of Scots, sent to the scaffold in 1587 and now the subject of aballetco-created by director Bonas and choreographer Sophie Laplane for Scottish Ballet, premiering at this year’s Edinburgh international festival.There are actually multiple festival shows revisiting Mary’s legacy in Edinburgh this summer, which all take different slants on the story of the girl who inherited the throne at just six days old, became queen consort of France as well as Scotland’s ruler, and was executed at the age of 44. “I think she was a badass,” says Mhairi McCall, whose showMary, Queen of Rock!reimagines Mary as a rock star (drawing on icons from Tina Turner to Stevie Nicks), who returns to Scotland from France to find that rock music has been outlawed in favour of pop (that’s your Catholics v Protestants there). For Rona Johnston, writer/performer ofMary: A Gig Theatre Show, Mary’s story is a tragedy: “She could have done so much more but she was torn down in her prime.”View image in fullscreenMhairi McCall starring in Mary, Queen of Rock! at Cowbarn at Underbelly, Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFor Scottish Ballet’s own investigation into the myth of Mary, Laplane tells me: “We didn’t want to do a historical ballet.” The 16th century is definitely history, but what she means is they didn’t want to make something ploddingly factual, but rather dig into emotions and relationships, especially the one with Mary’s cousin, Elizabeth I. The story is told through Elizabeth’s memory and imagination as she lies on her deathbed, and it does sound like a bit of a fever dream: Mary’s baby, James, is represented by a balloon; young Queen Elizabeth appears on stilts; and Mary turns into a spider and eats her second husband, Lord Darnley.Reinvigorating narrative ballet is very much Scottish Ballet’s agenda. Its last festival premiere, the hugely successfulCoppéliain 2022, turned a corny 19th-century piece into a cautionary tale of AI and tech bros. The idea for this new ballet has been in the works for several years, back when Nicola Sturgeon was still first minister, “and we didn’t know if we’d be knocking on the door of another independence referendum,” says Bonas, putting English/Scottish friction to the fore.The rollercoaster of political fortunes plays out in contemporary life just as it did in Mary’s time, with leaders lauded one moment, hunted the next. McCall’s rock show, with its feisty frontwoman, makes this point by drawing comparisons with women in the music industry. “We love to build up women in the media, to such a point that the only way for them to come is down, and we relish in their downfall,” she says.Their portrayals are always stereotyped. Elizabeth is frustrated and neurotic, and Mary is riding her horse with her hair looseSophie LaplaneThe rapport and rivalry between Scottish Queen Mary and English Queen Elizabeth has been fodder for myriad books, TV shows and films. “It’s always very stereotyped,” says Laplane. “Elizabeth is frustrated and neurotic, and then Mary is riding her horse in the wild with her hair loose. When we started digging into it, it was interesting to find out that Mary was many, many things.”“They’re always pitted against each other,” says Johnston. “And [in our show] we say the reason for that is because of the men in their lives, who were all power hungry.” After Mary’s first husband, Francis II, Dauphin of France, died, she married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who orchestrated the murder of Mary’s friend and secretary David Rizzio. Mary may or may not have been involved in the subsequent plot to kill Darnley, but she did marry the man thought to be responsible, the Earl of Bothwell. “She met a lot of bad men, bad male influences,” agrees McCall. “And she kind of got shot down every step of the way.”The Scottish lords then turned against Mary, and Elizabeth perceived her as a threat and had her imprisoned. For Johnston’s gig theatre show, she wanted to imagine a different landscape for the two women, where instead of competition and political paranoia there would have been sisterhood and solidarity, “imagining the two of them could have been partners in some way, rather than enemies”. McCall, too, wanted to go against “the age-old narrative of two women trying to tear each other down”.Surprisingly, Mary and Elizabeth never actually met. However, they exchanged hundreds of letters, with an intensity Bonas jokingly likens to someone who strikes up a pen-pal relationship with someone in prison and falls in love with them. “They were very intimate in the letters, calling each other ‘my sister’,” says Bonas. “They absolutely recognised each other as two ruling queens and had a concept of their power and what that meant, being two women at the top of patriarchal power structures, both very vulnerable, actually, in their own ways. Needing one another, but in rivalry.” Laplane adds: “They were the only ones who could understand each other’s situation.”View image in fullscreenCharlotta Öfverholm as the older Elizabeth and Roseanna Leney as Mary in Mary, Queen of Scots.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicDespite being a “dear sister”, Mary did ultimately plot against Elizabeth (although some dispute this), and Elizabeth did send Mary to her death. “But it took her a long time to get round to signing the death warrant,” insists Bonas. “[Elizabeth’s spymaster] Francis Walsingham pretty much had to force her into it in the end.” Bonas talks of the “stunt” Mary pulled at her execution, “where she turned up wearing black, and then she’s standing on the scaffold and whips it off, and she’s dressed in red. They understood their own brands. They were aware of their own political and cultural identities.” All of which makes them fascinating characters to keep exploring on stage. For Bonas, Mary was “proud and strong and determined and passionate, but she was as much of a political actor as Elizabeth. She’s iconic, she’s emblematic of Scottishness, but telling the story through Elizabeth gave us a chance to investigate English guilt.” (Bonas is English, with a Scottish mother; Laplane, like Mary, has French and British parentage.)The atmosphere of political instability, and the sense of nowhere and no one being safe is something Laplane wanted to capture in the choreography, with a cast of shadowy figures ramping up the paranoia. She has brought her characteristic dance language to the work, full of sharp precision, detail and wit (as seen in previous works including Dextera, Click! (made for Ballet Black), and the film Dive, also co-created with Bonas). In her depiction of the three courts, Laplane finds humour amid the history. In the French court, she weaves in historical dance styles with a sense of refinement, but the men all have portly bellies (“Because back in the day, if you were rich, you ate a lot!”); in the English court, to show how stratified society was, she has Elizabeth rising up on stilts while the men all shuffle around her on their knees. The Scottish court was more horizontal, with genders mixing and more access to the queen, so they tried “to find that sense of community in the movement”, explains Bonas, “without just doing country dancing”.The score for the ballet is by Mikael Karlsson and Michael P Atkinson, who also wrote the music for Coppélia, mixing period and modern sounds. And the designs are by Soutra Gilmour (Evita, Sunset Boulevard), referencing fashion designers who themselves used historical motifs, such as Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. Cultural references bounce back and forth, with the aim of collapsing the five centuries between now and then, and synthesising eras – just as ballet itself does as an art form, forged in the Italian and French courts and now continually remade for the modern day, but always in touch with its roots. The aim is to help us see these distant figures as flesh-and-blood women. Bonas’s question is always: “How can you re-experience these characters in a way that makes them feel like people? How do you get them off the page?”Johnston says she easily connected to Mary when she started reading about her. “She was sort of my age, in her 20s, when she was in charge of Scotland. You see quotes about how fun she was and how much people loved her.” McCall was drawn to the fact that there’s still so much we don’t know. “Did she intentionally betray Elizabeth and turn against her? Was she pushed into that? Was she completely innocent? We’ll never really know for sure what she thought, what she felt. Mary’s a great example of somebody who tried to do the right thing at every turn and was just set up to fail. I like to believe she thought: ‘I’ve tried to do everything right [but when it went against her], I may as well just go down the wrong path now!’ And I love her as a person for that.”Mary, Queen of Scots is atFestival theatre, 15-17 August;Mary: A Gig Theatre Show is atGilded Balloon Patter House, 14-21 August;Mary, Queen of Rock! is atCowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Squareuntil 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreBalletMusicalsFestivalsEdinburgh festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few other comics are so associated with a single, one-off performance. That gig pitched the Pennsylvania native into a political firestorm – but in her recent live work, the comic (now based between London and Barcelona) is as apt to joke about her own life, and gender politics, as current affairs. And tonight, there are pressing personal, and very gender-related, concerns to address: Wolf appears onstage eight months’ pregnant.As you’d imagine, there’s plenty of material about that experience, including a riff on the cholestasis she developed in her first pregnancy, and another straining to justify (by characteristically blunt comparison) the “placenta smoothie” she consumed at the birth of her first child. But, understandably for an act who generates half an hour’s new standup every week for her podcast Thought Box, Wolf’s show doesn’t linger on any topic for too long, ranging across her life in a multiracial family, pigeon spies in the second world war, and the experience of being a conjoined twin.‘It felt like a scene from The Handmaid’s Tale’: US comics on the dangers of political satireRead moreIt teeters on the edge of tastelessness, that last one, but a feature of Wolf’s comedy is an aversion to right-thinking, a preparedness to alienate in pursuit of the joke. See a gag comparing drag queens to Belgian colonists in the Congo, or another refusing to engage in baby talk for fear of what her burbling tot might actually be saying. That’s what gives the 40-year-old her edge: even generic routines (the one about women needing pockets, say) can swerve on to sensitive territory.It’s not always a show where the thinking develops: Wolf’s routines, delivered with a mischievous perma-smile, can feel like gambits or provocations, thrown out to trigger a reaction or start a conversation – about how the village it takes to raise a child has been atomised, say, or about the limits of her, and her audience’s, liberalism. Together, they make for a smart and sly set in which the tongue that lashed Donald Trump is turned instead on gender politics, Wolf’s foibles, and our own.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 17 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Michelle WolfComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the other, it provides several rounds of general knowledge quizzes and her own version ofThe Chase.The ostensible reason for this happy and eccentric hybrid is Islam-Wright’s parallel careers in the arts and as a quiz host.

The quiz questions match the narrative theme. When you have just been straining for answers about the Bangladesh her family left behind or the attack on the World Trade Center a couple of days before she started school, you respond to her true-life tales in a different, more attuned frame of mind.Hers is a Romeo and Juliet story common to any immigrant community in which traditional values and present-day experience come into conflict.

One bunk, one strip of a window. Jacobs had already been incarcerated for a decade by then; at 15, he was given a double life sentence for second-degree murder. Alone in the hole, Jacobs thought, as he always did, about the most devastating month of his life, April 2004: on the 16th, he shot and killed a young man in Bellflower, California. Three days later, another young man shot and killed his beloved older brother Victor. For years, Jacobs was caught in a terrible cycle of grief – for what he had done, for what had been done to him.‘I must document everything’: the film about the Palestinian photographer killed by Israeli missiles in GazaRead moreIn the hole, Jacobs would lie on the floor, eyes closed, and imagine his life outside prison. He’d make beats by pounding on his bunk or chest. A talented singer and rapper, he began to compose songs on notebook paper, along with treatments for imagined music videos. His lyrics that grappled with healing and reckoning – how to maintain self-worth in the face of devastating interpersonal and systemic violence, how to reconcile the worst thing you’ve ever done with your dignity as a human being. The prison kept Jacobs in the hole for 2.5 months – far longer than the 15 days the United Nationsrecognizes as torture. “Being in here, death always feels imminent,” Jacobs says in a recorded prison phone call at the beginning of the remarkable new documentary Songs from the Hole. “I have to manufacture hope. And the way I manufacture hope is by writing music.”Jacobs eventually managed to record rough demos of his tracks as JJ’88 and, a few years later, played some of them for Contessa Gayles, a documentary director then filming The Feminist on Cellblock Y at the prison. Jacobs and his co-facilitator of a prison reading group, richie reseda, “had a keyboard on a trash can in the corner of the gym – richie was on the keys and 88 was singing and rapping”, Gayles recalled recently. “I just saw how incredibly talented they were and how beautiful and intimate the storytelling was in 88’s lyrics.” The three stayed in touch, and once reseda was released, began working on an idea, finally realizing a music video or two based on Jacobs’s original treatments.The result is Songs from the Hole, a deeply moving and unconventional documentary that weaves Jacobs’s musical visions first developed in solitary – bits of his handwritten “first drafts/treatments for the visual album” appear on screen – with more traditional narrative footage of his life and loved ones outside prison. “At the outset, we were really trying to be intentional about it not feeling like a traditional or familiar incarceration film,” said Gayles. “We always understood this as not just an incarceration doc, but a music film, first and foremost. Creative expression was at the center.”Fittingly, much of Songs from the Hole plays out as the hip-hop visual album Jacobs initially envisioned in solitary – stories of his family, the west coast gang culture in which he was raised, and the prison industrial complex that entraps and punishes Black men, with actors playing his younger self and Victor. Gayles, reseda and Jacobs maintained an analog collaboration for years, some of which plays out on screen – handwritten snail mail, prison phone calls always capped at 15 minutes (“I didn’t always know when they were coming in, so I just had to be ready with the phone and the recorder,” said Gayles). The production team would mail stills from the dailies, printed on paper, back to Jacobs for his input.Though the film includes recreations of incarceration as well as photos and audio from prison, the trio were “intentional to not include any voices from the system”, said Gayles, instead focusing on the experience of incarcerated people and their loved ones. Over many months and appeals to the state for clemency, Gayles checks in on his mother, Janine, father William, sister Reneasha, and his partner Indigo, whom Jacobs met when she visited prison as part of a group working for restorative justice. The goal, said Gayles, was to make Jacobs “feel as present as possible while also putting the audience in a position of experiencing him in a similar way as his loved ones do – at a distance, primarily through the phone and letters”.In song and in those 15-minute prison phone calls, Jacobs describes how he followed his brother into life on the street and turned to violence as “a tool that I used for everything”. Guns were easy to come by. Jacobs describes, with hard-earned clarity, his adolescent mindset; at 15, he believed that shooting someone would earn him respect, make him a man. That belief shattered quickly, compounded and twisted by the rage and grief he felt at losing Victor three days later. “Part of what compelled me a lot about [Jacobs’s] story was the fact that he and his family were in this position of being on both sides of that type of deadly violence,” said Gayles. “He had the experience of taking a life, and then having a life taken from him.”For years, Jacobs felt angry and hopeless. He contemplated suicide. Then he met a fellow incarcerated man named Jay, who spoke with genuine contrition, remorse and grace about the life he took as a young man. Jay inspired Jacobs to think deeply about the family he had irrevocably harmed, a path forward that did not foreground anger. (The family, never named, did not participate in the film.) Jacobs’s journey toward forgiveness, both for himself and for his brother’s killer, comes to a head in a latter-half scene that left my jaw on the floor – both at the human capacity for compassion despite everything, and at the carceral system’s total lack of interest in it.Time and again, the California correctional system continued a cycle of violence, predicated on vengeance, that Jacobs sought to escape. “Violence isn’t the only answer to violence,” said Gayles. “When harm and violence happens, we don’t need to answer it by introducing more harm and violence through punishment, revenge, retribution, incarceration.” Jacobs’s partner Indigo puts it more bluntly: “My healing is not found in someone else’s punishment.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of NetflixDespite the heavy subject matter, Songs from the Hole is anything but a portrait of despair. Jacobs endeavors to find joy – in education, in his family and fiancee, in the fact of being alive, in the “manufactured hope” of his art. And, finally, freedom – in 2020, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,commutedJacobs’s sentence based on the age at which he committed his crime and his rehabilitative work, making him immediately eligible for parole. In 2022, after 18 years in prison, Jacobs walked free. The film ends with footage of him in the studio recording new music, singing, enjoying the freedom to mess up a track, then record again. Jacobs’s burgeoning music career is evidence that “there are brilliant artists who are incarcerated, who have stories to tell that will impact and shift culture,” said Gayles.At one point in the film, still incarcerated and defeated by another legal setback, Jacobs made a list of reasons to keep living. It included his family, his partner, his art. The last one was a belief: “My shortcomings do not diminish my good.” Over 106 minutes, Songs from the Hole makes as good a case as one can to believe it.“We all have things in our lives that we need to heal from – harm that we have experienced and harm that we have caused,” said Gayles. “I hope that this film is just an entry point, and potentially a tool, for folks to heal.”Songs from the Hole is out now on NetflixThis article was amended on 13 August 2025. An earlier version erroneously referred to a shooting outside a nightclub in Long Beach. It occurred in Bellflower, California, and was not outside a nightclub.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The more time I spent with them, the more I learned about the darker side of their mobiles’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 13 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.23 EDTShareThis started as a project with my daughter and her friends, who are all part of the smartphone generation. They were 14 years old at the time and I wanted to learn more about the relationship they had with their mobile phones. In 2022,a study by Ofcomshowed that nine out of 10 children owned one by the time they reached the age of 11, and that 91% of them used video platforms, messaging apps and social media by the age of 12. I spoke to my daughter and her friends about how they use their phones and the negative reputation that surrounds teenagers and their screens. They told me the positives as well as the negatives, such as how social media can raise confidence as well as knock it down.I asked if I could photograph them. There was very little direction from me and – rather than photographing them in a controlled portraiture style, as I would usually have done – I simply observed them doing their thing. The energy was high: they moved so fast, dancing to short music reels, filming each other, laughing, scrolling, chatting, taking selfies, and back to makingTikTokdances again. It was so hectic, I struggled to keep up. This image,calledTikTok, came out of that session. I found this composition and asked Lucy to quickly look up at me. I had about two seconds before the moment was broken and they moved on to the next thing. As a portrait photographer, you get a feeling about certain shots, and I knew this was the one.They moved so fast – dancing to music reels, filming each other, laughing, taking selfies – that I struggled to keep upBack in the edit, I reflected on how the girls use their phones as a form of visual communication, or as the theoristNathan Jurgenson calls it, “social photography”. This means the result of the photograph is social, rather than an object as it would be in traditional photography. Social photography is less about making a document or archive, and more about taking a picture or video and sharing it, basically having a visual conversation.‘Pics or it didn’t happen’ – the mantra of the Instagram eraRead moreThe more time I spent with the girls, the more I learned about the darker side of their phones – the sexism and misogyny online. I shared the project as a work-in-progress exhibition in Oxford, and I worked closely with other focus groups of teenage girls who shared their experiences of online sexism and sexual harassment. I was shocked at some of the things I learned. The final project includes photographs of their handwritten testimonials.To further my research, I was reading activistsLaura BatesandSoma Sara’s work – and the original title of the project was No Big Deal, informed by Sara, who says sexual harassment happens so often it becomes seen as “no big deal”. But as the project progressed, I changed it to Once a Slag, which refers to a TikTok soundbite my daughter played to me. The acceptance and ownership of the lyrics made me feel protective and frustrated as a mother and feminist. It’s not a comfortable title, but the shock factor is important to get attention and raise awareness.‘No smartphones before 14; no social media until 16’: The Anxious Generation author on how to fight back against big techRead moreThis photograph has many layers, but it’s also striking. It is beautiful and alluring and I think it has captured a wonderful moment. It’s a celebration of the joy of girlhood, and of a group of girls in their own world. And just like social photography, these teenage years are ephemeral. In this image they are having so much fun together – it’s so important to capture this confidence in a safe place.This image has also made me very conscious of the triangle of three gazes: Lucy gazing at the viewer, performing for the camera but also confronting the viewer with that look, that attitude. Then my gaze as the mother and the photographer – which changes the more research I do on the subject. Then the gaze of the viewer, who might be transported back in time to their own teenage years. I find the tension between these really challenging with this subject matter.The girls in the image are now 17. A lot has come out since it was made. People such as Andrew Tate have become widely known – even though the kids knew all about him years before us adults did – and more recently the Netflix series Adolescence prompted wide debate.This week a mum got in touch with me and said: “I need to talk to you about short skirts.” Where I sit as a mum, and where I sit as a woman, are often totally at odds. As a mum, instinctively, you want to be protective. But if you zoom out of it, why should a woman not wear what she wants? Unfortunately, young women today are at risk, just by having a phone. That’s the world we don’t know as parents today.Philippa James’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philippa JamesBorn:Bath, 1978TrainedBA in art and moving image at Maidstone, Kent (2000); MA in photography at Falmouth (2023)Influences“Rineke Dijkstra,Miranda July, Lynne Ramsay, Tracey Emin, Abigail Heyman,Cindy Sherman, Samantha Morton, Catherine McCormack, the filmShort Cuts by Robert Altman, andLisa Taddeo’s book Three Women.”High point“Being selected last year for the Taylor Wessing portrait prize and exhibiting at the National Portrait Gallery.

In particular, he will be remembered for his writing and playing contributions to the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970), often considered Clapton’s finest achievement.Clapton first came across Whitlock, a keyboard player and singer, who has died of cancer aged 77, when he was a member of the rock-soul actDelaney & Bonnieand Friends (formed by the married couple Bonnie and Delaney Bramlett). Clapton liked them so much that he recruited them as the opening act for his band Blind Faith on their sole tour in 1969, and they would also appear on Clapton’s first solo album, Eric Clapton (1970). The live album On Tour with Eric Clapton (1970) cracked the US Top 30 and was Delaney & Bonnie’s most successful release.Whitlock quit the Delaney & Bonnie band after recording their album To Bonnie from Delaney (1970), and hooked up with Clapton in England. Along with two further Delaney & Bonnie alumni, the bassist Carl Radle and the drummerJim Gordon, the foursome became Derek and the Dominos, a name designed to give Clapton a measure of anonymity after his “supergroup” excesses with Cream and Blind Faith. As Whitlock put it to the Best Classic Bands website: “He wanted to be Derek, not Eric. He wasn’t ready to step into his role as a solo artist at that time.”View image in fullscreenEric Clapton playing the guitar next to a floral-shirted Whitlock in the dressing room of the Lyceum Ballroom, London, in 1970.Photograph: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty ImagesThe Layla double album (recorded at Criteria studios in Miami) was a pivotal release in Clapton’s history. It reached only No 16 on the US chart and did not chart at all in Britain, but its reputation grew steadily over succeeding decades. It was a momentous feat for Whitlock too, since he co-wrote six of the album’s songs with Clapton, includingBell Bottom Blues,Anyday,Tell the TruthandWhy Does Love Got to Be So Sad?, and played acoustic guitar and sang on his solo compositionThorn Tree in the Garden.This was a feverishly creative period, since the Dominos band came together while all four members were simultaneously involved in recording Harrison’s triple album All Things Must Pass, his first solo effort since the demise of the Beatles. When Harrison took a break from the sessions, he invited the foursome to use the studio, which enabled the Dominos to record their first single, Tell the Truth, with Roll It Over (another Clapton/Whitlock composition) for the B side. Intriguingly, while Clapton was inspired to writeLayla’s title song by his infatuation with Harrison’s wife, Pattie Boyd, Whitlock dated Pattie’s sister, Paula, while he was in Britain. Whitlock later sold his rights to royalties from Derek and the Dominos, but Clapton and his management helped him to get them back.Bobby was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to James Whitlock and his wife, Ruby, and grew up in the city’s Millington district. James was a Baptist preacher renowned for his fiery oratory, traces of which could be discerned in his son’s singing. Bobby also first played the piano in his father’s church. As a teenager, Bobby could frequently be found at Memphis’s renowned Stax Records, where he got to know many of the local artists, including Booker T & the MGs, Albert King andSam& Dave. He added handclaps to Sam & Dave’s 1968 classic I Thank You. “It was a great time and town for music then, especially soul music,” he recalled. “It was loose and all about music everywhere that you turned.”As a professional musician Whitlock cut his teeth playing keyboards in the local bands the Short Cuts and the Counts, and Stax planned to record an album with him on its subsidiary label, Hip Records, making him the first white artist signed to Stax. However, Whitlock felt that they were trying to turn him into a lightweight pop artist – “It turned out to be bubblegum garbage music that they recorded with me” – so he was delighted to be recruited by the Bramletts instead. He travelled to Los Angeles to join them, and as he recalled it: “We started Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, just Delaney and Bonnie and myself.”Whitlock asserted that Derek and the Dominos were “the very best band on the planet … We were better than anybody,” but their progress was cut short by a surfeit of drugs and alcohol. The rock critic Robert Palmer described how he visited the Layla recording sessions in Miami and found that “there was a lot of dope around, especially heroin, and when I showed up, everyone was just spread out on the carpet, nodded out.”The Dominos split in 1971 after an abortive attempt to record a second album, though all the band members as well as the Bramletts and Harrison appeared on Whitlock’s debut solo album,Bobby Whitlock (1972). Reflecting on the Dominos in the Houston Press, Whitlock commented that “I am very happy that the one studio record was the ‘one’ and that was it. It never will have anything other than itself to be compared to.”He would release three more solo albums during the 70s, while his other musical activities included adding vocals to Dr John’s album The Sun, Moon & Herbs (1971) and an appearance on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street (1972). For the latter, Whitlock claimed he had co-written the trackI Just Want to See His Face, but was not given a songwriting credit. In 1973 he played organ on Down the Road, the second album by Stephen Stills’s band Manassas, but found himself deprived of a songwriting credit for the trackCity Junkies, which was based on a jam between Whitlock and the drummer Dallas Taylor.During the 80s and 90s, Whitlock largely retired from music and retreated to a farm in Mississippi. He made a musical comeback in 1999 with the albumIt’s About Time. On Christmas Eve 2005 he married CoCo Carmel, a musician who had been married to Delaney Bramlett from 1987 to 2000, and the pair of them recorded several albums and made regular live appearances. From 2006 to 2021 they lived in Austin, then moved to Ozona, Texas. In recent years he became a keen painter, and frequently had his work displayed in galleries.In 2010 he published a memoir, Bobby Whitlock: A Rock’n’Roll Autobiography, co-authored with Marc Roberty and with a foreword by Clapton. In May 2024 he was awarded a brass note on the Beale Street Walk of Fame in Memphis, an event he commemorated with a new song,Walking on Beale Street.He is survived by CoCo, his childrenAshley, Beau and Tim,and his sister, Debbie.Robert Stanley Whitlock, musician, singer and songwriter, born 18 March 1948; died 10 August 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockEric ClaptonobituariesShareReuse this content"

It is more common in groups such as older people and people who are overweight or obese.Now researchers have found the severity of the condition increases at the weekend. The study cannot prove the cause, but suggests it could be down to lifestyle factors such an increase in drinking and smoking, or changes in the type or patterns of sleep – all of which can increase the risk of the condition. As a result, they have called the phenomenon “social apnoea”.“Obviously, people tend to drink more on the weekend. They tend to smoke more on the weekend if they are prone to smoking,” said Prof Danny Eckert, a co-author of the research at Flinders University in Australia, adding that as well as a possible effect from irregular sleep patterns, it might also be that people were less likely to use devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machines to manage the condition at the weekend.The researchers say regardless of the underlying cause, the results matter given the health and safety implications of OSA. It is known toraisethe risk of conditions including stroke, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and can also affect driving safety as a result of sleepiness, have an impact on relationships, and reduce quality of life.Writing in theAmerican Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Eckert and colleagues report how they analysed de-identified data from 70,052 people – the majority of whom were middle-aged, male, and overweight – who used a commercially available under-mattress sleep sensor that can track heart rate, snoring and sleep apnoea.All participants had four or more sleep recordings a week, at least 28 sleep apnoea measurements a year, and five or more breathing disruptions an hour during sleep, on average, a year.The team found the odds of moderate to severe sleep apnoea, meaning 15 or more breathing interruptions an hour, were 18% higher on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, and the effect was more pronounced in men and people under the age of 60.They also found weekend catch-up sleep of 45 minutes or more, compared with less than six minutes, and social jetlag – in other words, a clock-shift in sleep patterns – of 60 minutes or more, compared with less than 18 minutes, was associated with 47% and 38% greater odds of having moderate to severe OSA respectively.Dr Sriram Iyer, an NHS respiratory and sleep consultant, who was not involved in the work, said the study highlighted the night-to-night variability in OSA symptoms, and the team’s assumptions about the cause of the weekend uptick were “perfectly reasonable”.Ryan Chin Taw Cheong, a consultant ENT and sleep surgeon at the Cleveland clinic, London, praised the size of the study, saying it was the first of its kind to look at variability in the severity of the condition throughout the week.While he noted that study did not include data on participants’ lifestyles, meaning it could not prove the cause of the increased severity of OSA at the weekends, he said factors such as smoking and drinking were known to exacerbate symptoms, and addressing such issues – alongside diet and weight – should be one of the first steps taken to tackle the condition.“With the best intentions, we can try to treat you medically. But if you’re consuming lots of alcohol or smoking heavily, whatever we’re doing as medical professionals will be just a drop in the ocean,” Cheong said.Explore more on these topicsSleep apnoeaSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingAlcoholSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

I had spent an excruciating week resolutely not looking at my phone, part of a month-long effort to whittle my daily screen time down from more than four hours a day to less than an hour, with the hope of improving my mental wellbeing (and possibly carving out a career as an inspirational speaker). But my efforts felt futile without being able to post evidence online about how offline I had become. I frantically Googled how to retrieve notifications (you cannot) and – briefly – considered re-creating my screen time report in Photoshop.Over the past decade or two, my efforts at self-improvement have taken various forms: the year where I read 105 books; the period during which I gave up all forms of sugar including, misguidedly, fruit; and a dalliance with shamanism that, I’m sorry to say, included interpretive dance. Some might suggest I would be better off learning to cook, or drive, or type with more than one finger, but they can’t reach me because I no longer look at my phone.View image in fullscreenTrading one obsession for another … Joe Stone in Kefalonia.Photograph: Courtesy of Joe Stone“Project Screen Time” began after I listened to a podcast in which a comedian claimed that you shouldn’t look at social media within two hours of waking up, becauseit messes with your dopamine, or something. This is my favourite kind of advice: uncited, from the mouth of a layperson who can’t remember how they acquired it. But I gave up opening Instagram first thing in the morning and … it worked. Miraculously, choosing not to sandblast my brain with pictures of other people’s abs before I was fully conscious did improve my mood. Even better, I found that if I didn’t look at my socials first thing, I could often resist until after lunch. As is typically the case when I embark on a new regime, this brief moment of clarity quickly became a frenzy.I traded one obsession (looking at my phone) for another (not looking at it). In my second week, I was down to two hours of screen time a day. By my third, it was an hour and a half – and I became determined to get it below 60 minutes. Part of me was impressed that I could appear normal while quietly (nobly?) wielding this superpower. However, I was unable to keep my gift a secret. I soon began boring friends, acquaintances and service workers with tales of my herculean discipline.Before long, my quest was disrupting my day in new ways. I resented having to open Maps on my phone, so I found myself getting lost while cycling to appointments. If I wanted to show someone a picture or a meme, I would ask to Google it on their phone, rather than my own. I refused to order Ubers after nights out (the painstaking process of watching a cab crawl towards my location while the minutes of screen time racked up was torturous) and instead offered to transfer the money (later, on my laptop) to whoever did.I pick up my phone 111 times a day – it doesn’t matter how much time we spend on it | Blake MontgomeryRead moreI became increasingly frustrated that my screen time wasn’t lower. I would get to 2pm having barely glanced at my phone and yet the data would claim I had used it for 36 minutes. I began to think conspiratorially. My screen time was displayed in a graph split into blue (social), turquoise (entertainment) and orange (productivity and finance). But the vast majority of the chart was made up of undelineated grey. What was the grey?!Eventually, screen time was added to the list of subjects (including the music and lore ofTaylor Swiftand my attraction toRon DeSantis) that I was forbidden from discussing at home. My lowest point arrived as I was showing a friend my weekly stats, which gives you a breakdown of how long you’ve spent on each app. He queried why “Settings” was my third most-used application – and I had to admit it was because that was how I compulsively checked my screen time.My tantrum over being unable to memorialise my lowest-ever screen report (51 minutes a day!) was a wake-up call; reducing my screen time had become its own form of phone addiction. Rather than escaping the need to seek validation from strangers online, I had happened upon a new way to earn their approval. But all was not lost. The realisation nudged me towards acceptance that I will probably never be a moderate person; I can’t rely on any form of self-regulation (my latest regime – skincare – revolves around an LED mask that automatically switches off after 10 minutes, otherwise I fear I would be wearing it to the office like a DayGlo Hannibal Lecter).In the end, I stopped trying to recapture my screen-time report, instead screenshotting the less aesthetic chart in my settings to post online. Within minutes, DMs flooded in from people congratulating me on my self-restraint and asking how I had managed to quit my phone. I replied to them all, dopamine flooding my brain’s starved reward centre. That day, my screen time was three hours and 36 minutes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Air coolers are not the same thing as air conditioning. Rather than extracting moisture from the air to cool your room down by multiple degrees, evaporative coolers use water to cool the air they blow towards you – like a sea breeze taking the edge off summer heat – and they use a fraction of the electricity of aircon.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A typical portable air conditioner uses 1,000W (watts) of electricity (costing about 26p an hour to run, based on the current price cap). By comparison, the evaporative coolers I tested use between 26W and 87W; you could run my favourite model, the Swan Nordic (26W), for 38 hours and it would still use less electricity than a single aircon unit running for an hour.When we’re suffering from heatwaves caused by theclimate crisis, it makes sense to use less energy by choosing energy-efficient products that are effective and built to last. So I’ve tested eight air coolers to help find the best for you, assessing them in terms of size, noise, power use and, of course, how much they cool you down.It’s worth considering afantoo: they don’t actively cool air down, but the improved air circulation they contribute helps your sweat to evaporate faster, cooling down your body – and they’re even more energy efficient. It’s a personal choice: a powerful fan feels immediately cooling, whereas an evaporative cooler actually lowers the temperature. Personally, I favour evaporative coolers that have powerful fans built in. Most can be used as stand-alone fans without the evaporative function enabled, although the effectiveness varies.Note that evaporative coolers (sometimes known as swamp coolers) humidify your air, so they’re not a good fit if you have damp and mould problems. They’re designed to be used with doors open and fresh air coming in.At a glanceBest air cooler overall:Swan Nordic air cooler£69.99 at SwanBest budget air cooler:JML Chillmax Air Tower Plus£59.99 at AmazonBest for cooling power:Symphony Diet 3D 20i£129 at AmazonBest for the garden:Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UK£219 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’m triply qualified to test these evaporative coolers. First, I’m an award-winning consumer tech journalist with decades of experience testing gadgets of all shapes and sizes. Second, I have a degree in mechanical engineering. Last, but not least, I’m a menopausal woman in her 50s, as I pointed outwhile testing fans; I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt cold.How I testedView image in fullscreenA digital thermometer was used to measure how much the air coolers changed the temperature in the room.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI chose eight evaporative coolers, each from a different brand. For the scientific side of this test, I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) they use. From one metre away, I used a digital thermometer to measure the change in air temperature and the Sound Meter app to measure the noise. I also measured each evaporative cooler’s size.Subjectively, I took note of everything from how cooling each evaporative cooler felt, how annoying the noise was and how easy the controls were to use. I also considered how they looked and how small they pack away for the winter, as well as the price tag.Any evaporative coolers that weren’t collected by manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that fully furnishes the empty social housing in which women and children are placed after surviving domestic abuse.The best air coolers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest air cooler overall:SwanNordic air coolerView image in fullscreen£69.99 at SwanCurrently out of stockThis evaporative cooler isn’t just good-looking, it’s effective. I’ve tested it before for ourfanstest and retested it here: I found it just as good, and it came out slightly quieter in my tests this time. It’s on castors with a rear drawer for water, and comes with two ice packs to cool the water. There’s a slot to store the remote control.Unusually, rather than oscillating or having a swing function, the grille at the front slowly turns to alter the breeze, which is a bit hypnotic.Why we love itThe Swan cooled the room well, by 1C in an hour, and put out a wide, cooling breeze. There are 24 fan speeds, and you can select them via the remote control.The breeze is powerful, and its energy consumption is modest. It’s great to use as a fan, with or without the evaporative cooling, depending on the temperature. It’s also one of the quietest on test; I could definitely sleep with it running.It’s good value and good looking, with a coffee-coloured “oatmeal” finish and wood-effect detail. This makes a nice change from the monochrome of most models.It’s a shame that …there’s no bung on the bottom for draining the tank at the end of summer. Instead, you have to use it until nearly empty, then tip it out – although this is only once a year.Dimensions:29 x 24 x 71cm (WDH)Water tank:5lNumber of speeds:24Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:40dBPower use on top setting:26WBest budget air cooler:JML Chillmax Air Tower PlusView image in fullscreen£69.99 at B&Q£59.99 at AmazonAt its current lowest price of £59.99, this is a bit of a bargain – think of it as a tower fan with the added perk of evaporative cooling. It’s tall and thin, with a round base rather than castors. Indeed, the 29 x 29cm listed in the specs below includes the base, while the tower itself is just 15cm wide by 19cm deep.It comes with an ice pack, and you can also take the grille off the front, remove the filter and pre-soak it (by running it under the cold tap) for faster cooling. I did this for the test, which may help explain why it was so effective. To fill it, you have to pour the water into the rear drawer with a jug; you can’t detach it. This means that emptying it requires you to tip it over the sink.Why we love itThe JML cooler does a good job of putting out a cooling breeze, feeling almost like a tower fan. In fact, this cooler oscillates, turning from side to side, rather than having a swing function. Features include a timer (two, six, eight or 12 hours) and you can choose whether the lights are bright, dim or off – both features are handy at bedtime and welcome to find at this price.Cooling was fast and fairly effective. The JML cooler took the room temperature down by 0.6C within half an hour, and remained steady after that. There’s no fan-only setting, but the machine works fine without water in the tank, which effectively makes it a fan anyway.A great product for the price, this cooler performs as strongly as many tower fans, with the added bonus of the cooling functionality.It’s a shame that …there’s no remote control.Dimensions:29 x 29 x 94cm (WDH)Water tank:3lNumber of speeds:4Remote control?NoPeak noise level on test:55dBPower use on top setting:77WBest for cooling power:Symphony Diet 3D 20iView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£129 at AmazonThis evaporative cooler is bulky and imposing, but it sits on castors and is easy to move around. There are smaller models available, but theAirconCentreteam recommend sizing up: get a model designed for a larger space than you need, to make it even more effective.The control panel on top tilts up, so you can usefully see it from the other side of the room. Low down at the front, there’s a flap that opens like a letterbox for filling with water. There’s also an inlet at the back so you can attach a hose for automatic water filling.To be honest, I can’t see anyone in the UK plumbing in their cooler: maybe in a hotter, drier country where you have to use the cooler all day, every day.It also means you can’t open a drawer to tip out excess water, but there’s a plug at the bottom to drain it fully – ideal at the end of summer when you need to dry it before packing away.Why we love itThis Symphony unit cooled the room more than 1C within half an hour, faster than any of the other air coolers on test. This was despite not coming with any ice packs: it’s so powerful that it clearly didn’t need them.The result was strong and refreshing, like a sea breeze. It was loud, but you’ll probably be willing to overlook that on a very hot day. On cooler days, you can also use it as a tower fan, which is quieter. Capacity is huge, at 20 litres, and it demanded that I add at least four litres before it would start. It used this up in a relatively speedy 1hr 15mins, which wasn’t altogether surprising given that it used the most energy of all the coolers on test. I can see, then, why they’ve included the option to connect a hose, but given 20 litres will last you more than seven hours, it’s not too taxing to just fill the tank. The power use (87W on max) is more than triple the Swan’s (26W), but it still costs only pennies to run (and it’s a small fraction of the power use of air-conditioning units).You can manually adjust vertical louvres to decide on the angle of airflow, and there’s a swing setting that moves them to shift the breeze from side to side. This was good at creating a breezy effect. There’s also a timer for up to seven hours, but it’s too loud to use when sleeping unless you’re a fan of white noise.It’s a shame that …it’s loud at 60dB, equivalent to a washing machine.Dimensions:30 x 32 x 83cm (WDH)Water tank:20lNumber of speeds:3Remote control?YesPeak noise level on test:60dBPower use on top setting:87WBest for the garden:Shark FlexBreeze Pro Mist FA300UKView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£219 at John Lewis£220 at ArgosThis is not technically an evaporative cooler. It works in a similar way, but you can’t use it to cool indoors with water. Instead, it’s designed to cool you outdoors by spraying a fine mist of water directly into the air in front of the fan. I found it really effective for cooling while I was sitting on the patio.The fan is slim and elegant, with a slightly wider 35 x 35cm circular base. The big carry handle on top can be used to angle it up and down, and the fan oscillates from side to side. You can choose from three angles of oscillation or use the left and right buttons on the remote control to turn the fan.Why we love itThe Shark is very good at cooling you down outdoors. There are three levels of mist, and it’s the kind of wet wind you get straight off the sea, making everything slightly damp but very welcome in hot weather. It’s perfect for a barbecue on a summer’s day.It claims to reduce temperatures by up to 6C, although I can’t give a test figure because the water spray made my digital thermometer stop working. But what I can say is that it cooled me down fast. You quickly see why the water mist is for outdoors only: my clothes became slightly damp, and a small puddle formed in front of the Shark. I made a note not to use my laptop near it: it’s not for WFP (working from the patio) days.I liked that it’s rechargeable, easy to carry around the house by the top handle, and even convertible; you can take off the tank to use it as a fan indoors and take off the pole to convert it to a desk fan.The cordless run time is quoted as two to 24 hours, depending on fan speed, and charging time is five to six hours. I found that I could use the fan at the same time as charging it for later use.And power use was impressively low: 14W on the top fan setting, 7W to charge the battery and 21W to do both at once. This gives many fans a run for their money. It works well as a fan, with five speeds, of which the first two were silent. It’s pricey but convenient since it’s cordless. I’d buy it for indoor use and enjoy the misting for outdoor entertaining on hot days.It’s a shame that …you can’t use the misting indoors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

You can use it as a fan without evaporative cooling, although it’s not as powerful as many other fans I tested.It sits on castors, making it easy to move around, but doesn’t come with ice packs (but you could add ice for even more cooling). There’s a filling drawer at the back, with a plug underneath for draining. I liked the large capacity, but I was less keen on the way it looks. It’s not my favourite, but overall it’s not a bad buy.It didn’t make the final cut because …others performed better as coolers and fans, and are more attractive.Dimensions:31 x 30 x 75cm (WDH);water tank:10l;number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:25dB;power use on top setting:43WBeldray 4-in-1 digital air cooler & heaterView image in fullscreen£124.99 from BeldrayCurrently out of stockBest for:year-round useThis is the only evaporative cooler on test that doubles asa fan heater. While fan heaters aren’t the most energy efficient, it at least means this gadget needn’t sit gathering dust during winter. It’s compact with a sleek, boxy design on castors. There’s a filling drawer and also a flap for filling from the top.It’s not as loud or annoying as some: the sound is mannered, and I was able to sleep when using the quiet setting. Unfortunately, however, the breeze is mannered too. It felt mildly cooling, but the temperature didn’t measurably drop, even when using ice packs. I liked the swing function, at least, because it made me appreciate the breeze more.The heater worked well, but it uses a lot of power: 2kW on top mode, 1.4kW on the lower setting. It’ll warm you while WFH, but I prefer to usean electric throw: they’re cosy as well as being more efficient.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not cooling enough.Dimensions:27 x 30 x 60cm (WDH);water tank:6l;number of speeds:3;remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:74WPro Breeze OmniAir 5LView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£209.99 at Pro BreezeCurrently out of stockBest for:air fresheningThe Pro Breeze’s party trick is that you can add aroma to the air it kicks out: there’s a little drawer on the front for a pad, which you scent with a few drops of essential oil. Sadly, though, I didn’t find the room was particularly filled with lemon scent when I added my lemon oil.Cooling was a letdown, too: the temperature didn’t measurably decrease, despite adding ice packs in the rear water drawer. The lowest mode is quiet enough to sleep to, at least, and there are two sleep modes that gradually reduce power.I also liked the swing function, which blows side to side. I preferred this to the breeze mode that switches between each of the three fan levels. The breeze just wasn’t strong enough, however, no matter which mode it was in.The unit is tall and slim with no castors for moving it around, reminiscent of a tower fan. The tower itself is just 19cm wide by 24cm deep (with a wider, circular base as specified below), so it’s fairly narrow visually.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive and doesn’t cool enough.Dimensions:31 x 31 x 103cm (WDH);water tank:5l;number of speeds:3remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:30dB;power use on top setting:46WBlack+Decker BXAC65002GBView image in fullscreen£109 at CurrysCurrently out of stockBest for:using as a fanThis cooler was easy to use. To fill, I could simply pull the rear drawer half out to fill it with a jug, or easily unclip the tubes to take it to the sink. It’s also easy to check the water level from the front.Sadly, it didn’t measurably cool the room in my tests, despite the ice packs. It did put out a good breeze, though. I tried the thermometer in a neighbouring room to check if the temperature was otherwise rising: at best, the Black+Decker had cooled things by 0.3C.Overall, I still quite liked it, but more as a fan than as an evaporative cooler. It put out a nice breeze, with a sleep timer, a swing function and a natural mode that varies the strength to feel like a natural breeze.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not cooling enough.Dimensions:30 x 31 x 76cm (WDH);water tank:7l;number of speeds:3remote control?Yes;peak noise level on test:40dB;power use on top setting:63WWhat you need to knowWhat’s an evaporative cooler?Evaporative coolers use water from a reservoir to cool the air that blows at you, like a sea breeze takes the edge off summer heat. They don’t always produce a powerful wind like a fan, but they’re designed to cool the room and are much more energy efficient than air conditioning.They cool the room only a little, though, so don’t expect them to drastically alter the temperature like aircon. They’re most effective in dryer environments as they make the air more humid, effectively acting as humidifiers while cooling.What features should I look out for?Most fans oscillate, moving side to side by swivelling on their base, whereas evaporative coolers tend to achieve a similar effect via aswingmode, which turns the vertical louvres at the front, moving the airflow from side to side. I found this effective for variety, but the angle is narrower than an oscillating fan.Meanwhile,breezeandnaturalmodescycle between different fan speeds to mimic the variety of a natural breeze.Also look out fora sleep timer, which gradually reduces the power overnight.How much does an evaporative cooler cost torun?I’ll set out the maths. For each evaporative cooler on test, I measured its power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kWh (kilowatt hours). If, for example, you were using a 30W evaporative cooler for five hours, it would use 30 x 5 = 150Wh or 0.150kWh of energy.The energy price cap for 1 July to 30 September 2025 is 25.73p a kWh. So that’s the price to use 1kWh of energy. Multiply 25.73p by 0.150kWh and you’ll discover it costs just below 4p to run your evaporative cooler for five hours, or about £14 to run it this much every day for a year.Evaporative coolers are very cheap to run, then, and they’ll keep you cool enough that you can dodge air conditioning. Aircon uses significantly more electricity: pounds a day, not pennies.Broken tech is also awful for the environment. The evaporative coolers featured here have a one- or two-year guarantee. Longer guarantees are better: the makers are more likely to have built the product to last.Searching for a fan that will keep you cool on the move?

They’re salty, sweet, rich and nutty, with a crisp exterior that gives way to a soft centre. Their toasty aroma comes from browning the butter until it turns a deep brown.I used panela sugar, which lends a lovely caramel flavour to the mix, but if it’s not available you can replace it with more brown sugar.If you don’t have oval cake moulds or a cupcake tin with oval holes, any muffin or mini-cupcake tin – or even one with more traditional rectangular holes – will work. If your moulds are a bit bigger than the ones I used, just bake them for a couple of extra minutes or until the centre feels just set. If they’re smaller, take a little time off the bake as they’ll cook a bit quicker.You can premake the mixture and refrigerate it for up to five days before baking, which helps to ensure an even rise.Ten baking tips (and life lessons) from Australia’s best bakersRead moreCharlie Duffy’s burnt butter and pecan cakes – recipeMakes20170g unsalted butter100g brown sugar75g caster sugar75g panela sugar45g almond meal45g pecans70g plain flour4g salt1g ground cinnamon½ vanilla bean, seeds scraped160g egg white(from about 6 eggs)To finish150g pecansLightly grease 20 7×2 cm oval cake moulds and arrange on a baking tray evenly spaced apart.Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. When it starts to foam, stir frequently with a whisk. Continue cooking and stirring until the colour starts to turn deep brown and the smell is nutty and toasty.Strain the burnt butter through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or coffee filter paper into a heatproof bowl. Set aside to cool to about 65C.Meanwhile, combine the sugars, almond meal, pecans, plain flour, salt and cinnamon in a food processor and blitz until the pecans have broken down to a fine texture (similar to the almond meal). Empty into a large mixing bowl and add the vanilla seeds.Add the egg white to the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula until just combined, then follow with the still-warm burnt butter and mix with the spatula until just combined.Pour into a disposable piping bag and cut a small opening in the tip, then pipe the mixture into each mould until it is a couple of millimetres away from the top (I weighed mine to 35g each).Refrigerate overnight to rest (or for up to five days) – this will ensure an even rise. Skipping this step will risk the cakes popping out of the moulds unevenly during baking.Preheat the oven to 185C fan-forced (205C conventional).View image in fullscreenTo finish the cakes, place one whole pecan in the centre of each cake.Working carefully with a mandoline, shave the remaining pecans into very thin, paper-like shavings. Loosely pile shavings on to each cake.Bake for 14 to 15 minutes, or until the edges have browned slightly and the cakes feel firm to touch. Cool in the moulds for two minutes, then use the tip of a small knife to remove each cake from its mould.I love enjoying these warm with a coffee, but they’ll also keep well for a few days if you store them in a cool, dry spot.This is an edited extract fromThe Baker’s Book, Favourite recipes and kitchen wisdom by Australian bakers you loveby Ruby Goss (Murdoch Books, $45)Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkCakeAustralian lifestyleFoodDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Have you noticed the sheer abundance of fruit this year? The branches are heavy and the ground is scattered with fallen fruit. Last weekend, I harvested about 10kg plums from our tree, and my daughter suggested we make a jam tart. It turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever eaten, sweet yet sharp, sticky and rich. A simple, seasonal treat.Raining plum jam tartFrom plum to pear, every fruit tree I pass this year seems to be laden with fruit. This kind of bumper crop is known as a mast year. Some fruit trees swing naturally between light and heavy harvests from year to year, depending on whether they’re focusing energy on growth or fruiting, and it’s thought that this cycle may be an evolutionary tactic to support seed dispersal. By producing a glut, more fruit is eaten and spread by animals. This recipe is a great way to turn that glut – whether that’s a discounted punnet of berries, windfall apples or a bag of scrumped plums – into something to savour. Jams are one of the simplest and most delicious ways to preserve the season. If you’re making your own pastry, don’t forget to save any scraps to weave a lattice topping orshape into biscuits. I like to season mine with a little olive oil and whole spices before baking.For the jam500g plums250g unrefined sugar½ unwaxed lemon, ideally organic, cut into four wedges1 large blind baked tart case, homemade (see below and method) or bought in150g shortcrust pastry, for the lattice topping (optional)For the pastry (optional)300g wholemeal flour(eg, khorasan, emmer or spelt), plus extra for dusting150g cold butter, dicedA pinch ofsalt3 medium eggsWash and stone the plums, then put them in a thick-based saucepan with the sugar and lemon wedges. Bring the pan to a boil on a medium heat, then turn down to a simmer (take care the mix doesn’t boil over). After 20-30 minutes, once the jam has started to reduce and turn thick and sugary, take it off the heat (if you have a thermometer, boil the plum mix to 101C, to make a loose jam).To make your own wholemeal pastry case, in a food processor blend the flour, cold diced butter and a pinch of salt for 30 seconds, until the butter is finely mixed into the flour. Add two of the eggs and two tablespoons of cold water, then pulse for about 30 seconds, until the pastry comes together into a ball; add a touch more water, if need be.Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead very briefly, until evenly mixed. Shape into a thick round disc, place on a plate, cover with an upturned bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin, turning the dough as you go and dusting with more flour if it threatens to stick. Once the pastry round is large enough to line the base and sides of your tart case, roll it on to the pin and unroll it directly into the case. Gently ease the pastry it into the corners, then wrap the overhanging pastry up and over the rim, pressing it against the outer edge with a fork. Don’t worry if it cracks or any holes appear: that’s a sign of a nice “short” pastry – simply fill any gaps with leftover pastry or seal any cracks by pressing it back together. Next, using a serrated knife, trim the excess from the top and gather the offcuts into a ball. Chill and save for the lattice.How to turn excess pastry into moreish biscuits – recipeRead morePrick the base with a fork to stop it puffing up, then bake for about 18 minutes, until just cooked and lightly browned. Meanwhile, make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg with 30ml water. Take the baked case out of the oven, brush with the egg wash (this will fill any fork holes) and return to the oven for another five minutes. Remove and leave to cool before filling (though if you want an extra glazed tart, repeat the glazing and baking for five minutes process once more).Fill your homemade or bought in pastry case with a 1cm layer of the plum jam. If you’ve made your own pastry, roll out 150g excess pastry into a rectangle the length of the inside of the case, cut into 1-1½cm-wide strips, then arrange in a lattice on top of the jam.Bake in a preheated 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 15 minutes, then remove and brush the lattice with an egg wash made from a little milk or a beaten egg thinned with a splash of water. Bake for a final five minutes, until golden, then remove, leave to cool and enjoy with creme fraiche, yoghurt or vanilla ice cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitBakingPastryDessertSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s peaches, nectarines and apricots that get all the glory. Well, more for me! Plums that haven’t flown in from far-flung places are best: sweet, tart, fleshy and complex in flavour. It’s a no-brainer to earmark them for comforting cakes and puddings, but they are an equally worthy companion for meat, such as duck, pork or fried chicken, because their natural sharpness cuts through any fatty richness.Sticky chicken wings with plum ketchup (pictured above)This ketchup is fruity, sweet and sharp, and the perfect thing to swipe moreish chicken wings through.Prep20 minMarinate1 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes6For the chicken wings4garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2cm piece ginger, peeled and grated1tsp sesame oil60ml soy sauce60ml Shaoxing rice wine, or mirin2tbsp maple syrup1tbsp chilli sauce, such as sambal oelek or sriracha2kg chicken wings6 spring onions, trimmed and sliced1 long red chilli,sliced30g toasted sesame seedsFor the ketchup1kg plums, stoned and coarsely chopped1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 star anise1 cinnamon stick4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced4cm piece ginger, peeled and grated100g soft brown sugar100ml white-wine vinegar60ml soy sauce2tspChinese five-spiceHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line two baking trays with greaseproof paper. In a large bowl, stir the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine, maple syrup and chilli sauce until well combined. Add the chicken wings, toss to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, or overnight.Meanwhile, make the ketchup. Put the plums, onion, star anise, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the five-spice and simmer, stirring frequently, for 20-25 minutes, until the mix thickens. Fish out and discard the star anise and cinnamon, then puree the sauce with a stick blender until smooth and transfer to a serving bowl (or decant into a sterilised jar or bottle, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for three months).Transfer the wings to the lined trays and bake for 40-45 minutes, turning once halfway, until cooked through and nicely golden brown. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle over the spring onions, chilli and toasted sesame seeds, then serve with the ketchup.Sweet and sour pork with plumsView image in fullscreenPlums bring just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to this Chinese-inspired dish that’s perfect for serving with noodles or sticky rice.Prep20 minMarinate4 hr+Cook45 minServes41 tsp Chinese five-spice2 tsp light soy sauce2 tsp Shaoxing rice wine30g ginger, peeled and grated450g pork fillet or shoulder, trimmed and cut into 3cm chunks600ml sunflower oil1 egg, beaten75g cornflour1 large red onion, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks1 red and 1 yellow pepper, stalks, seeds and pith discarded, flesh cut into 2cm chunks1 large carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal600g plums, stoned and cut into bite-sized wedges6 spring onions, greens from 3 finely sliced, the rest sliced into 4cm batons2 red chillies, thinly sliced on the diagonal4garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedEgg noodles or rice, to serve (optional)For the sweet-and-sour sauce150ml chicken stock1 tbsp sriracha50ml tomato ketchup2 tbsp clear honey1 tbsp rice vinegar2 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp dark soy sauce½ tsp sesame oil1 tsp cornflourStart by marinating the pork. In a large bowl, combine the five-spice, light soy sauce, rice wine and ginger, then add the pork and toss to coat evenly. Cover and chill for at least four hours, or overnight.For the sauce, put all the ingredients except the cornflour in a small saucepan, whisk to combine and bring to a boil. Take off the heat and set aside.Line a plate with kitchen paper, then heat the oil in a wok (filling it by no more than half) to 180C (if you don’t have a digital probe thermometer, drop in a cube of bread– if it turns golden in 30 seconds, the oil is hot enough).Take the pork out of the fridge and mix in the beaten egg. Put the cornflour in a large bowl, add the pork (discard the excess marinade) and toss to coat. Working in two or three batches, deep-fry the pork for three to four minutes, turning halfway, until browned and crisp, then use a slotted spoon carefully to transfer it to the paper-lined plate. Carefully pour all but a tablespoon of the oil in the wok into a heatproof container (leave it to cool, then discard).Set the wok on a high heat, then stir-fry the red onion, peppers, carrot, plums and spring onion batons for five minutes, until just becoming tender but still with some bite. Add the chillies and garlic, stir-fry for a minute more, until fragrant, then pour in the sweet-and-sour sauce and leave it to come to a bubble. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of cornflour with a tablespoon of water, then gradually stir this into the wok to thicken the sauce. Add the drained fried pork, heat through for a minute or two, then scatter with the shredded spring onion greens and serve immediately with noodles or rice.Chai milk creme caramel with tea-poached plumsView image in fullscreenThese plums are just as wonderful eaten with thick yoghurt for a quick dessert or breakfast.Prep15 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingInfuse1 hr+Makes6For the caramel100ml water150g caster sugarFor the set custard5green cardamom pods, bruised1tsp fennel seeds3 cloves1 stick cinnamon1tsp loose black tea leaves, or 1 teabag200ml whole milk350ml double cream2 eggs,plus 4yolks, beaten75g caster sugarFor the plums100g caster sugar1 teabag1 star anise1 cinnamon quill1 vanilla pod,split lengthways and the seeds scraped out150g caster sugar500g plums, halved and stonedTo make the caramel, put the water and sugar in a pan and heat gently until the sugar dissolves, swirling and titling the pan to help it along. Keep heating until the mix turns a deep brown, then pour into six ramekins, tilting to coat the bases and sides evenly. Set aside to cool and set.Heat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Put the spices, tea, milk and cream in a saucepan, bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to cool and infuse for one to two hours.In a bowl, whisk the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar. Slowly whisk in the infused cream, pouring it in through a strainer, then discard the solids. Put the ramekins in a roasting pan and pour in the custard. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, bake for an hour, then remove and leave to cool. Once cold, refrigerate the creme caramels until needed.Meanwhile, poach the plums. Tip the sugar into a pan with 200ml water, the tea and the spices, and heat gently until the sugar dissolves. Add the plums, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for five to 10 minutes, until the fruit is tender (this will depend on the plums’ ripeness). Take off the heat, leave to cool completely, then fish out and discard the spices and teabag.When you are ready to serve, briefly dip the base of each ramekin into hot water to loosen the creme caramel, then invert each one on to individual plates. Serve with the poached plums.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkFruitFoodMeatPorkChickenDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

How to pass the test on your finances with honoursFrom checking overdraft terms with your bank, to wrapping up household bills … and don’t forget the discount schemesMabel Banfield-NwachiWed 13 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareCheck graduate accountsMost student accounts turn into graduate accounts automatically after you have finished university, but it’s worth checking what you’re being offered. Some banks keep the interest-free overdraft for a few years after you graduate, with limits of up to £3,000, while others reduce it quickly or charge interest.“It’s always a good idea to check how your overdraft terms might be affected, so you can make a plan to repay the debt before charges apply,” says Paul Slinger from NatWest. “Banks do, typically, notify you in advance of changes.”NatWest offers an interest-free overdraft of up to £3,250 for your first year after graduation. This drops to £2,250 in the second year, and £1,250 in the third. At HSBC, you could get an interest-free limit of up to £3,000 in the first year, reducing to £2,000 in year two.Lots of banks will not let you have a graduate account unless you had a student one with them. You can often switch before you finish university, but once you have graduated your choice is limited. HSBC, TSB, Barclays and Bank of Ireland all let you switch to them after you graduate, according to the websiteSave the Student.View image in fullscreenCheck, or update, ityour details and income tax, through your account on the HM Revenue and Customs website or app.Photograph: mundissima/AlamyTake a look at the different offers to find the one that best suits your needs, or use a comparison site such asCompare the Marketto get an overview. You will usually be able to transfer any outstanding overdraft to your new graduate account if you have switched, and your old account will be closed.If you are still in your overdraft, plan to clear it before interest kicks in. If you have another account for everyday spending that could mean a monthly standing order to your graduate account.A graduate account might not be the best option for everyone, says Tom Allingham, money expert at Save the Student. “Of course, not every graduate will need a 0% overdraft, and if you don’t, then a graduate bank account may not be the best place for your money. If so, it’s worth considering what else you’d like from a current account – perhaps a switching bonus, or a high-interest linked saver.”Don’t forget the loansIn England and Wales, repayments usually start the April after you finish your course, but the income threshold depends on your plan. Most students who started after August in 2023, are on plan five, where repayments kick in when they earn £25,000 a year. If you started between 2012 and July 2023, it’s likely you are on plan two, with a threshold of £28,470.Scottish students are on plan four and pay once they earn over £32,745 a year, and are unlikely to have a tuition fees loan to repay if they studied in Scotland.Northern Irish students are on plan one and start repaying at £26,065 a year, but tuition fees for residents are lower. All details are on theUK government website.You don’t have to do anything, as repayments come out of your salary automatically, or through self-assessment if you are freelance.Allingham says that, in the short term, this means recent graduates can usually relax. “That said, repayments can be mistakenly taken, so keep an eye on your payslip – if you notice an early or under-threshold repayment, look into claiming a refund,” he says.However, don’t ignore your loan, says Slinger. “It’s worth checking your online student loan account to keep track of your balance and any interest building up.”It’s also important to keep your details updated with Student Finance – especially if your income changes significantly or you move abroad.Sort out council taxYou are exempt from council tax as a student but have to start paying as soon as your course ends, not from your graduation date. For most, that means you should have been paying from around June, even if your student tenancy ran into July or August. Postgraduate students tend to finish their course at the end of September, so might be exempt a little longer.If you have extensions or resits, let your council know – it may extend your exemption. Your university may provide a letter confirming your status if needed.When setting up your next place, make sure to shop around as there may be cheaper broadband or energy dealsPaul Slinger, NatWestSome housemates might choose to stay, while others go, and the council will usually expect payment from whoever is still there and no longer classed as a student. If you all leave on different dates, the bill might be split based on who was living there, and when.If you get a bill and think it’s wrong, it’s worth getting in touch to explain. “Let your local council know your status, and check if you’re eligible for any discounts, such as if you live alone or with other students,” Slinger says.Wrap up any billsIf your student tenancy has not come to an end, be prepared for when it does: at that point you should take any meter readings – such as gas, electricity and water – and send them to the suppliers so that you are only charged for what you used. The same goes for wifi – cancel it if no one is taking over, and watch out for notice periods.View image in fullscreenNew student accommodation towering over terrace housing in Southampton, UK.Photograph: Britpix/AlamyIf you have been splitting bills and sharing expenses with housemates, check everything has been paid, and close any joint accounts or transfer them to whoever is staying. You can useapps such as Splitwise to do this easily. “If your name’s on the bill, you’re responsible for closing or transferring the account,” says Slinger. “When setting up your next place, make sure to shop around as there may be cheaper broadband or energy deals available.”Make sure suppliers and the landlord have your forwarding address.Check your tax codeIf you are starting a job, make sure your tax code is right – first payslips can come with emergency codes, especially if your employer doesn’t have your full details.Check, or update, your details and income tax, through your account on the HM Revenue and Customs website or app, and get a rebate if you have been overcharged. If self-employed or freelancing, you will need to register with HMRC if you earn more than £1,000 in a tax year. You haveuntil 5 October in the following tax year to sign up for self-assessment, so if you start now, you have until October 2026.Enjoy student discountsPerks don’t end the moment your course does. You can usually keep using UNiDAYS and Student Beans until your account expires. After you graduate, you can apply for UNiDAYS GRADLiFE, but you will need to reverify your account before you can access discounts. Student Beans also offers Grad Beans. “This extends your access to some of the most popular discounts,” Allingham says.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksConsumer affairsStudent experienceStudent financeHigher educationStudentsShareReuse this content"

But actually it’s very good and needn’t be confined to travel, especially if you’re prone to very dehydrated skin year-round.

They’re a great way to top up on moisture and to punctuate waking and dining moments, where you have to stop vegetating and look livelier.

When home, it can be stored in the fridge for instant relief in hot weather.I stick on hydrating under-eye gel patches an hour or so before landing, and while they certainly help me look less knackered, they are there as much for something to do on a long and boring flight (the in-sky equivalent of necking a whole bag of wine gums while driving on the motorway). I typically reach for any I have at the time, but if I were shopping for some, I’d generally opt for Patchology’sEyeGels(from £4 a pair), since they’re inexpensive and do the job well.Before landing, I add much-needed colour and SPF, such as Merit’s silky, pared-backThe Uniform(£34), a tinted mineral sunscreen with added perk.Explore more on these topicsBeautySali Hughes on beautySkincarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Celebrating 60 years of the Mountain Bothies AssociationThey may be the most basic form of shelter imaginable, but for the author of The Book of the Bothy they embody the magic of staying in the wild, even on a wet weekend in the Lake DistrictPhoebe SmithWed 13 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 02.02 EDTShare‘Do you think I’m going to be cold?” asks my friend Ellie as we navigate the winding roads of Mosedale, on the north-eastern reaches of the Lake District, while rain batters against the windscreen. It’s a fair question. Both the Met Office and Mountain Weather Information Service are clear – being in the Lakeland hills will not be pleasant this Friday night, due to a sudden cold and wet snap. But there’s another reason she’s asking. I’m taking her to stay in her first bothy – that’s a mountain shelter left open, year-round, for walkers, climbers and outdoor enthusiasts to use, free of charge, with no way to book.Unlike mountain huts in other parts of Europe and the world, they weren’t built for this purpose. They are old buildings left to ruin in wild places – former coastguard lookouts, gamekeepers’ cottages, remote Highland schoolrooms – before the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA) began to maintain them, offering shelter in a storm. And during this particular storm, shelter is definitely needed.View image in fullscreenFording a nearby stream.Photograph: Phoebe SmithBefore we left, Ellie was worried about what to pack, and well she might be. Despite a bothy having four walls, a roof, windows and a front door (they range from tiny, one-room affairs to sprawling, multi-bedroom structures), they are still very basic. There is no running water (there’s usually a stream nearby for this), no toilet (each has a bothy spade so you can dig your own) and no electricity (tealights and a headtorch are a must), and the one we are heading to, Great Lingy Hut, doesn’t even have the usual bothy stove for warmth.We reach the bothy and knock on the door with mild trepidation, to discover if anyone else has beaten us to itYet it’s precisely for these reasons that I’ve chosen it to be Ellie’s first. I know that because of the bad weather it’s unlikely we’ll have to share with anyone else. We park at the base of Carrock Fell, where the River Caldew is now a raging torrent. It is past dusk; the rain has eased to a mere mizzle and we can just make out the shape of the building on the skyline. With backpacks shouldered we begin uphill, keeping our eyes open for signs of walkers who may have potentially beaten us to it.“Visitor numbers have definitely gone up in recent years,” the chair of the MBA, Simon Birch, tells me when I speak to him the night before. “Of course, back in the day they were kept a secret – some old documents I was going through have ‘confidential’ written across them. But people can’t keep secrets like this.”View image in fullscreenPhoebe (left) and Ellie keeping warm in the unheated bothy.It was in 2009 that the MBA decided to publish grid references to its 100-strong network on its website – despite some internal protests. After that, the “cat was out of the bag”, says Birch. When the MBA celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2015, I asked and was granted permission to write the first guidebook about bothies – as a love letter to them, rather than a definitive guide. There was a lot of pushback, though. When The Book of the Bothy was published, I experienced online trolling (from MBA members and others), abusive emails, complaints to my publisher and even threats. But at the same time, one of the MBA’s co-founders, Betty Heath, told me how much she loved my passion; Birch told me that younger members began to sign up (when there was a real danger of membership ageing out); and now there is even a female thirtysomething trustee.Out of the 105 bothies they currently look after, only two are owned by the MBA. All the others are on leases. “Ultimately, we could lose all our bothies, if the owners decided to take them back,” says Birch – which proves just how special the network and ethos of bothies is.The hut we head to in the Lakes was originally used by miners at the nearby and now disused Carrock Mine (which dates back to the 16th century). It was relocated to its higher location on the moor as a shooting box. During the 1960s it was leased to the “Friends” Quaker boarding school in Wigton as an outdoor base and was fitted with a sleeping platform. When that school closed in 1984, it became an open shelter, and eventually the Lake District national park took responsibility for its maintenance before handing it over to the MBA in 2017.View image in fullscreenWe were at peace, away from the madness of our day-to-day lives.Photograph: Phoebe SmithWe pass the mine workings under a starry sky, so they appear only as silhouettes. We ford the stream with the help of walking poles and mutual words of encouragement. Finally, we reach the door and experience the anticipatory few seconds that anyone who’s ever stayed in a bothy will know – when after hours of walking you knock on the door with mild trepidation, to discover if anyone else has beaten you to it. The door swings open. It’s empty. We have it to ourselves.We enjoy our breakfast beside the window, where a lifting fog offers tantalising views down this little-visited valley“The biggest change has been the impact that the growing popularity of long-distance trails has had on the bothies,” Simon tells me. “Some of the spots are incredibly well used, and we now have a sanitation officer in the MBA.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Put candles and the camping stove in the designated area so as not to cause a fire risk. Use the spade for the toilet – well away from the building and any watercourses. Set up a bag for waste. As a countryside girl, she has a good idea of the code – but Birch says a problem the MBA is facing in its 60th year is that content creators are showing people the bothies on social media but not teaching good practice. As such, in a very modern move, the MBA is seeking creators to collaborate with it, to demonstrate responsible bothying.We settle in, heating a pre-made tagine and making hot chocolates to keep us warm. I also fill hot-water bottles. We chat for hours, me regaling Ellie with stories of previous bothy visits – including the time I inadvertently crashed a stag party in Scotland.The wind whistles through the cables that hold Great Lingy Hut down, but despite this, as mothers of young children, we both sleep well away from the madness of our day-to-day lives.In search of the UK’s finest mountain view: walking in Northern Ireland’s MournesRead moreRecent figures put the MBA membership at 3,800 – with many more users who don’t pay the annual £25 donation to join.

You can make such a difference with a bit of cutting back, clearing up leaves, cutting an edge on a lawn. People notice edges: you could spend hours making a herbaceous border perfect but if the edge of that border isn’t crisp, it will automatically look untidy.”“Never underestimate how much a good tidy will help things,” agrees Glaswegian gardenerColin Stewart, who was atGreat Dixter in East Sussexand now works with private clients. “Even just sweeping up dead leaves from paths makes a huge difference. Sharpen up fuzzy edges. Be brutal: if you’ve got plants that are going over, maybe sweet peas which have bolted and look a bit sad, rather than hanging on to them, it is probably best to be ruthless and pull those things out and put in something new – there is still a lot of time before the frosts are coming. Deadheading flowers will help to replenish plants so they can flower again.” Leave anything that could become a seedhead, likeDigitalis luteaor verbascums, Stewart says.Think about boundariesGiving paving a good sweep and scrub can make an immediate impression. “Even sweeping up dead leaves from paths makes a huge difference,” says Stewart. “Neat paths always make any chaos feel instantly more intentional. If you have really cracked concrete or paving slabs, putting gravel down is a good idea. If you put a thick enough layer down, some plants will self sow into it. It is preferable to decking, which always rots and becomes a hideout for vermin.” And don’t forget to sort out any sad-looking fencing, which can be painted if not replaced: “I go into a lot of gardens that are really let down by boundaries,” says Stewart. “Painting all the fences and walls around the space in the same colour, in a uniform way, makes an astonishing difference and elevates the whole garden.”Look for the lightView image in fullscreen‘It is important to think about where the light falls.’Photograph: Jacky Parker Photography/Getty ImagesPlanting “depends on whether you’re in sun or shade”, says Malt. “If you’ve got a sunny garden that gets dry in summer, obviously Mediterranean plants will do well; things likeArtemesia,Eryngium, myrtle andPhlomis. For dry shade, ferns give lovely texture.”“It is important to think about where the light falls, not just in terms of plants, but also where you want to sit,” says Stewart. “You probably want your seating area to be in the sunniest spot where the light falls in winter, spring and autumn. But in the summer, you probably want it to be in the shadiest part of the garden. And maybe that ends up being almost the same place, because of the way the position of the sun changes and because of the things coming into leaf. The classic advice is always to wait a year and observe your garden before you commit to doing anything major: look at where the light falls at every point in the year.”Know your soil“You can do a soil test,” says garden designer and presenterDanny Clarke, which you can get from a garden centre, to find out whether it is sandy, clay or loam. “If you’ve got soil that is a bit challenging – for example it’s deficient in nutrients, has poor drainage, or is clay, which makes it hard to work with in dry or wet conditions – you can always put in a raised bed. Then you control the medium and can put the plants you want in your space.”Clarke adds: “I believe in gardening on the edge: give it a go and see what happens. If you are unsure as to where to put a plant, put it in the ground, and it will soon tell you if it is unhappy. When the leaves are drooping, it is going to need watering or feeding. If that doesn’t work, you have probably put it in the wrong place, so move it and see what happens. That’s what being green-fingered is all about.”Embrace container gardeningView image in fullscreen‘You can grow almost anything in a container.’Photograph: Posed by models; Cavan Images/Getty Images/Cavan ImagesWhatever kind of outdoor space you have, containers are a good idea, says Malt. “You can moderate the environment for the plants, so you can grow almost anything in a container. Normal rules don’t apply. Some people will say, ‘You can only put bedding plants in, or you can only do roses or certain types of small shrub’ – I think that is rubbish. Go to a nursery, see what you like, and just try it.”Containers are particularly good for edibles: “I’ve got cucumbers growing in pots up a trellis,” says Malt. “Strawberries are great in containers,” says Clarke. “They are very drought-tolerant and children love them, as do the birds.”Malt is always relocating her pots: “If they don’t thrive in one part of the patio, balcony, or whatever you’ve got, you can just move it over. If you’ve got full sun, it is better to choose things that thrive in full sun. But if you’ve got a patio that faces lots of different aspects, you can move things around a bit.”Malt uses old sinks, olive oil tins and chimney pipes as homes for cardoons,Althaea cannabinaand salvias. “They are all pretty drought-tolerant plants that can take not being watered as much. Having said that, if you are growing in pots, they will always need a fair amount of water. If you’ve got the option of capturing rain with a water butt, that is really helpful. The other thing with pots is to make sure you feed them regularly. Some people think you have to change the soil all the time, but you don’t, you just keep them fed. Make sure you get a really good liquid seaweed, and if you feed that every week or fortnight, they are going to be fine.”“Use trailing plants for your balcony pots to cover the container,” says Clarke. “Use a cheap container, fill it with soil, put in flowers for height, which could be poppies or roses, then some trailing rosemary. There is a saying: ‘Thriller, filler, spiller.’ A thriller such as a canna lily would be a centrepiece; you might say it’s a show-off. A filler such as a geranium acts in a supporting role and fills out the space. The spillers, such as ivy, are planted at the edge of the container and trail downwards.”Garden for a heating climate“Concentrate watering on new plantings and pots,” says Stewart. “I would never water a lawn. Let your grass go brown and it will revive when the rain comes. I’ve got gardens I work on where the lawn is almost like a short meadow and is allowed to flower and get to a certain height, and it stays greener. If you have a very close-cropped, immaculately cut lawn, that will go brown much sooner.”If you go on holiday and come back to a dead-looking garden, don’t panic, says Stewart: “Just give it a consistent water for a couple of weeks, and it will probably start to show signs of life.” Unpredictable summer weather can be difficult to plan for but “fennel is brilliant”, says Malt, “because it is really tolerant of dry spells and seems to be quite happy when it is wet. Cistus are having a real moment; they have a very long season of interest and don’t mind dry.”Buy small plantsView image in fullscreenCucumber sprouts in ecological peat cups.Photograph: Elena Medoks/Getty Images“Be patient and buy smaller plants,” says Malt. “Bare root is best, but 9cm plants are good. They will take a bit longer to get going but they catch up quickly, and they’re much hardier and better for the planet in terms of plastic waste, and much cheaper.” Water them thoroughly when you plant, says Malt, to make sure they are well established.Plant in clumps“It is so much better, if you’re going to buy 15 plants, to buy three varieties – five of three different plants – because things look great in big clumps,” says Malt. “I generally buy in fives. That’s my number.”“Always plant in odd numbers because it doesn’t look contrived,” says Clarke. “It is almost like just throwing the plants up in the air, and you’re planting them where they land.”Think about lighting“Adding festoon lights into a garden makes it instantly feel really intimate and a nice place to sit out in the evening,” says Malt. “That is a tip from my own garden that I think has made such a difference. A mirror is brilliant in a small space too.”“I’m not a massive fan of outdoor lighting,” says Stewart. “Similarly to irrigation, you end up with wires through the soil, and it makes it much less comfortable to garden. Also it’s not good for wildlife: lights going on and off at night can bereally disruptive for them. A few lanterns or candles on tables, to me, is much more romantic and inviting.”Create a wildlife-friendly spaceView image in fullscreenGiving animals something to drink from is always a good idea.Photograph: Kevin Sawford/ImageBroker/Getty Images“It’s not just about your plants, it’s about everything else that may visit your space, whether that’s a fox or a pigeon,” says Clarke. “Some form of water is always good,” says Malt. “It doesn’t have to be a water feature. You can make tiny ponds out of any container. Just have something for birds to drink from.”“Ponds can attract all manner of wildlife,” says Clarke, “like insects, frogs and hedgehogs.” Malt also advises putting in pollinator-friendly plants: “Provide really good sources of nectar and look at winter-flowering plants, such as ivy.”Sweat, stingers and scratching: 14 expert, easy ways to treat and prevent insect bitesRead moreDon’t obsess over weeding“Look at weeds in a different light,” says Clarke. “Often, the weeds in our gardens are indigenous, and the bees tend to go for them more than they do the plants that we import. So I’m one for being a bit more relaxed: don’t trim your lawn to within an inch of its life; maybe let the shrubs get a bit shaggy. They don’t have to be neat and prim and proper. Let them do their own thing. The wildlife will thank you for it.”Consider a bulb lasagne“Gardens planted in autumn seem to be the happiest,” says Malt. It is the ideal time to plan for the year ahead and planting bulbs is a good starting point: “There isn’t a mega rush, but start thinking about planting in the autumn.“Doing a bulb lasagne – layering bulbs in a container so there is a succession of flowers throughout the spring, with later flowering ones at the bottom, and earlier flowering ones at the top – is flipping brilliant. We do really outrageously clashing, distasteful pots of tulips, muscari and smaller daffodils.”“In terms of planting, you want a bit of a discordant, jarring note to it,” says Stewart, “like a pastel scheme with really bright orange dahlias in among it. That will give it more depth.”Choose failsafe plantsView image in fullscreenAnn Folkard geraniums.Photograph: Jacky Parker Photography/Getty Images“If you’re just starting out, and you don’t know what to combine with another plant, ornamental grasses are great,” says Clarke. “If you have a rose in your garden that doesn’t quite go with a pittosporum, split it with a grass – that will bridge the gap between two plants.” Feather grass is his go-to.“Most hardy geraniums are brilliant,” says Malt, “such as Ann Folkard and Tiny Monster. They fill up a space really quickly, and they are gorgeous. Peonies and dahlias are pretty easy to grow, and you can do them in pots.”“One of my favourites isErigeron, a little trailing daisy that is so useful in containers,” says Stewart. “It is one of those plants that if you repeat it, it will unite everything in a container scheme beautifully. But it becomes even more magical when it starts to self-sow, jumping into the cracks in paths and paving. It flowers all summer, and is one of those plants that makes a garden feel really established and lived in.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsGardening advicePlantsInsectsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this week’s Long Wave, asyet more journalists are killed in Gaza, and some western countries make belated moves to recognise a Palestinian state, I examine the history of that Black solidarity, and how it has endured.Before that, some housekeeping: we’d love to know what you think of The Long Wave – what you’re enjoying, what you’re not and how we can improve. So if you can spare a few minutes, please fill out thisshort survey.A shared history of oppressionView image in fullscreenMombasa rally … a pro-Palestine rally in the coastal Kenyan city in 2023.Photograph: Gideon Maundu/APA Palestinian state was first declared by Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, in 1988. Of the 84 countries that immediately recognised the new state, half were African orCaribbeancountries. But statements of solidarity preceded recognition as the Palestinian issue was seen as emblematic of the struggles of so many postcolonial Black countries, and indeed that of Black emancipation movements in general.The Black Panther Stokely Carmichael referred to Palestine as “the tip of Africa”. In aspeech to the UN general assemblyin 1994, Thomas Sankara, the president of Burkina Faso, said: “I think of the valiant Palestinian people, the families which have been splintered and split up and are wandering throughout the world seeking asylum. The Palestinians remind us all of the need and moral obligation to respect the rights of a people.” And, of course, Palestine connected with the longest independence struggle of all – South Africa, where Mandela viewed Palestine as not just similar but crucial to a broader global liberation.‘Organically linked’ political synergyView image in fullscreenThe yoke of imperialism … an Israeli soldier lines up captured Egyptian troops in the Gaza Strip, in June 1967.Photograph: Government Press Office/APIn Africa, in particular, sympathy with Palestine developed not out of knee-jerk relatability but as a result of events. In the 1950s and 60s,Israel, which was established in 1948, attempted to cast itself as one of a rising number of countries shaking off the yoke of imperialism and establishing new, idealistic states. In doing so, it made inroads in the global south in general, and Africa, as the country attempted to counterbalance hostility from its Arab neighbours. But the wars of 1967 and 1973 sharpened the contours of Palestinian dispossession, as millions were displaced and their lands occupied, and Israel seized land in Egypt, Syria and Jordan.This period was a turning point that, according to Dahlia El Zein, a historian of the modern Middle East and Africa,marked “the decline of Israel’s influence in Africa”, and alienated Israel from themes of postcolonial struggle, situating it on the other side of liberation movements. By the mid-70s, Palestine’s place at the heart of the postcolonial movement was entrenched. The precursor to the African Union, the Organisation of African Unity, stated in 1975 that “the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regime in Zimbabwe and South Africa have a common imperialist origin … being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the dignity and integrity of the human being”.Parallel struggles against imperialismView image in fullscreenStanding together … the Palestinian artist Ayman al-Hasari paints a mural of George Floyd on a wall in Gaza City.Photograph: Ahmad Hasaballah/ImagesLive/Zuma/ShutterstockAs political challenges evolved from battling with imperialism and its aftermath to establishing civil rights and anti-racism movements in the Black diaspora, so did solidarity with Palestine. If Palestine was thetip of Africa for the Black Panthers, it also occupied a similar position in the political geography of contemporary anti-racism activists.Palestine interlocked with everything from diaspora labour union organisations, such as the UK’sCaribbean Labour Solidarity, to national and even international anti-racism movements such as Black Lives Matter. Years before the globalisation of the BLM protests in the summer of 2020, the movement’s organisers made the ending of Palestinian occupation a central demand, as well as advanced the adoption of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. At a 2021 protest for Palestine in New Jersey, Zellie Thomas, an organiser with Black Lives Matter, invoked the visceral familiarity some Black Americans felt with Palestinians. “We know occupation. We know colonisation, we know police brutality,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it has further strengthened the Palestinian cause, making it not one of abstract ideology but a crisis demanding urgent intervention due to the role of western powers, particularly the US, in supporting Israel’s assault.It was South Africa, a country with the most vivid and brutal experience of apartheid and segregation – and western enabling of that system – thatbrought the case against Israelat the international court of justice, in which it demanded that protections against genocide of the Palestinians be applied.And in the diaspora, most crucially in the US, the prime sponsor of Israel, Palestine continues to reach new points of resonance. Last year, Ta-Nehisi Coates, the most celebrated Black writer on racism and reparations in the US, published The Message, a book in which he critiques Israel and places it firmly in the camp of his own country, whose racist history he knows so well.Coates said the “closest analogue” he could think of when hevisited the occupied Palestinian territorieswas “the time in which the United States of America referred to itself as a democracy, even as it was disenfranchising whole swaths of Black people in the southern states. And so, when I say Jim Crow, when I say segregation, that is because that is the period that immediately comes to mind for me.”Perhaps this is why it has taken so long for western countries to recognise Palestine. Perhaps it is only when you can identify with the victims, when their fate speaks to your history and your lived experience, that solidarity becomes a spontaneous moral instinct rather than a political calculation.To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesThe Long WaveAfricaCaribbeanMiddle East and north AfricaRaceIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewslettersShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.London-based Nothing’s latest gadget is a set of over-ear headphones that throws out the dull design norms of noise-cancelling cans for an attention-attracting look that is a cross between a 1980s Walkman and Doctor Who’s Cybermen.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The large, semi-transparent cans are certainly a statement piece on your head, with an outer design covered in details, dot-matrix print and physical buttons, but sadly stopping short of theflashing LEDs of the company’s phones.The unconventional design has a rather more conventional price, costing £299 and landing the Headphone 1 in competition with the very best noise-cancelling headphones from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser and myriad others.View image in fullscreenThe various dots and details visible through the transparent plastic shell are purely cosmetic.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe eye-catching transparent plastic ovals protrude from smooth aluminium squircles to form the ear cups, which are attached to the headband by black steel arms that rotate and tilt to adjust the fit.The headphones are relatively heavy at 329g, but have a well-judged clamping force that keeps them secure on your head without too much pressure. The ear cushions are slim and quite comfortable, if a bit sweaty on warmer days. But the padding on the headband is a little too thin and can create a sore spot on your head after a few hours of listening.The right ear cup has five buttons and two ports dotted around it. The power switch, USB-C and headphones ports are in the bottom edge, with a dedicatedBluetoothpairing button hidden on the inside edge. A rolling button controls volume and presses in for play and pause or to switch noise-cancelling modes.View image in fullscreenThe roller button and paddle are beautifully tactile, making them easy to identify and control while on your head.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBelow the roller is a paddle that rocks left and right to skip track, fast-forward or rewind. A final button on the outside of the ear cup activates the phone’s voice assistant, but can be customised to other functions such as controlling noise cancelling. It is really nice to have multiple tactile buttons compared with the various touch or single-button controls plaguing most headphones.The battery lasts 30 to 35 hours with noise cancelling, or up to 80 hours with it off, which is in line with the competition and long enough for a week of commuting or any flight. A full charge takes two hours.The headphones support Bluetooth 5.3 and can connect to two devices simultaneously. They also have a standard 3.5mm headphones socket and can play audio over USB-C, which is handy for wired listening with a phone.SpecificationsWeight:329gDimensions:189.3 x 173.9 x 78mmDrivers:40mmConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging and audioBluetooth codecs:SBC, AAC, LDACRated battery life:35 hours ANC onSound by KEF, noise cancelling by NothingView image in fullscreenThe memory-foam ear cushions are quite thin but comfortable and provide a good seal for the sound.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing partnered withthe storied British speaker maker KEFfor the audio tuning of the Headphone 1, resulting in some great-sounding headphones. They have a fairly bassy profile, with plenty of punch in the low end without drowning out the mids and high tones. They produce a relatively wide soundstage with solid detail and separation of tones.But they sound best with noise cancelling turned off. Switch it on and they sound narrower and a bit muted in some more complex tracks, lacking a bit of punch here and there. They won’t trouble the very best in the market for high-end nuance but they sound good for general listening across a range of genres.The noise cancelling is similar: reasonably effective but some way behind the best in class. It can handle rumbles and other lower end tones reasonably well. But it really struggles with higher tones such as voices, which are clearly audible even with noise cancelling set to maximum, making them a poor choice for trying to focus in an office or cafe.The transparency mode sounds clear and natural but is a bit too loud, increasing the volume of world around you unnecessarily. It is great for awareness, but can overwhelm the music. Call quality is good, coming through nice and clear in quiet or noisy street environments.The excellent Nothing X appon AndroidoriPhonehandles settings, updates and has a full equaliser. It can be used to turn on some good spatial audio with or without head tracking to add a bit of space and realism for movies.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe physical switch for power feels good next to the USB-C and 3.5mm headphones ports.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones aregenerally repairablewith replacement ear cushions available from customer service, but they are not made with any recycled materials.PriceThe Nothing Headphone 1 cost£299(€299/$299/A$549) and come in white or black.For comparison, theSony WH-1000XM6cost£399, theBose QuietComfort Ultracost£350, theSonos Acecost£399, theBeats Studio Procost£350, theSennheiser Momentum 4 Wirelesscost£199and theFairbuds XLcost£219.VerdictThe NothingHeadphones1 stand out above the very samey-looking crowd of noise-cancelling headphones. But that overt design draws more attention on the street than I would like, particularly in white as tested.They do sound pretty good, but their noise-cancelling performance falls short of rivals’ at this price. As does the comfort with the headband lacking enough padding for really long listening sessions.Solid battery life, great connectivity and a quality app make the headphones easy to live with. It is nice to have multiple physical buttons for the playback and other controls too.At £300 or equivalent you can easily get a better combination of sound, noise cancelling and comfort from leading rivals. That means, even more sothan with the company’s phones, you have to really want something to make you look different to choose these headphones.Pros:standout design, great button controls, good sound, noise cancelling, good app for Android and iPhone, good spatial audio, 3.5mm and USB-C audio, Bluetooth multipoint, decent case.Cons:headband padding a bit thin, relatively heavy, do not fold up for travel, average noise cancelling, attract quite a lot of attention, expensive.View image in fullscreenThe headphones rotate to flat but do not fold up for storage and travel, making their case relatively large.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Biya served as prime minister under Ahidjo from 1975 to 1982.Macron said in the letter: “The commission’s historians clearly established that a war took place in Cameroon, during which French colonial authorities and military forces committed various forms of violent repression in several regions of the country, a war that continued beyond 1960, with France’s support for actions taken by the independent Cameroonian authorities.However, Macron did not apologise or mention any form of reparations.In 1884, the area today known as Cameroon became the German colony of Kamerun. During the first world war, British and French forces seized the territory, which was later split between them by the League of Nations after Germany’s defeat in 1919.In January the commission, which was announced at a joint press conference given by Macron and Biya in Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital, in 2022, submitted its findings in a1,035-page report. The human toll of the state-sponsored repression is estimated to have been tens of thousands, included the assassination of the nationalist leader Ruben Um Nyobè.The Cameroonian singer Blick Bassy, a co-head of the commission, said: “We are only at the beginning of a process that will require several years … to locate and identify the bodies in mass graves and also to address to land issues that continues to affect a large number of Cameroonians today.“But before anything else [there should be] national mourning, and proper funerals for our compatriot who died for the nation must be organised,” said Bassy, whose 2019 album 1958 paid homage to Nyobè.“On the French side, public outreach is crucial, integrating this history into the school curriculum so that it is never repeated and also to ensure that the French population can truly understand and accept the country’s history.”For years, France had refused to confront the ghosts of its colonial empire that stretched from Algeria in northernAfricato Benin in the west. But in recent times a new guard of historians and activists, many from former colonies, have categorised official French narratives that barely mentioned the violence of colonial exploits in the 20th century as polished fiction.This has coincided with a sustained wave of anti-French sentiment in Francophone Africa that has partly spurred coups against governments in the region deemed to be puppets of Paris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Macron, more than any of his predecessors, seems to be responding to this pressure with a series of strategic gestures that are often criticised as incomplete.In 2018, his government initiated the restitution of 26 cultural artefacts to Benin, a direct response to a groundbreaking report he had commissioned. The report, co-authored by the French art historian Bénédicte Savoy and the Senegalese writer Felwine Sarr, argued that these objects were not merely museum pieces but living parts of a cultural memory that belonged back home. A 27th artefact traced to Finland wasreturned to Beninthis May.Correspondenceseen by the Guardian in Julyrevealed that the French government had signalled a willingness to discuss reparations with Niger for the massacre of thousands of citizens in the 1899mission Afrique centrale(MAC), one of the most violent colonial campaigns in Africa. Again, it stopped short of apologising for its role.Experts say the conversation now has to move from cultural restitution to a more direct discussion of historical debt and hope that official acknowledgments usher in the real work of reckoning.Bassy said: “We are at the point in time when Africa is confronting its history … to come to terms with itself but also to approach its future with greater clarity and confidence.”Explore more on these topicsFranceCameroonColonialismAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Between 1980 and 2000,nearly 70,000 people were killedand 20,000 disappeared, according to the findings of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Shining Path fighters were responsible for about 54% of the deaths and the military for the rest.Boluarte said: “With the enactment of this amnesty law, the Peruvian government and congress recognise the sacrifice of members of the armed forces, the police and self-defence groups in the fight against terrorism.”She added: “We’re giving them back the dignity that should never have been questioned.”There has been widespread concern about backsliding on human rights under Boluarte’s government. In 2023, theformer president Alberto Fujimoriwasreleased from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release. Last year, Peru’s congress approved a bill establishing a statute of limitations for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed before 2003.The UN Human Rights Commissionexpressed alarmabout the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Peru is now a pariah state from the point of view of international law. It puts Peru on the same level as Venezuela and Nicaragua for their outright disregard for the rulings of the inter-American court and of international law more generally.”She expressed disappointment at what she called a “cynical move”, especially as Peru “for many years did make meaningful efforts to bring perpetrators of serious human rights violations to justice”.Explore more on these topicsPeruHuman rightsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This is democracy raised to the nth power … They are being judged based on the plea bargains and statements given by from people who took part in the coup attempt,” Lula said at an event in the capital Brasília.“And I’ve said to President Trump: If what happened in the Capitol had happened in Brazil, he would be put on trial here in Brazil too,” Lula added, rejecting the idea that there was anything “arbitrary” about Bolsonaro’s trial.Lula also rejected US criticism of the human rights situation in Brazil after the state department usedits annual human rightsreport on Tuesdayto accuse his government of undermining democratic debateand “suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians”.Lula said: “There was really no reason to hit Brazil with tariffs and nor will we accept being told that we don’t respect human rights here in Brazil.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead more“Every time that our American friends decide to pick a fight with someone, they try to make the people they want to fight with look like demons,” Lula added, lamenting how the 201-year-old diplomatic relationship between the two countries was “being thrown away”.Lula urged Brazilians not to fear the pressure campaign being waged by Trump, who avoided charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election after his election last year. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to issue“full, complete and unconditional”presidential pardons for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6 storming of Congress. In Brazil,141 peopleare serving prison sentences for taking part in the 8 January 2023 rightwing riots in Brasília, which were allegedly part of Bolsonaro’s coup plot.“We shouldn’t be scared and anxious or get all excited whenever a crisis comes along. Crises exist for us to create new things. Humanity has created great things … in times of crisis,” Lula said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

A non-profit found multiple false entriesJosé Olivaresin New YorkWed 13 Aug 2025 12.33 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.51 EDTShareA senior official appointed to the defense department led a thinktank that promoted fake news about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according toInSight Crime, a non-profit analyzing organized crime.Joseph Humire was appointed this summer to be the head of policy focusing on the western hemisphere within the office of the under secretary of defense for policy. He was previously the executive director of a conservative thinktank focused on global security. Humire’s appointment comes as theTrump administrationis ramping up its aggressive strategy against organized crime in Latin America and the Venezuelan government, which it accuses of working with TdA.Under Humire’s leadership, the Center for a Secure Free Society thinktank published the “TdA Activity Monitor”, tracking alleged crimes by accused members of the gang throughout the US. According to InSight Crime, at least five event entries in the tracker appeared to have been “completely fabricated”. InSight Crime found zero basis for the false entries, with local police departments telling researchers the purported crimes were nonexistent. InSight Crime analyzed more than 90 of the entries, finding many relied on unverified sources.‘Cemetery of the living dead’: Venezuelans recall 125 days in notorious El Salvador prisonRead more“Some incidents are included multiple times, inflating the gang’s perceived presence and activities,” researchers found.The monitor is no longer available online following InSight Crime’s reporting.“The TdA Monitor is an aggregator, not a primary source of information about Tren de Aragua’s activities,” a statement from the Center for a Secure Free Society said, adding that it “reflects the media reporting”.The Department of Defense declined to comment.Humire has spoken publicly about alleged Tren de Aragua crimes on Fox News and other conservative outlets. He has also promoted the idea that the Venezuelan government is directing the gang’s crimes around the world, despite doubts from the intelligence community.Humire authoreda reportin December 2024 for the conservative Heritage Foundation, writing that Tren de Aragua “is a perfect proxy and tool of asymmetric warfare” by the Venezuelan government to “destabilize democratic countries”. In March, Humiremade similar claimsbefore Congress.But US intelligence agencies have cast doubt on the theory that the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, directs the gang, according to anintelligence memowhose release angered top officials, who then reportedlyordered a rewrite.TdA has been a major focus of the Trump administration, which designated the group as a terrorist organization earlier this year. Members of the gang have been implicated in violent crimes across the hemisphere butorganized crime experts say descriptions of the group have exaggerated its scale, reach and structure.Despite skepticism from US intelligence agencies, Trump officials have repeatedly said the Venezuelan government, under Maduro, is working with Tren de Aragua to “infiltrate” the US. The accusation was used to justify the Alien Enemies Act invocation in March, leading to the expulsion of hundreds of Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a Salvadorian prison.Humire’s appointment to the defense department comes as the administration turns up the pressure on Venezuela. Last week, Trumpdirected the Pentagonto use military force on some drug cartels – a significant escalation in the “war on drugs” – and the justice departmentdoubleda bounty on Maduro to $50m.The justice department has accused top Venezuelan officials of running the “Cartel of the Suns” to traffic drugs to the US. The state department recently declared the Cartel of the Suns to be a terrorist organization, but experts also say this claim may beoverstated. Rather than a hierarchical organization trafficking drugs under Maduro’s orders, InSight Crimeexplainsit is more a “network of networks” within the military.The Trump administration has increased the US’s involvement in Latin America through threats oftariffsandmilitary intervention, allegedbackroom dealsandprisoner swaps. Rightwing leaders have cozied up to Trump, including El Salvador’s authoritarian Nayib Bukele.

Among the unresolved issues are wages and compensation for work carried out on the ground. Flight attendants are currently not paid for any work before or after the plane takes off.Air Canada’s vice-president of corporate communications told CBC News on Tuesday that there was a “huge gap” between the two sides.Air Canada says it has offered “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the union says that figure still fails to fully account for inflation.Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, but Cupe says its members should be fully paid for that labour.Earlier this week, the union representing Air Canada’s flight attendants declined Air Canada’s request to resolve negotiations through arbitration. Under that scenario, a third-party arbitrator would weigh proposals from each side and then make a final decision that both the union and Air Canada would have to accept.“Despite our best efforts, Air Canada refused to address our core issues,” the union said after it rejected the request for arbitration.Air Canada says its decision to gradually suspend flights will allow for an orderly winding down of operations. The airline said it had also made arrangements with other carriers to give customers possible alternative travel options amid one of the year’s busiest travel periods.“We regret the impact a disruption will have on our customers, our stakeholders and the communities we serve,” said Michael Rousseau, Air Canada’s chief executive, in a statement.Canada’s federal minister for jobs and families, Patty Hajdu, said in asocial media post on Xon Tuesday evening that she was monitoring the situation, but that the federal government was not stepping in. “The best agreements are the ones the parties reach themselves,” she wrote.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Former Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen was also among those named.Two prosecution witnesses, Chan Tsz-wah and Andy Li, also accused Lai of financially backing the advocacy group “Stand With Hong Kong” to run overseas newspaper ads supporting the 2019 protests.Lai has denied calling for sanctions againstChinaand Hong Kong and said he never advocated separatism.Four other people who held senior roles inApple Dailywere called upon by prosecutors to testify about how Lai shaped the outlet’s political stance.The mogul said his newspaper championed democracy and freedom, adding that he had always disavowed violence.“The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong... (including) rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly,” Lai said on the first day of his testimony.Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 after police raids and the arrests of its senior editors.Lai is a British citizen and his son Sebastien reiterated in March calls for British prime minister Keir Starmer to do more, saying: “I don’t want my father to die in jail.”Judges have indicated that a verdict could be reached by October.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There were no reports of any untoward incident, Commodore Jay Tarriela of the Philippine coastguard said, citing information from US officials and a Philippine surveillance flight.The US navy has for years staged what it calls freedom-of-navigation voyages and overflights in the South China Sea to challenge China’s restrictions and its demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. That hasangered Chinaand its forces have had close runs-in with US warships and aircraft on such patrols in international waters and airspace.The deployment happened after Washington’s ambassador to Manila, MaryKay Carlson, on Tuesday condemned “the latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel” in Scarborough. The rich fishing atoll off the north-westernPhilippineshas been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coastguard, fishing and other ships in recent years.The Philippines, a former US colony, is Washington’s oldest treaty ally in Asia. The US has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines if Filipino forces come under an armed attack, including in the SouthChinaSea.On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coastguard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coastguard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19km) from Scarborough. Video footage made public by the Philippine coastguard show the Chinese coastguard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship.Shortly after the collision, the video shows the heavily shattered bow of the Chinese coastguard ship without the Chinese personnel, who were standing on deck before the crash. The Chinese navy ship sustained deep dents and what appeared to be linear gushes on its hull.Japan, Australia and New Zealand expressed alarm on Wednesday over the dangerous maneuvers that led to the collision in the busy waters, a key global trade route.“Japan upholds the rule of law and opposes any actions which increase tensions. Our concern goes to the repeated actions in the South China Sea,” the Japanese ambassador to Manila, Endo Kazuya, said in a post on X.The Australian embassy in Manila expressed concern about “the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard”, saying in a statement the incident “highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law”.South China Sea: a visual guide to the key shoals, reefs and islandsRead more“This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coastguard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the [anti-]collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.”Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500ft (150 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coastguard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board. The Chinese jet carried out dangerous maneuvers for about 20 minutes, including flying about 200ft above the small Philippine aircraft, Tarriela said.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsChinaSouth China SeaPhilippinesVietnamMalaysiaBruneinewsShareReuse this content"

But with more than 40 million people employed in the public sector, some analysts predict the new rules will probably hamper economic growth.Why Peak China may finally have arrived | George MagnusRead moreThe policy is “undermining the impact of other policies aimed at boosting domestic spending,” said Guo Shan, an economist at Hutong Research, an independent advisory firm based in Beijing and Shanghai. Guo predicts the drive could cause China’s retail sales growth to slow by around one percentage point in the second half of the year.The original guidelines were introduced in November 2013, a year after China’s leader, Xi Jinping, came into power, with thegoal of cracking down on corruptionone of his signature policies. The renewed regulations outline more specific guidelines on official travel – both domestic and international – as well as protocols for hosting receptions and rules governing the use of official vehicles.In June, local governments began figuring out how to implement the new guidance. Some civil servants in Shandong province have been reportedly ordered not to dine out in groups of more than three. Cadres in Anhui provinces have been instructed to be wary of social gatherings and to refrain from treating bosses or underlings to meals.View image in fullscreenChinese President Xi Jinping speaks next to foreign minister Wang Yi in July.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe renewed push hints thatprevious anti-corruption driveswere not completely effective, while the latest effort could cast a shadow over the Chinese economy, say analysts.“The latest anti-corruption drive will definitely harm the economy,” said Alfred Wu, a public policy expert at the National University of Singapore.There have already been reports of penalties for civil servants who overindulge. In June, two bank employees in Anhui province had their 3,000 yuan (£310) bonuses docked for attending a lunch paid for by a client. The lunch in question was a bowl of noodles that typically costs around six yuan in the local town.Baijiu –China’s national liquorwith an alcohol content comparable to vodka – has long been a popular choice among Chinese officials. But the spirit has come under renewed scrutiny after the recent deaths of three local officials in separate provinces, who died of alcohol poisoning.Among the hardest-hit in the liquor industry is Kweichow Moutai– one of China’s most iconic and valuable brands. Known for its distinctive soy sauce-aroma style of baijiu, the brand has long been associated with official banquets. Since the revised regulations were introduced in May, the company’s share price has dropped nearly 9%, wiping out more than 170 billion yuan in market value by the end of July.The intensifying restrictions reflect a broader campaign to regulate the daily lives of civil servants. As the government grows increasingly concerned about national security, controls that previously only applied to senior bureaucrats who might have access to sensitive information, such as restrictions on international travel, now seem to be spreading lower down the ranks.An online notice circulating on Chinese social media platform Weibo – reportedly from Guangdong Province – outlines new requirements for teachers’ overseas travel, even if they are travelling for their own holidays. It states that even junior personnel must now apply for permission for trips abroad, specifying that “foreign visits are exclusively for family-related purposes; personal leisure travel is not permitted.”In other regions, public sector workers must hand in their passports. “I really don’t understand why our county won’t allow ordinary teachers to travel abroad. My parents were already at the immigration office, but they weren’t allowed to apply for passports,” wrote one Weibo user, who said that their parents were teachers.Guo, the Hutong Research economist, said that Beijing was likely willing to bear the economic pain caused by the austerity policy. “Since this is a political drive, economic concerns are secondary. And there are still many other tools to boost the economy should Beijing decide to do so,” Guo said.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This includes by returning 80% of revenue from its point of consumption tax to racing.Eslake told Guardian Australia greyhound racing “likes to style itself as an industry” but relies on the “public purse” in most states.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny.”The Victorian racing minister, Anthony Carbines, on Monday said he had no plans to end greyhound racing in the state, describing the Tasmanian government’s announcement as a “desperate” attempt to secure the support of crossbench MPs after failing to win a majority at the recent state election.“No one’s safe in Tasmania. Throw everyone overboard to form a majority,” Carbines said.He said greyhound racing generated $850m a year in economic activity and employed almost 5,000 people in full-time work in Victoria.“The government here in Victoria backs greyhound racing,” Carbines said.In 2018, the ACT banned greyhound racing.New South Wales proposed a ban in 2016 before the then premier, Mike Baird,backflipped after a backlash.

He is to meet Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. The meeting will reportedly be held at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, a military facility crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the height of the cold war.Asked ifRussiawould face consequences if Putin did not agree to stop the war after the Alaska meeting, Trump said: “Yes, they will … very severe consequences.”1:21Trump says Putin faces ‘very severe consequences’ if no Ukraine truce agreed – videoThe president’s remarks followed what he described as a very good call with European leaders in which he consulted about the goal and strategy for his summit. He pleased Europe’s leadership by giving reassurances that a ceasefire was his priority and he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement.Trump’s approach at the video conference, as described by France’s Emmanuel Macron, appeared to reassure some of the leaders, who were making a final collective plea to the unpredictable US president that he had a duty to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty – and European security – at the talks.The European leaders spoke to Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, in a hastily convened one-hour meeting in an effort to shape Trump’s negotiating strategy. Zelenskyy and European leaders have been excluded from the summit and fear that Trump, intent on fulfilling his election campaign guarantee that he could easily end the bloodshed in Ukraine, will make concessions that compromise Ukraine’s future sovereignty.But Trump underlined his promise that the summit was not in itself a substantive negotiation and was what he described as a “feel-out” to test Putin’s terms to sign a temporary ceasefire that would then lead to talks with Kyiv. Trump said it had been a very good call, and that he rated it 10 out of 10.Britain, France and Germany, co-chairs of the so-called “coalition of the willing”, later laid out their position on the talks, reiterating that international borders must not be changed by force, and insisting that Ukraine must have “robust and credible security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.The three countries repeated that meaningful negotiations could happen only with a ceasefire in place, and called for Russia to face further economic sanctions if it did not agree to cease hostilities at the summit.Speaking alongside Zelenskyy in Berlin, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe wanted Trump to be successful in Alaska but that it had made clear to the US president that Ukrainian and European interests had to be protected at the summit.Merz called for a 30-day ceasefire, and then substantive talks. Putin has resisted a ceasefire for months.Setting out the key principles on which Europe is united he said: “Negotiations must be part of a common transatlantic strategy. Then they can ultimately be most likely to succeed. This strategy must continue to rely on strong support for Ukraine and necessary pressure against Russia. This also means, if there is no movement on the Russian side in Alaska, then the United States and we Europeans should … increase the pressure.”He added that there could not be any Russian legal ownership of Ukrainian territory. “President Trump knows this position, he shares it very extensively and therefore I can say we have had a really exceptionally constructive and good conversation with each other.”Macron said no serious discussions had taken place about Russian-Ukrainian land swaps involving the ceding of Ukrainian territory, and Trump had anyway underlined that any such discussions could only be negotiated with Kyiv. He said Trump would fight for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US and Russia and that such a meeting would be held in Europe.Graphic showing Russian advances in UkraineRussian advances in UkraineOne European diplomat said: “Overall the meeting was reassuring in that our points came across, but the question remains whether Trump will stick to the agreed script when he gets into the room with Putin.”Trump met heads of state and government leaders from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Poland and Finland, as well as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The issue of security guarantees for Ukraine was raised in the call with Trump, but no breakthrough was made in the US offering to provide practical support to the coalition.But the Europeans’ main objective had been to seek reassurances from the notoriously fickle Trump that he would not be lured into making irretrievable pledges requiring Ukraine to make concessions of land as the price for securing Putin’s agreement to a ceasefire. They also tried to extract assurances that Trump was still prepared to deploy as yet unused economic levers that could damage Russian revenues.Trump alone in a room with Putin is a recipe for disaster – just look to their last meetingRead moreEuropean leaders have been careful in public to welcome Trump’s summit but in private fear Trump is bent on improving US-Russia relations and sees a loss of Ukrainian sovereignty as a necessary and unavoidable price to secure that objective.Trump has been vague about his strategy, including the terms he will offer to induce Putin to agree to a ceasefire.Zelenskyy has vowed that the Ukrainian military will not voluntarily surrender territory in Donetsk and Luhansk, but Russia is insisting at least four Ukrainian regions will become Russian either at the negotiating table or through force.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump vented his fury at media reporting of his meeting with Putin, writing on Truth Social: “The media is being really, really unfair about my meeting with Putin. They keep quoting fired losers and really stupid people like John Bolton, who just said that even though the meeting is on US soil, ‘Putin has already won’. What the hell is this? We win EVERYTHING.”The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said further sanctions or secondary tariffs could yet be placed on Russia’s trading partners if the Alaska meeting did not go well.A confident Moscow dismissed the importance of Europe’s consultation with Trump. The foreign ministry spokesperson Alexei Fadeyev said: “We consider the consultations requested by the Europeans to be politically and practically insignificant actions. Verbally, the Europeans support the diplomatic efforts of Washington and Moscow to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but in reality the European Union is sabotaging them.”Russia says the Alaska meeting is likely to address the full gamut of Russian-American bilateral relations, and not just Ukraine. “We hope that this meeting will allow the leaders to focus on the full range of issues, from the crisis in Ukraine to the obstacles that hinder normal and constructive dialogue, which is crucial to ensuring international peace and stability,” the spokesperson said.The veteran Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will be present at the talks.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Critics sayRussiais trying to expand its control over the country’s internet space.Vladimir Putin has authorised the development of a state-backed messaging app integrated with government services, as Moscow seeks to establish what it calls digital sovereignty by promoting homegrown services and reducing its dependence on foreign-owned platforms.“In order to counteract criminals … measures are being taken to partially restrict calls on these foreign messengers,” the Interfax news agency quoted the communications regulator Roskomnadzor as saying. “No other restrictions have been imposed on their functionality.”Russia’s digital ministry said: “Access to calls in foreign messengers will be restored after they start complying with Russian legislation.”In a statement, WhatsApp’s owner, Meta, said: “WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people. We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.”Telegram said it “actively combats misuse of its platform, including calls for sabotage or violence, as well as fraud” and removes “millions of pieces of harmful content every day”.Reuters reported that voice calls on Telegram had barely functioned since 11 August and that WhatsApp calls had been rendered impossible due to intermittent sound and a metallic buzzing.The digital development ministry said Telegram and WhatsApp had ignored repeated requests to take measures to stop their platforms being used for activities such as fraud and terrorism.Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament’s information technology committee, said the platforms would need to open legal entities in Russia and cooperate with Roskomnadzor and law enforcement as part of their compliance with Russian law to lift the blocking measures.Meta was labelled an extremist organisation by Moscow in 2022, but WhatsApp, widely used in Russia, was allowed to remain.

At the end of the project, the full anthology of texts will be printed using paper made from trees from the Future Library forest in Nordmarka, in northern Oslo, where 1,000 spruce trees were planted by Katie Paterson, the artist behind the project, in 2014.Ghosh, whose novels include The Circle of Reason and Sea of Poppies, said being invited to participate in the Future Library project was a “profound honour and a humbling act of trust”. The initiative “compels us to think beyond our lifetimes, to imagine readers who have not yet been born”.“It is particularly significant for me that the project has a forest at its core”, he added, “because for a long time now, I have been writing about a forest, albeit of an entirely different kind – the great mangrove forest known as the Sundarban”. Stretching across the Ganges delta, the Sundarbans are the backdrop to Ghosh’s novels The Hungry Tide, Jungle Nama andGun Island.“It will be an exciting challenge to make a connection between the forests of the far north and those of the tropics, at this time of extreme planetary crisis,” added Ghosh, whose works often address climate disaster. “I am moved to be part of a work that intertwines ecology, literature and patience on such a monumental scale.”Ghosh grew up inIndia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and has a doctorate in social anthropology from the University of Oxford. He has written a number of novels, as well as works of nonfiction and essay collections.Ghosh’s writing “is expansive, urgent, and deeply attuned to the shifting ground of our world”, said Paterson. “His stories traverse oceans and centuries, revealing how the climate crisis is inseparable from histories of empire, migration and myth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, (no relation) described the two-state solution as “humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East”.But the special rapporteurcautioned that the renewed push for Palestinian statehood should not “distract the attention from where it should be: the genocide”.She called for an embargo on all arms sales toIsraeland a cessation of trade agreements – as well as accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity with which the international criminal court has charged top Israeli officials. She also called for a complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory by the17 September deadlineset by the UN general assembly.“Ending the question of Palestine in line with international law is possible and necessary: end the genocide today, end the permanent occupation this year, and end apartheid,” she said. “This is what’s going to guarantee freedom and equal rights for everyone, regardless of the way they want to live – in two states or one state, they will have to decide.”In her three years as rapporteur, but especially since the beginning of Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, Albanese has become one of the most outspoken and recognizable advocates for Palestinian rights. Her technical reports accusing Israel of operating an “apartheid regime” and committing “acts of genocide” have often anticipated major international and Israeli rights groups reaching the same conclusions.Last month, the Trump administration sanctioned Albanese over her outspoken support for Palestinian rights and what US officials called her “shameful promotion” of ICC action against Israeli officials.While Albanese has described herself as a reluctant “chronicler of genocide”, and others have called her “the voice of the global conscience”, she has also drawn condemnation and attacks – including accusations of antisemitism so persistent that she at one point sat down for a TV interview in which the first question posed to her was: “Are you an antisemite?”“Antisemitism and discrimination against Jews as Jews is gross,” Albanese told the Guardian in an earlier interview in December. “But frankly I couldn’t care less if Israel were run by Jews, Muslims, Christians or atheists… All I want is for Israel to conduct itself in line with international law.”View image in fullscreenFrancesca Albanese in Rome, Italy, on 29 July 2025.Photograph: Mauro Scrobogna/LaPresse/ShutterstockAlbanese described the growing global split over Israel’s actions in Gaza as “the ultimate struggle” and a matter of “light and darkness”. She characterized the US’s sanctions against her as a sign not of strength “but of guilt”.“The US is a country of contradictions, full of ideals and principles and still, plotting against democratic values,” she said. “Those in power – Democrats or Republicans – have always been led by this kind of supremacist logic toward others, and this strategy is openly betraying the US values of democracy, of fundamental freedoms, and really leveling everything that they have been preaching.”She also criticized the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for failing to more forcefully condemn the “unprecedented violation” of theprivileges and immunitiestraditionally afforded to UN representatives.A spokesperson for Guterres said earlier that the sanctions against her set a dangerous precedent, but noted that Albanese does not report to him. The rapporteur’s mandate is entrusted by the UN Human Rights Council.Albanese described the recent gathering ofthe Hague Group– a 30-nation conference held in Colombia to set out practical steps for UN member states to take measures in support of Israel ending the occupation, as “an ethical force inside the system”, which she said was “premised upon a basic respect of international law and the honoring of multilateralism, which seems to me the basic ingredient to have a functioning international community”.That stands in contrast to a UN that Albanese believes is living a “moment of existential crisis”.“[The UN] needs to decide whether to be a real, multilateral platform,” she said. “We are no longer in the settler-colonial bloc kind of mentality that conceived the birth of the UN. Now there are 193 member states, and all of them have agency and all of them must be respected. Now is the time to cut the umbilical cord from the veto-power mentality and put the emphasis on the general assembly.”Albanese noted that Israel’s 21-month war inGazahad prompted a “profound shift” in global views of the conflict, as well as “brutal repression”.“We see millions of peopletaking to the streetsandasking for an end to the genocide, and they’re being beaten and arrested and held on counts of terrorism, while those who are wanted by the ICC for war crimes are being received and allowed to fly over European and western space,” she said. “This is absurd. This is the end of the rule of law.”The horror of Gaza called and a mass of rain-soaked Sydney Harbour Bridge marchers, young and old, came in full forceRead moreInternational law, she added, “is not a prophecy … It is a tool that must be used in order to fix things. And in fact, when people use it in court, they generally win.”But she sounded a note of optimism about the shifting discourse around Israel’s actions. “An entire new generation now speaks the language of human rights,” she said. “For me, this is a success in and of itself.”The widening gap between those in power and millions of people that have taken to the streets worldwide in support of Palestinians is in part why hermost recent reportfocused not on Israeli actions but on the global corporations that she says are “profiting from genocide”.“The occupation is profitable, and so is the genocide, and this is shocking, but it is to be known in order to be seen and to be stopped,” she noted. “The power is not just with the prime ministers or with the governments. The power is with us, and we can start choosing through our wallet.”As for Palestinians, despite their monumental suffering and the ever-mounting death toll, “they have already won the legitimacy battle,” Albanese said.“Everyone knows what Israel has done to them for the past 77 years,” she said. “They’ve already made history – and not through violence as some try to portray them – but with their perseverance and principles and trust in the justice system, which has not been their ally.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

When visitors arrive, the eight-year-old pretends to be sleeping so that no one looks at him. Between his frequent dialysis sessions, he cries. His bones hurt, he says.Abdel Karim is dying. His death should be preventable but because he lives inGazahe cannot access the treatment that would save his life. What started as acute kidney failure is now chronic: his small body has begun to swell and he spends his days between hospital beds and injections that he hates.“My son suffers greatly. The hospital has become his home. The doctors stand helpless and I can only watch and pray,” said his mother, Najwa Wahdan.As the sickness progressed, Abdel Karim was also diagnosed with malnutrition as food began to disappear from Gaza’s markets. His only hope is to be evacuated from Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad. Wahdan filed a medical referral four months ago but is still waiting.Abdel Karim is one of thousands of people in Gaza waiting for treatment abroad. Getting approved for a medical evacuation is a long, arduous process that can take years. Zahir al-Wehadi, the head of the information department at the Gaza ministry of health, said: “We have more than 16,000 patients [in Gaza] who need treatment abroad. We have already lost more than 600 patients who died while still waiting to travel.”Tens of thousands of people in Gaza have been wounded by Israeli strikes and gunfire over the past 22 months of a war that has killed more than 61,000 people. Disease and sickness, much of which were not present in Gaza prior to the war, are rife in the territory as solid waste accumulates and people live tightly packed together with limited access to clean water or hygiene products.Repeated Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals and Israel’s blockade of basic goods into the territory have left the medical sector devastated. Doctors in Gaza say that often they do not have the supplies to treat patients. In those cases they write a referral for the patients to be evacuated abroad.Israel controls who enters and leaves Gaza. People who need medical treatment abroad must have their exit approved by Cogat, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians. In December, the World Health Organization said the pace of medical evacuations out of Gaza was so slow that it would take five to 10 years to clear the backlog. Cogat has been approached for comment.Chart showing rate of medical evacuations from GazaWaiting for medical evacuation is torturous. Patients and their families have no ability to speed up the process and can do nothing but hope that approval comes before death does.During their long wait, Abdel Karim’s physical and mental state has deteriorated. He has lost the ability to walk and when his blood pressure drops too low he temporarily goes blind and has seizures.“What I loved most about Abdel Karim was his calmness; he never caused trouble like other children,” his mother said. “He loved studying Arabic and English. He once wanted to become a doctor.”But the months of sickness have taken its toll on the once happy child. “For the last three months he has been withdrawn, irritable, yelling often and not speaking to anyone – this is not the calm son I knew before,” Wahdan said.View image in fullscreenNajwa Wahdan enjoys a moment of happiness with her son after they managed to buy aubergines, some of the few fresh vegetables the two had had for months.Photograph: Seham TanteshMany children have died while waiting for their evacuation approval.Amina al-Jourani was not too worried when in January 2024 her 15-year-old son, Nidal, came home with a foot injury. Israel had bombed a nearby house and Nidal had gone to the scene to help transport wounded people to the hospital on his bicycle. When he returned to his home he had a small gash on his foot.“At first we didn’t pay it much attention. It seemed like a simple, ordinary wound,” Jourani said. But in the following days Nidal developed a fever. He began to lose weight and his skin was covered with red spots.It was a year and a half before doctors approved a request to transfer Nidal abroad, as his condition, though persistent, did not seem to be life-threatening. The hospital he was staying in, the European hospital, was bombed and he was sent home. His fever spiked and his foot turned blue. Nidal went to another hospital where they diagnosed him with kidney failure. He died two days later, on 2 June 2025.Doctors say it is impossible to deal with the caseload, particularly as the humanitarian situation has worsened since Israel instituted a harsh blockade of aid on Gaza in March. Aid groups have saida worst-case famine scenariois unfolding in Gaza. Israel denies there is a starvation crisis in Gaza and says the UN is to blame for poor distribution of aid – a claim that aid bodies uniformly reject.View image in fullscreenDr Ragheb Warsh Agha: ‘Many children die because of the lack of resources.’Photograph: Seham TanteshRagheb Warsh Agha, the head of the gastroenterology department at al-Rantisi children’s hospital, said: “Many children die because of the lack of resources or the lack of response to transfer requests. In many cases the child’s treatment is simple – for example, we may need basic medicines, specific treatments that are unavailable, or to conduct tests for which the necessary equipment does not exist.”Agha said the overcrowded hospital often had to place three children in a single bed, which encouraged the spread of disease. Gaza’s starvation crisis has also meant disease spreads more easily. Lack of food weakens people’s immune systems and makes them more susceptible to sickness. Recovery is more difficult when the body does not have food.For parents waiting for the mechanisms of bureaucracy to give them the slip of paper that means life for their children, the helplessness is agonising.Jourani said: “At the height of his illness, Nidal gave me 100 shekel he had saved and he told me: ‘Mom, keep this for me so I can buy lots of sweets, chocolate and snacks when the [border] crossing opens.”Two and a half months after Nidal’s death, his mother received a message: his referral had been approved, his request to be evacuated granted.“Nidal died and the money is still in my purse,” she said through tears. “He died waiting for the crossings to open.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The bill was proposed by her party in March and is supported by all opposition parties.“If we find six of 68 government MPs with a spine, we can stand on the right side of history,” said Swarbrick.Speaker Gerry Brownlee said that statement was “completely unacceptable” and that she had to withdraw it and apologise. When she refused, Swarbrick was ordered to leave parliament.Brownlee later clarified Swarbrick could return on Wednesday but if she still refused to apologise she would again be removed from parliament.Luxon’s government has said it would make a decision in Septemberabout whether it would recognise Palestine as a state.Netanyahu has been strongly critical of growing international moves to recognise a Palestinian state. “To have European countries and Australia march into that rabbit hole, just like that, fall right into it,” he said earlier this week. “This canard is disappointing, and I think it’s actually shameful. But it’s not going to change our position.”Netanyahu went on to claim Israel was “actually applying force judiciously, and they know it”.Foreign minister Winston Peters told parliament that over the next month the government would gather information and talk to partners, which would inform cabinet’s decision.“We’ll be weighing this decision carefully rather than rushing to judgment,” Peters said.Along with the Green party, opposition parties Labour and Te Pati Māori support recognition of a Palestinian state.Labour parliamentarian Peeni Henare said New Zealand had a history of standing strong on its principles and values and in this case “was being left behind”.Explore more on these topicsNew Zealand politicsNew ZealandGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warGreen PartynewsShareReuse this content"

Anglers aged 13 and over must hold a rod licence to fish for freshwater species such as carp in England and Wales. Lammy failed to land a catch, but “all of my kids did”, Vance said.The Foreign Office said an “administrative oversight” meant licences had not been obtained in advance. Lammy bought them as soon as he was made aware, and wrote to theEnvironment Agencyto acknowledge the breach. “He also thanked them for their work protecting Britain’s fisheries,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said.The agency confirmed the licences had since been bought. All fish caught during the visit were returned to the water.The fishing trip formed part of a wider UK tour by Vance, who was on holiday in the Cotswolds with his wife, Usha, and three children. The visit has combined family time with private political meetings and a heavy security presence in the normally quiet Oxfordshire countryside.Vance’s stay at Dean Manor, an 18th-century Georgian home, reportedly arranged by the former chancellor George Osborne, led to road closures, police checkpoints and the installation of a temporary helipad. Pippa and Johnny Hornby, who own the property, later apologised to residents for the “circus” caused by the vice-president’s security detail.0:54Cotswolds residents protest against JD Vance visit – videoProtesters from the Stop Trump Coalitionheld a “Vance not welcome” party in nearby Charlbury, attended by about 100 people carrying placards and cakes mocking the Republican politician.

But she may have caused another, which could have consequences for race relations.The home secretary has encouraged senior police officers to free themselves of longstanding protocols so they can combat the prolific use of social media by far-right bloggers and organisations that have escalated disinformation around high-profile incidents.Last summer’s national riots were fomented from an early stage bymisinformation about the Southport killer– he was claimed, in posts recycled tens of thousands of times, to be a Muslim, foreign-born and an asylum seeker. All three statements turned out to be wrong.Until today, there was nothing in the College of Policing’s guidance that actually prevented police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even ethnicity of someone who has been charged.The police are restricted as to what they can say about suspects. But the guidance on media relations – and what would be released to the public – said that if someone was arrested, police should only give the suspect’s gender and age.Once a suspect was charged, the guidance said police could give out the suspect’s name, date of birth and address. Before 2012, police forces made decisions on what information to give to the media on a purely case-by-case basis, decisions often made depending on the force’s relationship with individual journalists and media outlets.But it was Lord Leveson’s damning 2012 report on press ethics that prompted police forces to become more cautious because of concerns that releasing the ethnicity of suspects could be used to feed false narratives.Leveson examined testimony from the National Union of Journalists claiming that some national newsrooms openly encouraged racist reporting. One reporter was told by the news editor to “write a story about Britain being flooded by asylum-seeking bummers”, another was told to “make stories as rightwing as you can” and another was told to go out and find Muslim women to photograph, with the instruction: “Just fucking do it. Wrap yourself around a group of women in burkas for a photo,” the testimony said.He examined numerous reports including a Daily Star article under the headline “Asylum seekers eat our donkeys,” which claimed that donkey meat was a speciality in Somalia and eastern Europe and blamed asylum seekers, without any evidence.Leveson concluded that “when assessed as a whole, the evidence of discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers, is concerning”.Fast-forward 12 years to Southport, and Merseyside police were left making decisions on whether to release information on the ethnicity and nationality of the killer of three young girls in order to dispel public anger that had spilled on to the streets. Senior officers had to deal with major criminal incidents and took days to dispel social media untruths.Such disinformation was at least partly responsible for last summer’s riots. At the time, Merseyside police said they were not giving out more information because of the contempt of court rules.It is hoped that the new guidance will mean police will no longer be left flat-footed when responding to viral social media posts by extremists. Decisions on releasing such information will remain with police forces, with wider legal and ethical considerations also taken into account, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said, but verifying a suspect’s immigration status is up to theHome Office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But a former race adviser to No 10 said: “Yvette has unwittingly opened a Pandora’s box. After every charge, everyone with a union jack on their X bio will demand from the police the ethnicity of the suspect.“The Home Office is going to get even more demands for the asylum status of every Black or brown suspect. It is going to be chaos, and has handed Nigel Farage another stick to beat Labour with.”There could well be a knock-on effect on mainstream reporting and community relations, campaigners believe. Enny Choudhury, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “Releasing the ethnicity of everyone suspected of serious crimes will do nothing to help victims or secure justice – it will simply fuel mistrust, deepen divisions, and make Black and brown communities more vulnerable to prejudice and harm.”Explore more on these topicsYvette CooperHome OfficeRacePoliceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Stephen Doughty, a junior Foreign Office minister,said ministers would continue to work towards the target in March, even after the government had announced it was cutting international aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP tospend more on defence.Under the target, 80% of aid spending must go to programmes that have gender equality as a component by 2030, though it does not need to be the main focus.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, told MPs last month that he could not “commit to decisions made by the last government” and it was “for us to look at this afresh”.The government spent £15.3bn in aid in 2023, the latest year for whichfinal figures are available. Of this, £10bn was bilateral aid spent directly on projects in developing countries, rather than multilateral institutions such as the UN.Provisional figures suggest the UK’s aid spending fell to £14.1bn in 2024, an 8% decrease on the previous year, with £11.3bn going to bilateral aid.A government impact assessment said in Julythat the government’s aid cuts meant that in Africa – which receives half of the UK’s bilateral aid – spending was being reduced in women’s health and emergency response in countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.The assessment warned that “reductions to health spending risk an increase in disease burden and ultimately in deaths, impacting in particular those living in poverty, women, children and people with disabilities”.It said there would be cuts to girls’ education programmes in countries including Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and to projects encouraging women’s participation in peace processes, with conflicts including Ukraine and Sudan supported at a reduced scale.Critics warned that scrapping the 80% commitment could compound the impact of the US and UK aid cuts and exacerbate what feels like “a global war on women”.Labour has promised to prioritise women and girls in government including by promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights abroad, and tackling gender-based violence. Harriet Harman, the former acting Labour leader, was appointed UK special envoy for women and girls in March 2025.Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international aid committee, said: “The UK’s commitments to women and girls are not just words on a page, they’re a lifeline that gives hope to some of the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet.“The Trump administration immediately cut all international maternal and reproductive health support, and just last month, burned contraception it had bought for low-income countries. Now is the time for the UK to step up our commitment to gender programming, not step away.“When we look at conflicts, climate impact and nutrition it is always women and girls who bear the brunt. Our aid programming gives them hope and opportunities in what feels like a global war on women. We can’t take that away from them now.”Alex Farley, a policy manager at Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said that “at a time when women’s rights globally are under attack and the US has been gutting all gender equality and diversity programming, it’s definitely very worrying to see the UK following suit.”“Gender equality programming has already been put at disproportionate risk in the government’s cuts to UK aid. Upholding the 80% commitment, alongside stand-alone gender programmes, is really important for the UK to send a signal showing that it’s committed to tackling gender inequality rather than stepping back.”Amelia Whitworth, head of policy, campaigns and youth at Plan International UK, said: “Anti-gender movements are growing, humanitarian and climate crises are intensifying, and girls and women are being hit hardest. In a world where girls’ rights are being rolled back, the UK has to hold the line.“WithUSAIDslashing over 80% of its programmes – including funding for gender and DEI initiatives – and European donors retreating, the need for the UK to uphold its gender equality commitments has never been greater.”A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that the government was “carefully reviewing the viability of existing commitments” after cutting aid spending to 0.3%.“As the foreign secretary has said, women and girls are a fundamental priority,” the spokesperson said. “From appointing a dedicated special envoy for women and girls to improving energy access for 15 million women worldwide, the UK has demonstrated how integrating gender equality into its international work can transform lives. We will continue to champion the rights of women and girls globally and ensure that gender equality is embedded across all the department’s priorities.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyAidUSAIDGenderWomen's healthWomenDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

Abedi was jailed for a minimum of 55 years in 2020 for helping his brother to plan the 2017 attack.On Wednesday, Counter Terrorism Policing North East said Abedi had been charged with five offences after the incident which injured four prison officers. It said that in line with interim guidance also issued on Wednesday by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and College of Policing, clarity regarding Abedi’s nationality and ethnicity was available to the media on request. A spokesperson later said: “His nationality is British, and his ethnicity is Asian (self defined).”Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had carried out a “thorough investigation” of the incident with Durham Constabulary and HMP Frankland. Police said the Crown Prosecution Service had authorised charges of three counts of attempted murder, one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and one count of unauthorised possession in prison of a knife or offensive weapon.Abedi will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 September. Police said he remained in custody “within the prison estate”.The attack at a separation unit at HMP Frankland led to questions around prisoner access to cooking facilities.The Ministry of Justice said there would be a full review of how the incident was allowed to happen.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But many residents in the flood zone had evacuated before peak water levels, and there were no damage reports similar to the past two summers, when about 300 homes were flooded.The temporary barriers “really have protected our community”, Juneau city manager Katie Koester told a news conference. “If it weren’t for them, we would have hundreds and hundreds of flooded homes.”On Tuesday morning, authorities confirmed that water had started escaping the ice dam, with flooding expected into Wednesday. Some Juneau residents in the flood zone had already evacuated as officials intensified their warnings on Tuesday, saying: “Don’t wait, Evacuate TONIGHT.”The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Juneausaid in an X postlate on Tuesday that local hydrologists had adjusted their Mendenhall flooding forecast, anticipating that the river would crest at over 16ft on Wednesday morning.Nicole Ferrin, with the NWS, said during a briefing on Tuesday that the flood warning was issued after “a lot of analysis” but the calculations were complicated by rainfall causing significant rising of the lake and river and confirmed that a sub-glacial release had occurred.“This will be a new record based on all of the information we have,” Ferrin said,according to the Juneau Empire.City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4km) of riverbank in an attempt to prevent widespread flooding. The 10,000 “Hesco” barriers are essentially giant, reinforced sandbags intended to protect more than 460 properties, said emergency manager Ryan O’Shaughnessy.Some water did seep into yards through drains that had been installed under the barriers. In other spots, trees floating down the river struck and damaged the barriers, officials said. But the fortified wall largely held.Melting glacierThe Mendenhall Glacier fills a large valley north of Juneau, creating an ice dam for a meltwater lake that fills Suicide Basin. Since 2011, outburst floods from the depression have been pouring into Mendenhall Lake and rushing down the river toward Juneau each year.But the annual Mendenhall glacial lake outburst flood is judged to be intensifying as a result ofclimate change.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (Noaa), said in a statement that Alaska had warmed twice as fast as the rest of the US over the last several decades.Over the last century, Alaska’s average annual temperature has risen 3.1F and the overall trend continues to increase,according to datafrom Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information.Scientists have attributed the retreat, melting and thinning of glaciers over the last century to Earth’s warming climate. Alaska’s glaciers are among thefastest-melting glaciers on Earthand have been in steep decline since the late 1980s, according to theAlaska Climate Science Center.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn the record amounts of water that threatened Juneau, Rick Thoman, Alaska climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, told Climate.gov,Noaa reported: “Without climate change, there is no reason to think that this would be happening on the Mendenhall Glacier, then in the lake, and downriver.”An outburst in August 2023 sent record amounts of water into Mendenhall Lake and down Mendenhall River toward Juneau, inundating areas that had not experienced flooding before, theNWS office in Juneau saidat the time, causing significant erosion.The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from Juneau and considered a popular tourist attraction. Juneau lies 800 miles (1,300km) from Anchorage, whereDonald Trumpand the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, are due to meet on Friday to discuss the war in Ukraine.Flooding from the glacier has become an annual concern for almost 15 years, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes.It is blamed on the retreat of a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier – a casualty of the heating climate – and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer.When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the blue-ice Mendenhall glacier.The Mendenhall was originally named Sitaantaagu (“the Glacier Behind the Town”) or Aak’wtaaksit (“the Glacier Behind the Little Lake”) by the Tlingit Indians, but later called Auke (Auk) Glacier, for the Auk Kwaan band of Tlingit Indians, by naturalist John Muir. It was renamed in 1892 for Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, who had helped determine the boundary between Canada and Alaska. It is considered a relic of the little ice age that lasted until the mid-18th century and is now receding at about 100-150ft (30-45 meters) a year.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAlaskaClimate crisisGlaciersDonald TrumpVladimir PutinFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Psychology was “the most frequently reported clinical occupational staffing shortage”. A majority of VA facilities also reported severe shortages of police officers, who keep veteran patients and staff safe.The VA operates the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, serving 9 million veterans annually. The report is required under two laws, one signed by Trump in 2017, which require the agency’s inspector general annually to determine the extent of staffing shortages within each medical center.In a statement, Congressman Mark Takano of California, the ranking Democrat on the House committee on veterans’ affairs, said the report “confirms our fears” that shortages of medical staff were leading to “decreased access and choice for veterans”.The VA press secretary, Peter Kasperowicz, told the Guardian the congressionally mandated watchdog report was “not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages” and that it was “completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable”.The report is based on a survey of VA medical centers in April. Since then, a Guardian review of agency staffing records found, the VA has continued to lose doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers and other frontline medical professionals.Kasperowicz did not dispute the fact that the agency had lost thousands of “mission-critical” healthcare workers under Trump – including after the watchdog’s survey period concluded.The VA is in the midst of a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers, which the secretary of veterans affairs, Doug Collins,saidcould be accomplished by September through a combination of attrition, a hiring freeze and deferred resignation program.The staff cuts, Collins said, would not affect patient care, but were “centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to veterans”.In May, the Guardianreportedthat staff losses at the VA had led to unit closures, reduced hours of operations and exam backlogs across the hospital system.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the stern of a narrow wooden boat, 23-year-old Mustafa Hashim scans the marshes’ shallows, cutting the motor and switching to a traditional pole to avoid snagging on invasive roots or thickening mud.It takes him about half an hour to push through the shrinking marshes to reach Um al-Nea’aj,once a vibrant lake teeming with boats and birdsong. Now, the water is about half a metre deep.“Two years ago, there were families and fishermen everywhere,” Mustafa says, leaning out of the boat. “You could hear laughter, the splash of fish. Today, there’s nothing.”View image in fullscreenMustafa Hashim, 23, steers his boat to Lake Um al-Nea’aj. With the changing climate, drought and water extraction, navigation is becoming increasingly difficult.Photograph: Daniela SalaOn the horizon, flames from the Halfaya oilfield flicker.Iraq’s southern wetlands – known collectively as the Mesopotamian marshes – are among the world’s most endangered ecosystems. Their expanse is believed by some to have contained the biblical Garden of Eden. Recognised as aUnesco world heritage sitein 2016 andprotectedsince 2007 as awetland of international importanceunder the Ramsar Convention, the marshes once stretched nearly 120 miles (200km) from Nasiriya to Basra, forming a rich and vast aquatic world.But beneath the surface lies another kind of wealth: oil. Three strategic oil concessions overlap with the protected area: Halfaya, Huwaiza, and Majnoon. The latter,Majnoon, takes its name from the Arabic word for “crazy”: it is considered one of the world’s “super-giant” oilfields, with estimated reserves of up to38bn barrels(5.2bn tonnes).View image in fullscreenThree generations at home in Abu Khussaf village: Hashim Kasid, Mustafa Hashim and Kasid Wanis.Photograph: Daniela SalaBut the processes used to extract that oil have a voracious appetite for water. In a land already threatened by drought and desertification, the wetlands are being sucked dry.Mustafa’s grandfather, Kasid Wanis, 87, once took his boat from Hawizeh to Basra (about 70 miles) using nothing but a pole and his memory of the route. “We didn’t know what cars were. We didn’t need them. We were a people of water,” he says.His 41-year-old son Hashim, Mustafa’s father, grew up fishing these waters. But four years ago, he packed his nets away. “There’s not enough water to live,” he says quietly.Crude oil is Iraq’s economic lifeline, accounting for more than95% of its total exports and 69% of GDP. The country is the world’ssixth-largest crude producer, and the fate of the Hawizeh marshes is tightly bound to that of the oil industry. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe hassought alternatives to Moscow’s crude, with Iraq becoming a key source.The connection between oil extraction and water scarcity is direct and devastating. The Halfaya oilfield – in which the French energy company TotalEnergies alsoholds a stake– is operated by a consortiumled by PetroChina.Spanning an area three times the size of Paris, it includes 300 wells, three oil-processing plants, a water-treatment facility, and its own airport to transport foreign workers between the site and international airports. It is state-ownedPetroChina’s largest overseas project.View image in fullscreenFishermen from Qarmat Ali with the Nahr Bin Umar oilfield across the Shatt al-Arab River. They complain that due to pollution and the river’s increased salinity, they often pull in dead fish.Photograph: Daniela SalaAbout a decade ago, shortly after PetroChina began operations in the region, six water-pumping stations were built along the Tigris River – the lifeline that feeds the marshes.Every day, they extract about 60,000 cubic metres of water, roughly the daily consumption of a mid-sized city. That water is diverted to the oilfields, where it is injected into wells to boost crude extraction – a standard practice across the region.The pumping stations are drawing from already diminished reserves. Dams built upstream in Turkey and the Kurdish region of Iraqhave reduced water flow into southern Iraqby more than 50% since the 1970s, while Iranian dams on the Karkheh River – which feeds the Hawizeh marshes – have also reduced the region’s water supply. Now, feeding this industrial oil complex is costing residents their environment and their way of life, they say.These days, Hashim is less worried about dwindling fish stocks than about the military checkpoints. The canals that once led deep into the wetlands are cut off and patrolled. Armed guards control access, requiring local fishers and buffalo herders to hand over their ID cards to enter.The marshes have become a militarised zone. Authorities say the heightened police and military presence is meant to prevent smuggling and secure the nearby border with Iran just a few miles away. But according to residents, it also serves to suppress local protests.“The occupation follows the oil,” Mustafa says. “They want to cut us off from our land so they can exploit it without resistance.”View image in fullscreenA water buffalo’s carcass lying where Basra’s northern marshes once were. They dried up after a water-pumping station was built to supply the oilfields of the Italian firm ENI.Photograph: D SalaAs the marshes dried, Mustafa did what many others have been forced to do – he joined the industry he blames for their destruction. In 2023, he and his father worked as subcontracted labourers for PetroChina. “I saw it up close,” he says. “They call this development, but it’s destruction disguised as progress.”Saddam’s troublesome marsh dwellers left high and dry by drainageRead moreBy the summer, he had quit. That same year, drought peaked andprotests erupted across the region, and Mustafa joined them, organising blockades of oilfield access roads. “At first I told Mustafa to stop,” Hashim says. “But then he made me see it: this is political, and we can’t stay silent.”As well as its thirst for water, oil extraction in the region has been linked to devastating pollution. “This economy is literally killing people,” says Majid al-Saadi, director of the agriculture department in Maysan province. In late 2024, Saadi and his team compiled a confidential local government report into the effects of oil extraction on the region.The report, seen by the Guardian, documents alarming concentrations of hydrocarbons and heavy metals, chemicals into drinking water, and the collapse of local agriculture. “This is not just pollution – it’s expropriation,” Saadi says.View image in fullscreenWastewater and polluted foam pour into Basra’s Ashaar canal, next to the Shatt al-Arab River. Basra was once known as the ‘Venice of the Middle East’ but the canals are now full of sewage.Photograph: Daniela SalaIn early 2025, Saadi delivered the report to Iraq’s environment ministry, and says that officials promised to open talks with the oil ministry. But he is sceptical that any action will follow.For now, the expansion of oilfields in the area continues. Leaked photographs and videos, geolocated by the Guardian, now show excavators, pipelines, and workers digging directly into the heart of the protected zone – where the new Huwaiza oilfield is now under development.The exploration has been confirmed by satellite imagery analysis carried out for the Guardian by Placemarks, an independent geo‑analysis studio that uses satellite imagery and data to map environmental changes.View image in fullscreenFish sold in Nahr Bin Omar.

The new excavations would directly violate Ramsar protections. But the pact is not legally binding, and depends on states complying voluntarily.Iraq’s oil and environment ministries did not respond to requests for comment. In July, the interior ministry’s federal security affairs agency said in a social media post that environmental police had “conducted a field inspection … to monitor potential environmental violations resulting from the activities of oil companies in the Hor al-Huwaiza area”.It continued: “The field visit revealed that the pond had completely dried up, with no ongoing drilling, extraction, or disposal of oil waste at the site. However, there were excavations … being carried out by local companies contracted with the Chinese company Geo-Jade for exploration purposes and the future installation of oil rigs.”View image in fullscreenThe Basra water resources directorate.

Hundreds marched near the Halfaya oilfield, denouncing new drilling permits. “This isn’t just about today’s drilling rights,” Mustafa said. “We’re fighting so the next generation can know the wetlands our ancestors protected for thousands of years.”The unrest comes as Iraq boosts oil production amid a worsening water crisis. With another scorching summer under way, the head of Basra’s Human Rights Commission has called for a state of emergency to be imposed, warning of a looming humanitarian disaster from scarcity, pollution and rising toxicity.What remains in the marshes is a quiet war – over land, water and memory. “The government and the companies have turned us into a cake to be divided,” Mustafa says. “They treat these waters like a business opportunity.

Its membership has fallen by about 300, from 2,100 three years ago, as farmers have retired or through consolidation of farms, amid a trend for keeping larger herds. Arla members represent almost a third of all UK dairy farmers.Nearly200 British dairy farmers quit the industryover the 12 months to April 2025, according to the most recent figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), taking the total number of producers to 7,040.The industryhas been warning for some timethat a continued exodus of dairy farmers could jeopardise the UK’s current self-sufficiency in liquid milk.“What we’re seeing is the real impact of these workforce shortages on our farming industry, whether that’s in higher costs or lower milk production,” said Bas Padberg, managing director of Arla Foods UK.“The effect of this is ultimately going to be seen in the price and availability of products on the supermarket shelves, affecting the millions of people that rely on dairy as a source of nutrition in their diet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Younger workers are most likely to enter the industry if it is in the family: two-thirds (66%) of farmers said their farms had been passed down at least four generations, while only 3% of respondents said they were first-generation.Explore more on these topicsFarmingMilkFood & drink industryFoodBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham should have been able to announce themselves kings of the continent here in Udine, flimsy though any grand statements after a Uefa Super Cup win might be. Thomas Frank had challenged them to back up theheroics of Bilbaowith a statement in the Friulian heat and, by the evening’s end, he should have been basking in the kind of start that can define a new manager’s tenure.‘Very, very proud’: Thomas Frank hails Tottenham players after PSG defeatRead moreInstead he received a reminder that there is no quick fix to some deep-rooted habits. For long periods Spurs, faced with a lethargicParis Saint-Germain, resembled a perfectly imprinted version of the Frank playbook. They pummelled their ­opponents in the air, their two-goal lead owing much to well-executed free-kicks and plenty more havoc arising besides. On top of that they looked at ease with a three-man back line that gave a stellar attack little encouragement. With five minutes of regulation time left there was no sign they would be subjected to penalty-inflicted torment.Then the PSG substitute Lee Kang‑in rifled past Guglielmo Vicario from 20 yards and, for the first time, theChampions League holderslooked clear-eyed. By contrast ­Tottenham had sunk back and there was a familiar yawning dread when, simply unable to find a way out by now, they saw six added minutes held up on the touchline.In the fourth of them Gonçalo Ramos glanced in a cross from the otherwise quiet Ousmane Dembélé and Frank will be aware of the surgery still needed on a squad whose backbone is too accustomed to splintering.Not that anyone could judge too harshly. There will certainly be no recriminations for Micky van de Ven or Mathys Tel, who both erred in the shootout and rendered a Vitinha miss irrelevant. Van de Ven was denied by the highly scrutinised PSG debutant Lucas Chevalier, who had a mixed night, and Tel wafted his spot kick wide. It left Nuno Mendes to score the clincher and leave a resounding message that the best in class are never really down and out.View image in fullscreenGonçalo Ramos scores Paris Saint-Germain’s injury-time equaliser from close range.Photograph: Dénes Erdős/APUsed correctly it is a lesson that will serve Spurs and Frank admirably. They looked well ahead of schedule for the majority, even allowing for the fact PSG appeared addled by a calendar that leaves them neither rested nor match sharp. Frank wants to add at least one big ticket signing to their attack but will have been enthused by the ball carrying of Mohammed Kudus, who was both tireless and effective, and some of the Ghanaian’s combinations with Richarlison. When Tottenham expressed themselves it was because, full of running, they had earned the right.But it was their booming, dominant presence from crosses that caused the most unrest. In the warm-up Frank’s players had lined up en masse to practise attacking set pieces, an unusual sight in time usually given to rondos and shooting drills. It foreshadowed what would follow. Kevin Danso’s long throw was utilised from the opening minutes and, the first time Spurs won a free-kick on halfway, Vicario was called to launch it boxwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vicario unloaded another of those long, deep deliveries and Cristian Romero connected beyond the far post. The ball ricocheted and, after Chevalier brilliantly touched João Palhinha’s strike onto the bar, Van de Ven followed up. Frank referred afterwards to a “special operation” from such routines and, at that point, Spurs were delivering on their mission.Three minutes into the second half a deep Pedro Porro free-kick found Romero, announced before kick-off as the new captain, peeling around the back to plant a downwards header across Chevalier. In truth the keeper should have saved, applying a painfully weak hand to Romero’s attempt.

The new episodes cover the national team from the 2024 Copa América, in which the US underperformed by exiting at the group stage, up through the 2025 Nations League final, where the US lost against Panama and Canada en route to a disappointing fourth-place finish in a competition they had won in each of the previous three editions. Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he announced thathe would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team’s last competitive tournament before next year’s World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a second-straight 50-game season with Milan.Christian Pulisic’s father tells Landon Donovan to ‘grow a pair’ after criticism of sonRead morePulisic’s decision elicited strong critiques from ex-US players such as Clint Dempsey,Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad and Herculez Gomez.“In my opinion [they] disrespected me in a lot of ways, and completely forgot about what I’ve done for this national team for 10 years,” Pulisic said in the docuseries.The series also includes segments focused on Pulisic’s personal life, and the role his family plays within his inner circle. His father, Mark, is a former professional soccer player, and he spoke up forcefully for his son.“These [pundits] want clicks, social media, ‘subscribe to my channels,’ ‘listen to my podcasts’ or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,” he said. “It’s jealousy. People want to be in his shoes, and they’ll find any reason to bring him down.

Those are the same guys that’ll turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day. Don’t get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to. But quite frankly, the guys before us didn’t win anything either … Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak negative on us.”Pulisic finished last season asone of Milan’s best playersin a season when the team won the Supercoppa Italia but lost in the Coppa Italia final, lost in the knockout round of the Champions League, and finished eighth in the Serie A table.

His feat required him to surf at least three waves a day, rain or shine, in sickness or in health, through frigid Pacific waters and the shark-rich lineup off Sonoma County.Born in Alhambra, California, in 1948, Webster began standup surfing in 1961 at the age of 13. In 1973, he moved to Bodega Bay, about 70 miles north of San Francisco. Two years later, a run of large swells known as the Monster from New Zealand sparked a personal challenge: surf every day for 100 consecutive days.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

And so forth.”From 3 September 1975 until 5 October 2015, Webster never missed a day in the water. Inspired by surfers like Doc Paskowitz and Phil Edwards, he followed Edwards’ dictum that a wave wasn’t truly ridden unless it was taken all the way to the beach, fin dragging in the sand.Kelia Mehani Gallina: the 12-year-old girl staring down monster waves at Teahupo’oRead moreThe streak was as much about grit as it was about waves. Year-round water temperatures on his stretch of coast hovered around 50F (10C), often dropping into the 40s in winter. Storms regularly battered the shore, and the surf could be fickle or outright dangerous. Webster endured kidney stones, thyroid problems and, on one searingly difficult day, still paddled out after his wife died of cancer.He built his life around the pursuit, never taking vacations away from the coast and even quitting jobs that interfered with his sessions. “The only thing I’ll have is the memory of riding all those waves,” hetold the New York Timesin 2000. “When I’m out there watching the seals and sea lions, and 30-inch salmon jumping, and I have all those waves to myself, it’s like my own personal Disneyland.”His streak ended in 2015 when he needed surgery for kidney stones. By then, Webster had ridden an estimated 43,923 waves. In 2003, his dedication was profiled in Dana Brown’s surf documentary Step Into Liquid. Eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater was among those who saluted him, writing: “#DaleWebster hasn’t missed a day of surfing in #14641 days and I think he’s awesome.”Webster reflected on his devotion in philosophical terms. “Surfing is really a challenge,” he told Surfer. “It may not be barreling, but the act of putting on a suit, going out there, and just being in the water feels wonderful.”Explore more on these topicsSurfingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Singles matches begin 24 August.Williams last played in a Grand Slam event at the 2023 US Open, losing in the first round. She has not won a singles match there since 2019. Her return to the tourcame last month at the DC Open, her first match anywhere in 16 months. Asked then if it would be a one-off appearance, Williams replied: “I’m just here for now, and who knows? Maybe there’s more … I definitely feel I’ll play well. I’m still the same player. I’m a big hitter. This is my brand.”The comeback follows surgery last year to remove uterine fibroids, which sidelined her for most of the season. In Washington, she became the oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova at Wimbledon in 2004. She also drew headlines for announcing her engagement to an Italian actor and joking that she needed to get back on court for the health insurance.Williams, who has also won 14 women’s doubles titles with her sister Serena and two in mixed doubles, entered the Cincinnati Open via a wild card last week butlost in the first round of singles. In New York, she will play mixed doubles with American Reilly Opelka.Other women’s singles wild cards went to Americans Clervie Ngounoue, Julieta Pareja, Caty McNally, Valerie Glozman and Alyssa Ahn; France’s Caroline Garcia, who will retire after the tournament; and Australia’s Talia Gibson.Men’s wild cards went to the Americans Brandon Holt, Nishesh Basavareddy, Tristan Boyer, Emilio Nava, Stefan Dostanic and Darwin Blanch; France’s Valentin Royer; and Australia’s Tristan Schoolkate.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Venus WilliamsUS sportsUS Open tennisTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But who is thriving and who has plenty of work to do to make it to the top?Oliver ConnollyWed 13 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 11.51 EDTShareCaleb Williams, Chicago Bears2024 stats: 3,541 yards, 62.5% completion percentage, 20 passing touchdowns, six interceptions, 27th in EPA/play.Williams entered theNFLwith enormous hype. He was supposed to be a franchise-altering quarterback, a one-man offense who could spin magic out of the mundane. Instead, his rookie season fell flat.Chicago drafted him No 1 overall and then plopped him into an ill-fitting roster with anill-fitting scheme. To compound things, the Bears overloaded Williams with too much, too soon and he spent much of the year looking frazzled.Therewas plenty of blame to go around: receivers quit on the offense (at one point mid-play), the offensive line was brutal and there was no supporting run game. By the midpoint of the season, the players’ body language was so poor that the O-line barelypretended to carewhen Williams was crushed.Still, the rookie wasn’t blameless. Williams swung between hyper-aggressive and ultra-conservative. The creativity that defined his game in college vanished. Early in the season, he bailed from clean pockets, hoping to extend plays; later, he stayed glued to the top of his drops, as though he was trying to deconstruct pre-draft narratives about his instinctual style in real-time. Neither extreme worked.Williams did show progress late in the year, playing with better rhythm in a more structured set-up, but his accuracy was still erratic. Among starting QBs, only Anthony Richardson was more inaccurate on unpressured throws from the pocket.Enter Ben Johnson. The former Lions offensive coordinator has been the most sought-after head coach for two cycles. He rejected multiple job offers before finally taking the Bears gig, betting his career on Williams.NFL preseason storylines: Cowboys chaos, the Browns‘ QB circus and Aaron Rodgers’ last danceRead moreIt’s not just Johnson, either. For the third straight year, the Bears have been crowned offseason champs (hang the banners!). Chicago overhauled their offensive line, trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing center Drew Dalman in free agency. They added Ozzy Trapilo in the second round of the draft, and he is in contention to start at left tackle.It’s a solid haul, but there are caveats. Jackson was a bust in LA, his career derailed by injuries. Thuney has been one of the league’s best guards for a decade, but he turns 33 in November and he showed signs of ageing last season. Dalman is a run-game specialist who has been exposed in pass protection. If the trio click early, they will help fuel Johnson’s rushing attack, the bedrock of Johnson’s offense, but it could easily go the other way.And there are still fair questions about how Johnson will build a passing game to fit Williams. In Detroit, Johnson built a rhythm-based attack around Jared Goff. That’s not Williams’ natural game. He is a creator, wired to hold the ball and extend plays. Finding a balance between Johnson’s systematized approach and Williams’ freewheeling style will be a challenge.Adjustmentsshouldflow in both directions: Johnson loosening his approach; Williams speeding up his play in the pocket. Early training camp reports, though, have not been encouraging. Johnson hasn’t decluttered the Bears’ offense. He’s added even more to the quarterback’s plate,dumping his entire offense on Williamsand asking him to play catch-up. That’s the same approach last year’s staff took, and it was a dud.Johnson was hired to trigger a quick turnaround for Williams and the Bears, but the partnership may take a year to come together. Williams remains an electric talent. Johnson is one of the best offensive architects of his generation. The potential peak is a Mahomes-Reid-like fusion of ideas. But the teething issues could be gnarly until the duo find a middle-ground approach that works.Confidence meter: 5/10 – Banking on Johnson.Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders2024 stats: 3,568 yards, 69% completion percentage, 25 passing touchdowns, nine interceptions, eighth in EPA/playDaniels put together the finest rookie quarterback season in modern league history, carrying the Commanders to an NFC Championship game.Nothing about last year was a fluke. He crackedeverything opposing defenses threw his way, torching the blitz and shredding complex coverage rotations. At times, Daniels was a one-man offense, an explosive play waiting to happen, whether through the air or on the ground. He also mastered pro-level nuances and refused to make dumb mistakes, finishing the season with 1.7% turnover-worthy play percentage, second only to Lamar Jackson.The Commanders recognize they have something special and spent the offseason trying to fast-track their championship timeline. That’s a laudable strategy, but the particulars are fuzzy. They bet on household names, acquiring Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel in offseason trades to give Daniels more protection and firepower. But both of the new arrivals are at iffy stages of their careers: Tunsil didn’t play up to his reputation in Houston last season; Samuel is a unicorn, but injuries have slowed him down. The team mirrored the strategy on defense, bringing in older vets (Von Miller, Will Harris, Eddie Goldman) to try to push them over the top. Now, Washington have the oldest roster in the NFL despite having one of the best young quarterbacks in the league.You can quibble with the Commanders’ medium-term outlook, but the rosteris stronger this season than last. Tunsil, for all his faults last season, is a clear upgrade at left tackle. If the team can box off acontract extension for Terry McLaurin, they will have plenty of weapons for Daniels to work with. Even if the team regress, we have seen enough from Daniels to know he will be a perennial MVP contender.Confidence meter: 10/10 – we’re gonna need a bigger scale.Drake Maye, New England Patriots2024 stats: 2,276 yards, 66.6% completion percentage, 15 passing touchdowns, 10 interceptions, 20th in EPA/playMaye was dealt the roughest hand of any rookie quarterback last season. He was dropped on a barren roster, playing for a head coach who was in over his head.Given the circumstances, Maye was outstanding. There were flashes of the Justin Herbert-esque quarterback he could be: An efficient, downfield bomber who can move the chains with his legs, so long as he kicks his addiction to fumbles. The surface numbers were fine. But the under-the-hood figures were more encouraging. He finished the year 20th in EPA/play, ranking third among the rookies and ahead of more established starters. He also finished with 2.8% completion percentage over expectation, which sounds small but put him 11th in the league, above Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen.This season, the arrow is pointing up. Mike Vrabel is now the Pats’ head coach. Josh McDaniels is back calling plays. Professionalism is back in the building. The front office invested heavily and smartly to upgrade the offense, adding Stefon Diggs, rookie receiver Kyle Williams, veteran linemen Morgan Moses and Garrett Bradbury, and two linemen drafted in the top three rounds, including left tackle Will Campbell.Even with the additions, the Patriots’ offensive line lacks experience and difference-makers. But it’s in a stronger place than when Maye walked into the huddle a year ago. The receiver room is also improved, running eight deep, with recent draft picks Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker unlikely to make the regular season roster.With those improvements around him, Maye is the most likely quarterback to take the Year Two leap.Confidence meter: 7/10 – finally working with some pros.View image in fullscreenMichael Penix had some promising performances in limited playing time in 2024.Photograph: Brett Davis/USA Today SportsMichael Penix Jr, Atlanta Falcons2024 stats: 775 yards, 58.1% completion percentage, three passing touchdowns, three interceptionsThe sample size is tiny. But in three starts, Penix justified last offseason’scontentious investment. Atlanta drafted Penix No 8 overall, three months after signing Kirk Cousins in free agency to a three-year, $180m fully guaranteed deal. At the time, double-dipping on quarterbacks felt foolish. And given that Cousins arrived in Atlanta fully cooked, itstillfeels foolish. But with Cousins’ decline and a so-so draft intake, picking up a quarterback with Penix’s potential has proven to be a savvy move.Watching Cousins last year was miserable. He couldn’t move. His throws had no juice. Strip off the nameplate, and the Falcons had a quarterback struggling to operate a functional NFL offense. Atlanta’s OC, Zac Robinson, was forced to scrap elements of his offense to try to hide Cousins’ physical shortcomings. It took only one drive for Penix to show the promise of Atlanta’s offense. Unlike Cousins, Penix has a rapid release and a hose for an arm. He immediately allowed the Falcons to expand the playbook and showed some veteran craft in the pocket. He navigated muddy pockets, extended plays when he could and manipulated defenders with his eyes, spraying the ball to all levels of the field.For all the positives, Penix’s accuracy remains a concern. He posted one of the highest uncatchable pass rates of the season (34.4%) in Week 17, a lingering issue from his days in college. But there was enough upside to fill fans with confidence that he can be, at worst, a league-average starter – and that alone would be an improvement for the Falcons.Atlanta’s offense is oozing with potential. Drake London is an All-Pro-caliber receiver. With Kyle Pitts, Casey Washington and Ray-Ray McCloud, they have a good cast of supplementary pass-catchers. Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier are one of the best backfield tandems in the league. The offensive line is solid, if unspectacular. The ceiling of the group will come down to Penix’s development.Confidence meter: 6/10 – who doesn’t love a rocket-armed lefty?JJ McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings2024 stats:N/AMcCarthy isthis season’s mystery box. He missed his entire rookie season with a knee injury and stood on the sidelines as Sam Darnold rejuvenated his career, showing what’s possible in Kevin O’Connell’s offense.This year’s Vikings roster is deeper and more talented than the group that won 14 games last season, putting McCarthy in an ideal spot for a first-year starter. The offensive line is improved, he has a game-breaker at receiver, a top-10 tight end, a decent rushing attack, an offensive guru for a head coach and a hellacious defense that should provide plenty of short fields.Pushing deep into the playoffs should be the expectation in Minnesota; the roster is too loaded, the coaching staff too good to miss this opportunity. But that’s a ton of pressure to lay at the door of a quarterback who is effectively a rookie.An American dream dashed: why Louis Rees-Zammit called time on NFL adventureRead moreIf he does nothing else but limit turnovers, McCarthy should pilot the Vikings to double-digit wins. If he can prove to be more of a playmaker, which he showed in bursts at Michigan, he can elevate the offense beyond what Darnold produced last season.Confidence meter:5/10 – too many unknowns.Bo Nix, Denver Broncos2024 stats: 3,775 yards, 66.3% completion percentage, 29 passing touchdowns, 12 interceptions, 19th in EPA/playLast year, Nix and Sean Payton silenced the bozos (this writer included) who rolled their eyes at Denver drafting him in the first round. Anyone doubting Nix at this point is likely holding on to priors. Is he as physically gifted as Williams, Daniels, or Maye? No. But entering his second season, Nix has checked off more boxes than all but Daniels.As a rookie, Nix was efficient, accurate and decisive. He was fortunate to be playing behind one of the league’s best offensive lines, but he quickly mastered Payton’s richly layered offense and took advantage of his environment.Early on, the Broncos sheltered Nix. That made sense. Even as an older rookie – he entered the league as a 24-year-old – Nix’s feel in the pocket was off, and he struggled to rev up to the speed of the league. But by the midseason, Payton had ripped the training wheels off, and Nix demolished any pre-draft notions about his game. He started manipulating defenses rather than reacting to them. He challenged the middle of the field. He ripped heaters into tight coverage. Over the second half of the season, Nix finished sixth in adjusted completion percentage on throws of 20 yards or more, outpacing Herbert, Jackson and Joe Burrow. He cut down on negative plays, posting the best rookie pressure-to-sack rate at 13% (elite quarterbacks typically hover around 10%).Pre-draft, Nix was billed as a system quarterback, one who would rely on making quick, decisive reads, accuracy and not turning the ball over. Those traits still define his game. But he showed in the second half of his rookie year that he is more than a cog in Payton’s machine.If Nix can build on his rookie campaign, the Broncos will have legitimate title aspirations.Confidence meter:8/10 – Nix can anchor a franchise.Explore more on these topicsNFLChicago BearsWashington CommandersAtlanta FalconsNew England PatriotsMinnesota VikingsDenver BroncosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By January 2023, Garín sat at a precarious No 82.‘I’m good, I promise’: the loneliness of the low-ranking tennis playerRead moreAn unforgiving ranking system, determined by tournament performances over the past 52 weeks, waits for no one. Even players like Garín, once among the world’s best, can find themselves back in purgatory after a bad spell. “In the beginning, it was difficult to find motivation,” says the 29-year-old after a long pause.“The cities, conditions are not the best, different from when you play the best tournaments. The Challengers are tough. Sometimes I get very upset because you go a long way to win 30 matches and you’re still outside the top 100. It’s way too much.”The life of a player can be far from fancy. Casual fans may look toward Carlos Alcaraz’s lucrative sponsorship deals with envy, but those on the fringes of the top 100 and beyond live a starkly contrasting reality. The less glamorous side of the sport involves endless travelling, cost cutting to make ends meet and battling bouts of loneliness.Kevin Clancy, a sports psychologist who worked with Ireland’s top players, believes tennis and golf are the most psychologically demanding sports. He says: “It’s roughly about 20% of the time that you’re on court and hitting the ball, so there’s 80% of the time where you’re doing a lot of thinking.“Tennis is a sport that mentally could beat you up really, really badly. For players at Challenger level, it’s about survival. They need to play more tournaments and have that constant pressure of, ‘I need to perform and get points’.“A lot of times those players are sleeping on floors. They’re sharing maybe a motel room with a number of other players. In some cases they may even struggle to have enough money to buy proper food.View image in fullscreenNikoloz Basilashvili returned from an elbow injury last year and suffered a net loss of about $120,000.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images“These players are playing in front of a man and his dog in the middle of nowhere. It’s really tough from a psychological perspective.”When the Serbian professional Dusan Lajovic first started on tour, he relished the new experiences of travelling to far-flung countries. But his youthful exuberance quickly wore off after years of gruelling 11-month schedules. In 2023, herevealed his battles with depression and anxiety.Lajovic, once ranked 23rd in the world and now aged 35, says: “It’s not just forehands and backhands, it’s how much can you suffer? How much can you travel? How much can you sleep in different beds every week? We take almost as many flights as pilots. It’s a lonely sport.“When you’re hitting 30, you’re trying to nest somewhere, start a family. But tennis doesn’t allow you that. It’s not just saying, OK, this is for me, I’m going to be strong, because you’re going hit walls. It takes a toll on your body, your mental health.”Players dedicate their entire lives to the sport. Japan’s Taro Daniel would know, having moved across the globe to Spain when he was 14. “To put into perspective, it’s 20 years more dedication than a doctor to be here,” the 32-year‑old says, chuckling. “And even then, 90% of people don’t make it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On WhatsApp, Zoom, whatever, it’s extremely important. You need to have a routine in place after a match.”For all their sacrifices, a juicy financial return is far from guaranteed. In 2024, Nikoloz Basilashvili returned from an elbow injury and earned $63,183 in prize money. But after subtracting flight costs and paying his coaches, the Georgian said he made a net loss of about $120,000.View image in fullscreenCristian Garín says he found it difficult to be motivated on the Challenger tour.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images“I wanted to quit after my injury because I was very burned out for many years,” he says. “You are mostly alone and you don’t really have a lot of friends to talk to. I don’t know if there is any other sport like this, to take a flight on the same day you play a match and then next week you are in another city. But then I decided to look at tennis in a different way, to enjoy it a little bit more.”As a former world No 16 with more than $9m in career earnings, Basilashvili could afford the short-term hit. Others, like India’s Sumit Nagal, oncereduced to a mere €900 in his bank account, do not enjoy the same luxury. “All I can say is you need to keep on playing, keep on winning. That’s how it is,” the world No 302 says.Most persist to fuel their love for the sport. For Nicolás Jarry, a former world No 16 who dropped out of the top 100 while battling vestibular neuritis – an ear condition affecting his balance and vision – tennis serves an additional purpose; as his form of self expression.“I was born the oldest child, so I follow a lot of rules,” he says. “When somebody tells me to do A, and it’s not going to kill me, I will do A, even if I think B. Now, I follow my instincts. It motivates me to see how far I can go following my gut.”Explore more on these topicsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wyman often works in wayfaring, and his signs and instructions to viewers often use simple, geometric shapes to get the job done, often incorporating a playfulness as well. His approach has made his work timeless. In 2011, when the government of the District of Columbia wanted their metro map updated, they went right back to Wyman, who had crafted the original design for the system about 40 years earlier.His most notable work, though, came early on in his career. In the late 60s, Wyman, along with a handful of others, was tasked with creating the visual identity for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was a massive task, especially for a young designer only a half-decade removed from college.Determined to get the assignment right, Wyman moved to Mexico in the months leading up to his deadline and immersed himself in the country’s culture. He dived into archives, visited archaeological sites and spoke to locals. Slowly, he started to pick up design cues – from the yarn paintings of the indigenous Huichol in western Mexico, to the Aztec stone carvings that have always helped define the country’s visual identity.What Wyman helped produce is almost universally recognized as one of the greatest assemblages of sports design ever created. The logotype for the tournament alone – that hypnotic, concentric “MEXICO 68” – blended the country’s culture with the Op Art movement. Wyman and his team created event posters, wayfaring signage and more and within years their designs dotted the landscape of the entire city.View image in fullscreenA collection of Lance Wyman’s work for the 1968 Olympics.Photograph: Courtesy Lance WymanIn 1970, when the country hosted its first-ever World Cup, they went right back to Wyman’s logotype, and Wyman himself created a handful of other designs for the tournament. It feels fair to say that the visual identity of that tournament may well be the most instantly-recognizable design work of any World Cup in history.I reached Wyman a couple of years ago, at his office in New York City. Then 86, his work had understandably slowed. The World Cup is returning to Mexico in 2026, and I was eager to gather his thoughts on some of the early designs associated with the tournament, particularly Fifa’s official World Cup logo.“I did see it, yes,” Wyman said back then. “It’s not that effective. It’s not really identifiable when it goes small, so that’s certainly a problem. It certainly doesn’t say ‘soccer.’ I remember the first time I saw the [European] Champions League logo, I thought that was pretty clever. This … I’m just not so sure there’s a lot you can do with it.”View image in fullscreenThe 2026 World Cup logo was revealed in 2023.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThe logo felt phoned-in back then, as it does now. It was crafted by Fifa’s in-house design team and accompanied by the requisite explainer graphic and evena presentation by Fifa itself, who espoused its valors: scalability and adaptability. It’s less a logo and more of a logo system, they explained, allowing them to adapt the image to different devices and even alter it to suit different host cities in the tournament’s host countries. It’s the same thing Wyman did expertly in 68, just worse.My view, of course, is purely subjective – as are most things related to art and design. But looking at the logo got me thinking more broadly about the direction of crests and design as a whole in American soccer.More recently,the crest for Denver Summit FC– the NWSL’s latest expansion club, which will debut in 2026 – only intensified what I’d already been thinking: why do these things all look the same in recent years? And despite that, why are some so inspiring, and some so … bland?View image in fullscreenA collection of World Cup 1970 posters designed by Lance Wyman.Photograph: Courtesy Lance WymanIn some ways, Vermont-based designer Matthew Wolff holds the keys to the design direction of American club soccer. His work spans the entirety of the men’s and women’s game, having handled some of MLS’ most well-received crests, elegant designs for LAFC and NYC FC among them. In the NWSL, Wolff was most recently tapped to craft a new logo for the club now known as Boston Legacy (after that club rolled out maybethe most roundly criticized name and brandin American soccer history.His work dots the lower leagues as well, where several of his crests have felt like instant classics – Union Omaha, and even recent USL League 2 champions Vermont Green, a club Wolff helped co-found.“I was at the right place at the right time,” said Wolff. “I think about the trajectory of American soccer in parallel to where I was in my education and my early career. [Everybody] has known that American soccer was going to explode for years and years. So I think I somewhat intentionally positioned myself to be ready, willing and able to create football crests in the United States.”Wolff’s works sometimes feels a little bit like Lyman’s: uncluttered, bold, simple. Like Wyman did in ‘68, Wolff operates in a space where his work often ends up being representative of the community that commissioned it and he often incorporates elements of those places into his final design.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others feel a lot more esoteric, like the crest Wolff crafted for USL’s One Knox FC. That one, which features a color palette inspired by a handful of Knoxville’s local monuments, feels distinctly more generic, as does Denver’s.It’s an aesthetic summed up on a podcast I heard recently. In it, the host was raving about Denver’s new crest, saying it would feel right at home on the side of a reusable metal water bottle. To that person, that was a compliment. At times, though, that type of ubiquity can rob a design of its character.Wolff himself acknowledges the reality of design work as a whole. His job is done for the client, to meet the needs of their brief, not necessarily his own tastes or preferences.“My ideal vision is kind of irrelevant to these crests,” says Wolff. “I’m trying to answer a brief, some parameters that have been set by a club or by me and the club together. There’s obviously an infinite number of ways you can execute it, even in the tightest of briefs. If you told me ‘OK, this crest needs to have a heraldic lion that’s blue, and be in a circle and say Chelsea at the top and Football Club at the bottom and have some ornaments … there are still infinite ways I can design that. I don’t really think about my own tastes in the crests as much as ‘is this answering the brief.”Designers, in other words, are only part of the equation these days in terms of crafting a brand identity.“[The process] has been pulled away from graphic designers - specialists - and pulled into this nebulous room of other people who make design decisions by committee,” said Ben Mahler, a former creative director atMLSclub DC United. “Marketing directors, focus groups, analytics driven shit, it all ends up pushing things into safer territory. It’s losing the artistic side and the wonkiness that comes from an individual.”View image in fullscreenOne Knoxville and Vermont Green FC logos, both designed by Matthew Wolff.Photograph: One Knoxville & Vermont Green FCWolff, and any other designer in this space, is also subject to the mercy of the audience, so to speak. Bos Nation is far from the only club to have course corrected after an initial misstep – when the Chicago Fire rolled out an absolutely atrocious rebrand in 2019, their fans were enraged. The Fire turned to Wolff to solve that problem, and he did so with a much cleaner, easier-to look at design.“These designs are meant to represent the fans and the club,” said Wolff. “And if the fans, or the community see this crest and they feel it doesn’t represent them, then I think they’re well within their rights to let the club know. These fans are the ones who the clubs are asking to buy a $100 kit. And sure, there are examples where people make comments [about a crest] that are a little ridiculous. But by and large, I get it.”View image in fullscreenLance Wyman among some of his non-sports work.Photograph: Courtesy Lance WymanFor his part, Wyman, who grew up in Kearny, New Jersey (an American soccer holy land in and of itself) told me he’s never been asked to do a soccer crest. A few years back he partnered with a non-profit tohelp design a soccer ball, which turned out great: the red, blue and white design is bedecked with stars. It feels a bit like the design of the old North American Soccer League’s ball, used through the ‘70s and early ‘80s.Outside that, Wyman’s work has largely been done for companies and local municipalities. Looking at his designs, it’s hard to imagine why some club out there wouldn’t bring him into the fold. Wolff’s work is often fantastic, but some variety might be nice, too. Maybe some club out there could take a chance on the person whose designs have been thrown on nearly every logo-related mood board in existence, over the years.“Every once in a while something will come along with sports, but for the most part, my work has been focused elsewhere,” Wyman said a couple of years back. “I’d love to take a crest on, if I had the opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsFootballDesignMLSNWSLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Too many managerial changes and different strategies had undermined the playing principles established under Ferguson, said Rashford, and prevented any meaningful transition. He believes United will not be serious contenders for the Premier League again unless they keep faith with a clear plan.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 14: Manchester UnitedRead moreUnited endured their worst top-flight campaign since being relegated in 1973-74 when finishing 15th last season. Ruben Amorim, who sidelined Rashford before his loans to Aston Villa andBarcelona, is United’s sixth permanent manager since Ferguson stepped down in 2013, the last time the club won the title. Rashford came through United’s academy while Ferguson was in charge.“Show me a successful team that just adapts,” Rashfordtold the Rest is Footballpodcast with Gary Lineker and Micah Richards. “When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team, the whole academy set-up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?“You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles. Whereas at times I feel like United have just been … we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.“If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.“So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect? People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.”No United manager in the post-Ferguson era has been given three years. Rashford said the club could learn from their fierce rivals Liverpool, who ended a 30-year wait for a top-flight title under Jürgen Klopp in 2020. Klopp joined in October 2015 and secured his first trophy in 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People only remember his final few years when he was competing with [Manchester] City and winning the biggest trophies – he certainly didn’t win for three years.“To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel – it’s not easy. But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is.

The experienced left-back Reinildo played Champions League football for Atlético Madrid last season and the Chelsea loanee striker Marc Guiu comes highly recommended.Even so last season’s star, Jobe Bellingham, now at Borussia Dortmund, will be missed and the manager, Régis Le Bris, faces quite a challenge in blending so many newcomers into a cohesive unit. The left-sided Paraguay central defender Omar Alderete – who finalised his £10.4m move from Getafe on Tuesday morning – looks a smart addition, but disappointing pre-season results reflect a squad who possibly still barely recognise each other if they pass on the street.If Sunderland are not quite copying Nottingham Forest, who spent £142m on 21 players after being promoted in 2022, they would be very happy to emulate Forest and ensure Premier League survival before starting to thrive. Re-establishing themselves in the top tier after an eight-year absence will be tough but the club are certainly throwing everything at the challenge. Stadium of Light regulars will hope first-team roles are found for much-loved players of last season’s promotion including the striker Wilson Isidor and, above all, the talented local-born midfielder Chris Rigg. Harmony off the pitch and unity on it were formidably strong last term; can that glorious spirit be recreated at a time when a series of playoff winners seem set for the exit or the bench?A graph of Sunderland’s finishing positions in the past five seasonsThe managerThe 49-year-old Le Bris ended his first season on Wearside by choreographing Sunderland’sdramatic Wembley triumph against Sheffield Unitedin May’s playoff final. A former Rennes and Laval defender, the Frenchman holds a doctorate in physiology and biomechanics and a diploma in the mental training of elite athletes. He spent a decade as a youth coach at Lorient in his native Brittany before taking charge of the first team in 2022, with his love of trigonometry underpinning a coaching philosophy that sees football as being all about triangles. Le Bris began learning English, almost from scratch, the same year.

He has presided over a strategy of recruiting gifted, if raw, young players from across the world. The successful implementation has been masterminded by the sporting director, Kristjaan Speakman. The latter has been joined this summer by the former Nice and Roma sporting director Florent Ghisolfi, who has assumed the same role and has been restocking the squad. The club’s gradual gentrification continues with the Michelin-starred chef Tommy Banks opening a decidedly upmarket restaurant, Banks on the Wear, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light.A horizontal bar chart of last season’s resultsStar signingThe much decorated Xhaka, the 32-year-old Switzerland captain and former Arsenal central midfielder, has joined for a fee that could reach £17m after a successful stint at Bayer Leverkusen. “I feel I’m ready to help Sunderland with my experience but also with quality as well,” he said. His recruitment constitutes quite a statement because it is a significant deviation from the board’s policy of acquiring promising youngsters with high resale potential. The intensity of Xhaka’s tempo-setting game should appeal to fans and the raucous Stadium of Light looks a perfect stage for his well-calibrated passing range and committed brand of leadership.Stepping upAfter scoring six goals (all in the Conference League) in 16 first-team appearances for Chelsea Guiu arrives on a season’s loan. The talk in west London is that the former Barcelona forward could prove as good as Cole Palmer and Sunderland fought off considerable opposition to borrow the 19-year-old for a season. “I see myself as a powerful striker who can make a big difference on and off the ball,” he said. “I pride myself on being a natural goalscorer.

That, to be fair, is an estimate, because the football presenter and broadcaster has always been a grafter. From Setanta Sports to Channel 5 there are few places where she has not applied her blend of deep knowledge and emotional warmth, and as of this weekend she will be the face of the BBC’s and Sky’s coverage of the Premier League.The action gets under way at a second home, Anfield, from where Cates will host Sky’s Friday Night Football coverage of Liverpool v Bournemouth. This follows two preview shows for the BBC, and precedes her first shift onMatch of the Day.Premier League to test Ref Cams on first weekend with view to permanent rolloutRead moreAsked whether her schedule might be daunting, Cates appears almost bemused. “I’ve just got busy weekends, but I work in sports so I expect to have busy weekends,” she says. “It’s not as complicated as you think – there’s a very fast train to Manchester.”Cates, speaking at Sky’s HQ, says she doesn’t want to sound cliched but “it’s good to keep doing new things”. Her new roles are a chance to “keep things fresh”. Having worked in the industry for 27 years, starting with a presenting role on the opening morning of Sky Sports News, “to get a chance to do something new and still have the live football and have so many live games, it’s just really lovely to have that balance”.For many years Cates had to endure questions that her colleagues don’t; from being a woman in a man’s world to being the daughter of a football legend, Sir Kenny Dalglish. She has long since carved out her own place in sports broadcasting, however, so when she was approached for the role of Match of the Day host, alongside Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan, Sky immediately brokered a deal that would keep her on its roster too.While her male colleagues may get more attention, usually adjacent to some controversy, Cates’s less combative approach has helped to shape contemporary coverage of football on TV (and radio). Her more approachable and conversational style is suited to the age of podcasting and long‑form interviews.“I think that the tone generally has changed to become more conversational on air, and I think that’s probably because that’s come from digital,” she says. “A lot of that was fan-led and a lot of it was just people starting up on their own at the beginning. But I think you can have a conversational tone without having a conversation, and you can still interview somebody while having a conversational tone.”View image in fullscreenKelly Cates has little social media presence. ‘There’s a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they don’t care about it,’ she says.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty ImagesCates offers another distinction from many of her peers; she is not an avid user of social media. She has no account on X and tends to use Instagram to promote her work rather than share her worldview. “I haven’t ever really used my social media for that, so it isn’t something that I’m going to have to change,” she says.“I think that in a lot of cases, I’m not the best-placed person to talk about some of those issues. And I think there’s a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they don’t care about it. I think it’s perfectly possible to care about something and keep quiet and let experts talk about it, which I think is a lot of the time better. I always feel like if I couldn’t cope well with being challenged heavily on it, then I shouldn’t be putting my opinion out publicly.”That she should be asked about her posting reflects the Gary Lineker-shaped presence in the room. Cates, Chapman and Logan are being asked by the BBC to team up to replace a broadcasting legend, with all the public scrutiny that entails. Cates says she has not spoken to Lineker about the job, but defends his reputation despite his being a “controversial” figure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We just don’t know each other that well. I think [Chapman] was saying that Gary said: ‘Why would I tell three broadcasters how to do their job?’ Which is very lovely of him because he was brilliant at the job. And as much as he was a controversial character at times, any focus group that researched these things would tell you how much he was adored in that role.”On how she will approach following in the footsteps of yet another football legend, Cates is matter of fact.“I don’t want to be Gary. I think there’s a temptation to try and be someone else, and I think that you get a job because of yourself. If then you try to be someone else, it can all just get a bit confused. I don’t need another thing to think about. I don’t need to be sitting there thinking: ‘What would Gary do?’”Cates has enough talent and experience to help her adapt to her new prominence. Britons will see a lot more of her on their screens and she will be watching even more football. Is there any possibility that more could become too much? “If it was going to happen, it would have kicked in by now,” she says with a smile.Explore more on these topicsFootballMatch of the DayinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Sesko’s arrival atManchester Unitedwas third time lucky for last season’s Europa League finalists, having attempted to make a deal for the Slovenia striker when he was leaving Domžale in 2019 and again when he agreed to fly the Red Bull Salzburg nest in 2022, eventually joining up with RB Leipzig a year down the line.Now United havetheir still-only-22-year-old manand if Sesko has been feted in the inner circles of European football since his mid-teens, one could suggest the wait has not only be worthwhile but that it could work in favour of Ruben Amorim as he attempts to author a dramatic uptick in the fortunes of the English game’s premier fallen giant.Marcus Rashford claims Manchester United are stuck in ‘no man’s land’Read moreAnd now, the time for talking and for contemplating is done. United have wanted their headline No 9, and Sesko has wanted his chance to shine in England. Both have had their wishes come true and both need to prove that their partnership can be a fruitful one because, beyond the hype, club and player have a lot staked on this, and really need it to work. Sesko’s debut is expected to come at home to Arsenal on Sunday.Ever since Sesko arrived at Leipzig in 2023, it was strongly suspected this moment would come. From even earlier, perhaps. Sesko arrived in the Red Bull universe in 2019, signing his Salzburg deal a few days after turning 16, less than a year after Erling Haaland had done the same.Haaland is a figure who frequently comes up when discussing and describing Sesko; not just because of entrusting his development to Red Bull’s finishing school but because of their comparative athletic profiles. Both men are 6ft 5in, both have the build that would suggest they would be traditional target men and both have lightning pace that one doesn’t expect from a player of that stature.Yet from there, they diverge. If the physical characteristics of Haaland and Sesko are slightly misleading, so is the suggestion that they are similar players. The Norwegian, from his first steps in the Salzburg first team, had looked like the goal machine he has proved to be so emphatically in Dortmund and Manchester. Sesko, his successor, never really looked like doing the same, even if he struck 16 times in 30 Austrian Bundesliga games in his final Salzburg season.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko celebrates scoring for RB Leipzig against Bayern Munich last season.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesWhat Sesko lacked in sheer goal volume, though, he made up for in his all-round game, which outstripped that of Haaland when he was in Austria (or Germany for that matter). In terms of running the channels, linking with teammates in the final third and being an authentic part of the team rather than just a penalty box predator, Salzburg-era Sesko was clearly the brighter bet. It was entirely legitimate, however, to wonder how regularly he might score in Germany after making the move to Leipzig.The big success of his time with Leipzig was his arrival as a consistent goalscorer in a top European league. A pair of six-week droughts, one in autumn, another in early spring, meant he ended up with a lower Bundesliga tally last term than in his debut season, 13 compared with 14, but his ability to be decisive and make proper use of his natural gifts – strength, speed, a thunderous shot, the ability to peel away from defenders with the adroitness of a smaller man and ability in the air when required – has been clear.Sesko’s spell in the Bundesliga, like Haaland’s, always felt like a loan in all but name and contractual detail. More than a finishing school, it was more a waiting room until an inevitable move to the Premier League.Mikel Arteta’s longstanding interest in Sesko was no secret but the arrival of Andrea Berta at Arsenal (with his record of going big on established centre-forwards) shifted the club’s focus to Viktor Gyökeres, which opened the door for United to try again for Šeško.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Højlund and Zirkzee are two among countless examples of talented players who have arrived at Old Trafford and not become the players they were expected to be.One could argue that Newcastle were Sesko’s safer bet, given that his aim will be for his Premier League trajectory to mirror that of Alexander Isak, transforming strong potential into all-conquering product. Amorim has successfully developed players beyond their wildest dreams (Gyökeres being the most famous example) so perhaps he can do so again, with a pre-season behind him and a squad more shaped to his liking.Sesko’s temperament gives him a great chance; throughout this summer’s transfer saga he behaved in an exemplary fashion at Leipzig, with the sporting director, Marcel Schäfer, underlining this week that “his move is a loss both from a sporting and a personal perspective”. His success in the Premier League would be a significant corner turned for this latest United rebuild.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is only the tip of the iceberg, however, with Fifa finding that female footballers were 29% more likely to face online abuse or threats at the Women’s World Cup in 2023 compared with their male equivalents at Qatar 2022.Numerous female athletes from tennis, athletics and across sport have also spoken out against misogyny, threats and abuse online. When Sheffield Hallam and University College Birmingham scrutinised policies of clubs in the Women’s Super League, Women’s County Championship and women’s rugby union championships, as well as governing bodies such as the Football Association, they were concerned about how little focus there was on combating abuse of female athletes.“Clubs lack adequate protection against social media and are failing to manage the increased attention on female athletes,” they say. “Given that female athletes face three times more online abuse than their male counterparts and are gaining more online visibility, this is especially concerning.”“No clubs or organisations differentiated the support or protection of social media policies for women’s sports, and female athletes were only explicitly mentioned in the FA’s Game Changer Objectives for the women’s game,” they add.The study, published this week in theCommunication & Sport journal, acknowledges some bodies have launched campaigns, but adds: “These acts are superficial and performative, lacking genuine care and protection, yet organisations are commended for them.“Campaigns often focus on racism while under-representing other forms of discrimination primarily targeting female players. This illustrates the lack of specificity regarding the protection of female athletes. Furthermore, it demonstrates how organisations and clubs are shirking their duty of care, shifting the responsibility onto athletes to safeguard themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And so boycotting social media removes them from that space which is a workplace for them.”Explore more on these topicsSportSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Fast forward several decades and while the standard of officiating remains much the same, advances in the fields of both technology and vanishing foam dictate that Premier League refs are now forced to include spray cans, headsetsand now body camerason the list of items to be ticked off their pre-match checklists before they can lead teams out on to the pitch.The news that several of those tasked with dispensing on-field justice will be testing Ref Cams in selected matches throughout the first round of fixtures this weekend was broken by Big Website earlier, meaning some or all of Jarred Gillett, Anthony Taylor and Chris Kavanagh will be joining assorted other frontline workers who are forced to go about their business wearing an electronic all-seeing eye to record their professional activities. However, unlike the police, Wetherspoons bar staff and some of their grassroots brethren, these members of the PGMOL match officials will not be using them for safety and security measures, but in the interests of further enhancing the viewing experience of TV viewers at home.This latest televisual wheeze has been approved by Ifab, self-styled “independent guardians” of the rules of association football, a body you’d think might be better served sorting out the increasingly impenetrable shambles that is the handball law, rather than greenlighting new and innovative ways to show everyone how utterly unfit for purpose it continues to be. Already used in Copa Gianni, where it offered viewers the shaky and largely unhelpful on-pitch POV of a wheezing man struggling to keep up with elite athletes while running around a furnace, this new technology has apparently been embraced by broadcasters who, with the exception of one that happens to sponsor this email and is therefore beyond reproach of any kind, are always looking for new ways to try to justify the increases in their already exorbitant monthly subscriptions.The PGMOL, whose employees will be wearing the Ref Cams, is also understood to be wholeheartedly in favour of this innovation, having arrived at the misguided and almost certainly incorrect conclusion that in providing fans with further insights into how difficult a referee’s job can be, it will help reduce the amount of abuse to which they are subjected. Good luck with that one, lads.

It was later announced that the game had been abandoned with the score at 0-0.Manchester Evening News reported that a replacement ambulance was needed and the delay forced the fixture to be called off.United issued an update on Koné’s condition, saying in a statement: “We can confirm Sékou is conscious, stable and communicating with United’s medical team. He has been taken to hospital, as a precaution, for further checks.”A statement on Tamworth’s official X account said: “Due to the medical situation, we are forced to abandon tonight’s fixture, details will be revealed in due course.“We would like to wish safe travels to all the Man United fans, staff and players.

Inter had hoped to reunite Leoni with the formerParmacoach Cristian Chivu but were unable to match the financial offer from Liverpool.Liverpool consider Leoni one of the most promising young defenders in Europe and, having agreed a package with Parma, he is expected to go straight into the first-team squad. A deal for the 6ft 5in defender would not end the Premier League champions’interest in Marc Guéhi. Negotiations with Crystal Palace over the England international are continuing.Newcastle close to signing Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa for £40mRead moreDominic Calvert-Lewin is undergoing a medical atLeedswith a view to sealing a free transfer to the promoted Premier League club. The 28‑year-old centre-forward has been a free agent sinceleaving Evertonin June after nine years. He scored 71 times in 273 appearances for the club and described his departure as “incredibly difficult”.Moving to Elland Road, where he is poised to become the eighth recruit of a busy summer, would bring the former Sheffield United player back to his native Yorkshire. Calvert-Lewin would compete with the former Wolfsburg forward Lukas Nmecha and Joël Piroe, the Championship top scorer last season, for a place in Daniel Farke’s XI.Calvert-Lewin’s arrival would be expected to accelerate Patrick Bamford’s exit from Leeds. Farke has told Bamford he has no future at the club. His fellow forward Mateo Joseph has joined Mallorca on loan. Calvert-Lewin, like Bamford, has struggled with injuries in recent seasons. He has 11 England caps, scoring four goals, but last played for his country in 2021.Newcastle are among a clutch of clubs who had considered Calvert‑Lewin, scorer of three goals last season, but they decided he was too injury‑prone.The Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz had ranked high on Farke’s attacking shortlist but, providing Calvert‑Lewin’s medical proceeds as planned, Leeds seem unlikely to continue that pursuit.Fulham are anxious to retain Muniz but he has recently been the subject of a near-£35m bid from Atalanta and is another option considered by Newcastle as Eddie Howe reshapes his frontline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They wereultimately defeated on penaltiesafter squandering a two-goal lead and their new manager was left to rue an inability to bend the outcome to their will in the shootout.Goals from Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero appeared to have rocket-launched Frank’s tenure before Lee Kang-in and Gonçalo Ramos curtailed the celebrations. But the Dane saw plenty of encouragement in the way his players dominated their star-studded opponents for the first three quarters of the match.Nuno Mendes gets PSG party started in Super Cup shootout win against SpursRead more“Very, very proud of the players, the team, the club, the fans,” he said. “I think the players gave everything against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best. I think for 75 to 80 minutes we were perfect, almost ­giving nothing away.”Tottenham were decisively undone when Van de Ven and Mathys Tel missed in the shootout but Frank was in no mood to apportion blame. “It’s down to the smallest of margins, like the flip of a coin,” he said. “I’d like to thank all the players who stepped up, were brave and took responsibility.”Frank had set Spurs up with a back three and placed a heavy emphasis on set pieces, which they practised in the warm-up and deployed effectively for both goals. It recalled some of his best work with Brentford but he said the tactics had been honed specifically to trouble PSG. “It was a special operation,” he said. “In medical terms the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very close to succeeding.”There were signs of a greater flexibility than Spurs had tended to exhibit under Frank’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou. “We showed that we can be adaptable and pragmatic, and we needed to be against a team like PSG,” he said. “The way we wanted to defend, high pressure and low defending, was top, almost perfect, and also the set pieces were very good and dangerous.”A Premier League opener with Burnley awaits on Saturday and, in the meantime, Spurs are attempting to sign the Manchester City forward Savinho and the Crystal Palace ­talisman Eberechi Eze. “We’d like to strengthen the squad, no doubt about that,” Frank said. “We do work very hard to see if we can do that. In general I am very happy with the squad but in any transfer window we try to see if we can make the squad stronger before the window closes.”The PSG manager Luis Enrique praised Lucas Chevalier, the debutant goalkeeper, who replaced the seemingly outbound Gianluigi ­Donnarumma. Chevalier should have done better for Romero’s goal but saved from Van de Ven in the shootout.“He’s shown personality and we want him to integrate with the team immediately,” he said. “Everyone was talking about the situation, his wasn’t easy, but he showed great character.”Explore more on these topicsUefa Super CupTottenham HotspurParis Saint-GermainnewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of traditionalists might not like that.Australia unfazed by England’s aggression before Ashes, says Scott BolandRead more“I’m not suggesting I know the number that will play, but literally we’re trying to send countries bankrupt if we force them to try to play Test cricket. We need to make sure we invest in the right spaces to play Test cricket where it means something, and has jeopardy, and that’s why the Ashes will be as enormous and as profitable as it is because it means something.”But there could be more Test cricket played in Australia, with Greenberg open to playing red-ball matches in Queensland and the Northern Territory during winter.Australia arecurrently hosting South Africain Twenty20s and ODIs in Darwin, Cairns and Mackay. Tests were last played in Darwin and Cairns more than 20 years ago, with Australia hosting Sri Lanka in 2003, then Bangladesh the following year.“I was in Darwin on Sunday night [for the first T20],” Greenberg said. “I went there primarily because it meant a lot to the people of the Northern Territory. They hadn’t had international cricket there for the best part of 17 years. The one thing when you go there at this time of year is you take the one biggest variable away, which is the weather. Great facilities … I can see that [Tests] happening.”Greenberg has also been exploring privatisation of the Big Bash League, noting other T20 competitions around the world are backed by money outside the governing cricket boards. “That will upset some people, and it will set the hares racing and potentially of people debating the merits,” he said.“It would be completely naive of us sitting here in Australia to not explore it. I’m not suggesting that we’re going to do it yet. I’m not suggesting there’s been a decision made, and ultimately it won’t just be my decision or Cricket Australia’s decision. It will be the whole of leadership of Australian cricket and it has to be beneficial for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsCricket AustraliaAustralia sportAustralia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Forest want to resolve the issue but will demand assurances Neville will be more careful in his language when discussing Marinakis before confirming he can attend.Neville’s claim in April 2024 that the club were behaving like “a mafia gang” particularly angered Marinakis and led to the owner threatening legal action against Sky. In a statement three months later, the broadcaster said: “Sky Sports have discussed with Gary the language used and its potential to cause offence.” Sky also apologised “for any offence caused”.Neville has not been to Forest since he made those comments. He had been due to be part of Sky’s team there on the final day of last season for the visit of Chelsea but the broadcaster was forced to change its plans at the last minute, afterNeville was denied media accreditation. It used its studios to present coverage of a game that decided the European fate of both clubs.Sky described Forest’s ban as “an unprecedented and unwelcome step”. Neville wrote on social media at the time: “I’ve dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action. Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club.”Two weeks earlier Neville had criticised Marinakis for walking on to the pitch and remonstrating with Forest’s manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, after a 2-2 draw with Leicester. Marinakis said he was frustrated that the injured forward Taiwo Awoniyi had been allowed to play on after colliding with a post. The strikerhad abdominal surgerythe next day.View image in fullscreenEvangelos Marinakis (left) makes his thoughts known to Nottingham Forest’s manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, after May’s game against Leicester.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesNeville described Marinakis’s conduct as “scandalous” and said Nuno should “negotiate his exit” over the way he appeared to have been spoken to by the owner.Neville said the club had acted like a “mafia gang” in issuing astatement that criticised the video assistant refereeStuart Attwell after a 2-0 defeat at Everton. Forest werefined £750,000by the Football Association for “an attack on the integrity of a match official on an unparalleled scale” but, after threatening legal action, secured the apology from Sky.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.London-based Nothing’s latest gadget is a set of over-ear headphones that throws out the dull design norms of noise-cancelling cans for an attention-attracting look that is a cross between a 1980s Walkman and Doctor Who’s Cybermen.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The large, semi-transparent cans are certainly a statement piece on your head, with an outer design covered in details, dot-matrix print and physical buttons, but sadly stopping short of theflashing LEDs of the company’s phones.The unconventional design has a rather more conventional price, costing £299 and landing the Headphone 1 in competition with the very best noise-cancelling headphones from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser and myriad others.View image in fullscreenThe various dots and details visible through the transparent plastic shell are purely cosmetic.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe eye-catching transparent plastic ovals protrude from smooth aluminium squircles to form the ear cups, which are attached to the headband by black steel arms that rotate and tilt to adjust the fit.The headphones are relatively heavy at 329g, but have a well-judged clamping force that keeps them secure on your head without too much pressure. The ear cushions are slim and quite comfortable, if a bit sweaty on warmer days. But the padding on the headband is a little too thin and can create a sore spot on your head after a few hours of listening.The right ear cup has five buttons and two ports dotted around it. The power switch, USB-C and headphones ports are in the bottom edge, with a dedicatedBluetoothpairing button hidden on the inside edge. A rolling button controls volume and presses in for play and pause or to switch noise-cancelling modes.View image in fullscreenThe roller button and paddle are beautifully tactile, making them easy to identify and control while on your head.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBelow the roller is a paddle that rocks left and right to skip track, fast-forward or rewind. A final button on the outside of the ear cup activates the phone’s voice assistant, but can be customised to other functions such as controlling noise cancelling. It is really nice to have multiple tactile buttons compared with the various touch or single-button controls plaguing most headphones.The battery lasts 30 to 35 hours with noise cancelling, or up to 80 hours with it off, which is in line with the competition and long enough for a week of commuting or any flight. A full charge takes two hours.The headphones support Bluetooth 5.3 and can connect to two devices simultaneously. They also have a standard 3.5mm headphones socket and can play audio over USB-C, which is handy for wired listening with a phone.SpecificationsWeight:329gDimensions:189.3 x 173.9 x 78mmDrivers:40mmConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging and audioBluetooth codecs:SBC, AAC, LDACRated battery life:35 hours ANC onSound by KEF, noise cancelling by NothingView image in fullscreenThe memory-foam ear cushions are quite thin but comfortable and provide a good seal for the sound.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianNothing partnered withthe storied British speaker maker KEFfor the audio tuning of the Headphone 1, resulting in some great-sounding headphones. They have a fairly bassy profile, with plenty of punch in the low end without drowning out the mids and high tones. They produce a relatively wide soundstage with solid detail and separation of tones.But they sound best with noise cancelling turned off. Switch it on and they sound narrower and a bit muted in some more complex tracks, lacking a bit of punch here and there. They won’t trouble the very best in the market for high-end nuance but they sound good for general listening across a range of genres.The noise cancelling is similar: reasonably effective but some way behind the best in class. It can handle rumbles and other lower end tones reasonably well. But it really struggles with higher tones such as voices, which are clearly audible even with noise cancelling set to maximum, making them a poor choice for trying to focus in an office or cafe.The transparency mode sounds clear and natural but is a bit too loud, increasing the volume of world around you unnecessarily. It is great for awareness, but can overwhelm the music. Call quality is good, coming through nice and clear in quiet or noisy street environments.The excellent Nothing X appon AndroidoriPhonehandles settings, updates and has a full equaliser. It can be used to turn on some good spatial audio with or without head tracking to add a bit of space and realism for movies.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe physical switch for power feels good next to the USB-C and 3.5mm headphones ports.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones aregenerally repairablewith replacement ear cushions available from customer service, but they are not made with any recycled materials.PriceThe Nothing Headphone 1 cost£299(€299/$299/A$549) and come in white or black.For comparison, theSony WH-1000XM6cost£399, theBose QuietComfort Ultracost£350, theSonos Acecost£399, theBeats Studio Procost£350, theSennheiser Momentum 4 Wirelesscost£199and theFairbuds XLcost£219.VerdictThe NothingHeadphones1 stand out above the very samey-looking crowd of noise-cancelling headphones. But that overt design draws more attention on the street than I would like, particularly in white as tested.They do sound pretty good, but their noise-cancelling performance falls short of rivals’ at this price. As does the comfort with the headband lacking enough padding for really long listening sessions.Solid battery life, great connectivity and a quality app make the headphones easy to live with. It is nice to have multiple physical buttons for the playback and other controls too.At £300 or equivalent you can easily get a better combination of sound, noise cancelling and comfort from leading rivals. That means, even more sothan with the company’s phones, you have to really want something to make you look different to choose these headphones.Pros:standout design, great button controls, good sound, noise cancelling, good app for Android and iPhone, good spatial audio, 3.5mm and USB-C audio, Bluetooth multipoint, decent case.Cons:headband padding a bit thin, relatively heavy, do not fold up for travel, average noise cancelling, attract quite a lot of attention, expensive.View image in fullscreenThe headphones rotate to flat but do not fold up for storage and travel, making their case relatively large.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Finlay said the government should urgently establish new legislative guardrails.“Bias testing and auditing, ensuring proper human oversight review, you [do] need those variety of different measures in place,” she said.AI and misinformation in crosshairs of Labor’s review of its landslide election winRead moreThere is growing evidence that there is bias in AI tools in Australia andoverseas, in areas such as medicine and job recruitment.An Australian studypublished in May found job candidates being interviewed by AI recruiters risked being discriminated against if they spoke with an accent or were living with a disability.Ananda-Rajah,who wasa medical doctor and researcher in AI before entering parliament, said it was important for AI tools to be trained on Australian data, or risk perpetuating overseas biases.While the government has stressed the need for protecting intellectual property, she warned that not opening up domestic data would mean Australia would be “forever renting [AI] models from tech behemoths overseas” with no oversight or insight into their models or platforms.“AI must be trained on as much data as possible from as wide a population as possible or it will amplify biases, potentially harming the very people it is meant to serve,” Ananda-Rajah said.“We need to free our own data in order to train the models so that they better represent us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But here we are, absorbing astory from the New York Timesthis week in which Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are discovered to have been running a private school out of their compound in Palo Alto, California, in violation of city zoning laws. More pertinently, the school of 14 kids, which includes two of the couple’s three daughters, is less than a mile from the school for low-income families that the couple founded in 2016. Guess which school the world’s second-richest man and his wife are shutting down?Say the word “zoning infraction” to a certain stripe of American and the effect is equal to using “queue jumper” on a Briton, but of course the broader point here isn’t one about permits. (A spokesperson for Zuckerberg and Chan told the newspaper that the family was unaware about the zoning laws and that the private school, or “pod of home schoolers” as they put it, is now moving to another location.) It is, rather, about Zuckerberg’s perceived retreat from progressive social causes, starting with the shuttering of the school and ending with the announcement in May this year that the pair’s charitable foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), will bepulling fundingfrom almost all the affordable housing and homeless charities it supports in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as slashing diversity programmes.Officially, the reason for these changes is that after a decade spent learning the ropes of effective philanthropy, CZI has decided that its money is best allocated to science and medical funding. Unofficially, of course, the switch from amission statementabout “advancing human potential and promoting equality” to a foundation that now calls itself a “science-first philanthropy” seems in keeping with more localised changes in the Zuckerberg household. Namely: the Meta head’s swing from the kind of guy who, during the Biden administration, might have worn a This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T-shirt, to his Trump-era guise as someone who goes on Joe Rogan to argue for more “masculine energy” in the workplace and appoints aTrump allyto the Meta board.Zuckerberg’s politics are clearly as flexible as the next tech leader’s, but I suspect there are other things in play here, too. Unlike science research, the specimens in philanthropy-funded social experiments have a nasty habit of talking back. In 2010, when Zuckerberg gave $100m to overhaul the Newark public school system, some educatorscalled him outfor what they saw as the application of startup values and glib quick fixes – charter schools, anyone? More “parental choice”? – to the vast, interlinked challenges of the US’s struggling public school system. You can imagine how this might have gone down at HQ. We’re trying to help them; why are they giving us shit? Why aren’t these nobodies tugging their forelocks like a billionaire at an autocrat’s inauguration?Another thing about billionaires: they get bored very quickly. One of the alleged reasons that Zuckerberg and Chan are shutting their charitable school in East Palo Alto, is that,reportedly, Chan was frustrated by the slow pace of progress. It is baffling, isn’t it, given the geniuses involved; and yet these kids seem determined to stay poor and not get into Harvard. The rock-solid certainty among certain tech leaders that their skills are infinitely transferable is, however, a hard one to unseat. Consider theBezos Day 1 Academies Fund, in which the world’s third-richest man promises to “operate a network of tuition-free, Montessori-inspired preschools in under-resourced communities”, rather than, say, compel his $2.36tn company to pay itsfair share of taxesto fund state education coffers.Meanwhile, back in the Zuckerbergs’ Crescent Park community, things are getting a bit tense. In an area popular with Stanford professors, the Zuckerbergs bought 11 properties, turned them into a compound, and like low-rent oligarchs in Holland Park, west London, promptly put in a pickleball court and dug out the basement. Years of noise, construction and traffic from the school – oh, boy, were neighbours ready when the New York Times reporter came calling. “No neighbourhood wants to be occupied,”said one, whose home is surrounded on three sides by Zuckerberg properties. “But that’s exactly what they’ve done. They’ve occupied our neighbourhood.” Substitute “neighbourhood” for “world” and he’s summed it up nicely.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMark ZuckerbergOpinionMetaPhilanthropyCaliforniaWest CoastcommentShareReuse this content"

The more time I spent with them, the more I learned about the darker side of their mobiles’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 13 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.23 EDTShareThis started as a project with my daughter and her friends, who are all part of the smartphone generation. They were 14 years old at the time and I wanted to learn more about the relationship they had with their mobile phones. In 2022,a study by Ofcomshowed that nine out of 10 children owned one by the time they reached the age of 11, and that 91% of them used video platforms, messaging apps and social media by the age of 12. I spoke to my daughter and her friends about how they use their phones and the negative reputation that surrounds teenagers and their screens. They told me the positives as well as the negatives, such as how social media can raise confidence as well as knock it down.I asked if I could photograph them. There was very little direction from me and – rather than photographing them in a controlled portraiture style, as I would usually have done – I simply observed them doing their thing. The energy was high: they moved so fast, dancing to short music reels, filming each other, laughing, scrolling, chatting, taking selfies, and back to makingTikTokdances again. It was so hectic, I struggled to keep up. This image,calledTikTok, came out of that session. I found this composition and asked Lucy to quickly look up at me. I had about two seconds before the moment was broken and they moved on to the next thing. As a portrait photographer, you get a feeling about certain shots, and I knew this was the one.They moved so fast – dancing to music reels, filming each other, laughing, taking selfies – that I struggled to keep upBack in the edit, I reflected on how the girls use their phones as a form of visual communication, or as the theoristNathan Jurgenson calls it, “social photography”. This means the result of the photograph is social, rather than an object as it would be in traditional photography. Social photography is less about making a document or archive, and more about taking a picture or video and sharing it, basically having a visual conversation.‘Pics or it didn’t happen’ – the mantra of the Instagram eraRead moreThe more time I spent with the girls, the more I learned about the darker side of their phones – the sexism and misogyny online. I shared the project as a work-in-progress exhibition in Oxford, and I worked closely with other focus groups of teenage girls who shared their experiences of online sexism and sexual harassment. I was shocked at some of the things I learned. The final project includes photographs of their handwritten testimonials.To further my research, I was reading activistsLaura BatesandSoma Sara’s work – and the original title of the project was No Big Deal, informed by Sara, who says sexual harassment happens so often it becomes seen as “no big deal”. But as the project progressed, I changed it to Once a Slag, which refers to a TikTok soundbite my daughter played to me. The acceptance and ownership of the lyrics made me feel protective and frustrated as a mother and feminist. It’s not a comfortable title, but the shock factor is important to get attention and raise awareness.‘No smartphones before 14; no social media until 16’: The Anxious Generation author on how to fight back against big techRead moreThis photograph has many layers, but it’s also striking. It is beautiful and alluring and I think it has captured a wonderful moment. It’s a celebration of the joy of girlhood, and of a group of girls in their own world. And just like social photography, these teenage years are ephemeral. In this image they are having so much fun together – it’s so important to capture this confidence in a safe place.This image has also made me very conscious of the triangle of three gazes: Lucy gazing at the viewer, performing for the camera but also confronting the viewer with that look, that attitude. Then my gaze as the mother and the photographer – which changes the more research I do on the subject. Then the gaze of the viewer, who might be transported back in time to their own teenage years. I find the tension between these really challenging with this subject matter.The girls in the image are now 17. A lot has come out since it was made. People such as Andrew Tate have become widely known – even though the kids knew all about him years before us adults did – and more recently the Netflix series Adolescence prompted wide debate.This week a mum got in touch with me and said: “I need to talk to you about short skirts.” Where I sit as a mum, and where I sit as a woman, are often totally at odds. As a mum, instinctively, you want to be protective. But if you zoom out of it, why should a woman not wear what she wants? Unfortunately, young women today are at risk, just by having a phone. That’s the world we don’t know as parents today.Philippa James’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philippa JamesBorn:Bath, 1978TrainedBA in art and moving image at Maidstone, Kent (2000); MA in photography at Falmouth (2023)Influences“Rineke Dijkstra,Miranda July, Lynne Ramsay, Tracey Emin, Abigail Heyman,Cindy Sherman, Samantha Morton, Catherine McCormack, the filmShort Cuts by Robert Altman, andLisa Taddeo’s book Three Women.”High point“Being selected last year for the Taylor Wessing portrait prize and exhibiting at the National Portrait Gallery.

I had spent an excruciating week resolutely not looking at my phone, part of a month-long effort to whittle my daily screen time down from more than four hours a day to less than an hour, with the hope of improving my mental wellbeing (and possibly carving out a career as an inspirational speaker). But my efforts felt futile without being able to post evidence online about how offline I had become. I frantically Googled how to retrieve notifications (you cannot) and – briefly – considered re-creating my screen time report in Photoshop.Over the past decade or two, my efforts at self-improvement have taken various forms: the year where I read 105 books; the period during which I gave up all forms of sugar including, misguidedly, fruit; and a dalliance with shamanism that, I’m sorry to say, included interpretive dance. Some might suggest I would be better off learning to cook, or drive, or type with more than one finger, but they can’t reach me because I no longer look at my phone.View image in fullscreenTrading one obsession for another … Joe Stone in Kefalonia.Photograph: Courtesy of Joe Stone“Project Screen Time” began after I listened to a podcast in which a comedian claimed that you shouldn’t look at social media within two hours of waking up, becauseit messes with your dopamine, or something. This is my favourite kind of advice: uncited, from the mouth of a layperson who can’t remember how they acquired it. But I gave up opening Instagram first thing in the morning and … it worked. Miraculously, choosing not to sandblast my brain with pictures of other people’s abs before I was fully conscious did improve my mood. Even better, I found that if I didn’t look at my socials first thing, I could often resist until after lunch. As is typically the case when I embark on a new regime, this brief moment of clarity quickly became a frenzy.I traded one obsession (looking at my phone) for another (not looking at it). In my second week, I was down to two hours of screen time a day. By my third, it was an hour and a half – and I became determined to get it below 60 minutes. Part of me was impressed that I could appear normal while quietly (nobly?) wielding this superpower. However, I was unable to keep my gift a secret. I soon began boring friends, acquaintances and service workers with tales of my herculean discipline.Before long, my quest was disrupting my day in new ways. I resented having to open Maps on my phone, so I found myself getting lost while cycling to appointments. If I wanted to show someone a picture or a meme, I would ask to Google it on their phone, rather than my own. I refused to order Ubers after nights out (the painstaking process of watching a cab crawl towards my location while the minutes of screen time racked up was torturous) and instead offered to transfer the money (later, on my laptop) to whoever did.I pick up my phone 111 times a day – it doesn’t matter how much time we spend on it | Blake MontgomeryRead moreI became increasingly frustrated that my screen time wasn’t lower. I would get to 2pm having barely glanced at my phone and yet the data would claim I had used it for 36 minutes. I began to think conspiratorially. My screen time was displayed in a graph split into blue (social), turquoise (entertainment) and orange (productivity and finance). But the vast majority of the chart was made up of undelineated grey. What was the grey?!Eventually, screen time was added to the list of subjects (including the music and lore ofTaylor Swiftand my attraction toRon DeSantis) that I was forbidden from discussing at home. My lowest point arrived as I was showing a friend my weekly stats, which gives you a breakdown of how long you’ve spent on each app. He queried why “Settings” was my third most-used application – and I had to admit it was because that was how I compulsively checked my screen time.My tantrum over being unable to memorialise my lowest-ever screen report (51 minutes a day!) was a wake-up call; reducing my screen time had become its own form of phone addiction. Rather than escaping the need to seek validation from strangers online, I had happened upon a new way to earn their approval. But all was not lost. The realisation nudged me towards acceptance that I will probably never be a moderate person; I can’t rely on any form of self-regulation (my latest regime – skincare – revolves around an LED mask that automatically switches off after 10 minutes, otherwise I fear I would be wearing it to the office like a DayGlo Hannibal Lecter).In the end, I stopped trying to recapture my screen-time report, instead screenshotting the less aesthetic chart in my settings to post online. Within minutes, DMs flooded in from people congratulating me on my self-restraint and asking how I had managed to quit my phone. I replied to them all, dopamine flooding my brain’s starved reward centre. That day, my screen time was three hours and 36 minutes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For hours at a time, I trundle along the photorealistic landscapes in my pick-up truck, delivering parcels to isolated communities and building new roads. The only reason I complete the main story missions is to open new areas of the map so that I can meet new people and build more roads. I find it blissfully enjoyable.Of course, I am far from alone in playing video games this way. “Cosy games” have becomea thriving cottage industryover the past five years, led by crossover successes such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley and Untitled Goose Game, but also housing hundreds of smaller titles that appeal to highly engaged communities. On Steam this month you’ll discoverCatto’s Post Office, a delightful game about a feline postal worker, Fruitbus, a cute food truck management sim, MakeRoom, an interior design challenge, and Tiny Bookshop, which is about running … a tiny bookshop. Most of these games are united by the same elements: small teams, often young, often working remotely; short play spans; low-stakes challenges; and highly stylised visuals, as an aesthetic choice and an economic necessity.But why, if the audience for cosy games has been firmly established, aren’t there more lavish mainstream, triple-A examples? It’s clear producers such as Ubisoft, EA and Xbox are finding it tough to come up with fresh ideas – that’s why they’ve all spent (wasted) many millions trying to make the next identikit live service shooter to compete with Fortnite. So why not, I don’t know, try to make a big open-world adventure based around positive interactions and soft drama? The TV, film and book industries are crammed with this sort of stuff. Where is my video game version of Call the Midwife? Why can’t I ride a bicycle around 1950s east London delivering babies while faintly patronising decent working folk? Where is the video game equivalent of Downton Abbey or Gilmore Girls?View image in fullscreenHorribly charming … Untitled Goose Game.Photograph: House HouseOf course, I understand the most obvious answers. Like Hollywood, mainstream game development is largely based on minimising risk, and since the dominant cultural strand has always been action, violence and power fantasy, we inevitably end up where we are: with a thousand different combat adventures and not a single big-budget game about the love lives of a witty single mum and her sometimes exasperating daughter. But when we start to talk about culture rather than money, other factors come into play. “I think cosy gamers are a nuanced audience that values stories and mechanics over visual fidelity,” says Moo Yu, creative director at small studioTeam Artichoke, which is making an adorable anti-capitalist puzzle game named Mythmatch. “While I do think big-budget cosy games are absolutely going to be developed, it is an audience that isn’t begging for one and is capable of appreciating a wider range of experiences at a wider range of price points.”This is an important detail – high-end visuals and vast open worlds aren’t necessarily the prize goal, they’re just one aesthetic and immersive option.Untitled Goose Gamewould perhaps not have been so amusing if the lovely village had been photorealistic and the horrible goose constructed from 100,000 texture-mapped polygons. Stardew Valley is beautifulbecauseit resembles a vividly colourful retro game, not despite it. Art is not just about slavish reproduction, thank goodness. Part of the cosiness of the cosy genre is the restriction of both choice and outcome; the game takes your hand and says come this way, you are safe.View image in fullscreenCommunity over authority … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeMy lifelong friend Jon Cartwright is a veteran game developer who mentors small studios in Australia and New Zealand. When I emailed him about all this he replied: “When I think of a cosy game, I think of limited scope/size. And that’s been a function of them broadly being developed by smaller indie teams with limited budgets. But I think with the overload of … well,everythinggoing on in the world, and especially during the stress of Covid, having a small, safe environment with low stakes gameplay was a really untapped market. The fact that the visuals were ‘simple’ was another source of comfort and charm.”Charm is hard to replicate – it won’t materialise because you’ve developed an expensive new graphics engine, or because you have 500 staff working on it for 18 hours a day. You can’t build hi-tech charm centres in the desert. Itcanhappen in big games, just like it can in big TV dramas, but it’s a limited and unstable commodity. And in fact, the whole notion of the cosy game as an identifiable genre or deliberate play metric is still relatively young; games for so long, were mostly about winning. The verbs and adjectives of games about being nice to people have yet to be formalised. There’s a hoary old cliche that games are the opposite of film because explosions are cheap but a closeup shot of a human face showing emotion is wildly expensive. You could say that, in an interactive medium with historically limited visual naturalism, it’s been easier to create drama through having someone shoot at you than ask you on a date. But we have a hundred years of animation history to show us how charm, cosiness and emotional intimacy can be drawn from the most symbolic and stylised palettes.Moo Yu is certain that mainstream, naturalistic cosy epics will happen – in fact, he cites the fashion-focused role-playing gameInfinity Nikkias an example. Until then, I will be in Death Stranding 2, having to fake care about chiral contamination and extinction entities just so I can rescue kangaroos, visit inventors and drive my truck through irradiated landscapes of considerable beauty. Sometimes you have to play their game to win your own.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro shooter … Operation Night Strikers.Photograph: Taito/M2August is proving a spectacular month for retro arcade collections and I cannot resist recommending one more before I regretfully return to the 21st century.Operation Night Strikersis a collection offour acclaimed Taito shootersfrom the late-1980s including the seminal light gun blaster Operation Wolf, essentially an interactive combination of the action flicks Rambo and Commando. Also here are its decent sequel Operation Thunderbolt, plus two lesser-known greats – cyberpunk flying car shooter Night Striker and Space Gun, a frenetic take on Aliens, complete with face huggers and flame throwers. As usual for modern collections, save functions have been added, and if you get the Switch version, you can use your JoyCon as a makeshift light gun. It’s not very accurate, but it’ll remind veteran arcade dwellers of using Operation Wolf’s original mounted Uzi gun controller.These colourful, fast and ridiculous popcorn games perfectly capture the spirit of the era, with their smooth scrolling 2D backdrops, banging electro-pop soundtracks and monosyllabic, muscle-bound heroes.

How does it impact other publishers?”Well, put it this way: no major games company is going to be putting up its big hope for 2026 in the same launch window as Rockstar’s long-awaited behemoth. When the game was originally slated for a late 2025 launch, three triple-A developerstold industry newsletter the Game Businessthey were giving it a wide berth. This can be hugely disruptive to development teams who may have spent years planning for a specific release slot – it can also create a media and marketing black hole, where for a few weeks, no one is interested in anything else.However, it’s not all bad. WhenGTA Varrived in 2013, it didn’t destroy everything in its path – casual mobile games such asPuzzle & DragonsandCandy Crushdid fine, as did titles with dedicated fanbases such asWorld of WarcraftandCall of Duty. Also, a massive hit like GTA brings wider attention, interest and potentially investment to the whole industry, and there is plenty of money to be made from releasing similar titles in the wake of the original – Grand Theft Auto spawned a whole genre of gangland adventures fromSaints RowtoSleeping Dogs, while also lending innovative new design features to the entire market (GTA Online was, after all, the original live service experiment).So yes, it’s healthy. Kind of. The immediate financial shock can be challenging for other studios, but GTA V showed that casual gamers and dedicated fans of other franchises didn’t abandon everything and flock to Rockstar. Furthermore, the aftermath of a spectacular success can open new opportunities. After all, before Star Wars, no Hollywood studio would have touched a big budget sci-fi flick, but in the following years, we got Alien, Blade Runner, The Thing and the Star Trek movies. Success is inspiring – even when it happens to our rivals.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterDeath StrandingMinecraftCall The MidwifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ever since the Edo period, Japanese summertime has been associated with the arrival of supernatural forces – a season defined by malevolent spirits. As the country’s temperatures soar, it’s believed that the barriers separating the world of the living and the dead begin to wane, allowing once contained ghosts to slither into our realm.It’s under this sweaty backdrop that I find myself wandering Silent Hill f’s fog-laden Japan. Set in the fictional town of Ebisugaoka during the 1960s, players are put into the dust-coated shoes of a misunderstood teenage girl named Hinako. Summer or no, Hinako’s tale begins in suitably bleak fashion. Fleeing her drunk and abusive father, Hinako miserably roams the intricately rendered streets of her rural home town. Failing to live up to the lofty standards set by her impossibly beautiful older sister, Hinako finds herself teased by classmates – lost, and struggling to understand her place in society.“Gender is a big part of the story,” teases series producer Motoi Okamoto. “We can’t really elaborate too much but the 1960s was when the women’s rights movements started to take form in Japan … So this plays a major role in why we decided to go with the time period.”View image in fullscreenSilent Hill f.Photograph: KonamiDespite the town’s inevitably eerie nature, Ebisugaoka is an utterly gorgeous virtual locale. As I roam its near-deserted streets, I can’t help but peer into every cobbled corner, slide open each translucent bamboo door, and examine the lavish detail of every Inari shrine. It’s a refreshing change from the Japan usually depicted in games – either a neon-drenched Tokyo or ye olde samurai epic.“Horror games from Japan – and based in Japan – have not seen major releases over the last decade,” says Okamoto. “Silent Hill has always been a marriage between western horror and Japanese-style horror, but as time progressed, we believed that the Japanese essence was starting to wane. So with Silent Hill f, we decided that we wanted to infuse the Japanese themes more strongly.”It’s not long before the town’s unsettling beauty gives way to outright horror. As a plume of fog descends on Ebisugaoka, puppet-esque beings pursue Hinako, strikingly beautiful red plant-like tendrils rising up from the soil. These crimson flowers can attach to your legs during combat, tethering you helplessly to the floor as the mannequin-esque monstrosities judder menacingly towards you.View image in fullscreenDust-coated … Silent Hill f.Photograph: KonamiIn keeping with the setting, there are no firearms in Silent Hill f. Instead, Hinako defends herself with whatever weapons she can muster – namely daggers, baseball bats and scythes. Tense melee combat is the order of the day. Perfectly timed dodges and counters replenish Hinako’s stamina, allowing her to land a follow-up attack, resulting in a surprisingly Dark-Souls-esque survival horror.“One of the first things that I had in mind going into this game was I wanted to incorporate more action,” says Okamoto. “But of course, since this is a horror game, we can’t lean entirely on the action. We also needed to have those tense moments in between … I think we’ve managed to strike a fairly delicate balance.”Initially, I’m not so convinced. For the first hour, combat in Silent Hill F feels gruelling and sluggish. Each dodge and hard-won hit is slow and imprecise, resulting in some baffling early deaths. Yet where early battles frustrate, I slowly warm to the tense melee, eventually clicking with its considered cadence. While the inconsistent difficulty in this preview build could use a pre-release tweak – one late demo boss saw me suddenly dying upwards of 30 times – the scrappy combat fits survival horror surprisingly well.View image in fullscreenStress built into its systems … Silent Hill f.Photograph: Konami“A lot of people say they really enjoy being scared by horror games, but I think what they actually mean is that they enjoy the tension,” says Al Yang, game director at the studio developing the game with Konami, NeoBards. “The fear of the unknown is one thing, but jump scares constantly? That’s going to get very old, very fast.”Instead, Silent Hill f has stress built into its every system. In a Lovecraftian touch, players must pay attention to their sanity meter, leaving offerings at shrines to restore Hinako’s mental stability. “You need to know how close your candle is to going out, toreallyhave it feel tense,” adds Yang. “You can see the durability of your weapons … you’re very aware of your own limitations, of how close you are to dying – or running out of resources – andthatis what creates tension.”Where the early hours see you navigating labyrinthine alleyways, tightly knit streets soon give way to foggy rice fields and eerily abandoned farmhouses. Yet for all Ebisugaoka’s horrifying monstrosities, there’s a refreshingly human yarn at Silent Hill f’s heart. As Hinako searches for her friends while the town goes to hell, flashbacks and believable conversations keep you invested in her past, present and future. As with previous entries, there’s a dreamlike quality to every encounter, leaving you unsure which interactions are real, yet the beautifully realised 60s setting consistently grounds things.“When it comes to exploring time periods, if you go too far back, it becomes so detached from our familiar reality that it basically borders on fantasy,” says Silent Hill f’s script writer, Ryukishi07 about the 60s setting. “Whereas the present is too grounded in reality … so there’s really no room for interpretation. It’s why I’ve always [enjoyed] the possibilities that arise from the period in between the past and present –that’swhere fantasy and reality intersect.”It feels fitting to be playing a new Silent Hill during Japan’s equivalent of Halloween. For years, this was a series that seemed dead and buried – but now, like the spirits crossing into Japan, Silent Hill lives again.“When I became involved with Silent Hill, my plan was that we cannot just have one remake and let that be the end,” says Okamoto. “We could have just brought the old fans back and had a nostalgic get together – but I wanted there to be some kind of progression. I think fans can have more faith that Silent Hill has made a comeback … and that things will keep coming.”Silent Hill f is released onPC, PS5 and Xbox, 25 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that’s not all that’s going onWed 13 Aug 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 15.06 EDTShareIn a dangerous new escalation of his authoritarian rule,Donald Trumphas placed the police ofWashington DCunder federal control and announced that he will deploy the national guard to the country’s capital. According to the president, crime in the city is “out of control” – no matter thatcrime numbersare down significantly, including for violent crimes. But, of course, this power grab is not really about facts, it is about distraction and perception, and a chance to reconnect and refocus his base.Like all the other outrageous things Trump has been doing in the last weeks, the DC takeover is, first and foremost, an attempt to deflect from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Aspreviously demonstratedby his demand to rename the NFL team to the (racist) Washington Redskins, his attacks on the Wall Street Journal, or his calls to prosecute former president Barack Obama (“Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him?”) that he will do anything to get the Epstein case out of the political and public debate.But it is not just a deflection, it is also an attempt to bring the attention of his base back to the core of their bond with Trump, namely authoritarianism and nativism (which are, as always with the far right, closely connected). There is a clear pattern in the cities Trump links to disorder and violence. Cities like Baltimore, DC and Oakland are broadly identified as Black cities in the US, while cities like Los Angeles (Hispanic) and New York (the quintessential melting pot) are also often excluded from the “real” America in rightwing narratives.Of course, in the racist mind, Black and multiracial is connected to crime, danger, disorder – as are “the city” and “urban” centers (both deeply racialized concepts in the US). This racist fear and rejection of the multiracial city has a very long history in the country, but also for Trump himself too. Just remember his response to the infamousCentral Park Five, a multiracial group of teenagers accused of raping a white female jogger in 1989. Before the facts were known, Trump published an open letter in four local newspapers, in which he described New York City as a city out of control, called for the teenage boys to be “executed”, and demanded that the city’s leaders “Bring back the death penalty. Bring back our police.” Attacks on multiracial cities were also a major part of his deeply racist 2024 campaign. For example, he claimed that Philadelphia was “ravaged by bloodshed”, and comparedDetroitto a developing country.Trump’s aversion for multiracial cities was undoubtedly strengthened by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, which were successfully “vilified” in the rightwing media – today, only22%of Republicans support the BLM movement, compared to 84% of Democrats. Moreover, multiracial cities vote disproportionately for the Democrats, which is another sore point. And it is another crucial aspect of Trump’s authoritarian power grab.By targeting multiracial cities like DC and Los Angeles, Trump not only plays into the widespread racist association of these cities with crime and violence, but he also strengthens the belief that these “Democrat-run cities” are “out of control”. The message to his base is clear: Democratic rule in the (Black) cities is “weak” and endangers the (white) “Heartland” – all, of course, ultimately linked to the alleged “open border” policies of former president Joe Biden.Finally, the power grab is part of a broader agenda to create a deeply authoritarian and personalized state, in which the monopoly of violence rests exclusively in the hands of Trump. If implemented, thenew budgetwill transform the US into a deportation state, centered around the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and itsImmigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which is increasingly operating as a presidential militia that is not justabove the lawbut alsoabove otherlaw enforcement and even military agencies.It is crucial that liberal democratic actors take this authoritarian power grab seriously – without letting it distract them, or the wider public, from the Epstein case. As long as the courts still work, at least to some extent, the Trump administration should be challenged in court – despiteinitial setbacks, the court case over Trump’s power grab in California remains open. Media have a responsibility to inform the public of the real facts, includingreal-time factcheckingof Trump speeches.But, most importantly, media and politics must stop treating the various actions as “incidents” and connect the dots – for themselves and for the broader public. While each individual action might not be anti-democratic, they are all connected andtogetherconstitute a clear and consistent attack on democracy. And while all the institutions still stand, they represent less and less the liberal democratic values they were founded on.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

That’s why fascist leaders have constantly demanded that their populations venerate all violence performed in the service of the state and revere the apparatuses of state violence, such as police forces and the military. In this scenario, state violence is not only necessary for the nation’s survival. State violence is understood as even beautiful, something the public can and must believe in.Buying into state violence this way produces something historian Robert Paxton has called a “mobilizing passion”. In his book The Anatomy of Fascism,Paxton described how “the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will” is produced and then mobilized by fascists by creating “a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of traditional solutions”. In other words, there’s always a grave, existential threat lurking around every corner, and only fascist violence can restore order to a lawless world. To the fascist, as Umberto Eco once put it, “life is a permanent war”.Enter Donald Trump. Whether it’s anexistential threat of “wokeness”run amok in American universities, or theextraordinary dangerof unauthorized immigrants picking our vegetables, Trump is prepared to battle everyone and everything, including his own windmills, to restore the country to some illusory past glory that we are all supposed to believe in, and be willing to sacrifice ourselves for.But the sad truth is that many, if not most, of Trump’s justifications for his policies, are unsurprisingly based on bald-faced lies or gross exaggerations simply to further his pursuit of absolute power. Yet it doesn’t seem to matter. With each new announcement, Trump continues to prove how excellent he is at crafting the illusion of problems where there basically are none and leading his followers down an often-violent path of retribution. (Remember January 6, DC’smost violent dayin recent history?) By doing so, he seeks to constantly expand his authority while also deflecting from all the substantial problems that are staring him in the face. And these problems are not insignificant. Think of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal or the continuation of global conflicts that he promised months ago he would uniquely be able to end.The federal takeover of theWashington DCpolice department, announced with loud fanfare by Trump on Monday, is the latest example of this phenomenon. About 800 national guard troops will be deployed in the nation’s capital because, according to the president, “our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs, and homeless people.”This does sound rather frightening. Fortunately, it’s not true. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to matter.First, the facts. Crime in DC is at historic lows. “Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years,” the justice departmentannouncedearlier this year. And crime numbers for 2025 are even better, substantially lower than 2024. Violent crime in 2025 isdown 26%compared with 2024.The DC council understands this. The council responded to Trump’s announcement with an angry jointstatement: “This is a manufactured intrusion on local authority. Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we’ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the DC police is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency. Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard’s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.”Such facts ought to matter. So why don’t they to Trump?Facts don’t matter for Trump because facts have always operated as nothing more than an inconvenience for him. Just ask Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She was recentlyfiredby Trump after accurately reporting employment statistics, and those specific numbers contradicted Trump and his policies. But with every new policy enacted by this administration, Trump’s fact-free worldview becomes a lot more worrisome.That’s true for this policy, too. Owing to its historically limited autonomy, the District of Columbia is governed differently than other parts of the county. And under the Home Rule Act of 1973,the federal government can take over its policing functions for a period of 30 days. Congress would probably then have to extend that time limit if needed. But to think that Trump is focused on federal policing authority solely to deploy it to Washington DC is to also believe thatDonald Trumphas never seen a spray tan machine.Hereis Trump: “We have other cities also that are bad, very bad,” he said at his press conference. “You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York is a problem. And then you have of course Baltimore and Oakland. We don’t even mention that any more, they’re so far gone. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to lose our cities over this. And this will go further. We’re starting very strongly with DC.”Now, here are the facts. InChicago, homicides are down 33% in 2025.Los Angeleshad the “lowest homicide total in nearly 60 years” in 2025.New York’s police department is reporting that “from January 2025 through May 2025, New York City experienced the lowest number of shootings and murders in recorded history.” TheBaltimorepolice department has stated that 2025 “continues to see double-digit reductions in gun violence, including a 22% decrease in homicides”. And the Oakland police departmentreportedlast week “that overall crime in Oakland has dropped by 28% in the first six months of 2025” including a 24% decrease in homicides.Donald Trump wants to take over all forms of law enforcement in the United States, from local policing to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency that is now pumped up on budgetary steroids. (Under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill, Ice will now expand to become thelargestfederal law enforcement agency in US history, with abigger budgetthan most nations’ militaries.) Trump’s desire to control all forms of state power, and to expand them beyond belief, is a move straight out of the fascist playbook. And it’s completely dependent on the production of both extraordinary fear and blatant lies.The first way of fighting such an obvious power grab is not to give in to the fear and not to believe the lies. But what is less understood about Trump is that he doesn’t even care if we believe his lies. Like all such leaders, what Trump really wants is just that we no longer believe in the truth. The difference between not believing the lies and believing in the truth may sound slight, but it’s exactly in that distinction where some people are allowed to live and others must die. It’s where democracy is found or democracy is lost. And it’s why holding on to the very concept of truth ultimately matters so much more than just arguing over the lies.Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

That boastrang holloweven before the current war. Now, it’s not evenpretending. On Sunday, Israel openly and brazenlykilledsix journalists as they were sheltering in a tent that housed reporters and media workers.Israelaccusesone of those journalists – Al Jazeera’sAnas al-Sharif– of being aterrorist. It has not said what crime it believes the others have committed that would justify killing them. The laws of war are clear: journalists are civilians. To target them deliberately in war is to commit a war crime.The Guardian view on Anas al-Sharif and Gaza’s journalists: Israel is wiping out the witnesses | EditorialRead moreIt is hardly surprising that Israel believes it can get away with murder. In the two decades preceding 7 October, Israeli forceskilled 20 journalists. No one has ever been held accountable for any of those deaths, including that of the Al Jazeera journalistShireen Abu Akleh, whosekillingin 2022 sent shock waves through the region. Abu Akleh, a dual US-Palestinian citizen, was a household name in the Middle East, just as al-Sharif became a familiar face for audiences for his coverage of Israel’s assault on Gaza.Israel first began makingthreatsagainst al-Sharif shortly after the start of the war. The journalist reported receiving multiple phone calls from officers in the Israeli army instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza, as well as voice notes on WhatsApp disclosing his location. In December 2023, an Israeli airstrike hit his family home, killing the journalist’s 90-year-old father.A year later, the Israeli armyalleged publiclythat Anas al-Sharif was a terrorist – claims itrepeated last monthshortly after Anas al-Sharifexposedthe rampant levels of starvation throughout Gaza as a result of Israel’s refusal to allow in sufficient food aid. AnIsraeli spokesperson accused al-Sharifof lying about thefamine– despite corroboration of widespread starvation by independent and international groups.The Committee to Protect Journalists had seen this playbook from Israel before: apatternin which journalists areaccusedby Israel of being terrorists with no credible evidence. Indeed, we were so concerned that al-Sharif was being targeted that weissueda public statement urging his protection.To date, Israel has provided no independently verifiable evidence that any of the journalists whom it has admitted deliberately targeting were terroristsInstead, al-Sharif was killed alongside his colleagues in an attack that Israel has openly admitted was aimed at killing the journalist. Al-Sharif is the 184th Palestinian journalist to have been killed by Israel since the start of the war and one ofat least 26 journalistswhom CPJ believes to have been deliberately targeted for their work as journalists. The others have certainly been killed by Israel but whether Israel did so in full knowledge they were journalists we have not been able to determine.Israeldeniesit deliberatelytargetsjournalists. But the evidence shows otherwise. To date, Israel has providedno independently verifiable evidencethat any of the journalists whom it has admitted deliberately targeting were terrorists. In one case, that of the Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, the documents producedallegedly showedthat al-Ghoul became the leader of a Hamas battalion – when he was 10 years old. The documents Israel has shared on al-Sharif, which itposted on X, show al-Sharif as receiving a Hamas salary in 2023. The documents do not provide evidence that he was an active member of the terrorist group although Israel said it had “current intelligence” – which it did not publish – indicating al-Sharif was an active Hamas military wing operative.It is no wonder thatIsraelis now so confident about killing journalists that it can admit to killing six journalists and media workers while only one was allegedly its target. The international community has been woeful in its condemnation of Israel’s actions.On Gaza’s killing fields, journalism faces its darkest hour – but that won’t stop us reporting | Asef HamidiRead moreAnd that includes our own journalism community. Whereas the Committee to Protect Journalists received significant offers of support and solidarity when journalists were being killed in Ukraine at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the reaction from international media over the killings of our journalist colleagues in Gaza at the start of the war was muted at best. In some high-profile killings – such as that of the Reuters journalistIssam Abdallah– some governmentstrotted out well-worn defencesof press freedom, but stopped well short of seriously censuring Israel. And few took any concrete steps – such as the halt of arms sales or the suspension of trade agreements – that might have forced Israel to change course.Now, with more than 192 journalists and media workerskilledsince the start of the war – the deadliest conflict for journalists that we have ever documented –condemnationfrom individual journalists and some newsrooms has grown more vocal. But it is hard to see, if Israel can wipe out an entire news crew without the international community so much as batting an eye, what will stop further attacks on reporters.Already our window intoGazawas becoming more and more limited.

Here’s whyArwa MahdawiWhat is really behind the US Department of Energy’s weird pronouncement on social media?Wed 13 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTShareHave you ever tossed and turned at night wondering what the correct pronouns are for a lump of coal? No, me neither. However, it seems someone at the US Department ofEnergyhas devoted a few spare brain cells to this matter and decided that coal is a she/her.Co-opting a phrase adopted by the LGBTQ+ community, the official energy department X account tweeted on 31 July: “She’s an icon. She’s a legend. And she is the moment,” alongside a sparkling picture of coal. This comes as the Trump administration devotes considerable energy to making fossil fuels great again. The president has signednumerous executive ordersaimed at “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and reversedBiden-era pollution regulationson coal-fired power plants. These plants, according to a 2023 report,killed at least 460,000 Americansover the past two decades. Deaths declined when the environmental regulations that Donald Trump isso scornful ofwere put in place.Why is the Trump administration, which seems to thinkwomen are objects, so keen on personifying coal? Is it for poetic effect? Or are they trying to sanitise the deadly impact of coal pollution and associate it with mother nature? I suspect the second motive. Ships, for example,have traditionally been referred to as “she”, possibly because sailors saw them as amaternal protector.Countries can also be classified as female – particularly when a man thinks their violent actions need to be defended. In 2023, shortly after the 7 October attacks, at a time when Gaza was being bombed and blockaded by Israel,Keir Starmersaid Israel had “the right to defendherself”.Then again, sometimes the short answer to why things are unnecessarily gendered is simply “lazy sexism”. For a long time, Atlantic hurricanes were given only female names. When feminists started to challenge this in the 1980s, some peopleargued that stormswould be taken seriously only if they evoked female fury. Years after meteorologists finally changed the policy,a1986 Washington Posteditoriallamented: “Somehow many of the male names don’t convey either the romance or the urgency that circumstances might warrant.” This has been much debated and it’s not clear whether gendering a stormmakes any differenceto public safety. As for the weird social media post gendering coal? It feels like a smokescreen to get people chattering online as the world burns.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Total victories loom largest in the popular imagination because those are the stories nations always tell to sustain patriotic feeling. The fuller version of history is written in stalemates.That is worth remembering whenDonald Trump meets Vladimir Putinin Alaska on Friday. Both leaders have incentives to pretend that Ukraine’s fate can be settled decisively without any Ukrainians at the negotiating table. That doesn’t make it so.For the US president, this is a project of personal vanity. He promised to end the war within days of returning to the White House. The persistence of hostilities seven months after his inauguration is a rebuke to his self-image as the world’s master dealmaker.Putin also once thought the war could be concluded swiftly. He launched his all-out invasion in February 2022 expecting Kyiv to fall within weeks. When Ukrainian resistance thwarted that plan, the Russian president switched to a long game of attrition, relying on superior troop numbers and aerial bombardment to degrade Ukraine’s viability as a sovereign state. Russia’s industrial base and public opinion have been fired up for perpetual war. Kremlin propagandists boast of the nation’s limitless military stamina, while Russian commanders keep promising to break through enemy lines and initiate the long-awaited capitulation.Europe live: EU says Ukraine should be able to ‘choose its own destiny’ ahead of Trump-Putin meetingRead morePutin has to believe in the inevitability of Ukrainian defeat because any other scenario – even a ceasefire that allows him to hold territory captured so far – leaves the historic mission he set himself unfulfilled. He will harbour a vengeful grievance for as long asVolodymyr Zelenskyyis president of a country that is free to arm itself and pursue an independent policy of integration with other European democracies.Any border or treaty that prevents the Kremlin dictating Ukraine’s strategic orientation is illegitimate in Putin’s eyes. That won’t prevent him signing bits of paper as a tactical expedient. The Russian president recognises that he has tested his American counterpart’s patience. He has lost ground to Zelenskyy in the competition to shape Trump’s explanation for why the war persists when he has called for peace.The Ukrainian president has bounced back from histelevised humiliation in the White House in February, when he was harangued for ingratitude and blamed for inciting the invasion of his own country. Deft diplomacy, underwritten by Nato leaders pledging to pay Kyiv’s military bills, bought a sliver of recognition from Trump that maybe things were more complicated than previously thought; thatPutin was prone to “bullshit”; that his professed interest in peace was contradicted by the volume of bombs he kept dropping on Ukrainian civilians.The Alaska powwow is happening because Trump started setting ceasefire deadlines and threatening Moscow with sanctions. Putin needed to offer some affectation of willingness to compromise. He calculated that the spectacle of a summit, combined with some artfully ambiguous signals around “land swaps”, would appeal to Trump’s confidence in his own charisma and his belief that a deal is there for the doing.Putin will use the encounter to frame the conflict in terms that chime with Trump’s warped and historically illiterate reading of the story. It is the version in which a devious, criminal Zelenskyy bamboozles a senescent Joe Biden into throwing away heaps of US treasure on a crazy, losing bet. The war is nearly won anyway, Putin will say. Ukraine cannot prevail, but can sucker its allies into throwing good money after bad. He will outline a future of lucrative commercial relations between two great powers whose potential friendship has been sabotaged by a roguish European province that hardly even counts as a proper country. He will make grotesque territorial claims, covering places not yet conquered by Russian troops, and present this as the bare minimum of a reasonable allocation of land to Moscow. He will insist on Ukrainian “demilitarisation” – in effect guaranteeing the country’s vulnerability to some future incursion – and call it essential for the sake of Russian security. We know these are the demands because Putin has been making them for months. He restated them earlier this month.Trump doesn’t have to fall in a bromantic swoon at Putin’s feet to make the summit a success for Russia. The damage will be done if he emerges from negotiations parroting talking points from the Kremlin script. The fear among Ukraine’s European allies is that he will proudly outline a ceasefire proposal on terms that Zelenskyy cannot possibly accept – an unjust, unworkable partition of his country along lines drawn by the tyrant who invaded it. Putin will then claim that he tried to talk peace and only Ukrainian intransigence prolongs the war.Will Trump and Putin decide the future of Ukraine – podcastRead moreLess bleak scenarios are conceivable. Trump’s newfound scepticism about Putin might withstand corrosion by flattery. The Russian leader’s confidence in an imminent battlefield breakthrough might prove misplaced – a symptom of the brittle, authoritarian ego that only gives audience to sycophants bearing good tidings. He might be overestimating Russia’s economic resilience against sanctions. He might one day find ordinary Russians losing the will to sacrifice a generation of young men for a goal of national redemption that keeps receding over the horizon.When the domestic economic and political incentives change, Putin will get serious about a ceasefire. The task of Ukraine’s allies is to hasten that moment by sustaining maximum military aid to Kyiv and financial pressure on Moscow. Even then, a settlement would realistically leave some Ukrainian land under de facto permanent Russian occupation, behind heavily fortified lines. It will be a stalemate backed with sufficient deterrents to turn a hot war cold. It could end up looking something like the demilitarised zone on the Korean peninsula, separating two sides that are technically still at war, although the armistice was signed in 1953.For now, the challenge for Zelenskyy and his allies is handling a US president who talks about war and peace in terms detached from any moral, historical or strategic context. Trump draws no meaningful distinction between a settlement that allows Ukraine to thrive as an independent state and one that satisfies the appetite of a Russian president bent on conquest. He values two kinds of deal – those that make him richer, and those that allow him to luxuriate in the status of a great dealmaker. If he thinks such benefits are available by abandoning American allies and interests there is no reason to think he wouldn’t do it.That will be Putin’s aim in Alaska. He has no intention of ending the war just because the White House demands it, but he knows he must pretend to want peace. And he knows his best hope of defeating Ukraine is to manipulate Trump into bullying Kyiv towards capitulation, while imagining that his own humiliation at Kremlin hands is some kind of personal victory.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaUkraineEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s tariffs have shattered that complacencyJoseph de WeckThe shockwaves sent by the US president could finally push Switzerland closer to the EUWed 13 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 13.06 EDTShareGrowing up in Zurich often felt like being removed from the world. It shouldn’t be that way: after all,Switzerlandis at the heart of Europe. Riding on the cosy Zurich trams, one hears all the world’s languages; and the airport offers more direct intercontinental flights than Berlin. And yet, coming of age in Switzerland is like sitting in an aquarium looking at the world through a thick bulletproof window.That glass was shattered last week when Donald Trump announced39% tariffson Swiss exports. The US is the most important destination for Swiss products:18.6% of all its exportsgo there. If Trump maintains the tariffs, sales to the US “will be effectively annihilated”, said Switzerland’s industry lobbying group. The rightwing Swiss business minister, Guy Parmelin, announced a furlough programme to shield the economy from “mass layoffs”. The tabloid newspaper Blick captured the mood with a stark black front page, pronouncing it a “black day” for Switzerland.Trump’s tariff shock has provoked a major identity crisis in a country that has grown rich on exports, and done so in splendid isolation from world politics.To understand Switzerland, imagine it as a giant country club. First, you don’t get in there easily: immigration laws are tight, although being rich helps. Second, it’s a tidy place: every inch of land is curated, and every lawn mowed. Third, there are ample leisure activities on offer: after work, the Swiss go biking, or show off their toned bodies on the shores of immaculate lakes.View image in fullscreenThe front page of Swiss newspaper Blick, 7 August 2025.Photograph: Martina Bisig/BlickMost importantly, the Swiss club has traditionally offered its members tranquillity. History doesn’t happen here. The last war Switzerland was involved in was the Sonderbund war of 1847 (it lasted 26 days, and about 100 people died). The country has been run by a majority rightwing government since 1848. The Swiss economy has contracted inonly six of the last 60 years.As a teenager in the 2000s, looking out through the bulletproof window at the rest of Europe, I saw Islamist terrorism and mass youth unemployment. We had none of it.Crime is lowand social conflict barely exists, though Islamophobia did raise its ugly head in the 2009 vote toban minarets. The Swiss have Europe’s lowest proportion of working dayslost to strikes. Disputes are resolved through compromise, and frustrations vented through direct democracy, or drowned in a sea of passive-aggression. And yes,93.2% of trainsdo run on time.This all-pervasive sense of calm and predictability is perhaps the main reason why so many wealthy people move here. On a chaotic and anxious planet, Switzerland offers the luxury of living in a parallel reality – a chance to take a break from the world. That is the Swiss dream. That is the story of the children’s book Heidi, in which a wealthy German girl suffering big city life in Frankfurt escapes to the Alps. That is the story of Thomas Mann’sThe Magic Mountain, in which Europe’s neurotic elite retreats to the Swiss Alps to pontificate on the state of the world from a safe, numbing distance.Switzerland’s long history of neutrality and deliberate remoteness also nurtured a feeling of Swiss exceptionalism. Surviving two world wars untouched convinced many that staying alone means staying safe – indeed, that it can even be profitable, especially if you are happy to trade with Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa.Isolationism carries benefits even today. Not being part of either Nato or the EU allows Switzerland to be the only European country, apart from Iceland, to have a free trade agreement with China. It also allows Berne to spend just0.7% of GDPon defence – far below Nato’s 3.5% target. Swiss aid to Ukraine stands at just0.13% of GDP, eight times lower than that of the Netherlands. Switzerland has thrived on being part of the free world without shouldering any of the burdens that come with it. But in the new era of cutthroat geoeconomics, this “have your cake and eat it” policy doesn’t work any more.Moreover, Trump’s move completely blindsided Berne. In Switzerland, many people assumed that the president Karin Keller-Sutter’s majority rightwing government would get along well with the Rolex-wearing Trump. After all, he dislikes the EU, taxes and wokeness, and so do the Swiss. When the US vice-president, JD Vance,argued at the Munich Security Conferencein February that social media “censorship” was a bigger danger to Europe than Russia, Keller-Sutter praised the speech as “very Swiss”.Trump is losing his foolish trade war. This will cost ordinary Americans greatly | Steven GreenhouseRead moreTrump’s shocking tariff announcement has left the Swiss establishment clueless as to how to respond. Last week, Keller-Sutter tried to convince Trump to let go of the US’s$38bn trade deficitwith Switzerland. Trump latersaid of the call, “The woman was nice, but she didn’t want to listen.”Switzerland has little leverage at its disposal. The country has already committed tobuying F-35 fighter jets. Keller-Sutter can’t even promise to cut tariffs on US products. In 2024, Bern unilaterally eliminated tariffs on industrial products. If Trump adds pharmaceuticals to the 39% tariffs, the economic pain will be real: up to 0.7% of GDP a year or 700 Swiss francs a head, according to theSwiss Economic Institute. But the greater shock is psychological. A nation that has become accustomed to always getting its own way is now floundering, with a worse tariff rate than Algeria (30%). In a multicultural, federal country with four official languages, the grand unifying narrative of Swiss exceptionalism is in tatters.Perhaps worst of all, Brussels is getting a better trade deal than Berne. That is provoking a lot of head scratching in a country where support for EU membershipstood at 17%in a 2024 poll. Keeping the EU at a distance may no longer be the best option. The first test will come soon: the Swiss will vote on new economic treaties with the EU – something that the Swiss far right is fighting tooth and nail.Trump’s golf-cart style of governing ought to see him fit right in to the Swiss country club.

But what happens when these stories belong to our children?Wed 13 Aug 2025 19.40 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 20.35 EDTShareThe moment I discovered both of my children had been sexually abused by our babysitter’s partner, I was hollowed out by the greatest sorrow I’d ever known.They were aged four and two.A stain bloomed backwards through time, through all the moments that once felt delightful and perfect: fat little hands catching the light, unsteady feet in tiny sneakers, sleeping faces. All those times I kissed their soft cheeks goodbye.Time collapsed in on itself. There was no before and after – just an after that swallowed everything.As their stories unfurled, in the aftermath of reporting them, I held my children with all the strength and protective love a mother can muster. I reassured them always: We believe you. This is not your fault. I am so sorry I wasn’t there. Years later, they carry no shame, and their childhood brims with joy.I am one parent among countless parents affected by child sexual abuse. As the silent guardian of my children’s stories, as their fierce advocate, I am bound to protect their privacy. Their stories belong to them. There are countless voiceless parents like me, siloed in trying to simultaneously support their children’s healing while quietly reassembling their shattered selves.As a male kinder teacher I agree more needs to be done to protect children. But the solution is not to vilify people like me | David KellyRead moreFor so many other kinds of traumas and sorrows we have a shared language, grief and ritual. We know secrets are corrosive, that healing deepens when we share our experience with others. Communal care is vital for our wellbeing. We know, too, especially as women, the power of refusing to stay silent. But what happens when these stories belong to our children?I was lucky to have the love of close friends, family and professional support, but most people in my world had no idea – and still have no idea – of our family’s quiet devastation. Living in a close-knit small community, I struggled to contain this seismic rupture during early motherhood. In the midst of playdates, trips to the park and music classes, the “how are yous?” were answered with chirpy falsities – I was suffocating under an unrelenting shame and guilt, wrenched with fury and sorrow. The ongoing senseless injustice. Aching sadness. I blamed myself entirely.Traumatic stress held me in its vice for months. The reminders were everywhere, unbidden memories surfacing. One Christmas, a man dressed as Santa visited our local gathering place. The children swarmed around him and I was overcome by an internal, shrieking anguish. Those big, big hands and all the small, trusting hands. I wept uncontrollably in the car park.I felt haunted, and desperately lonely. I thought of all the other parents – and think of them still.The effects of sexual abuse ricochet in so many directions. More trauma support is needed for those of us standing in its shadowsIt has now been six years. The grief ebbs and flows. I now know the shame and guilt doesn’t belong to me. I have learned ways to manage the inner chaos of post-traumatic stress. I delight in my wonderful children’s strength, humour and curiosity.As an advocate to end child sexual abuse, I stand in solidarity with those seeking to address a legal system that continues to fail children. “Children do not and cannot lie about such things” is what we know and what we hear, over and over. This truth was validated for my children by the highest sexual assault recognition payout from Victims Services. Yet when children need to locate a date and time in their testimony, with no witnesses, no forensic evidence or a confession, it is nigh impossible for a perpetrator to be arrested – let alone convicted. My children’s disclosures tumbled out over months and years; words upon words of irrefutable evidence.I believe my children were able to tell me their stories because of all of our early conversations about bodily autonomy and not keeping secrets. Ongoing protective education programs are integral, and there needs to be more awareness of ill-founded, damaging stereotypes: there is no evidence to suggest that children who experience abuse will then go on to offend as adults.It is crucial we implement early-intervention measures for those at risk of harming children. Child sexual abuse is endemic: it happens in our communities, our homes, with people we often know and trust. Their actions are monstrous, but if we continue to deem them inhuman monsters, we are failing to address the problem where it begins: in ordinary places.These are difficult, complex, but necessary aspects of our ongoing national efforts to protect children.The effects of sexual abuse ricochet in so many directions. More trauma support is needed for those of us standing in its shadows: both families of abused children, and the devastated families of those who abuse.

Somehow, just imagining this solemn promise makes me tearful although I don’t even know that a variation of these words is headed my way.For the past week, our cavoodle Odie has been vomiting. The vet’s diagnosis of “it could be a stomach bug or lymphoma” is not exactly reassuring but, admittedly, the patient is wagging its tail.Two days later, our suspicion rises. The receptionist suggests I bring him in “now” for tests. I guiltily decline, loath to cancel my patients who have waited months to see me. Later, we go for an ultrasound and, as Odie burrows into my arms, his little heart thumps. Noticing his apprehension (and mine), the technician kneels, fusses over him before drawing him away.As I swallow the bill shock, I learn that Odie has swallowed something causing gastric obstruction. The waiting room has emptied but the vet does me the courtesy of asking me inside to advise that he will need emergency surgery. After texting the kids, I rush him to the animal hospital. In the rear view, he looks tired and innocent, and I feel remorseful. How did we fail him?Writing is all about discipline, love, luck and endurance – and I sure know about endurance | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThe receptionist greets me with a fine-tuned amount of care and compassion. She neither indulges me nor fawns over my dog. This is not the time to tell me he is cute. Odie and I are nodding off when the duty vet calls us. Soon, she has me marvelling at her ability to be professional without patronising.She explains that I have a choice between attempting to retrieve the foreign body via a gastroscopy or moving straight to open surgery.Why not pick the less invasive option first, I ask, instinctively thinking about my patients.“Because if it fails, your cost doubles and some people can’t afford it.”This one-line informed financial consent hits the mark – but nauseous at the idea of cutting open Odie’s tiny abdomen, I opt for a gastroscopy and hope for the best.I ask the vet if I should wait only to be gently advised that the procedure requires prepping for hydration and sedation. Having sent countless patients for a gastroscopy, I feel stupid.A friendly nurse appears. Odie likes her, licks her and follows her to “the dog ward”, leaving me to pay the hefty deposit. This reminds me of my patients whose pension would foreclose this luxury on behalf of a pet that is often their sole companion.“Before you leave, do you want to see Odie?” the receptionist asks.I have decision fatigue – and say no, unconvincingly explaining that I don’t want to get his hopes up.“As you like,” she says. Recognising the politest of signals to guard against future regret, I stop at the door.“Do you think I should see him?”“Yeah.”The nurse brings out a still happy-looking Odie. I stroke his head, telling him (and me) that we are lucky to be in able hands.Meanwhile, my own hands feel awfully empty without dog or leash.My remedy to ward off the tears is to play loud Bollywood music and, while incongruous, it stops the sadness from invading my heart. At home, after answering my kids’ questions with “we don’t know” and “we can’t say”, I fall into an exhausted sleep.After midnight, an apologetic, frustrated vet calls to say that the gastroscopy was unsuccessful. She could see a twig-like object but couldn’t budge it. So I consent to an exploratory laparotomy, a term for opening up the abdomen that I have explained to many patients suffering from conditions that don’t involve a swallowed twig.View image in fullscreenThe seed pod of a sweetgum tree removed from Odie.Photograph: Ranjana SrivastavaA kindly surgeon assures me of the routine nature of the procedure. Eyeing the “for resuscitation” box, I hope so.The offender turns out to be the seed pod of a sweetgum tree. Odie comes home, a little dopey and nonplussed as to what the fuss is all about.As an oncologist, I am used to being compared (unfavourably) to vets. In the depth of their disappointments, patients and families will lament that they wouldn’t treat an animal “like that”. Of course, the human condition and human expectations are complicated, but I will say that vets and their staff might just be the unsung heroes of healthcare.They protect the interests of those who can’t even speak for themselves, comfortable both with curing and, when the suffering gets too much, palliating. All this without fanfare but with compassion and humility.What I will remember most is their empathy, which felt natural and unforced. They instinctively understood that they were treating two patients – me and my dog – and tailored their touch and talk accordingly. Alas, we don’t do this nearly well enough in medicine. The barrage of bureaucracy no doubt hardens us but, if we let our empathy dissipate, we will be the lesser for it.As for Odie, his wound is healing and he is inhaling our love. Considering the drama, I have a good mind to never again let him off leash. But, to be honest, at the first whiff of his eagerness to sniff at every blade of grass and inspect every dog’s behind, I will relent and, before I can exclaim “Don’t eat that!”, we will be back to our normal ways.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

But there is more to doRachel Reeves is the chancellor of the exchequerWed 13 Aug 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 19.48 EDTShareThese past few weeks I have met dozens of businesses from across the United Kingdom. Pub and restaurant owners in Cornwall and Kent. Defence manufacturers in Belfast and Moray. Investment opportunities in Aberdeenshire and Port Talbot.I have seen an economy that has the ingredients for success – a skilled and committed workforce, world-class universities, innovative businesses. You don’t hear Reform or the Conservatives talk of this success. They want you to believe the economy is broken. That our best days are behind us and that the path of decline is inevitable. I fundamentally reject that. It is not the country I see around us, and it is not the future I believe in. Britain’s economy is not broken, but I know that in recent years it has got stuck.Austerity, a chaotic Brexit andLiz Truss’s disastrous mini-budgetled to more than a decade of stagnation. Our economy became trapped in a cycle of low growth, repressed investment and stagnant income that weakened our competitiveness on the global stage.The months and weeks before any budget are filled with people speculating about – or claiming to know – what tax and spend decisions I will take or what the Office forBudgetResponsibility will conclude. This budget is no different – I get that. I will set out the decisions I take in a responsible manner.But just as my focus over the past 12 months has been about kickstarting economic growth for the benefits of working people, so will my next. BecauseBritain’s productivity problemis not an abstract, technocratic one – it directly affects every working family in Britain who feel they are squeezing every penny to make ends meet. When businesses can’t grow, wages stagnate and there is less money in the pockets of working people. When infrastructure is inadequate, costs rise, and opportunities are lost.When skills do not match economic needs, potential goes unfulfilled. With lower productivity, tax revenues go down and our public services face cuts. And with the world changing, Britain has been left too exposed to global shocks.Working people across Britain are striving and grafting, but they haven’t had the tools they need for the job. They have not seen their incomes rise as a reward for their hard work. There is that sinking feeling that families and businesses across the country feel at the end of every month that they are working hard, but getting nowhere. There is nothing progressive – nothingLabour– about an economy that is not productive and does not reward those who contribute. Since I became shadow chancellor and then chancellor, I have known that breaking this cycle will require our sustained effort across many fronts.Because if renewal is our mission and productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our tools. It’s investment into our infrastructure, from the train lines and roads that connect businesses and communities to each other to the building of new houses that working people need to fulfil the dream of owning a home. It’s investing in British workers and raising skills in this country, so we end business reliance on cheap migrant workers.We are providing that investment and unblocking the barriers to it too. Breaking down the planning systemto get Britain building, cutting the unnecessary red tape that has stifled innovation rather than enabled it, and filling the skills gaps that are leaving businesses unable to expand and working people unable to progress.We are making progress: wages grew faster in our first 10 months in power than the first 10 years of Conservatives,384,000 more jobs have been created, trade deals now struck with theUnited States,Indiaand theEuropean Union, the cost of a representative new variable rate mortgagelower than when we were elected, and millions of working people getting a pay rise from aboost to the national minimum wage.But I know there is more to do – and that is what this autumn will be about. Because I do not accept decline as inevitable. If Labour’s first year in power was about fixing the foundations, then the second year is about building a stronger economy for a renewed Britain. A renewed economy that works for working people – and rewards working people. That is my priority. That is my mission.

What followed seemed inevitableWed 13 Aug 2025 12.06 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.36 EDTShareWhat is the role of journalism when Palestinian reporters are treated as criminals and left to die? Last October, I spoke with the journalist Hossam Shabat. He described families packing what little they had left in northern Gaza as Israel began implementing its “generals’ plan”. Six months later,Shabat was dead– killed by Israel, accused of being a Hamas operative.Israel does not try to hide these killings. Instead, it often smears its victims in advance – branding journalists as “terrorists”, accusations that are rarely substantiated. These labels serve a clear cause: to strip reporters of their civilian status and make their killing appear morally acceptable. Journalists are not legitimate targets. Killing them is a war crime.The latest round shook the world:five Al Jazeera journalistswere assassinated in a press tent in Gaza City,among them Anas al-Sharif, whose face had become familiar to anyone following Gaza up close. Both the UN and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)had warnedthat al-Sharif’s life was in danger. Weeks later, he was dead.Meanwhile, a growing consensus recognises Gaza as the site of a livestreamed genocide. Yet in Germany – a country that prides itself on havinglearned the lessonsof its own genocidal history – some of the most powerful media institutions have played a part in enabling Israel’s actions. Some German journalists have even justified the killing of their Palestinian colleagues.The clearest example is Axel Springer, Europe’s largest publisher and owner of Bild, Germany’s biggest newspaper. Hours after the killing of al-Sharif became public, Bild splashed his imageunder this headline: “Terrorist disguised as journalist killed in Gaza” (which was later changed to “Journalist killed was allegedly a terrorist”). Let that sink in.About a week before, Bild had publishedanother piece: “This Gaza photographer stages Hamas propaganda.” The article targeted the Palestinian photographer Anas Zayed Fteiha, accusing him ofstaging imagesof starving Palestinians as part of a Hamas campaign, despite the evidence that the subjects of the photos were indeed starving and waiting for food. In the article, Fteiha’s title as journalist appeared in quotation marks, implying he wasn’t a real journalist, and that images of starvation were exaggerated fabrications.The Bild story – along with a similar piece in the liberal Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) – wasswiftly amplified on Xby Israel’s foreign ministry, which cited them as proof that Hamas manipulates global opinion. Fteiha was branded an “Israel- and Jew-hater” serving Hamas. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundationquickly piled on, joined by rightwing influencers.In this case, German media had become a direct pipeline for Israeli talking points, quickly recycled into the international arena and repackaged as “evidence”. Fteihasaid in response: “I don’t create suffering. I document it.” Calling his work “Hamas propaganda”, he continued, “is a felony against the press itself”.Just days before the Bild and SZ articles were published, one of Germany’s largest journalists’ associations, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband (DJV),issued a statementwarning of “manipulation” in press photography. It specifically cast doubt on images showing emaciated children in Gaza, claiming their condition “apparently is not attributable to the famine in Gaza”. The DJV offered no evidence for this claim – largely because no such evidence exists.Facing backlash online, the associationcited a July articlein Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, whose author had speculated whether images of emaciated infants were really the result of starvation – or rather of preexisting conditions such as cystic fibrosis. The piece suggested that publications had been either negligent or manipulative in publishing these photos without further detail. Omitted was the fact that hunger and preexisting conditions can’t be neatly separated and that no preexisting condition alone could produce such extreme emaciation.Bias isn’t new in the German media landscape. At Axel Springer, support for the existence of the state ofIsraelis secondon the list of thecompany’s guiding principles, its so-called essentials. In September last year, Bild helpedderail ceasefire negotiationsby publishing an“exclusive” report– excerpts from a Hamas strategy leaked to Bild by Benjamin Netanyahu’s aides. In it, Bild claimed Hamas was “not aiming for a quick end to the war”, which neatly absolved Netanyahu of any responsibility for the breakdown in talks at the time. (In response to queries about the story, a Bild spokesperson told +972 magazine that the publication does not comment on its sources.)As it turned out, the Hamas document had beenbroadly misrepresentedby Bild. The timing couldn’t have served Netanyahu better: the story landed as mass protests put pressure on his position. Shortly after the Bild report was published, Netanyahu cited it in a cabinet meeting to cast the demonstrators as pawns of Hamas. The Bild article remains online, uncorrected.We published a photo of a malnourished child in Gaza. It made an impact globally – and created controversy | Elisabeth RibbansRead moreThe problem, however, extends far beyond Bild and Axel Springer. Across legacy German media, failures to provide fact-based, balanced coverage of Israel and Palestine have been far reaching – and became glaringly obvious after the 7 October attacks. Fabricated claims, such as thatHamas had beheaded 40 babies, along with various other pieces of deliberate misinformation,remainuncorrected.Outlets across the political spectrum in Germany routinely omit historical context, frame Palestinian deaths in passive, depoliticised terms, and display a near-blind faith in Israeli military “verification” – while ignoring a well-documented record of misinformation by Israeli state sources. In January, the ostensibly leftwing Die Tageszeitung ran a piece headlined: “Can journalists be terrorists?” The article cited the Israeli military four times – and did not quote a single journalist in Gaza.Across the German media landscape, such narratives contribute to stripping Palestinian journalists of credibility, and – in the worst case – handing Israel readymade justifications for targeting them.Germany’s “never again” pledge should carry weight given its deeply genocidal history. Yet it rings hollow when the country’s dominant outlets launder or supply propaganda to legitimise mass killing in Gaza. This is not journalism in the service of truth – it is journalism in the service of violence. Breaking this cycle would require a serious reckoning with the editorial cultures and political loyalties that have enabled German journalism to be weaponised in this way.The killing of journalists inGazamakes one thing painfully clear: Israel does not want a record to be left. When the history of this genocide is written, there will be chapters on the media’s role. Germany’s section will be uncomfortably large. No one should claim they didn’t see it happening.Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and author.

But in a world where rumours travel faster than facts, this new approach will have profound consequences for justice – and for the people who will live with the consequences.Thenew national guidancesays that “police forces should consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects when they are charged in high profile and sensitive investigations and operations”. It comes after Reform UKaccused policeof a “cover-up” over two men who have been charged in connection with the alleged rape of a child in Nuneaton. Prior to this, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, hadexpressed her viewthat guidance should change to allow “more transparency”. She was joined in this opinion by the chief inspector of constabulary, who warned that withholding such detailscould feed “two-tier policing” claims(the allegation that the state polices majorities more harshly than minorities, contrary to the overwhelmingbody ofevidencethat shows otherwise).The idea that identity characteristics should feature, after arrest, in what information is publicly released during police investigations has been circling for years. Until very recently, officials and criminal justice practitioners had mostly resisted. Their concern was simple: routine publication of these details would invite the public to see suspects as examples of a group rather than as individuals in a case.The current approach is embedded in force policies that explicitly root decisions over what to share with the media in “policing purpose” – releasing only what is necessary to protect life, prevent and detect crime, bring offenders to justice and maintain public confidence, rather than what satisfies curiosity or advances a political argument. It is reinforced by national professional guidance designed to prevent pre-trial publicity from straying into prejudice, including the longstanding norm that suspects should not be identified before they have been charged, except in clearly justified circumstances. This sits alongside thepress regulator’s rule, established after histories of press stereotyping playing a role in public incitement, that race or ethnicity should not be mentioned in reporting unless it is “genuinely relevant to the story” (there is not even a public interest override to that clause).Together, these norms made early disclosure of ethnicity and immigration status the exception rather than the default. Now the explicit decision has been made to alter this in standard police disclosures and reporting. So, what has changed?The answer, simply put, is that there is a perception that the politics and the information environment is now different. The impact of theonline falsehoodsabout the Southport killings in late July and early August 2024 – that the attacker was an asylum seeker who had recently arrived by boat – ricocheted through social media and spilled into street violence. In this instance, the police could not initially name the suspect because he was under 18.Subsequently,parliamentary committees,researchersandreportershave traced how rumour and identity claims fuelled disorder, while newsrooms and police forces were left firefightingconspiracy theories at speed. That crisis has bolstered the argument that withholding details such as nationality or asylum status can create a vacuum in which malign actors thrive, and that more routine disclosure will puncture misinformation.The problems with this argument are profound. First, conspiracies thrive on distortion, not on the careful absorption of official communications. A parliamentary committee concluded that social media’s business models incentivise the spread of misinformation, which helped trigger last summer’s violent disorder. In this climate, baking identity into the first telling of crime stories – before a suspect has been charged –is not transparency, it is kindling.Second, once an identity is put at the front of an update, the search for evidence gives way to the hunt for a “type” ahead of the facts. It steers attention from what happened and what can be proved to who the person is said to be and what that is taken to mean. In that climate, each new detail is read through the label, and the space for careful judgment shrinks. The history of policing and ethnic minorities in this country has illustrated this in numerous moral panics.Third, the new disclosure regime lands in a political and media environment that routinely associates migrants and Black and ethnic minorities with illegality. The Runnymede Trust’srecent analysesof millions of words in news articles and parliamentary debates documents how such groups are persistently paired with words about illegality. That pattern helps normalise hostility. These are not abstract academic points – they are the context in which the criminal justice system is brought into perpetual, manufactured culture wars that harm minorities and leave everyone less safe.Fourth, there’s a very basic problem of data quality. Police forces are famously bad at this. Ethnicity can be recorded as self-defined by the person involved or as “officer observed” using broad visual codes. Completion rates for self-defined data vary sharply between forces, and missing or mismatched records are common.National standardson ethnicity are also under review because the categories are contested and context-dependent. Now add the fact that “ethnicity”, “nationality” and “immigration status” are different things. Nationality may be known at the point of charging a suspect if documents are checked. Immigration status often is not – indeed, the police guidance confirms that, “It is not the role or responsibility of the police to verify a suspect’s immigration status” and that, “It is for the Home Office to decide if it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confirm immigration status.” Turning anysuch labels into front-of-house communications is an open invitation to error, before a correction that is too late to catch up with the narrative.The truth is that the demand for default disclosure of ethnicity or immigration status is not about transparency but advancing a political narrative. This is why the scriptscarcely needs factsto run. If police hold back, it is proof of concealment; if they disclose the information and those details fit the stereotype, this is used to indict the wider group. If the details do not fit, attention moves elsewhere.The new guidance might reconcile pressure for “transparency” with established privacy and contempt protections, and the ability to explain reasons for restraint (for instance, to safeguard a fair trial; to protect victims and witnesses; to avoid inflaming tensions). These too are a service to transparency as they tell the public that the police understand the rights of suspects and the realities of community safety.The real question, however, is not whether the public should be trusted with information. It is whether the state should normalise ethnicity and immigration status as the organising facts of crime reporting – and burden already marginalised communities with more suspicion.Nasar Meer is a professor of social and political sciences at the University of GlasgowDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Andtax reform is on the menuat its much-publicised reform roundtable, to be held next week.Here, we serve some food for thought – the taxation of owner-occupied housing. This may seem distasteful, but there are some strong arguments for doing so.Tax breaks for owner-occupied housing are very largeThe size of tax concessions for owner-occupied housing is similar to that of superannuation, and much larger than for investment property. Treasuryestimatesit forgoes more than A$50bn per year by exempting owner-occupied housing from capital gains tax (CGT).Sydney and Toronto had equivalent home prices, then Canada’s crashed. Could Australia see a similar slump?Read moreThere is also no tax on the rental value of owner-occupied housing, although wedid taxsuch “imputed rental income” (what a homeowner would pay in rent) briefly between 1915 and 1923.Owner-occupied housing exacerbates inequalityAustralia prides itself on being a fair society. In reality, we arenear the middleamong developed countries on standard measures of income inequality. But such statistics ignore the income that owner-occupiers derive from their homes.In anew paper, we see what happens to income inequality if owner-occupied housing income is included. This non-cash housing income refers to the imputed rent and unrealised capital gains on the property.When these are included in the income measure, inequality is higher, and it increases more strongly over time. The effect is large enough to shift Australia’s inequality from 16th to 10th highest amongst OECD countries (though we haven’t conducted the same exercise for other countries).Unsurprisingly, outright home owners are much better off than renters when income from the home is counted. They have an average income 86% higher than the average income of renters – compared with 34% higher if housing income is ignored, as it usually is.Australia’s progressive tax system is largely a mirageIncome taxes reduce inequality because the tax rate is higher for people with higher incomes. That is what is meant by a “progressive” tax system.Our paper finds that this changes greatly when income from owner-occupied housing is included. The income tax system reduces inequality by a lot less (about 40.5% less) if we include such housing income. Because this income is tax-free, the average tax rate for the rich is much lower than it seems. So the tax system is less progressive than it appears to be.The same is true for government pensions and benefits. They also reduce inequality, since they are targeted to people with limited means.But housing wealth is excluded from the pension assets test, so pensions are not as targeted as they appear to be. Repeating the exercise above, we find the effect of pensions and benefits on inequality is 18.9% smaller when housing income is included.Overall, the combined impact of income taxes and pensions/benefits on inequality is 26.7% lower when we include income from the family home.Favourable tax treatment is built into house pricesThese tax concessions may also increase house prices and encourage inefficient allocation of resources. Income from investing in owner-occupied housing is tax-free, while all other investments attract tax. So Australians plough their money into their home instead of other, more economically productive, investments. These funds could instead be invested into private firms (directly or through the stock market), stimulating entrepreneurial activity and lifting productivity, wages and profits.While stamp duty is typically payable on home purchases, the value of the income tax exemption is much larger. That lifts demand for housing, and hence housing prices. We know ofno recent studiesthat have estimated the size of this effect, but it is likely to be large and therefore make the move into home ownership more difficult.The absence of recent studies may be because taxing owner-occupied housing is not seen as a politically viable option. Muchmore attentionhas been placed on the much smaller tax concessions for investment property income.Most people would be better offThe Australian community as a whole would benefit from a reduced incentive to invest in housing because it would lead to increased investment in productive activities.In terms of who would benefit most, renters stand out as obvious beneficiaries, since the tax burden would shift towards homeowners. But a progressive tax on housing could also benefit owners of modest homes, as part of a broader redesign of the tax system.There is a temptation to equate a new tax with more total tax. This depends on the design. But it is certainly possible to implement a progressive tax on housing wealth, perhaps combined with an income tax cut, which could leave most people better off.How would this look in practice?There are many policy options for more fairly incorporating owner-occupied housing in the tax system. We do not make a specific proposal here, but options include:Albanese and Chalmers could take the Howard-Costello approach to tax reform. The conditions may never be better | Tom McIlroyRead morea broad-based land tax would go a long way to addressing the issue, and should be on the government’s agenda. This is an economically efficient tax that is advocated bymany economistsan explicit tax on owner-occupied housing wealth is also justifiable, since it is the only large asset that generates income that is not taxeda broader wealth tax could also be considered.We also believe there is a strong case for reconsidering the exemption of housing from the pension assets test. Manywealthy retirees benefitfrom public pensions, which are funded by taxes on the incomes of younger workers and renters.Too important to be squeamishWe should have a national conversation on whether the current tax treatment of owner-occupied housing is sensible. Moving away from complete exemption would open up opportunities for reduced reliance on income taxes and more food on the table for renters, and owners of modest homes.Will the reform roundtable etiquette permit consideration of reforming the taxation of owner-occupied housing? This is an important and much neglected consideration in assessing the overall fairness and efficiency of the tax system.This article was originallypublished in the Conversation.Peter Siminski is professor of economics, University of Technology Sydney.

Everything in it is tinged with wistfulness–a goodbye to cherished characters and a farewell to a stately home that was a sturdy presence in a transient world.When the ITV series started in 2010, wasn’t life … better? Did Elizabeth McGovern feel this too, the sense of time passing? After all, her character, Cora, is now ageing out of custodianship of Downton along with her husband, Lord Grantham, in favour of a younger generation and a changing era as the 1930s dawn.“No!” says McGovern, snapping me out of my melancholy. “I feel very excited that I’m going into a gratifying new phase in my career.” As well as reviving Cora, there is the play she has written, Ava: The Secret Conversations. Starring McGovern as Hollywood actor Ava Gardner, it will run in New York, Chicago and Toronto, having madeits debut in Londonin 2022. There is also a new album ofher folk-inspired music. “I feel like I’m just beginning,” she declares as we meet at her publicist’s London office. At first glance, McGovern, fine-boned and composed, seems delicate – but if you only go on first impressions, you’ll miss her rebellious spirit.I was never desperate. I could walk away. A lot of young women weren’t so luckyNot that making Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale wasn’t emotional. “You don’t have to work very hard, as a film-maker, to touch on that depth, because we’ve been working on it for so many years,” she says. McGovern worried that the absence ofMaggie Smith– who died last year after giving the show the brilliantly scathing Dowager Countess – would feel like too big a loss to the Downton world. But she says Smith’s presence “permeates” it. “She’s still very much in the atmosphere. I don’t feel there’s a big hole. In fact, in some ways, it sort of freed up the rest of the narrative to have a flow, because it’s not stopping for her moments. But everything she represents is there. She’s in every room, in every interaction, so it’s not like she’s not there. It’s a weird thing.”View image in fullscreenHeroine heiress … as Cora (centre) in The Grand Finale.Photograph: Rory Mulvey/Focus FeaturesThe women of Downton, whether the steely Lady Mary or spirited young cook Daisy, are gratifyingly tough, but Cora, usually quietly supportive in the background, never seemed that robust, even though it was her money – as an American heiress – that was running everything. Was that difficult to play? “At times, yes,” says McGovern. “I think as a contemporary woman, it is hard to feel the straitjacket of that period.” Did she ever fight for Cora to have more agency? “I wish at times she could have had more interesting stories,” says McGovern, but adds that it wouldn’t have been appropriate for her to have had “any more political or social power, because it just wouldn’t be accurate to the time”.Cora, though, is a vision of an exciting America; the daughter of a Jewish immigrant installed at Downton with her bags of new money and her progressive outlook. Were Downton set now, instead of Cora coming here to shake up Britain’s class-ridden ways, she would be a wealthy liberal refugee, a bit likeEllen DeGeneres, fleeing Trump’s America. McGovern, who grew up in California, has lived in the UK for the past 32 years. She is shocked and disappointed at modern US politics.“I mean,” she says, “it’s a reality that must have been bubbling away under what I thought was America. It can’t have come from nowhere.” But, describing herself as a positive person, she adds: “I think it will be painful, but we have too much successful history as a free country for us to let it go. It’s all of our responsibility to peacefully make sure we hold on to everything that I was confident – and complacent about – that America represented.”View image in fullscreenBig time … with Robert De Niro in Once Upon a Time in America.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyMcGovern had huge success early on. Her debut was in Robert Redford’s 1980 film Ordinary People, and she won an Oscar nomination for her role in her second film, Ragtime. This was followed by a part in Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America, opposite Robert de Niro. “I think I did feel like, ‘Gosh, this isn’t as hard as people say.’” She smiles. “Until I later experienced how difficult it is. My experience early on was just trying to keep my head on straight, do job after job, and do what most people are doing at that age – try to grow up. I only realised later how difficult it is to sustain a career.”Hers wasn’t a showbiz family: her parents were teachers. And although she has loved acting since she was a child, it was never about becoming a star. As a young woman in an often dangerous industry, this probably protected her. “I was never desperate, so I could always just walk away. A lot of young women didn’t feel they could. I think I was very lucky.”It also made her see the downsides of fame. “I think I did manage to avoid it myself, but the price you pay for fame is that it becomes really hard to have any relationships of intimacy, because you are collateral. Your whole being has sort of been sold, and that creates a tension about what people want from you.”A lot of McGovern’s early roles were as the girlfriend to the male lead. Then, she says: “I went from being the girlfriend to the perfect wife, and that I found frustrating. Most movies, television – it’s always the man’s point of view. It’s such a deep, subliminal thing that audiences are not even aware of it. I wasn’t even particularly aware of it. I knew my job early on was to fulfil a man’s fantasy of the woman they wanted. It never occurred to me to even question it.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve done my own thing’ … with Brad Pitt as her boyfriend in The Favor; now she thinks she would be cast as his mother.Photograph: Orion Pictures/AllstarBrad Pitt played McGovern’s boyfriend in the 1994 comedy The Favor. We joke – bitterly – that were she to be in a film with him now, she would probably be cast as his mother. This says a lot about what’s still considered desirable in a woman even though, at 64, McGovern is only three years Pitt’s senior. “I really don’t think that, just because society is viewing something that way, we have to. I try to have this discussion with my daughters. We can have a feeling independent of the consensus in society. I’ve just done my own thing and just kept doing it.”She bristles, not unreasonably, when I point out that her embracing her silver hair seems rare in her business. Was that a political decision? “Not really. But once again, I feel like a woman my age – that’s what we’re asked to talk about. I regret that about society.”There is something bracing about the way McGovern carves her own path. She left Hollywood and moved to London to start a family; she has two grownup daughters with her husband, the film-maker and producer Simon Curtis (who directed The Grand Finale). Approaching her 40s, she started a band, Sadie and the Hotheads, and started releasing music. “I have to remind myself,” she says, “that people will either like it or they won’t – and whatever they feel is fine with me. It’s about doing it.”In her 50s, she wrote her play about Gardner, drawn to the actor’s independent spirit. Now in her 60s, she is writing a screenplay, although she won’t say what it’s about. “It’s my next obsession. I really want to write stuff. I’m really excited about that.” Doing so is partly a way to create interesting work for herself as an older actor. There has certainly been plenty of talk about this – does she think the situation has improved? “Not that I’ve noticed.”View image in fullscreenIndependent spirit … with Aaron Costa Ganis in Ava: The Secret Conversations in New York.Photograph: Jeff Lorch/APShe loved the recent showDying for Sex, in which Michelle Williams plays a terminally ill woman in her 40s who embarks on a last attempt at sexual exploration. “It’s such a female story. I found that to be really encouraging, but it’s not going to be about someone my age.” Why? Is it because society considers the thought of older women having a sex life shocking? “I think possibly, yes. I mean, what can we do as women, except just keep going and not buy into it? We have no other choice.”If it takes a bit of effort, the pay-off is surely worth it – if McGovern and her outlook are anything to go by. “It’s a daily exercise in getting your head tuned into the right thing. It’s not that I blame anyone for accepting the status quo, but it doesn’t mean I have to. No way.” She laughs. “No way.”Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is out on 11 September in Australia, and 12 September in the UK and US.Ava: The Secret Conversationsis at New York City Center until 14 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDownton Abbey (Film)Downton Abbey (Television & radio)Period drama (TV)TelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The more time I spent with them, the more I learned about the darker side of their mobiles’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 13 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 12.23 EDTShareThis started as a project with my daughter and her friends, who are all part of the smartphone generation. They were 14 years old at the time and I wanted to learn more about the relationship they had with their mobile phones. In 2022,a study by Ofcomshowed that nine out of 10 children owned one by the time they reached the age of 11, and that 91% of them used video platforms, messaging apps and social media by the age of 12. I spoke to my daughter and her friends about how they use their phones and the negative reputation that surrounds teenagers and their screens. They told me the positives as well as the negatives, such as how social media can raise confidence as well as knock it down.I asked if I could photograph them. There was very little direction from me and – rather than photographing them in a controlled portraiture style, as I would usually have done – I simply observed them doing their thing. The energy was high: they moved so fast, dancing to short music reels, filming each other, laughing, scrolling, chatting, taking selfies, and back to makingTikTokdances again. It was so hectic, I struggled to keep up. This image,calledTikTok, came out of that session. I found this composition and asked Lucy to quickly look up at me. I had about two seconds before the moment was broken and they moved on to the next thing. As a portrait photographer, you get a feeling about certain shots, and I knew this was the one.They moved so fast – dancing to music reels, filming each other, laughing, taking selfies – that I struggled to keep upBack in the edit, I reflected on how the girls use their phones as a form of visual communication, or as the theoristNathan Jurgenson calls it, “social photography”. This means the result of the photograph is social, rather than an object as it would be in traditional photography. Social photography is less about making a document or archive, and more about taking a picture or video and sharing it, basically having a visual conversation.‘Pics or it didn’t happen’ – the mantra of the Instagram eraRead moreThe more time I spent with the girls, the more I learned about the darker side of their phones – the sexism and misogyny online. I shared the project as a work-in-progress exhibition in Oxford, and I worked closely with other focus groups of teenage girls who shared their experiences of online sexism and sexual harassment. I was shocked at some of the things I learned. The final project includes photographs of their handwritten testimonials.To further my research, I was reading activistsLaura BatesandSoma Sara’s work – and the original title of the project was No Big Deal, informed by Sara, who says sexual harassment happens so often it becomes seen as “no big deal”. But as the project progressed, I changed it to Once a Slag, which refers to a TikTok soundbite my daughter played to me. The acceptance and ownership of the lyrics made me feel protective and frustrated as a mother and feminist. It’s not a comfortable title, but the shock factor is important to get attention and raise awareness.‘No smartphones before 14; no social media until 16’: The Anxious Generation author on how to fight back against big techRead moreThis photograph has many layers, but it’s also striking. It is beautiful and alluring and I think it has captured a wonderful moment. It’s a celebration of the joy of girlhood, and of a group of girls in their own world. And just like social photography, these teenage years are ephemeral. In this image they are having so much fun together – it’s so important to capture this confidence in a safe place.This image has also made me very conscious of the triangle of three gazes: Lucy gazing at the viewer, performing for the camera but also confronting the viewer with that look, that attitude. Then my gaze as the mother and the photographer – which changes the more research I do on the subject. Then the gaze of the viewer, who might be transported back in time to their own teenage years. I find the tension between these really challenging with this subject matter.The girls in the image are now 17. A lot has come out since it was made. People such as Andrew Tate have become widely known – even though the kids knew all about him years before us adults did – and more recently the Netflix series Adolescence prompted wide debate.This week a mum got in touch with me and said: “I need to talk to you about short skirts.” Where I sit as a mum, and where I sit as a woman, are often totally at odds. As a mum, instinctively, you want to be protective. But if you zoom out of it, why should a woman not wear what she wants? Unfortunately, young women today are at risk, just by having a phone. That’s the world we don’t know as parents today.Philippa James’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philippa JamesBorn:Bath, 1978TrainedBA in art and moving image at Maidstone, Kent (2000); MA in photography at Falmouth (2023)Influences“Rineke Dijkstra,Miranda July, Lynne Ramsay, Tracey Emin, Abigail Heyman,Cindy Sherman, Samantha Morton, Catherine McCormack, the filmShort Cuts by Robert Altman, andLisa Taddeo’s book Three Women.”High point“Being selected last year for the Taylor Wessing portrait prize and exhibiting at the National Portrait Gallery.

As the industry slowly recovers from the decline of audiences during the pandemic – there were 126.5m admissions in 2024 compared with 176.1m in 2019, the rise in younger people returning to cinema may be due to anewfound love for filmdeveloped during the lockdown years. Although figures are yet to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, admission rates are continuing to increase, and it is younger audiences in particular who are showing significant enthusiasm, with figures from the Cinema Advertising Association suggesting that under-35s make up 50% of cinemagoers across the board.The younger audience discovered the depth of the history of cinema in lockdownThis is a proportion, which includes all cinemas including mainstream multiplexes, has held steady over the last few years but the effect appears particularly marked on the independent cinema circuit. Curzon, which operates 16 venues across the UK, reports there has been a clear shift over the past six years in young people overtaking older audiences. In 2019, the biggest age demographic of Curzon attendees was 65+, followed by 55-64. In 2025, however, the dominant age group is 25-34 – rising from 16% in 2019 to 31% in 2025 – followed by 18-25 (growing from 17% to 24% over the same period).The same goes for Bristol independent venue the Watershed, where the percentage of tickets sold to under 25s went from 19% (at reopening after lockdown in 2021) to 27% in 2024. (For comparison, the share of tickets sold to over 60s also increased, but by only by a single percentage point.)Steph Read, programmer at Watershed, says: “We find young people are quite adventurous with their taste, especially when it comes to older films and rereleases.” This year, Chungking Express from 1994 and 2004’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did well with younger audiences. “Over 50% of the audiences for both of those films were 24 and under,” Read says.View image in fullscreenGlasgow Film Theatre says young people connected with old films during the pandemic.Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamyPaul Gallagher, programme manager at Glasgow Film Theatre, attributes this new generation of filmgoers to “a growing appetite for cinema in general” that took off during lockdown. “Streaming became such a lifeline for lots of people, and there was definitely a younger audience who discovered the depth of the history of cinema at that moment.”“Gradually, in the years since then, this younger audience is now starting to join the dots and see that there are cinemas around that play stuff from the history of cinema. It’s not just new films, but that whole rich history of cinema.”Social media has clearly played its part. Gallagher says that screenings of films such as 1995 French social message thriller La Haine, as well as the works of directors such as Céline Sciamma and Wong Kar-Wai, have garnered much interest for their visual style and Instagram-friendly aesthetic. “We showed a couple of screenings of La Haine, and it was hugely popular, it sold out both of our biggest screens, which have just under 400 seats, and there was a visibly younger audiences.”View image in fullscreenScreenings of the 1995 French film La Haine have attracted younger audiences.Photograph: Ronald GrantFilm-dedicated appssuch as Letterboxdhave opened up access to a rich history of cinema, once the preserve of older film buffs, to a younger generation. “We’re Letterboxd fiends. That’s the first thing I do after a movie, I go to Letterboxd,” says Isiah Robinson, 22.Micha, 20, prefers to watch reruns of older films. “I don’t really go to the cinema to watch blockbusters, I want to watch films that already interest me,” she says. “The independent cinemas are usually cheaper anyways.”The cost of going to the cinema is another thing that young people factor in when deciding whether to see a film on the big screen. “We’re balancing the cost of living as well, so it’s a bit of a luxury,” says Isaiah Robinson, 22.According to the UK Cinema Association, the average price of a cinema ticket in the UK is £7.73, only a slight increase on 2018, when the average price was £7.22. Adjusted for inflation, the price is actually cheaper today than it was seven years ago.View image in fullscreenCurzon says social media is driving younger film fans to the pictures.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyAdele Agwu-kalu, 20, isn’t dissuaded by the cost as she says it is similar to what she would spend going out for a drink. “A ticket is basically the same price as a drink,” she says. “So the price is not really a factor.”For other younger people, the cost is worth it as the big screen provides a “no-distractions zone”, as opposed to the experience watching a film at home. “It’s nice to switch off,” says Sophia Crothall, 23. “I don’t touch my phone the whole time I’m in the cinema. At home I’m probably scrolling.”Greg Walker, cinema manager and programmer at Manchester’s Cultplex suggests that “cinema etiquette” is one of the reasons that smaller venues in particular benefiting from the rise in younger people going to see films. “More often than not, independent cinema audiences are the ones who are more respectful. They’re not on the phones constantly, they’re not talking.”“A lot of young people get pigeonholed into being those kind of people at cinemas, but I think a lot of them are actually the ones who want to go and watch the film. It’s not just a social area.”However, Ben Luxford, director of UK audiences at the British Film Institute, says that this new wave of film fanaticism is “still quite a small pocket of people ultimately”.“It might be fuelling a change in the audience at places like the BFI Southbank or in cinemas in university towns across the country, but it’s not happening everywhere,” he says.Cinemas are also benefiting from the rising popularity of music films by big-name artists whose fanbase is typically younger.Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which was released in 2023, has become the highest-grossing concert film of all time.Films spark and go viral – people want to be part of the conversation“Taylor Swift was a gamechanger,” says Eduardo Leal, group director of screen content at Vue. “The Eras Tour completely reset the ceiling for what a music film can do theatrically. Since then, we’ve had a bunch of successful K-pop titles such as J-Hope: In the Box and Seventeen: Power of Love.”“Social media has played a really big role in driving younger audiences to the cinema,” says Susie Bould, director of marketing at Curzon. “Films just spark and go viral. Saltburn, a few years ago, had a huge social virality, which gave it a life that it might not otherwise have had. I think people want to be part of the conversation.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryTaylor SwiftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where Beatie Bow was transported from the past to modern Sydney via a chant, “playing Gracie Darling” involves youngsters communicating with the spirit world, where Darling may have been taken after a seance performed in a creaky old shack went terribly wrong.Because of course it does! It’s a seance. In a shack. Just once I’d love to see a “talk to the dead” scene involving Ouija boards and the like go swimmingly well, a bunch of spirit-communicators leaving the event with ear-to-ear smiles and newfoundjoie de vivre. But of course, the seance in this reasonably well-staged but very codified and derivative series involves the Ouija board catching on fire and the titular girl (Kristina Bogic) spitting out demonic-sounding dialogue, before disappearing from the face of the Earth in 1997.Jumping many years ahead, we follow Gracie’s former bestie Joni (Morgana O’Reilly), who attended the seance and is now a child psychologist. In the first episode (this review encompasses the first three of six – all that was made available to the media) Joni receives a phone call, informing her that another girl has gone missing from that very same shack, where a bunch of kids were playing Gracie Darling. Ah yes, the past comes back to haunt! This moment establishes the show’s very genre-ified dialogue, via lines such as “It’s happening again”. Similarly tired-sounding language is sprinkled by the writers (Nation and Anya Beyersdorf) throughout the series and delivered by the poker-faced cast.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOccult activities becoming a form of adolescent recreation thematically aligns this show with Danny and Michael Philippou’sexcellent horror film Talk To Me, in which teenagers pass around an embalmed severed hand and channel a cranky spirit. But the Philippou brothers did something interesting by associating occult practices with other forms of recreational risk-taking, implying that consulting spirits and taking hits from a bong are different forms of the same ancient desire: to transcend the realm of the ordinary (which is exactly what I told my mother when she caught me smoking pot as a teenager).View image in fullscreenRudi Dharmalingam as Jay in Playing Gracie Darling.Photograph: Ingvar Kenne/Curio/Sony Pictures TelevisionIn Playing Gracie Darling, the occult element just feels cribbed from a cobweb-covered playbook. Likewise for the correlation between a core mystery and the troubled past of the protagonist, who, in order to fix a contemporary problem, must address something unresolved inside themselves – an oldie but a goodie. Another key player is local cop Jay (Rudi Dharmalingam, from the ABC’s sublime dramaWakefield), who was also part of that seance – because small town, because narratively convenient. The supporting cast also includes Dame Harriet Walter as Joni’s mum, Pattie, and Celia Pacquola as Ruth Darling, whose daughter Frankie is the latest person to disappear.Another very familiar element in this show concerns a situation brewing in the background that affects the local community, which serves as a scaffold for the main plot. Recently, inLast Days of the Space Age, there was an ongoing workers dispute at a power plant, and inThe Family Next Door, a controversial real estate property development. Here, it’s some recently constructed wind turbines which are disrupting the flight paths of birds and – some citizens believe – triggering health issues in the local community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s incredible what they lived through.” The mother in question was, of course, Anne Boleyn, and the royal cousin losing her head was Mary, Queen of Scots, sent to the scaffold in 1587 and now the subject of aballetco-created by director Bonas and choreographer Sophie Laplane for Scottish Ballet, premiering at this year’s Edinburgh international festival.There are actually multiple festival shows revisiting Mary’s legacy in Edinburgh this summer, which all take different slants on the story of the girl who inherited the throne at just six days old, became queen consort of France as well as Scotland’s ruler, and was executed at the age of 44. “I think she was a badass,” says Mhairi McCall, whose showMary, Queen of Rock!reimagines Mary as a rock star (drawing on icons from Tina Turner to Stevie Nicks), who returns to Scotland from France to find that rock music has been outlawed in favour of pop (that’s your Catholics v Protestants there). For Rona Johnston, writer/performer ofMary: A Gig Theatre Show, Mary’s story is a tragedy: “She could have done so much more but she was torn down in her prime.”View image in fullscreenMhairi McCall starring in Mary, Queen of Rock! at Cowbarn at Underbelly, Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFor Scottish Ballet’s own investigation into the myth of Mary, Laplane tells me: “We didn’t want to do a historical ballet.” The 16th century is definitely history, but what she means is they didn’t want to make something ploddingly factual, but rather dig into emotions and relationships, especially the one with Mary’s cousin, Elizabeth I. The story is told through Elizabeth’s memory and imagination as she lies on her deathbed, and it does sound like a bit of a fever dream: Mary’s baby, James, is represented by a balloon; young Queen Elizabeth appears on stilts; and Mary turns into a spider and eats her second husband, Lord Darnley.Reinvigorating narrative ballet is very much Scottish Ballet’s agenda. Its last festival premiere, the hugely successfulCoppéliain 2022, turned a corny 19th-century piece into a cautionary tale of AI and tech bros. The idea for this new ballet has been in the works for several years, back when Nicola Sturgeon was still first minister, “and we didn’t know if we’d be knocking on the door of another independence referendum,” says Bonas, putting English/Scottish friction to the fore.The rollercoaster of political fortunes plays out in contemporary life just as it did in Mary’s time, with leaders lauded one moment, hunted the next. McCall’s rock show, with its feisty frontwoman, makes this point by drawing comparisons with women in the music industry. “We love to build up women in the media, to such a point that the only way for them to come is down, and we relish in their downfall,” she says.Their portrayals are always stereotyped. Elizabeth is frustrated and neurotic, and Mary is riding her horse with her hair looseSophie LaplaneThe rapport and rivalry between Scottish Queen Mary and English Queen Elizabeth has been fodder for myriad books, TV shows and films. “It’s always very stereotyped,” says Laplane. “Elizabeth is frustrated and neurotic, and then Mary is riding her horse in the wild with her hair loose. When we started digging into it, it was interesting to find out that Mary was many, many things.”“They’re always pitted against each other,” says Johnston. “And [in our show] we say the reason for that is because of the men in their lives, who were all power hungry.” After Mary’s first husband, Francis II, Dauphin of France, died, she married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who orchestrated the murder of Mary’s friend and secretary David Rizzio. Mary may or may not have been involved in the subsequent plot to kill Darnley, but she did marry the man thought to be responsible, the Earl of Bothwell. “She met a lot of bad men, bad male influences,” agrees McCall. “And she kind of got shot down every step of the way.”The Scottish lords then turned against Mary, and Elizabeth perceived her as a threat and had her imprisoned. For Johnston’s gig theatre show, she wanted to imagine a different landscape for the two women, where instead of competition and political paranoia there would have been sisterhood and solidarity, “imagining the two of them could have been partners in some way, rather than enemies”. McCall, too, wanted to go against “the age-old narrative of two women trying to tear each other down”.Surprisingly, Mary and Elizabeth never actually met. However, they exchanged hundreds of letters, with an intensity Bonas jokingly likens to someone who strikes up a pen-pal relationship with someone in prison and falls in love with them. “They were very intimate in the letters, calling each other ‘my sister’,” says Bonas. “They absolutely recognised each other as two ruling queens and had a concept of their power and what that meant, being two women at the top of patriarchal power structures, both very vulnerable, actually, in their own ways. Needing one another, but in rivalry.” Laplane adds: “They were the only ones who could understand each other’s situation.”View image in fullscreenCharlotta Öfverholm as the older Elizabeth and Roseanna Leney as Mary in Mary, Queen of Scots.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicDespite being a “dear sister”, Mary did ultimately plot against Elizabeth (although some dispute this), and Elizabeth did send Mary to her death. “But it took her a long time to get round to signing the death warrant,” insists Bonas. “[Elizabeth’s spymaster] Francis Walsingham pretty much had to force her into it in the end.” Bonas talks of the “stunt” Mary pulled at her execution, “where she turned up wearing black, and then she’s standing on the scaffold and whips it off, and she’s dressed in red. They understood their own brands. They were aware of their own political and cultural identities.” All of which makes them fascinating characters to keep exploring on stage. For Bonas, Mary was “proud and strong and determined and passionate, but she was as much of a political actor as Elizabeth. She’s iconic, she’s emblematic of Scottishness, but telling the story through Elizabeth gave us a chance to investigate English guilt.” (Bonas is English, with a Scottish mother; Laplane, like Mary, has French and British parentage.)The atmosphere of political instability, and the sense of nowhere and no one being safe is something Laplane wanted to capture in the choreography, with a cast of shadowy figures ramping up the paranoia. She has brought her characteristic dance language to the work, full of sharp precision, detail and wit (as seen in previous works including Dextera, Click! (made for Ballet Black), and the film Dive, also co-created with Bonas). In her depiction of the three courts, Laplane finds humour amid the history. In the French court, she weaves in historical dance styles with a sense of refinement, but the men all have portly bellies (“Because back in the day, if you were rich, you ate a lot!”); in the English court, to show how stratified society was, she has Elizabeth rising up on stilts while the men all shuffle around her on their knees. The Scottish court was more horizontal, with genders mixing and more access to the queen, so they tried “to find that sense of community in the movement”, explains Bonas, “without just doing country dancing”.The score for the ballet is by Mikael Karlsson and Michael P Atkinson, who also wrote the music for Coppélia, mixing period and modern sounds. And the designs are by Soutra Gilmour (Evita, Sunset Boulevard), referencing fashion designers who themselves used historical motifs, such as Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. Cultural references bounce back and forth, with the aim of collapsing the five centuries between now and then, and synthesising eras – just as ballet itself does as an art form, forged in the Italian and French courts and now continually remade for the modern day, but always in touch with its roots. The aim is to help us see these distant figures as flesh-and-blood women. Bonas’s question is always: “How can you re-experience these characters in a way that makes them feel like people? How do you get them off the page?”Johnston says she easily connected to Mary when she started reading about her. “She was sort of my age, in her 20s, when she was in charge of Scotland. You see quotes about how fun she was and how much people loved her.” McCall was drawn to the fact that there’s still so much we don’t know. “Did she intentionally betray Elizabeth and turn against her? Was she pushed into that? Was she completely innocent? We’ll never really know for sure what she thought, what she felt. Mary’s a great example of somebody who tried to do the right thing at every turn and was just set up to fail. I like to believe she thought: ‘I’ve tried to do everything right [but when it went against her], I may as well just go down the wrong path now!’ And I love her as a person for that.”Mary, Queen of Scots is atFestival theatre, 15-17 August;Mary: A Gig Theatre Show is atGilded Balloon Patter House, 14-21 August;Mary, Queen of Rock! is atCowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Squareuntil 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreBalletMusicalsFestivalsEdinburgh festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We haven’t seen a trail of bodies like this in yearsJack SealeWed 13 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 11.40 EDTShareIt’s usually a bad sign if you’re wondering what the heck is going on in a drama when you’re two episodes in, but there is an exception: you can happily ride on if you sense that, although you don’t know what it’s doing, the show definitely does. Such is the bristling, bewildering, overpoweringly confident aura of Alien: Earth, a new TV take on cinema’s greatest sci-fi horror franchise by writer-director Noah Hawley of Fargo fame.We are in the year 2120, just the right setting for a show that plays on our fears that our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to live in hell. Simple green-on-black text, styled like a computer readout from the 80s, informs us that, in this broken future, corporations have taken over the universe, and which one achieves total domination will be determined by which of three technologies wins a “race for immortality”: cyborgs (enhanced humans), synths (wholly artificial beings) or hybrids (synthetic bodies with human consciousnesses implanted).The last of these is our primary concern in a first episode that mostly consigns the flesh-ripping aliens to flash-forwards so rapid they are almost subliminal. In Neverland, the laboratory complex of trillion-dollar disruptive startup Prodigy, a girl who looks to be in the last stages of terminal cancer lies down next to an inert adult figure she names Wendy. When the procedure is over, her brain has been copied from her ailing body and pasted into the entirely lifelike synthetic woman. The newly alive Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is the first hybrid and, soon, the leader of a gang of child-robot soldiers mentored by the enigmatic Kirsh, played by Timothy Olyphant sporting harrowing bleach-blond hair, an unnerving murmur and a turtleneck sweater that says something really isn’t right here.View image in fullscreenBlond ambition … Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh.Photograph: Patrick Brown/Copyright 2025, FX. All Rights Reserved.Up in space, meanwhile, a crew of humans have signed up for a job with big workers’ rights issues. If being managed by a humourless cyborg named Morrow (Babou Ceesay) wasn’t appalling enough, their cargo of captured alien life-forms are about to break out of the laughably weak glass containers they’ve been stored in, kill everyone except the self-preserving Morrow, and cause the spaceship to crash as Morrow grimly tries to fulfil his obligation to the super-rich Weyland-Yutani Corporation by returning the bounty to Earth.As the ship mingles with the rubble of the tall urban Earth building it has ploughed into and a Prodigy search-and-rescue (-and-steal-anything-valuable) team descends, led by Alex Lawther as listless medic (and Wendy’s long-lost brother!) Hermit, the monsters are finally on the loose. The setup is loose compared with most of the Alien movies, since the human and humanoid protagonists aren’t confined with the creatures in a tin box surrounded by an endless, scream-proof void, so Alien: Earth has to find other ways to create bone-deep dread.Most obviously we have the aliens, who aren’t yet particularly innovative but are suitably awesome, from a scuttling, leechlike bug to an eyeball with many, many legs and a shiny xenomorph that comes over as a little more man-like than its previous incarnations. They’re the classic nightmare fuel updated and sharpened and, when they strike, they leave behind the sort of oddly beautiful tableaux of torn corpses we haven’t seen since Hannibal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an obvious allegory for the rise of AI, the hybrid Wendy has been given abilities beyond what even her creators understand. Most pleasing to see is Samuel Blenkin, rewarded for his fantastic supporting turn as the resentful weakling Prince Charles in Mary & George with the key role of Boy Kavalier, the “genius” CEO of Prodigy and the Neverland project. With his comfy robes and puppyish, young-Wonka bounce, he is the frighteningly influential tech-bro pseudo-visionary who might bring the whole world crashing down, essentially just for a laugh: one of many nice touches in Blenkin’s performance is the way the Boy takes a crucial video call by lying on a bed and gripping a tablet between his raised bare feet.What Alien: Earth lacks in its opening two instalments is a propulsive, linear narrative or clarity of thematic vision, to the point where it sometimes approaches Westworld levels of making us ask the gloomy screen what in the blazes is happening. But whether it’s a padded corridor filmed at a 10-degree angle, a landscape of jagged concrete and raining sparks, a wriggling creepy-crawly from space or just the look in someone’s jaded eye, the series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner.Alien: Earth is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAlienreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is it simply a case of trying until something sticks? Or isacceptinga lack of talent a relief over chasing an impossible dream?EvolAnthWell, it’s not necessarily a lack of talent. I think everybody has talent, but you have to hone it. The more you do it, the more you like it. And when you have talent, you want to do it, you know?You signed my copy ofChristinewith the words“Keep on screaming for vengeance” because I was wearing aJudas Priestbadge. Is music still important to you?RobFramptonYeah, music is still important to me. I’ve moved on from Judas Priest because I couldn’t get the rights to use the lyrics from You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ for my [2008] novel, Duma Key. So I’ve moved on to Rancid, Nazareth, Anthrax andMetallica. I don’t listen to music if I’m composing directly from my head to the page. When I’m rewriting, I like to listen to club music, disco or something with a repetitive beat that flows through my head and goes in one ear and out the other. Today I was listening to some zydeco music, and LCD Soundsystem. I like North American Scum, Losing My Edge and Daft Punk Is Playing at My House very much.View image in fullscreen‘I like LCD Soundsystem very much’ ... band frontman James Murphy.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesDo you still go to bookshops and sign copies of your books when no oneis looking?PampersIf I can sneak in and sneak out, I do. I last did it at a bookstore down the road from me in western Maine and signed some copies of Never Flinch and You Like It Darker. I don’t really like book signings because you can’t do everybody. On my last book tour, I had to sign 400 books that were sifted at random from 1,000, so you only had a chance of getting one. But it was better than facing a line of people that never ends, where they all have two or three books. That’s tough.The word “prolific” is often overused, but not for your output. Is not stopping a choice, oris it because you can’t stop?JamesZZZIt’s hard to decide what to do with those two or three extra hours a day between 9am and noon. You can only watch so many gameshows on TV. I can go for a walk, but then I’m still thinking about the next thing. Basically, man, I’m entertaining myself.Do you still write all your books onMicrosoft Word?otterleyAs a matter of fact, I do. Sometimes I will sit and write in the mornings in longhand and then transcribe it. But mostly I use Word because you can go back and fix things. I’m not much of a computer geek, so if I have a problem, I get my IT guy on the job.Why is something scarier the more legs it has?biscoffThere is some truth to that. I just finished reading a British fantasy novel called City of Last Chances by Adrian Tchaikovsky. In it, there’s a monster in a hole in the ground, which is like a centipede and has all these legs. When they dump somebody into the pit, it grabs them with all its legs, punches through the flesh and chews off their head. So that was really scary. The thing is, they’re not like us. They don’t look like us. They are basically alien creatures, so it’s a little bit scary.Who do you read for lighter moments while on holiday? I re-readPG Wodehouse.LowerColonI don’t read PG Wodehouse. I have a tendency to read British mysteries. I’m reading one now called The Ending Writes Itself by Evelyn Clarke that’s set on a Scottish island. The people can’t get out and it’s pretty good.I’m studying for amaster’s in English and my dissertation is onHolly Gibney’s transformation from walk-on character to heroine, covering allsevenbooks. Can you help?Norahseel56View image in fullscreen‘I sort of fell in love with her’ … Justine Lupe as Holly Gibney in the TV adaptation of Mr Mercedes.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyI sort of fell in love with her. She was supposed to be almost a joke character; a walk-on, so to speak. She was obviously hen-pecked by her mother. Her mother was very overbearing and her father was a dishrag kind of person. There came a point in that first book, Mr Mercedes, where one of the characters, Jerome Robinson, goes to Holly because she understands computers and they kind of click. That was the point where she started to become three-dimensional. The more I wrote about her, and got interested in her, the more she started to become confident and interesting. She’s still got a lot of inferiority, and she’s not married and doesn’t have a boyfriend or anything. I think she might be a virgin. I’m not sure about that. I haven’t explored her backstory enough, but she became very interesting to me. By the third novel she was in, she just walked in and stole the book.Whatis the furthest youhave got into writing a bookand thought: “Nah, that’s no good,”and chucked it away?stinkyThere was one called The Cannibals that was set in an apartment building and these people couldn’t get out. It was sort of interesting, but I didn’t know what to do with it, so I just shelved it and went on to something that seemed more doable. It was probably about 200 pages. You go until you can’t think of anything else to say, and that’s the end.DoesRoland Deschain[the main character in King’sThe Dark Towerseries] wear a hat? In my mind, he doesn’t. My partner disagrees. Please settle this argument!jackbumbyIn some of the pictures he wears a hat. But I never really saw him in a hat, no.I’m going to an arts school and am thinking about becoming a horror writer. What part-time job would be good to get someinspiration?EagleDogCatI got some inspiration when I worked in a mill. We had to clean the place out and there were a lot of big rats in the basement. I wrote a story about that, and then I was off and running. I think any kind of a job that is manual labour – what in the US we call a blue-collar worker – is good experience for a writer. You don’t want a job where you can sit down in a clean, well-lit room and not have to clean up shit.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t really like book signings because you can’t do everybody.’Photograph: Jerod Harris/WireImageIf fear was a colour,would it be monochrome orhave different shades?SimotherI think it’s dark blue shading to black. You’ve got to have some colour because you have to be able to see a little bit. You’ve got to sense something and get an idea of what’s in the shadows, so to speak. So yeah, I’d say dark blue shading to black.If you had to invent an ending forTrumpian America, what would it be?hereroI think it would be impeachment – which, in my view, would be a good ending. I would love to see him retired, let’s put it that way. The bad ending would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It’s a horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?When I first sawStranger Things, it felt much like a Stephen King novel. Do you agree?MeckastemeduckI don’t see it as a Stephen King story as much as some other people do. I thinkthe Duffer Brothersgive me more credit than I deserve. Like a lot of talented people, they grew up with my material. When they were young and malleable, they read a lot of Stephen King and said: “We wanna do something like that.” But they’re very talented guys and the story they have developed has a lot more to it than Stephen King. It’s got a lot of Duffer Brothers in it. It’s good. I’ve seen all the episodes. I like it a lot.If someone was to make a film of your life, who would play you?MorganFox77I would love to have a good-looking leading man, but I don’t think Brad Pitt would do it. He is a lot better-looking than me. I’m a little bit on the elderly side now, so I’d say maybe Christopher Lloyd or – who’s the guy in Twin Peaks, the main tall guy? Kyle MacLachlan.I’m sure people are always asking you about your own dark secrets. Is there anything adorable about yourself that you’d like to share?UrrurrshCan’t tell you.When another film or TV adaptation lands on your desk, does it instil excitement or sighs of despair?LP43TTView image in fullscreenTom Hiddleston and Annalise Basso in The Life of Chuck, the latest Stephen King film adaptation.Photograph: Dan Anderson/StudioCanalI’m still excited when somebody makes a movie out of something that I’ve done. I was excited to seeThe Monkeyearlier this year, andThe Life of Chuck. I’m very excited to see [Edgar Wright’s remake of]The Running Man, which was filmed in England. I don’t write with movies in mind. I just write what seems like a good story that people and I will enjoy. Then whatever happens to it happens. That’s fine. I like the movies, but I think they’re different things, like apples and oranges, so to speak.Would you rather have the technology toteleport wherever you want, like inThe Jaunt,access to apantrywhich allows you totime travelback to a single point, like in11/22/63, or an unassuming shop where you canpurchase your greatest desire, like inNeedful Things?smilliganI don’t think I want anything to do with time travel because you’d mess things up. I’m afraid if I tried to teleport, my atoms would get mixed up with a fly and I saw that movie, so I wouldn’t like that. My greatest desire, what would it be? Hey, I’ve got everything I want. I’ve got two pairs of clean jeans in my dresser. The thing that I really like is – I’m sort of a shoe guy. I love shoes. I admire women because they get all these really cool shoes. I’ve probably got 20 pairs of shoes, man. Sneakers, little boots and things. When people see that, they’ll say: ‘Oh, that’s crazy.’ I bet there’s plenty of women out there that are going to read this who say: ‘I’ve got 50 pairs of shoes.’I have very vivid and often strange dreams which my husband jokes are likeStephen Kingnovels. Has any of your workbeen inspired by strange dreams?KatzahranI can think of one, about an abandoned refrigerator that, when it opened, was full of these flying leeches, and I put that in a story.You’vesaid you don’t like February,the number 13and doing interviews. Does this still stand?TopTrampThere was a time, when I was a young and struggling writer, when I would imagine all the smart, witty answers I would give in interviews. Now I’m actually faced with interviewers like your good self, I’m just sort of stuck. I hear myself saying: “Um … erm … ah … er …” a lot. It’s a case of be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.The Life of Chuck is in cinemas from 20 AugustDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For hours at a time, I trundle along the photorealistic landscapes in my pick-up truck, delivering parcels to isolated communities and building new roads. The only reason I complete the main story missions is to open new areas of the map so that I can meet new people and build more roads. I find it blissfully enjoyable.Of course, I am far from alone in playing video games this way. “Cosy games” have becomea thriving cottage industryover the past five years, led by crossover successes such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley and Untitled Goose Game, but also housing hundreds of smaller titles that appeal to highly engaged communities. On Steam this month you’ll discoverCatto’s Post Office, a delightful game about a feline postal worker, Fruitbus, a cute food truck management sim, MakeRoom, an interior design challenge, and Tiny Bookshop, which is about running … a tiny bookshop. Most of these games are united by the same elements: small teams, often young, often working remotely; short play spans; low-stakes challenges; and highly stylised visuals, as an aesthetic choice and an economic necessity.But why, if the audience for cosy games has been firmly established, aren’t there more lavish mainstream, triple-A examples? It’s clear producers such as Ubisoft, EA and Xbox are finding it tough to come up with fresh ideas – that’s why they’ve all spent (wasted) many millions trying to make the next identikit live service shooter to compete with Fortnite. So why not, I don’t know, try to make a big open-world adventure based around positive interactions and soft drama? The TV, film and book industries are crammed with this sort of stuff. Where is my video game version of Call the Midwife? Why can’t I ride a bicycle around 1950s east London delivering babies while faintly patronising decent working folk? Where is the video game equivalent of Downton Abbey or Gilmore Girls?View image in fullscreenHorribly charming … Untitled Goose Game.Photograph: House HouseOf course, I understand the most obvious answers. Like Hollywood, mainstream game development is largely based on minimising risk, and since the dominant cultural strand has always been action, violence and power fantasy, we inevitably end up where we are: with a thousand different combat adventures and not a single big-budget game about the love lives of a witty single mum and her sometimes exasperating daughter. But when we start to talk about culture rather than money, other factors come into play. “I think cosy gamers are a nuanced audience that values stories and mechanics over visual fidelity,” says Moo Yu, creative director at small studioTeam Artichoke, which is making an adorable anti-capitalist puzzle game named Mythmatch. “While I do think big-budget cosy games are absolutely going to be developed, it is an audience that isn’t begging for one and is capable of appreciating a wider range of experiences at a wider range of price points.”This is an important detail – high-end visuals and vast open worlds aren’t necessarily the prize goal, they’re just one aesthetic and immersive option.Untitled Goose Gamewould perhaps not have been so amusing if the lovely village had been photorealistic and the horrible goose constructed from 100,000 texture-mapped polygons. Stardew Valley is beautifulbecauseit resembles a vividly colourful retro game, not despite it. Art is not just about slavish reproduction, thank goodness. Part of the cosiness of the cosy genre is the restriction of both choice and outcome; the game takes your hand and says come this way, you are safe.View image in fullscreenCommunity over authority … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeMy lifelong friend Jon Cartwright is a veteran game developer who mentors small studios in Australia and New Zealand. When I emailed him about all this he replied: “When I think of a cosy game, I think of limited scope/size. And that’s been a function of them broadly being developed by smaller indie teams with limited budgets. But I think with the overload of … well,everythinggoing on in the world, and especially during the stress of Covid, having a small, safe environment with low stakes gameplay was a really untapped market. The fact that the visuals were ‘simple’ was another source of comfort and charm.”Charm is hard to replicate – it won’t materialise because you’ve developed an expensive new graphics engine, or because you have 500 staff working on it for 18 hours a day. You can’t build hi-tech charm centres in the desert. Itcanhappen in big games, just like it can in big TV dramas, but it’s a limited and unstable commodity. And in fact, the whole notion of the cosy game as an identifiable genre or deliberate play metric is still relatively young; games for so long, were mostly about winning. The verbs and adjectives of games about being nice to people have yet to be formalised. There’s a hoary old cliche that games are the opposite of film because explosions are cheap but a closeup shot of a human face showing emotion is wildly expensive. You could say that, in an interactive medium with historically limited visual naturalism, it’s been easier to create drama through having someone shoot at you than ask you on a date. But we have a hundred years of animation history to show us how charm, cosiness and emotional intimacy can be drawn from the most symbolic and stylised palettes.Moo Yu is certain that mainstream, naturalistic cosy epics will happen – in fact, he cites the fashion-focused role-playing gameInfinity Nikkias an example. Until then, I will be in Death Stranding 2, having to fake care about chiral contamination and extinction entities just so I can rescue kangaroos, visit inventors and drive my truck through irradiated landscapes of considerable beauty. Sometimes you have to play their game to win your own.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro shooter … Operation Night Strikers.Photograph: Taito/M2August is proving a spectacular month for retro arcade collections and I cannot resist recommending one more before I regretfully return to the 21st century.Operation Night Strikersis a collection offour acclaimed Taito shootersfrom the late-1980s including the seminal light gun blaster Operation Wolf, essentially an interactive combination of the action flicks Rambo and Commando. Also here are its decent sequel Operation Thunderbolt, plus two lesser-known greats – cyberpunk flying car shooter Night Striker and Space Gun, a frenetic take on Aliens, complete with face huggers and flame throwers. As usual for modern collections, save functions have been added, and if you get the Switch version, you can use your JoyCon as a makeshift light gun. It’s not very accurate, but it’ll remind veteran arcade dwellers of using Operation Wolf’s original mounted Uzi gun controller.These colourful, fast and ridiculous popcorn games perfectly capture the spirit of the era, with their smooth scrolling 2D backdrops, banging electro-pop soundtracks and monosyllabic, muscle-bound heroes.

How does it impact other publishers?”Well, put it this way: no major games company is going to be putting up its big hope for 2026 in the same launch window as Rockstar’s long-awaited behemoth. When the game was originally slated for a late 2025 launch, three triple-A developerstold industry newsletter the Game Businessthey were giving it a wide berth. This can be hugely disruptive to development teams who may have spent years planning for a specific release slot – it can also create a media and marketing black hole, where for a few weeks, no one is interested in anything else.However, it’s not all bad. WhenGTA Varrived in 2013, it didn’t destroy everything in its path – casual mobile games such asPuzzle & DragonsandCandy Crushdid fine, as did titles with dedicated fanbases such asWorld of WarcraftandCall of Duty. Also, a massive hit like GTA brings wider attention, interest and potentially investment to the whole industry, and there is plenty of money to be made from releasing similar titles in the wake of the original – Grand Theft Auto spawned a whole genre of gangland adventures fromSaints RowtoSleeping Dogs, while also lending innovative new design features to the entire market (GTA Online was, after all, the original live service experiment).So yes, it’s healthy. Kind of. The immediate financial shock can be challenging for other studios, but GTA V showed that casual gamers and dedicated fans of other franchises didn’t abandon everything and flock to Rockstar. Furthermore, the aftermath of a spectacular success can open new opportunities. After all, before Star Wars, no Hollywood studio would have touched a big budget sci-fi flick, but in the following years, we got Alien, Blade Runner, The Thing and the Star Trek movies. Success is inspiring – even when it happens to our rivals.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterDeath StrandingMinecraftCall The MidwifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you wouldn’t bet against this cat with nine lives high-achieving his way to award recognition this year, so confident is his comic voice, so frothy and delightful the hour we spend in his company. Rare is the standup with nary a grump, not a whisper of self-importance nor a scintilla of cynicism – just effervescent joy taken in our company, the world and so many wonderful things in it.And erudition, too, and surprising ideas to undergird the giddy comedy. An act much given to sweeping historico-cultural theses attends in This Must Be Heaven to gluttony, its distinction from greed, and how it challenges the individualism of our age. Tothill’s case study is the Georgian-era guzzler Edward Dando, who ate oysters by the barrowload and refused to pay for them. What a hero, argues our host – at least once he’s dispensed all the absolutely essential gossip that forms the first third of the show.Comedian John Tothill: ‘My second near-death experience? I blame the bedtime cheesy chips’Read moreHow much of that is extemporised, who knows, as the Essex man riffs ecstatically on how his audience is dressed, on a trip to the Margate Crab Museum, and on a dread experience he recently had gigging aboard a cruise ship. (“It made the House of Lords look like Love Island.”) No one is better at making this stuff seem as if it’s tripping apropos of nothing off his tongue, and few bring to it such vivacity.A buffet interaction on that fateful cruise gives the show its moral, which is to be grateful not grizzly at the abundance life puts our way. You might ascribe that life-affirming credo, shot through the entire act, to the most recent of Tothill’s brushes with death: he gives us a lurid account here of the exploded appendix that up-ended his 2024 fringe. Perhaps the “stupid and immature” (his doctor’s words) recklessness that risked ending it all is the flipside of Tothill’s zest for life, this committed self-indulger’s paradoxical negation of the self. Here’s to him safely surviving the fringe this month; he’s certainly thriving at it.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

The two performers of Emergency Chorus open with a curious duet, striking a series of poses like human semaphore signs. Hard to know what it is all about, but it is the start of the show and they do it with poise and concentration so you give them the benefit of the doubt.Indeed, things then seem to come into focus with a scene about barometers and the pioneering days of weather forecasting. The Victorians knew they were on to something when they realised they could measure changes in air pressure, but it took time to interpret the signs. A jokey scene much later on, in which Potter-Sweet plays an earnest and garrulous interviewer at a science conference quizzing Kulvichit as a taciturn, long-bearded mystic hermit, confirms Ways of Knowing is about attempts to predict the future.Pickled Republic review –  a curious cabaret of jarring vegetablesRead moreBut this raises two questions. One is what the intervening scenes are supposed to add. There is a vigorous dance sequence in which the two stamp out a syncopated beat for rather a long time, which could mean anything, and a gloomy section crawling around a coal mine – a reference, perhaps, to deep time and the bedding down of carbon over centuries. Or perhaps not.The other question is, even if we could puzzle out a meaning from this deliberate collision of scenes and styles, what do Potter-Sweet and Kulvichit have to say about it? It is true that in this time of climate emergency, artists find it hard to conceive of a future. But this introspective show, one of the winners of the 2025Underbelly Untapped award, seems nervous about even doing that much.

They entered the residence, removed property, and then fled.”After a surveillance operation, four suspects aged from 16-18 were arrested, and “numerous items taken” were recovered. McDonnell added that the suspects were “documented or affiliated with a criminal street gang”.Pitt’s home, in the Los Feliz neighbourhood of Los Angeles, was reportedly ransacked while the actor was on a promotional tour for his most recent film,F1. Other well-known figures reporting burglaries in recent months include actors Nicole Kidman and Austin Butler, and the footballerOlivier Giroud, who played for Los Angeles FC last season.McDonnell suggested that criminals were using increasingly sophisticated methods of targeting victims, including wifi jammers to knock out surveillance cameras, and monitoring celebrities’ movements on social media. He also said that gangs were fully aware that juveniles (under 18s) were treated differently by the US justice system.Explore more on these topicsBrad PittUS crimeLos AngelesCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Certified pedophiles”. The track was hugely popular, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and was performed at the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show. Its artwork features an image of Drake’s home dotted with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.Drake has strenuously denied the allegation that he is a paedophile. In his lawsuit filed in January, UMG is alleged to have “approved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track”, that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response”. Drake is not suing Lamar himself.UMG said the suit was “utterly without merit” but in April, Drake’s lawyers added an amendment to the suit, arguing that the Super Bowl performance “further solidified the public’s belief in the truth of the allegations against Drake”. UMG said Drake was “being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another”.View image in fullscreenUMG claim that Grainge (pictured) ‘is not involved in record releases or marketing activities, even high-profile ones’.Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagicOn Tuesday, Drake’s lawyers filed two new motions in the case, calling on the judge in the case to compel UMG to “collect, review, and produce” relevant documents from Grainge, arguing: “UMG’s refusal to permit relevant discovery into its CEO’s files is unsupported by law and would prejudice plaintiff’s ability to test and prove his claims.”The motion argues that Drake “now also has reason to believe that Grainge was personally involved in decisions made regarding the marketing and promotion of [Not Like Us] around its release … Given that plaintiff has alleged Grainge to be one of the individuals at UMG who acted with actual malice, plaintiff is entitled to seek discovery into Grainge’s files for the purpose of proving Grainge’s actual malice”.A letter from UMG’s legal team to Drake’s in July, denying access to Grainge’s documents, reads: “UMG has maintained since our first meet and confer on this topic that Sir Lucian had no meaningful involvement in the matters and decisions at issue in this litigation. Sir Lucian runs a global multinational company; he is not involved in record releases or marketing activities around individual tracks, even high-profile ones.” It adds that “to the extent his documents and communications contain any (limited) relevant information, it is expected to be cumulative and duplicative” of other UMG staff communications that the company has agreed to make available.Lawyers for Drake claim UMG’s position has slightly changed from a previous claim of “no role in the matters”, to “no meaningful involvement”.The second motion from Drake’s team seeks a different set of documents, “related to UMG’s historical censorship” of artists, arguing that UMG has the right to censor works when they contain defamatory statements, and has previously exercised that right.It also argues that UMG encouraged competition between two of its labels: Republic, which releases Drake’s music, and Interscope, which releases Lamar’s. The specific allegation is “that the incentive structure for executives at UMG’s labels motivated UMG to defame Drake”. The motion requests various financial documents, as well as Lamar’s unredacted record contract.UMG has not commented on the newly filed motions. The Guardian has contacted the company’s legal team for comment.UMG is seeking to have the case dismissed,claiming in Marchthat Drake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated … diss tracks are a popular and celebrated artform centred around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed”.Explore more on these topicsMusicDrakeKendrick LamarHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

It was good, spooky fun until it wasn’t. I recall movement and the start of a message before we recoiled from the board. Later that evening, I learned that my grandfather had died. While I realise now that a boy with a terminally ill relative and a lurid imagination was not the most reliable witness, I remember wanting to believe that I’d had a brush with the uncanny.When Times journalist Ben Machell’s dying grandmother bequeathed him a crystal ball, he began idly searching for mediums and happened acrossthe work of a man named Tony Cornell. Between 1952 and 2004, Cornell worked (unpaid and to the detriment of two marriages) for the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Weeding out deception and delusion from accounts of paranormal activity to find out what, if anything, remained, Britain’s most diligent parapsychologist was more claims adjuster than ghostbuster. His answering machine filled up with pleas to investigate strange happenings around the country: a trawlerman mauled by an invisible hound, a house that bled water, a rural bungalow plagued by fires and expiring pets.Machell has honoured Cornell with an entrancing biography. Drawing on boxes of tapes and documents, an unpublished memoir and interviews with relatives and contemporaries, he hears “the steady voice of a rational man methodically tapping the wall between reality and something else”. Cornell’s approach was approvingly described as “probing-doubt”: curious without being credulous, sensitive yet rigorous. In 1977, he clashed with two SPR colleagues over the infamous Enfield poltergeist: a hoax, he decided, but they got a bestselling book out of it while Cornell’s work, Machell writes, was largely “unheralded, unrewarded and appreciated only by a small group of people”. Machell’s elegantly thrilling yarn encompasses the broad history of paranormal research in the UK. In the middle of the 19th century, the tension between science and religion inspired a craze for “proof” of life after death in the form of spiritualism – seances, clairvoyants,automatic writing– and a subsequent desire to assess its veracity. The SPR was founded in 1882, in a “spirit of exact and unimpassioned inquiry”. Its members, including Lewis Carroll, future prime minister Arthur Balfour and psychologist William James, pioneered concepts such as telepathy and ectoplasm while exposing fraudulent mediums and “spirit photographers”.In the mid-19th century, the tension between science and religion inspired a craze for ‘proof’ of life after deathThe SPR proved so adept at debunking charlatans that Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass exodus of aggrieved spiritualists in 1930. The author’s nemesis was the American researcher JB Rhine, whose new field of parapsychology focused on psychic phenomena rather than the spirit realm. A poltergeist, for example, might actually be “recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis” – the violent discharge of mental energy by the living. Rhine’s secular approach appealed to Soviet materialists, who explored telepathy as a potential cold war weapon. The physiologist Leonid Vasiliev, whom Tony Cornell visited in Leningrad in 1962, possibly at the behest of MI6, claimed that explaining extrasensory perception would be as significant as discovering atomic energy.The more concepts such as telekinesis excited the public, though, the more uneasy the group’s rationalist wing became. In the 1970s, the decade of Uri Geller and Stephen King’s Carrie, Cornell’s mentor Eric Dingwall snapped and repudiated parapsychology for feeding a “new occultism”. Yet Cornell persisted. Even as he exposed numerous instances of mischief, attention-seeking and hallucination, he personally encountered a handful of phenomena that defied rational explanation. It was a mind-boggling experience in postwar India, too good to spoil here, that set him on this path in the first place. He still sought answers.During the 1990s, to his surprise, Cornell’s answering machine fell silent. He wondered whether conspiracy theories had supplanted the paranormal in the public imagination, or perhaps digital distractions had dulled our receptivity to psychic disturbances. But had he not died in 2010, he would have seen a new generation of ghost hunters do a roaring trade on YouTube, where there is no financial incentive for his brand of cautious analysis. As Dingwall feared, entertainment has trumped genuine investigation.Like many a biographer, Machell falls half in love with his subject. Cornell was respected within the SPR for his diplomacy and his “consistent willingness to be wrong”. Parapsychology may not be widely accepted as a branch of science, but Cornell had a true scientist’s commitment to doubt and impartiality. At a time when beliefs leave facts in the dust, it’s easy to share Machell’s admiration for a man who was willing to say: “I don’t know.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Its short, punchy chapters tell the story of plump, hapless Stanley Yelnats, sent to a summer camp for wayward boys, where a terrifying Warden has peculiar ideas about character reformation. The 5ft-deep holes the boys are required to dig turn out to have a surprising purpose. Shifts of time, register and perspective render a simple premise mesmerisingly intricate. It has peril, love, crime, wickedness, redemption and friendship in, well, spades.A quarter of a century later, Sachar has written his first supposedly adult novel, in which many of the same ingredients reappear. A man “dressed like a typical American tourist”, but with an odd habit of storing cake crumbs in the pocket of his hoodie, has arrived at the castle of the title, filled with curiosity to see how much has changed in the past 500 years. He seems to know intimate details about daily life back then in the court of King Sandro, Queen Corinna and the headstrong teenage princess, Tullia. Anatole, the king’s bumbling magician and alchemist, was fast losing prestige due to his abject failure to turn black sand, brought in from Iceland at huge expense, into gold. But the magician evidently achieved one stunning success, for Anatole is our present-day narrator. Grisly legends have built up around the castle, as eagerly related by the tour guide, but are full of errors. Anatole decides to recount the real story.There’s a dash of Patrick Süskind’s Perfume in Anatole’s experiments, but without that novel’s sombre heftThis former contemporary and rival of Leonardo da Vinci, now an immortal wanderer, explains how the near-bankrupt kingdom of Esquaveta depended for survival on a dynastic marriage between Princess Tullia and Prince Dalrympl of wealthy Oxatania; his betrothal gift of a tiger gave the castle its name. But Tullia loved Pito, a young scribe. Incensed, Dalrympl demanded that Pito be beheaded during the wedding feast. Anatole was tasked with ensuring the royal wedding went ahead and thus saving the realm. Timid and compromised, he brewed various bizarre concoctions supposed to inspire love and delete memories, but became embroiled in the lovers’ situation, especially after recognising Dalrympl as the swine who caused the death of Babette, his own sweetheart.The portrayal of science in the period is lightly comical but never patronising. Although he can’t conceive of a building block of matter any smaller than a grain of sand, Renaissance-era Anatole is almost on the point of discovering penicillin via his experiments with mouldy bread. In the present day he has centuries of scientific discovery to call upon; all the same, he muses, is the notion of the four humours any more fantastical a metaphor than the periodic table? Operating at the birth of modern science, Anatole had it both ways, creating effective medicines while also commanding respect as a controller of evil spirits.Despite a daring escape, pursuit and the threat of retribution, the air of whimsy throughout mitigates any sense of genuine peril (and we obviously know Anatole survives). Just as inHoles, Sachar knots plot threads together in unexpected and satisfying ways. There’s a dash of Patrick Süskind’sPerfumein Anatole’s experiments, but without that novel’s sombre heft. If the narration were given over to Tullia or Pito, this would be a standard YA novel; but then we’d be without the pleasures of Anatole’s long view and his gentle scepticism about love, war, human nature and politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

(It comes between Sex andDreams.) It is a thoroughly grownup and absorbing drama, acted with such sympathy and warmth, a ruminative and exploratory movie of ideas, and one that pays its audience the compliment of treating them as intelligent beings. Love is about a familiar question: can straight people learn from or even absorb the open and polygamous approach to sex that appears to come easier to gay people (and perhaps younger people of all sexualities), perhaps specifically gay men? Or is that idea stereotypical and naive?Andrea Braein Hovig plays Marianne, a urology consultant whose job it is to give bad news to a succession of men about their prostate cancer. She is single (though her past romantic life remains a mystery); her best friend, Heidi (Marte Engebrigtsen), tries to set her up with a divorced friend. But Marianne finds herself restive with the whole monolithic idea of dating and relationships and she is fascinated with what her nurse Tor (Tayo Cittadella Jacobsen) tells her about his own life. After work, she encounters him on their commuter ferry and he candidly tells her he uses Grindr to set up exciting, ephemeral encounters on this very craft.But it is Tor who is to develop serious feelings for one of his hook-ups – a urology patient at the hospital – and Marianne who experiments with openness, which is to upset others who feel obscurely threatened. Perhaps some of the characters are a bit too good to be true, and Marianne’s shrewd warning to Tor about immediately developing a “nurse” relationship to a partner is something whose implications are not heeded. Haugerud has something of Eric Rohmer, and perhaps a little more of Hong Sang-soo; a readiness to simply talk, and talk and talk some more. It’s surprisingly cinematic.Oslo Stories Trilogy: Love is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsNorwayRelationshipsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Truffle around the internet and you’ll find a saga to rival the finest in Old Norse about deals signed and projects greenlit and then abandoned over the years, with names attached to direct ranging from X-Men’s Bryan Singer to Transparent’s Joey Soloway. What a shame Soloway’s version never got off the ground because that surely would have been a hoot, and probably more interesting than this soggy, CGI-infused, low-budget confection that’s finally arrived.Little-known actor Matilda Lutz gets the lead role this time around, as well as getting all the hair extensions in the auburn aisle. She presents a Sonja that’s more a pixie-like hippy chick than Nielsen’s Valkyrie heroine, a bit of a loner who mostly kicks around the forest with her beloved horse. Sonja finds herself sucked, at first unenthusiastically, into camaraderie after she is captured by evil emperor Draygan (Robert Sheehan, clearly enjoying himself) and compelled to fight in gladiatorial combats. Sometimes her opponents are the other prisoners, and sometimes they are gargantuan amalgamations of pixels and VFX fairy dust, including a grumpy cyclops roughly the size of a tower block who is controlled by Draygan with what looks like a magic torch. Wallis Day plays another antagonist with bleached eyebrows and agonising visions of all the people she’s ever killed, just to show that baddies have backstories too.Indeed, there’s quite a lot of backstorying going on here, with lashings of flashbacks as we find out how Sonja came to be a lonely child of the forest, how other characters got roped into all this, and even what makes Draygan so mean. The action sequences, which are what made the original Sonja so indelible (especially since Nielsen hadArnold Schwarzeneggeras a co-star), are a bit more rote. But someone somewhere must have done a punch-up on the script, because every now and then a reasonably witty quip arrives out of nowhere before the dialogue reverts to faux medieval speak.Red Sonja is on digital platforms from 18 August, and on DVD & Blu-ray from 8 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsBrigitte NielsenArnold SchwarzeneggerRobert SheehanreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the film is set in 1593, the reference by screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard is clearly to The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which romances overcome deceit and disguise and the clown Launce has a canine companion, Crab, who is prone to steal the show.During times of tight cultural budgets, such as now, there is an old theatre joke about the RSC being forced to put on One Gentlemen of Verona. Joanna Bowman’s revival doesn’t quite go that far but has radically cut the text (removing some but not all smut, the antisemitism and some sub-par poetry) for a running time advertised at 80 minutes but in performance 90. The aim is to attract younger audiences: the evening show time is a bedtime-friendly 5pm.View image in fullscreenFull production numbers … The Two Gentlemen of Verona at Stratford.Photograph: Helen MurrayParents and teachers will perhaps advise their charges not to find templates for future relationships in the ruthless trickery between friends Valentine (Jonny Khan) and Proteus (Lance West) when both fall for Sylvia (Siân Stephens), prompting Proteus to fool cruelly current girlfriend Julia (Aisha Goodman). As Stephens is making a professional stage debut and the other three are also early in their careers, this confident and engaging quartet suggest the RSC has access to a flow of future talent.And, as ever, they do well to compete with the bit with the dog. Bowman and stage-handler Launce (a gamely upstaged Stu McLoughlin) completely fail to make Lossi, a silver haired lady lurcher, the “sourest-natured dog that lives” as Crab is called in the text. Lossi draws an instant “Aaaah!” from young and some older throats, especially when giving a presumably impromptu wide yawn during one of the longer speeches.View image in fullscreenYawning on cue … Lossi as Crab with her stage handler Stu McLoughlin as Launce.Photograph: Helen MurrayAlthough some scholars make rigorous cases for the play being underrated, it seems reasonable to infer that Shakespeare was relying on Crab to divert the audience from sections that might have done with a refill of the quill. The director follows suit by adding other hectic distractions when the dog is not on. Actors slide down poles on Francis O’Connor’s two-tier scaffolded set and, in the multitalented cast of 10, only Lossi doesn’t play an instrument. The act four song, Who Is Sylvia?, usually a solo, becomes a full production number (composer John Patrick Elliott, music director Dan de Cruz) with guitars, violin and chorales.In Shakespeare in Love, the dramatist informs an appalled Henslowe that there will be “no dog at all” in Romeo and Juliet. But, if there were awards for onstage dogs (the Bonies?), Lossi would win one and the RSC should probably check out the possibility of walkies-on roles elsewhere in the canon. Until then, she and her human co-stars provide a late summer afternoon’s dream.AtThe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreWilliam ShakespeareRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In particular, he will be remembered for his writing and playing contributions to the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970), often considered Clapton’s finest achievement.Clapton first came across Whitlock, a keyboard player and singer, who has died of cancer aged 77, when he was a member of the rock-soul actDelaney & Bonnieand Friends (formed by the married couple Bonnie and Delaney Bramlett). Clapton liked them so much that he recruited them as the opening act for his band Blind Faith on their sole tour in 1969, and they would also appear on Clapton’s first solo album, Eric Clapton (1970). The live album On Tour with Eric Clapton (1970) cracked the US Top 30 and was Delaney & Bonnie’s most successful release.Whitlock quit the Delaney & Bonnie band after recording their album To Bonnie from Delaney (1970), and hooked up with Clapton in England. Along with two further Delaney & Bonnie alumni, the bassist Carl Radle and the drummerJim Gordon, the foursome became Derek and the Dominos, a name designed to give Clapton a measure of anonymity after his “supergroup” excesses with Cream and Blind Faith. As Whitlock put it to the Best Classic Bands website: “He wanted to be Derek, not Eric. He wasn’t ready to step into his role as a solo artist at that time.”View image in fullscreenEric Clapton playing the guitar next to a floral-shirted Whitlock in the dressing room of the Lyceum Ballroom, London, in 1970.Photograph: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty ImagesThe Layla double album (recorded at Criteria studios in Miami) was a pivotal release in Clapton’s history. It reached only No 16 on the US chart and did not chart at all in Britain, but its reputation grew steadily over succeeding decades. It was a momentous feat for Whitlock too, since he co-wrote six of the album’s songs with Clapton, includingBell Bottom Blues,Anyday,Tell the TruthandWhy Does Love Got to Be So Sad?, and played acoustic guitar and sang on his solo compositionThorn Tree in the Garden.This was a feverishly creative period, since the Dominos band came together while all four members were simultaneously involved in recording Harrison’s triple album All Things Must Pass, his first solo effort since the demise of the Beatles. When Harrison took a break from the sessions, he invited the foursome to use the studio, which enabled the Dominos to record their first single, Tell the Truth, with Roll It Over (another Clapton/Whitlock composition) for the B side. Intriguingly, while Clapton was inspired to writeLayla’s title song by his infatuation with Harrison’s wife, Pattie Boyd, Whitlock dated Pattie’s sister, Paula, while he was in Britain. Whitlock later sold his rights to royalties from Derek and the Dominos, but Clapton and his management helped him to get them back.Bobby was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to James Whitlock and his wife, Ruby, and grew up in the city’s Millington district. James was a Baptist preacher renowned for his fiery oratory, traces of which could be discerned in his son’s singing. Bobby also first played the piano in his father’s church. As a teenager, Bobby could frequently be found at Memphis’s renowned Stax Records, where he got to know many of the local artists, including Booker T & the MGs, Albert King andSam& Dave. He added handclaps to Sam & Dave’s 1968 classic I Thank You. “It was a great time and town for music then, especially soul music,” he recalled. “It was loose and all about music everywhere that you turned.”As a professional musician Whitlock cut his teeth playing keyboards in the local bands the Short Cuts and the Counts, and Stax planned to record an album with him on its subsidiary label, Hip Records, making him the first white artist signed to Stax. However, Whitlock felt that they were trying to turn him into a lightweight pop artist – “It turned out to be bubblegum garbage music that they recorded with me” – so he was delighted to be recruited by the Bramletts instead. He travelled to Los Angeles to join them, and as he recalled it: “We started Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, just Delaney and Bonnie and myself.”Whitlock asserted that Derek and the Dominos were “the very best band on the planet … We were better than anybody,” but their progress was cut short by a surfeit of drugs and alcohol. The rock critic Robert Palmer described how he visited the Layla recording sessions in Miami and found that “there was a lot of dope around, especially heroin, and when I showed up, everyone was just spread out on the carpet, nodded out.”The Dominos split in 1971 after an abortive attempt to record a second album, though all the band members as well as the Bramletts and Harrison appeared on Whitlock’s debut solo album,Bobby Whitlock (1972). Reflecting on the Dominos in the Houston Press, Whitlock commented that “I am very happy that the one studio record was the ‘one’ and that was it. It never will have anything other than itself to be compared to.”He would release three more solo albums during the 70s, while his other musical activities included adding vocals to Dr John’s album The Sun, Moon & Herbs (1971) and an appearance on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street (1972). For the latter, Whitlock claimed he had co-written the trackI Just Want to See His Face, but was not given a songwriting credit. In 1973 he played organ on Down the Road, the second album by Stephen Stills’s band Manassas, but found himself deprived of a songwriting credit for the trackCity Junkies, which was based on a jam between Whitlock and the drummer Dallas Taylor.During the 80s and 90s, Whitlock largely retired from music and retreated to a farm in Mississippi. He made a musical comeback in 1999 with the albumIt’s About Time. On Christmas Eve 2005 he married CoCo Carmel, a musician who had been married to Delaney Bramlett from 1987 to 2000, and the pair of them recorded several albums and made regular live appearances. From 2006 to 2021 they lived in Austin, then moved to Ozona, Texas. In recent years he became a keen painter, and frequently had his work displayed in galleries.In 2010 he published a memoir, Bobby Whitlock: A Rock’n’Roll Autobiography, co-authored with Marc Roberty and with a foreword by Clapton. In May 2024 he was awarded a brass note on the Beale Street Walk of Fame in Memphis, an event he commemorated with a new song,Walking on Beale Street.He is survived by CoCo, his childrenAshley, Beau and Tim,and his sister, Debbie.Robert Stanley Whitlock, musician, singer and songwriter, born 18 March 1948; died 10 August 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockEric ClaptonobituariesShareReuse this content"

His work blurred the line between art and craft. He combined and developed his interest in clay as a sculptural material from its origins in domestic pottery. His latter work combined work thrown on the potter’s wheel and hand construction.Peter also held a lifelong interest in music, particularly jazz. As a drummer he provided the rhythmic foundation for traditional jazz bands and in particular for Acker Bilk. His love for the music developed from the trad bands of his youth to the abstract expressionism ofOrnette Coleman.He was indebted to traditional British potters – in particularBernard Leachof the St Ives Pottery. His appreciation of the abstract and the expressive allowed him to, in his later work, to explore improvised unconventional ceramic forms.Born inBristolto Ethel (nee Sanders), a bank employee, and Norman Smith, who worked for the British Aircraft Corporation, Peter attended Bristol Technical school; in 1961 he went to Battersea College of Technology (later the University of Surrey) to study metallurgy. He started out as a research scientist for the British Iron and Steel Association, where he worked for seven years. During his time there he was involved in the invention of “foamed steel”, which provides the basis of the foamed metals used in heat exchangers today.View image in fullscreenSmith encouraged an understanding of the medium of clay as an expressive and practical formHe also attended pottery classes run by Robert and Sheila Fournier at the Chaucer Institute in London with his wife, Jane (nee Furlonger), whom he had met at Battersea, where she was studying physics; they married in 1966.Six years later they moved to the south-west tip ofCornwall, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. He started by making a large coal-fired climbing kiln, and produced domestic earthenware using traditional methods. Soon afterwards he was voted a full member of the Craftsman Potters Association (CPA), of which he was later voted a fellow. The Victoria and Albert Museum bought two pieces of work from his exhibition at the CPA in London.Peter’s understanding of other artists’ work steered him first of all to become a member of Newlyn Society of Artists and then later to become the chairman of Newlyn Gallery, in which capacity he promoted exhibitions of early work by Damien Hirst, John Bellany and Maggi Hambling, among others.In the 1980s and 90s, Peter was also an influential teacher of ceramics at Falmouth University, where he encouraged a spontaneous and improvised approach based on developing technique and an understanding of the medium of clay as an expressive and practical form.He worked continually until illness prevented him from doing so in the last few months of his life. Latterly he produced more complex, fluid assemblages, emphasising the clay’s plasticity with the addition of wire and other initially extraneous material. He quietly pursued his voyage of discovery in ceramics for as long as time allowed.He is survived by Jane and his siblings, Laurence and Susan.Explore more on these topicsCeramicsOther livesArtJazzBristolCornwallobituariesShareReuse this content"

Celebrating 60 years of the Mountain Bothies AssociationThey may be the most basic form of shelter imaginable, but for the author of The Book of the Bothy they embody the magic of staying in the wild, even on a wet weekend in the Lake DistrictPhoebe SmithWed 13 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 13 Aug 2025 02.02 EDTShare‘Do you think I’m going to be cold?” asks my friend Ellie as we navigate the winding roads of Mosedale, on the north-eastern reaches of the Lake District, while rain batters against the windscreen. It’s a fair question. Both the Met Office and Mountain Weather Information Service are clear – being in the Lakeland hills will not be pleasant this Friday night, due to a sudden cold and wet snap. But there’s another reason she’s asking. I’m taking her to stay in her first bothy – that’s a mountain shelter left open, year-round, for walkers, climbers and outdoor enthusiasts to use, free of charge, with no way to book.Unlike mountain huts in other parts of Europe and the world, they weren’t built for this purpose. They are old buildings left to ruin in wild places – former coastguard lookouts, gamekeepers’ cottages, remote Highland schoolrooms – before the Mountain Bothies Association (MBA) began to maintain them, offering shelter in a storm. And during this particular storm, shelter is definitely needed.View image in fullscreenFording a nearby stream.Photograph: Phoebe SmithBefore we left, Ellie was worried about what to pack, and well she might be. Despite a bothy having four walls, a roof, windows and a front door (they range from tiny, one-room affairs to sprawling, multi-bedroom structures), they are still very basic. There is no running water (there’s usually a stream nearby for this), no toilet (each has a bothy spade so you can dig your own) and no electricity (tealights and a headtorch are a must), and the one we are heading to, Great Lingy Hut, doesn’t even have the usual bothy stove for warmth.We reach the bothy and knock on the door with mild trepidation, to discover if anyone else has beaten us to itYet it’s precisely for these reasons that I’ve chosen it to be Ellie’s first. I know that because of the bad weather it’s unlikely we’ll have to share with anyone else. We park at the base of Carrock Fell, where the River Caldew is now a raging torrent. It is past dusk; the rain has eased to a mere mizzle and we can just make out the shape of the building on the skyline. With backpacks shouldered we begin uphill, keeping our eyes open for signs of walkers who may have potentially beaten us to it.“Visitor numbers have definitely gone up in recent years,” the chair of the MBA, Simon Birch, tells me when I speak to him the night before. “Of course, back in the day they were kept a secret – some old documents I was going through have ‘confidential’ written across them. But people can’t keep secrets like this.”View image in fullscreenPhoebe (left) and Ellie keeping warm in the unheated bothy.It was in 2009 that the MBA decided to publish grid references to its 100-strong network on its website – despite some internal protests. After that, the “cat was out of the bag”, says Birch. When the MBA celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2015, I asked and was granted permission to write the first guidebook about bothies – as a love letter to them, rather than a definitive guide. There was a lot of pushback, though. When The Book of the Bothy was published, I experienced online trolling (from MBA members and others), abusive emails, complaints to my publisher and even threats. But at the same time, one of the MBA’s co-founders, Betty Heath, told me how much she loved my passion; Birch told me that younger members began to sign up (when there was a real danger of membership ageing out); and now there is even a female thirtysomething trustee.Out of the 105 bothies they currently look after, only two are owned by the MBA. All the others are on leases. “Ultimately, we could lose all our bothies, if the owners decided to take them back,” says Birch – which proves just how special the network and ethos of bothies is.The hut we head to in the Lakes was originally used by miners at the nearby and now disused Carrock Mine (which dates back to the 16th century). It was relocated to its higher location on the moor as a shooting box. During the 1960s it was leased to the “Friends” Quaker boarding school in Wigton as an outdoor base and was fitted with a sleeping platform. When that school closed in 1984, it became an open shelter, and eventually the Lake District national park took responsibility for its maintenance before handing it over to the MBA in 2017.View image in fullscreenWe were at peace, away from the madness of our day-to-day lives.Photograph: Phoebe SmithWe pass the mine workings under a starry sky, so they appear only as silhouettes. We ford the stream with the help of walking poles and mutual words of encouragement. Finally, we reach the door and experience the anticipatory few seconds that anyone who’s ever stayed in a bothy will know – when after hours of walking you knock on the door with mild trepidation, to discover if anyone else has beaten you to it. The door swings open. It’s empty. We have it to ourselves.We enjoy our breakfast beside the window, where a lifting fog offers tantalising views down this little-visited valley“The biggest change has been the impact that the growing popularity of long-distance trails has had on the bothies,” Simon tells me. “Some of the spots are incredibly well used, and we now have a sanitation officer in the MBA.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Put candles and the camping stove in the designated area so as not to cause a fire risk. Use the spade for the toilet – well away from the building and any watercourses. Set up a bag for waste. As a countryside girl, she has a good idea of the code – but Birch says a problem the MBA is facing in its 60th year is that content creators are showing people the bothies on social media but not teaching good practice. As such, in a very modern move, the MBA is seeking creators to collaborate with it, to demonstrate responsible bothying.We settle in, heating a pre-made tagine and making hot chocolates to keep us warm. I also fill hot-water bottles. We chat for hours, me regaling Ellie with stories of previous bothy visits – including the time I inadvertently crashed a stag party in Scotland.The wind whistles through the cables that hold Great Lingy Hut down, but despite this, as mothers of young children, we both sleep well away from the madness of our day-to-day lives.In search of the UK’s finest mountain view: walking in Northern Ireland’s MournesRead moreRecent figures put the MBA membership at 3,800 – with many more users who don’t pay the annual £25 donation to join.

We pack not only our own rubbish but empty packets and used candle holders left by others. “I love it,” says Ellie, “leaving it better than we arrived.” She may have begun this adventure worried about feeling cold but, thanks to the magic of bothies, is leaving as many do, warmed by the whole wild and wonderful experience.For more information visit theMountain Bothies Association.The Book of the Bothy by Phoebe Smithis available for£12.95fromguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsLake District holidaysWalking holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Have you noticed the sheer abundance of fruit this year? The branches are heavy and the ground is scattered with fallen fruit. Last weekend, I harvested about 10kg plums from our tree, and my daughter suggested we make a jam tart. It turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever eaten, sweet yet sharp, sticky and rich. A simple, seasonal treat.Raining plum jam tartFrom plum to pear, every fruit tree I pass this year seems to be laden with fruit. This kind of bumper crop is known as a mast year. Some fruit trees swing naturally between light and heavy harvests from year to year, depending on whether they’re focusing energy on growth or fruiting, and it’s thought that this cycle may be an evolutionary tactic to support seed dispersal. By producing a glut, more fruit is eaten and spread by animals. This recipe is a great way to turn that glut – whether that’s a discounted punnet of berries, windfall apples or a bag of scrumped plums – into something to savour. Jams are one of the simplest and most delicious ways to preserve the season. If you’re making your own pastry, don’t forget to save any scraps to weave a lattice topping orshape into biscuits. I like to season mine with a little olive oil and whole spices before baking.For the jam500g plums250g unrefined sugar½ unwaxed lemon, ideally organic, cut into four wedges1 large blind baked tart case, homemade (see below and method) or bought in150g shortcrust pastry, for the lattice topping (optional)For the pastry (optional)300g wholemeal flour(eg, khorasan, emmer or spelt), plus extra for dusting150g cold butter, dicedA pinch ofsalt3 medium eggsWash and stone the plums, then put them in a thick-based saucepan with the sugar and lemon wedges. Bring the pan to a boil on a medium heat, then turn down to a simmer (take care the mix doesn’t boil over). After 20-30 minutes, once the jam has started to reduce and turn thick and sugary, take it off the heat (if you have a thermometer, boil the plum mix to 101C, to make a loose jam).To make your own wholemeal pastry case, in a food processor blend the flour, cold diced butter and a pinch of salt for 30 seconds, until the butter is finely mixed into the flour. Add two of the eggs and two tablespoons of cold water, then pulse for about 30 seconds, until the pastry comes together into a ball; add a touch more water, if need be.Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead very briefly, until evenly mixed. Shape into a thick round disc, place on a plate, cover with an upturned bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin, turning the dough as you go and dusting with more flour if it threatens to stick. Once the pastry round is large enough to line the base and sides of your tart case, roll it on to the pin and unroll it directly into the case. Gently ease the pastry it into the corners, then wrap the overhanging pastry up and over the rim, pressing it against the outer edge with a fork. Don’t worry if it cracks or any holes appear: that’s a sign of a nice “short” pastry – simply fill any gaps with leftover pastry or seal any cracks by pressing it back together. Next, using a serrated knife, trim the excess from the top and gather the offcuts into a ball. Chill and save for the lattice.How to turn excess pastry into moreish biscuits – recipeRead morePrick the base with a fork to stop it puffing up, then bake for about 18 minutes, until just cooked and lightly browned. Meanwhile, make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg with 30ml water. Take the baked case out of the oven, brush with the egg wash (this will fill any fork holes) and return to the oven for another five minutes. Remove and leave to cool before filling (though if you want an extra glazed tart, repeat the glazing and baking for five minutes process once more).Fill your homemade or bought in pastry case with a 1cm layer of the plum jam. If you’ve made your own pastry, roll out 150g excess pastry into a rectangle the length of the inside of the case, cut into 1-1½cm-wide strips, then arrange in a lattice on top of the jam.Bake in a preheated 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 15 minutes, then remove and brush the lattice with an egg wash made from a little milk or a beaten egg thinned with a splash of water. Bake for a final five minutes, until golden, then remove, leave to cool and enjoy with creme fraiche, yoghurt or vanilla ice cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitBakingPastryDessertSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s peaches, nectarines and apricots that get all the glory. Well, more for me! Plums that haven’t flown in from far-flung places are best: sweet, tart, fleshy and complex in flavour. It’s a no-brainer to earmark them for comforting cakes and puddings, but they are an equally worthy companion for meat, such as duck, pork or fried chicken, because their natural sharpness cuts through any fatty richness.Sticky chicken wings with plum ketchup (pictured above)This ketchup is fruity, sweet and sharp, and the perfect thing to swipe moreish chicken wings through.Prep20 minMarinate1 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes6For the chicken wings4garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2cm piece ginger, peeled and grated1tsp sesame oil60ml soy sauce60ml Shaoxing rice wine, or mirin2tbsp maple syrup1tbsp chilli sauce, such as sambal oelek or sriracha2kg chicken wings6 spring onions, trimmed and sliced1 long red chilli,sliced30g toasted sesame seedsFor the ketchup1kg plums, stoned and coarsely chopped1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped1 star anise1 cinnamon stick4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced4cm piece ginger, peeled and grated100g soft brown sugar100ml white-wine vinegar60ml soy sauce2tspChinese five-spiceHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line two baking trays with greaseproof paper. In a large bowl, stir the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine, maple syrup and chilli sauce until well combined. Add the chicken wings, toss to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, or overnight.Meanwhile, make the ketchup. Put the plums, onion, star anise, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the five-spice and simmer, stirring frequently, for 20-25 minutes, until the mix thickens. Fish out and discard the star anise and cinnamon, then puree the sauce with a stick blender until smooth and transfer to a serving bowl (or decant into a sterilised jar or bottle, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for three months).Transfer the wings to the lined trays and bake for 40-45 minutes, turning once halfway, until cooked through and nicely golden brown. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle over the spring onions, chilli and toasted sesame seeds, then serve with the ketchup.Sweet and sour pork with plumsView image in fullscreenPlums bring just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to this Chinese-inspired dish that’s perfect for serving with noodles or sticky rice.Prep20 minMarinate4 hr+Cook45 minServes41 tsp Chinese five-spice2 tsp light soy sauce2 tsp Shaoxing rice wine30g ginger, peeled and grated450g pork fillet or shoulder, trimmed and cut into 3cm chunks600ml sunflower oil1 egg, beaten75g cornflour1 large red onion, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks1 red and 1 yellow pepper, stalks, seeds and pith discarded, flesh cut into 2cm chunks1 large carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal600g plums, stoned and cut into bite-sized wedges6 spring onions, greens from 3 finely sliced, the rest sliced into 4cm batons2 red chillies, thinly sliced on the diagonal4garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedEgg noodles or rice, to serve (optional)For the sweet-and-sour sauce150ml chicken stock1 tbsp sriracha50ml tomato ketchup2 tbsp clear honey1 tbsp rice vinegar2 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp dark soy sauce½ tsp sesame oil1 tsp cornflourStart by marinating the pork. In a large bowl, combine the five-spice, light soy sauce, rice wine and ginger, then add the pork and toss to coat evenly. Cover and chill for at least four hours, or overnight.For the sauce, put all the ingredients except the cornflour in a small saucepan, whisk to combine and bring to a boil. Take off the heat and set aside.Line a plate with kitchen paper, then heat the oil in a wok (filling it by no more than half) to 180C (if you don’t have a digital probe thermometer, drop in a cube of bread– if it turns golden in 30 seconds, the oil is hot enough).Take the pork out of the fridge and mix in the beaten egg. Put the cornflour in a large bowl, add the pork (discard the excess marinade) and toss to coat. Working in two or three batches, deep-fry the pork for three to four minutes, turning halfway, until browned and crisp, then use a slotted spoon carefully to transfer it to the paper-lined plate. Carefully pour all but a tablespoon of the oil in the wok into a heatproof container (leave it to cool, then discard).Set the wok on a high heat, then stir-fry the red onion, peppers, carrot, plums and spring onion batons for five minutes, until just becoming tender but still with some bite. Add the chillies and garlic, stir-fry for a minute more, until fragrant, then pour in the sweet-and-sour sauce and leave it to come to a bubble. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of cornflour with a tablespoon of water, then gradually stir this into the wok to thicken the sauce. Add the drained fried pork, heat through for a minute or two, then scatter with the shredded spring onion greens and serve immediately with noodles or rice.Chai milk creme caramel with tea-poached plumsView image in fullscreenThese plums are just as wonderful eaten with thick yoghurt for a quick dessert or breakfast.Prep15 minCook1 hr 15 min, plus coolingInfuse1 hr+Makes6For the caramel100ml water150g caster sugarFor the set custard5green cardamom pods, bruised1tsp fennel seeds3 cloves1 stick cinnamon1tsp loose black tea leaves, or 1 teabag200ml whole milk350ml double cream2 eggs,plus 4yolks, beaten75g caster sugarFor the plums100g caster sugar1 teabag1 star anise1 cinnamon quill1 vanilla pod,split lengthways and the seeds scraped out150g caster sugar500g plums, halved and stonedTo make the caramel, put the water and sugar in a pan and heat gently until the sugar dissolves, swirling and titling the pan to help it along. Keep heating until the mix turns a deep brown, then pour into six ramekins, tilting to coat the bases and sides evenly. Set aside to cool and set.Heat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Put the spices, tea, milk and cream in a saucepan, bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to cool and infuse for one to two hours.In a bowl, whisk the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar. Slowly whisk in the infused cream, pouring it in through a strainer, then discard the solids. Put the ramekins in a roasting pan and pour in the custard. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, bake for an hour, then remove and leave to cool. Once cold, refrigerate the creme caramels until needed.Meanwhile, poach the plums. Tip the sugar into a pan with 200ml water, the tea and the spices, and heat gently until the sugar dissolves. Add the plums, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for five to 10 minutes, until the fruit is tender (this will depend on the plums’ ripeness). Take off the heat, leave to cool completely, then fish out and discard the spices and teabag.When you are ready to serve, briefly dip the base of each ramekin into hot water to loosen the creme caramel, then invert each one on to individual plates. Serve with the poached plums.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkFruitFoodMeatPorkChickenDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"
