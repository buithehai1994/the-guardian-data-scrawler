Back in 2002, screenwriter Garland and director Boyle had a monster hit with theirpost-apocalyptic horror thriller 28 Days Later, about a “rage” virus that leaks from a lab and, turning people into aggressive zombies, causes a complete law-and-order breakdown in 28 days; Boyle famously made smart use of then-new lightweight digital tech which let him bring off miracles of unlicensed guerrilla shooting at dawn in the deserted London streets.That was fierce, muscular film-making, though I have never been a fan of zombies whose massed presence (then as now) requires silly, gurning, ketchup-strewn extras who can’t be clearly looked at for any length of time without laughing. (For my money it was only Edgar Wright’s zombie horror comedy Shaun of the Dead, which came out two years afterwards, which fully explored the real, intimate horror of zombie-ism: the gap between being bitten and transforming.) In 2007,a lacklustre sequel, 28 Weeks Later,brought the franchise stumbling to a halt.Now we have 28 Years Later, an interesting, tonally uncertain development which takes a generational, even evolutionary leap into the future from the initial catastrophe, creating something that mixes folk horror, little-England satire and even a grieving process for all that has happened. And there are some colossal cameo appearances.We are now on Holy Island off England’s north-east coast, where a barricaded, self-governing community grows its own food, brews its own beer and stays apart from the British mainland – which is a lawless quarantined hellhole where zombies roam free, procreating and living off the vast herds of unculled deer. (There is a startling, unintended moment of sadness, incidentally: we get a glimpse of theSycamore Gap treenear Hadrian’s Wall, evidently filmed before it was cut down.)The Holy Island menfolk make foraging expeditions across the water via the causeway at low tide, killing zombies with bows and arrows to burnish their hunter-gatherer instincts. Some of these zombies are “alpha” runners, but others are slow-movers, natural for target practice: bulbous creatures crawling on their stomachs, resemblingLucian Freud’s painting Benefits Supervisor Sleeping.Spike (Alfie Williams) is a 12-year-old kid whose adored mum Isla (Jodie Comer) is unwell, confused and depressed. His dad Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) takes Spike on a sortie to the mainland, a rite of passage which brings him to manhood. But then Spike becomes obsessed with rumours of a “doctor” still living in this danger zone, who carries out bizarre rituals like a cross between Marlon Brando and Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now. Spike disobeys all the island’s rules by taking his mum with him out into this forbidden area, on a desperate quest to find this doctor who can cure her.Holy Island is certainly a fascinating place, ripe for scary film-making (as Roman Polanski showed with his 1966 movie Cul-de-Sac). Garland and Boyle give us some intriguing hints as to how the community has regressed into a kind of fortress mentality, living like a stone age version of the 50s. Archive clips of the archers of Agincourt in Olivier’s Henry V show their subconscious groupthink: pugnacious reliance on ancient warrior craft and a profound mistrust of the French.But, a little awkwardly, the film has to get us on to the mainland for some badass action sequences with real shooting weaponry – and then we have the two “alpha” cameos that it would be unsporting to reveal, but which cause the film to shunt between deep sadness and a bizarre, implausible (though certainly startling) graphic-novel strangeness, there to promote franchise continuation. So the zombies carry on at their dual speed, intriguing, but going in circles.28 Years Later is out on 19 June in Australia and 20 June in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsDanny BoyleAlex GarlandJodie ComerAaron Taylor-JohnsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

For me, “wrath” always comes last. (I shan’t say what’s first – too revealing.)Anger doesn’t feature in my day-to-day life. I even struggle to feel wrathful when it’s appropriate. World events make me fatalistic and depressed; when my gym instructor says to “let loose” on the ski machine, my effort remains constant. The time I visiteda rage room, my main takeaway was that the Metallica song I selected as the soundtrack sounded fantastic on big speakers.This might seem like a good thing: anger is rarely thought of as positive or productive. But is it true that I don’t feel anger – or am I just really good at repressing it?Systems are crumbling – but daily life continues. The dissonance is realRead more“When people say: ‘I never get angry,’ what they really mean is they just contain it really well – and often at their own expense,” says Sam Parker, a senior editor at British GQ and author ofGood Anger: How Rethinking Rage Can Change Our Lives.Parker wrote the book “for people-pleasers, conflict-avoiders and self-improvers”, drawing from scientific research, his own experience, and interviews with therapists and other experts.He used to believe that “the only people with an anger issue were the people who kept getting into fights and arguments, and losing their temper,” Parker tells me. “I had this idea that I was somehow beyond anger, or it was just of no use to me.”He did struggle with anxiety. And when he hit a rough patch in his 30s, Parker tried yoga, meditation, gratitude journaling and even cold showers. What worked? Boxing.A couple of months in, while letting loose on the bag, Parker was unexpectedly overcome by emotion, enough to wet his eyes. “For the first time in months I wasn’t sad or anxious,” he writes. “I was furious.”View image in fullscreen‘When people say “I never get angry,” what they really mean is they just contain it really well – and often at their own expense,” says Sam Parker.Photograph: Courtesy Sam ParkerOver time, it dawned on him: “The more that I recognised anger in myself, talked about it, processed it and eventually acted on it, the more my anxiety went down.”After that epiphany, Parker learned there was a well-established scientific link between anger and anxiety – it just wasn’t widely acknowledged.To him, it represented a critical oversight in the mental-health conversation. Anger is as natural as sadness, fear, happiness or disgust – but it’s often left out of the picture.In part, it’s a language problem, Parker explains. “In English, we conflate ‘anger’ with ‘aggression’ or even ‘violence’, as though they are the same thing.”But it is an especially challenging emotion to experience and be around. Even psychotherapists may avoid taking on openly angry patients, Parker learned in researching his book.Whether in pop science or academic research, “across the spectrum, anger is sort of neglected,” he says.Parker wrote Good Anger hoping to reframe the emotion, and help others understand, experience and express it differently. Anger is persistently seen as negative: “We tend to avoid talking about it altogetheruntilit has boiled over into aggression,” he says. This can compound the shame and stigma.“A lot of the time, aggressive behaviour is a choice we make,” says Parker. But the emotion itself is legitimate, exists to protect us – and often has something insightful to say.“We tend to think that anger’s telling us something about other people: how unreasonable they are, how they’re out to get us, why they’re idiots … Far more often, it’s pointing us towards an unmet need or event from the past,” he says.When proportionately experienced, anger is not only part of a balanced emotional mix – it can also be “a real source of determination, vitality and clarity”, Parker says, pointing us towards what we value and spurring us on.When he finally acknowledged and began attuning to his latent anger, “that was when I started to see the real benefits.”Parker’s right: it’s not really accurate for me to say “I never get angry.” I just avoid acknowledging it, or name it something more palatable, such as irritation or disappointment.I associate this aversion with my adolescence, when I frequently gave into anger, lashing out at my family and feeling unpleasantly out of control.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’But, I learn from Parker’s book, having been an angry teenager doesn’t necessarily make me an angry person.

Having high trait anger means you’re quicker than others to fly off the handle. “State anger”, on the other hand, is temporary, triggered by frustration or a perceived threat.“No one gets away without having state anger,” says Parker. The question is, how do you typically express it? Anger researchers distinguish between “anger-out” and “anger-in”: externalising the emotion through physical or verbal aggression, versus striving to contain it and, in doing so, turning it inwards.View image in fullscreenSam Parker wrote Good Anger ‘for people-pleasers, conflict-avoiders and self-improvers’.Photograph: BloomsburyThe former might be more familiar (and harder to ignore), but the “anger-in” crowd are suffering in silence, Parker says. Such containment is unsustainable and can carry a high personal cost: “Anger deferred is anger multiplied.”Refusing to acknowledge anger may even make people sick, Parker says, pointing to the deleterious effects of sustained elevatedcortisol, the stress hormone. However, not everyone feels equally free to express it.Women and girls are widely socialised to swallow anger and keep the peace; many told Parker their instinctual response to rage was to cry. For those burdened by the “angry Black woman” stereotype, navigating the emotion iseven more fraught.And though boys generally feel more attuned and entitled to anger, “they’re not taught to be curious about what their anger is really about, and what they should do with it,” Parker says.A healthy relationship with anger entails active, open engagement – neither denying its existence nor letting it run the show. For instance, the leftwing commentator and author Ash Sarkar told Parker about learning to understand and harness her anger as a self-protective response to racist and sexist attacks. But achieving such presence of mind takes time and practice.The accepted wisdom that anger needs to be released, such as by punching a pillow or primal screaming, has been proven to be of limited psychological benefit, says Parker.More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?A better goal is “creating a positive, productive association in your body and mind”. That can be achieved through physical movement, as Parker discovered with boxing; other examples are jogging and dancing. Anger can also be channelled creatively through journaling, painting or drawing.Once past the heat of the moment, you can decide with clarity what, if any, action is necessary, Parker says. “Sometimes you do have to go and have the scary conversation, and say the difficult thing.”Other times, merely acknowledging how you feel is enough to lessen the sting, and help you move on. “Today, if I feel angry about something, I’ve trained myself as best I can to think: ‘OK, this is information,’” says Parker.Knowing his tendency to bury anger, Parker tries now to stay connected with it. For example, he and his partner have discussed their respective triggers and approaches to arguing. “What you’re really doing is handing each other a map,” he explains, “so that when conflict does arise, you can find your way out of it a bit quicker.”Curious to learn more about my own terrain, I started by asking myself: if I was angry, what would I be angry about? The question flushes out some long-buried hurts and perceived injustices that I’d pushed from consciousness. None feel like they need to be acted upon, but they feel better for being excavated.I realise that while I’ve avoided conflict, believing it to be ruinous, the friendships I value most are those where we’ve already demonstrated that we can disagree, express frustration or argue, and recover.It’s a comforting takeaway: wrath might be uncomfortable, but it isn’t necessarily a deadly sin.Good Anger: How rethinking rage can change our livesis out in the UK now and published in the US on 19 AugustGood Anger by Sam Parker (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, £20).

Not so long ago, the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster was allowed out by Kemi Badenoch to stand in for her at prime minister’s questions when Keir Starmer was otherwise engaged. Though this may be a memory Alex wishes to forget. It wasn’t his finest hour.Angela Raynerran rings around him without even breaking sweat.So, on Wednesday, Alex found himself sidelined. Not wanted on voyage. From time to time, he would check his phone for messages. Just in case he had missed something. Willing his phone to ping with a late call-up. Nothing. He just had to suck it up. Take his place on the opposition frontbench and cheer on some other poor sucker. Maybe it was for the best. Some men are born failures. Some achieve failure. Some have failure thrust upon them. Alex is unique. A combination of all three.Instead it wasChris Philpwho got the job. Given the nod by Kemi shortly after breakfast and with next to no time to prepare. The last man standing who can be trusted to be loyal. Or more or less competent. In his own way. At least some of his neural pathways function as they should.The Philpster is Team Kemi through and through. Up until Team Kemi is no longer a thing. Much as he was with Team Truss. Then he will be his own man. Left to ponder that no one will ever be Team Philp. Chris even looks and sounds a bit like Kemi. Just not as good. Imagine. But this was his moment. His time. It might never happen again. He could be a hero. Just for one day.Also having an unexpectedly good day was Keir. Of all the days to missPMQs, this was a good one. A nice snooze on the flight back from Canada. No tricky questions on why the G7 turned into the G6. No having to cover for a US president who seemed to imagine he was the star of his own first-person-shooter video game. No having to look his own MPs in the eye as his government published its new welfare bill. Over to Angie.Philp stuck to what he knew. Grooming gangs and immigrants. Which all felt rather familiar. As if we knew what everyone was going to say before they said it. After all, Kemi had had her say in answer to Yvette Cooper’s Commons statement on Monday. The next day she and the Philpster had held their own press conference to fill in any gaps. And now? Now, it was third time lucky. So far, they had consistently struck the wrong note. Maybe this was the chance they needed. And it wasn’t as if Chris was capable of coming up with any other questions.This was all about the survivors, said Philp. Which was a decent place to start, given that he and Kemi had previously made it all about them. A bit of a stretch given that neither had shown much interest in the scandal when they had been in government. Rayner thanked him for his tone and assured the house that the inquiry would be comprehensive and would put the victims first.After that, it was all rather downhill. Maybe it was nerves, but the Philpster got increasingly shouty and squeaky. His voice racing through the octaves. Starmer should apologise for calling people far right and racist for having demanded an inquiry. Ange corrected him. Keir had only been calling out those who had previously shown no interest in grooming gangs and, besides, he had done more to secure convictions as director of public prosecutions than the Tory government had managed in 14 years.It was just weird to think that Philp and Kemi were now positioning themselves as the champions of the survivors, but we were where we were. Chris moved on to his next pet subject. Illegal immigrants. One or two of the people who had arrived on small boats were implicated in child sexual exploitation. Therefore, it followed that every illegal immigrant was probably a paedophile. And should be killed. Or something.And another thing … The Philpster was racing through his desperately limited repertoire and was already struggling. Rwanda. If onlyLabourhadn’t closed down the Rwanda scheme, then already more than a million immigrants – although why stop at those arriving by small boat? Why not go for those with visas too? – would have been safely rehoused in Rwanda to fight in the war with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.“The deputy prime minister has a brass neck,” he declared. For … for stating the obvious. That Rwanda was always going to fail. Rishi Sunak would never have called a general election last July if he had believed in the scheme. But to his dying breath, Chris will insist otherwise. He just needed a few more days, a week, even. Then he coulda been a contender.We ended where we always end on these occasions. Nowhere very much. Philp may have disappointed the Tory benches who had been hoping for a miracle, but Rayner hadn’t exactly shone. It was as though she didn’t believe the lines she had been given to read out. Was starting to wonder if neither the Tories nor Labour had all the answers. A revelation that comes to all sentient politicians in the end. You could chalk it up as a win for Ange. Largely because she’s the more engaging. She connects to people. They believe her.Well, not all. Labour’s Sarah Champion managed to throw a dampener on proceedings, saying she had had enough of point scoring from all sides of the house over the grooming gangs. The victims had even been failed by the criminal injuries compensation scheme. Time for everyone to up their game.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsConservativesChris PhilpKemi BadenochAngela RaynerKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

The trouble with shifting Evita’s big balcony number from stage to streetIn the new Evita at the London Palladium, Rachel Zegler sings from the theatre’s actual balcony – meaning the big-paying audience doesn’t experience what passersby get for free. Could this gimmick catch on?Mark LawsonWed 18 Jun 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.36 EDTShareIn the theatrical tactic “breaking the fourth wall”, characters acknowledge the presence of the audience. As when, in the current NationalTheatreproduction of Stephen Sondheim’s final musical, Here We Are, the performers, walking forward, stop in shock at seeing a big room full of strangers.The director Jamie Lloyd, though, is pioneering a technique that might be called breaking the theatre wall. In his revival of Evita, previewing at the London Palladium, Rachel Zegler’s Eva Perón sings Don’t Cry For Me Argentina – supposedly delivered from the Casa Rosada presidential balcony in Buenos Aires – from the balcony outside the Palladium, while the audience inside has to settle for a video feed.Last year, at London’s Savoy theatre, Lloyd staged the title number of another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical,Sunset Boulevard, with Tom Francis delivering the song while walking up the stairs from his dressing room out on to the Strand and then back down into the theatre, all filmed by a backwards-moving camera operator capturing live images shown on a screen to theatregoers. Since the Olivier-winning production became Tony winning on Broadway, Francis has been doing a version of the route in and out of the St James theatre along West 44th Street.Paying Evita audience upset as Don’t Cry delivered offstage to West End passersby for freeRead moreBoth staging stunts prompted social media complaints about shelling out big money (top tickets are around £200) to find the night’s big numbers are being sung to passersby for free. There is artistic loss, too. The anthemic, dramatic titular song in Sunset Boulevard features lyrics, from Don Black and Christopher Hampton, that are among the most effective, except those by Tim Rice, that Lloyd Webber has ever worked with. Joe Gillis, a Hollywood chancer who has run out of money, sings of Norma Desmond, whose career has stalled: “She was sinking fast, I threw a rope / Now I have suits and she has hope / It seemed an elegant solution.”This number, starting the second act, is a show highlight. But, in Lloyd’s production, the tight writing and explosive orchestration were, for me, lost in the jeopardy of the gimmick, as the audience – and, it seemed to me, Francis – fretted that he might fall down the steps, crash into the camera, be accosted by a reveller or police officer, or electrocuted if rain drenched his microphone. (Should Manhattan be hit by wilder weather, a route inside the building has been mapped, according to the New York Times, though not yet used.)The question is what explosion of the venue adds theatrically. Perón’s hold over the Argentinian populace depended to a significant degree on her being Catholic – the musical is very strong on the Buenos Aires first lady’s co-option of the scriptural Madonna that the secular Madonna later played in the movie version – and their being poor and living under military dictatorship. These days, poverty will regrettably be well represented on the streets of London, though relevant faith and tyranny less so. Does a dead fascist singing to tourists and boozers enhance or distract from the action of Evita?When the Belgian director Ivo Van Hove stagedOpening Nightlast year at the Gielgud, Sheridan Smith, playing a boozy, unreliable actor, was nightly seen outside on Shaftesbury Avenue and beamed to screens inside, staggering drunk from a limo to the stage door. This worked dramatically – because the external scene was in character – and gained useful publicity, although not enough to prevent the flawed show closing early.View image in fullscreenFreeloaders … the packed street outside the Palladium.Photograph: UnBoxPHD/YouTubeLess seems gained from throwing musicals out on to the street. Relevantly, Hampton, co-librettist of Sunset Boulevard, also wrote a solo play, Tales From Hollywood, about eastern European émigrés in the California movie business, in which characters include Austro-Hungarian writer Ödön von Horváth and German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, who demonstrates his theatrical technique of “alienation”, drawing attention to the lighting or frequently breaking the fourth wall in other ways. Von Horváth says: “Brecht always liked people to be aware they were in a theatre. I said to him more than once, ‘But Brecht, what makes you think they think they’re anywhere else?’”A good question, which Lloyd intensifies by putting the singers somewhere else. By following Sunset Boulevard with Evita, he has now staged two of Lloyd Webber’s best-known shows. Logically, the next might be Jesus Christ Superstar. And, if he continues his signature of street theatre, then logically the title character will be crucified outside, looking across from his West End Calvary towards department stores and fast-food joints.That may raise questions for whoever is archbishop of Canterbury by then, but also for theatre audiences. Just as the fourth wall should only be breached for very good narrative reasons, people who have paid a lot of money to sit in a theatre may reasonably expect that the most important songs in a musical will be sung in front of them.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Barry Smethurst, 41, a record shop worker trying to travel by rail from Saddleworth to Manchester Piccadilly, did not agree.Waiting on the platform for a morning train that was nowhere to be seen, he asked Meta’sWhatsAppAI assistant for a contact number for TransPennine Express. The chatbot confidently sent him a mobile phone number for customer services, but it turned out to be the private number of a completely unconnected WhatsApp user 170 miles away in Oxfordshire.It was the beginning of a bizarre exchange of the kind more and more people are having with AI systems, in which chatbots try to negotiate their way out of trouble, deflect attention from their mistakes and contradict themselves, all in an attempt to continue to appear useful.Smethurst’s joust with Meta’s AI began when he told it the TransPennine helpline it had dug up looked like a private number. When he asked what this number was, the AI quickly said it shouldn’t have shared it and tried to change the subject, saying: “Let’s focus on finding the right info for your TransPennine Express query!”But Smethurst wanted to know why it had shared the private number, which it turned out belonged to James Gray, 44, a property industry executive from Oxfordshire who is also a WhatsApp user and whose number appears on his company website.The AI explained vaguely it was generated “based on patterns” and promised to “strive to do better in the future” by admitting when it didn’t know an answer. But it then falsely described the number as “fictional” and not “associated with anyone”. When Smethurst challenged that, it admitted: “You’re right,” and said it may have been “mistakenly pulled from a database”.Asked which database, it muddied the waters further by contradicting itself again saying: “I didn’t pull the number from a database. I generated a string of digits that fit the format of a UK mobile number but it wasn’t based on any real data on contacts.”With the conversation going round in circles, Smethurst said he did not believe the chatbot and told it: “Just giving a random number to someone is an insane thing for an AI to do.”“It’s terrifying,” Smethurst said, after he raised a complaint with Meta. “If they made up the number, that’s more acceptable, but the overreach of taking an incorrect number from some database it has access to is particularly worrying.”Gray said he had thankfully not received calls from people trying to reach TransPennine Express, but said: “If it’s generating my number could it generate my bank details?”Asked about Zuckerberg’s claim that the AI was “the most intelligent”, Gray said: “That has definitely been thrown into doubt in this instance.”Developers working with OpenAI chatbot technology recentlyshared examplesof “systemic deception behaviour masked as helpfulness” and a tendency to “say whatever it needs to to appear competent” as a result of chatbots being programmed to reduce “user friction”.In March, a Norwegian manfiled a complaintafter he asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT for information about himself and was confidently told that he was in jail for murdering two of his children, which was false.And earlier this month a writer who asked ChatGPT to help her pitch her work to a literary agentrevealedhow after lengthy flattering remarks about her “stunning” and “intellectually agile” work, the chatbot was caught out lying that it had read the writing samples she uploaded when it hadn’t fully and had made up quotes from her work. It even admitted it was “not just a technical issue – it’s a serious ethical failure”.Referring to Smethurst’s case, Mike Stanhope, the managing director of the law firm Carruthers and Jackson, said: “This is a fascinating example of AI gone wrong. If the engineers at Meta are designing ‘white lie’ tendencies into their AI, the public need to be informed, even if the intention of the feature is to minimise harm. If this behaviour is novel, uncommon, or not explicitly designed, this raises even more questions around what safeguards are in place and just how predictable we can force an AI’s behaviour to be.”Meta said that its AI may return inaccurate outputs, and that it was working to make its models better.“Meta AI is trained on a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets, not on the phone numbers people use to register for WhatsApp or their private conversations,” a spokesperson said. “A quick online search shows the phone number mistakenly provided by Meta AI is both publicly available and shares the same first five digits as the TransPennine Express customer service number.”A spokesperson for OpenAI said: “Addressing hallucinations across all our models is an ongoing area of research. In addition to informing users that ChatGPT can make mistakes, we’re continuously working to improve the accuracy and reliability of our models through a variety of methods.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)WhatsAppMetaSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Boot season is finally over; it’s time to let your tootsies breathe for a bit. But if just the thought of getting your feet out brings you out in hives, fear not – summer footwear extends far beyond just a pair of full-feet exposing flip-flops.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From funky trainers, mules, plimsoles and chunky flatforms, to ballet pumps in bold colours, and this season’s trending fisher’s sandals, your options for summer feet coverage for the whole family are varied and wide. So whether you’re running errands, off to work, picnicking in the park or summer lounging with your nearest and dearest, we have the shoes that fit.For this guide, we’ve searched out the best summer footwear for men, women and kids, so you can approach the warm months with a spring – or summer, if you like – in your step.The best women’s summer footwearView image in fullscreenMontbellsock-on sandals£45 at MontbellRope sandals are very much a thing, in large part down to Prada. These ones from outdoor clothing specialist Montbell – founded by Japanese alpinist Isamu Tatsuno in 1975 – are a brilliant example of the genre; pared back, chic and going for a lot less than Miuccia prices.View image in fullscreenBirkenstockTulum soft footbed£125 at Birkenstock£125 at Begg ShoesIt wouldn’t be a guide to summer footwear, and particularly not here at the Guardian, without at least one pair of Birkenstocks. But if you’re a bit bored by the ubiquitous Arizona two-strap style, then the Tulum is a great alternative. Comfortable and a little more unexpected than their double-strap siblings, they cradle the foot in style.For more comfortable women’s footwear, read our guide to thebest sandals this summerView image in fullscreenGrensonQueenie£195 at GrensonPrepare to see a lot of “fisher sandals” this summer, a style that’s swimming its way into hearts and wardrobes. This pair from heritage British shoemaker Grenson is as close to a perfect example as I can find; theQuincymodel is near-identical, but with a thicker sole. Budget-wise, they’re more smoked salmon than kipper, but they should last an age and, when they look a little worn, Grenson offers a limited repair service.View image in fullscreenMarks & Spencerbow flat ballet pumps£29.50 at M&SThe popularity of the ballet flat shows no signs of abating. Despite so little cushioning between foot and ground, there’s something so poised about them that, on some occasions, the lack of support seems worth it. The puckering on this M&S pair is smart; the price tag is low (note: they’re not leather), and the black is either classic or – with a pink sock – statement.View image in fullscreenSuperga2750 Cotu classic£65 at Asos£65 at SupergaWhat Superga trainers offer in timeless design, they match in superlative arch support. Few lightweight summer trainers can claim this level of comfort. Available in a wide range of beautiful colours, I’m a fan of the off-white pair for their preppiness – they would have looked perfect on the feet of Bonnie inThe Wonder Years. Great with jeans and a simple white T-shirt or a summer dress.For more, check out our guide tothe best trainers that tick every boxView image in fullscreenEcco Sculpted Alba 25heeledsandal£77 at EccoDon’t let the fact that my old geography teacher – and yours, probably – used to wear Ecco shoes put you off this pair. This heritage Danish brand is plenty stylish, and these sandals prove it. Available in silver, black and this gorgeous yellow, the open-back style might be more suitable for picnicking rather than pacing.View image in fullscreenKeenUneekFrom £82.99 at Schuh£110 at KeenFor many, these shoes from Portland-based hiking brand Keen may stray too far down the “ugly shoe” route. Not for me, though, or the many others currently making them something of “a thing”. On a quest to create a comfortable shoe with a customisable fit, Keen has delivered some that work for both wide and narrow feet, and ones you can walk in for miles. The black is stylish, the green and orange is a statement.View image in fullscreenBobo Chosesfloralsandals£42 at Junior EditionStocked in a few places in the UK, Bobo Choses is a Spanish brand that’s known for its fun kidswear. This floral pair for women brings some of that childlike flavour to pool slides that will give that unicorn lilo a run for its money.View image in fullscreenCamperTwinsrecycled PET sandals£59 at FarfetchIfcoquettecoreandgorpcorehad a love child, I imagine it would look a bit like these sandals. Made from recycled polyester, they’re the creation of Camper – the sometimes madcap, sometimes sensible shoe brand from Mallorca. Style with flouncy skirts and more bows to lean into the cutesyness, or with walking shorts and a T-shirt for a look that offsets prettiness with practicality.View image in fullscreenFeiyueFe Lo 1920£29.90 at Urban Surfer£37.80 at SpartooThese minimalist canvas shoes have been quietly making their way on to more and more feet over the past few years. They take a simple white plimsoll up a gear. Originally worn in Shanghai in the 1920s, they’ve proved their staying power and still manage to look remarkably modern.View image in fullscreenCosEva flip-flops£65 at Cos£65 at H&MThere’s been a real hullabaloo caused by a pair of £670rubber flip-flopsfrom luxury brand the Row that have become a cult item with people who have more money than sense. If you’re after a similar low-key look but at high-street prices, you won’t go far wrong with this pair from Cos.View image in fullscreenMe+Emsuede clog£250 at Me+EmYou can thank Chemena Kamali, the creative director of Chloé, for the clogs comeback. This pair has a strap, making them far easier to wear than more traditional styles, plus a soft suede upper that’s more comfortable than the average nut-hard pair. A bit pricey, but this is a solid – and soft – pair of shoes.View image in fullscreenGramiccislide sandal£37 at Asos£55 at ParasolSlip on and strap in could be the tagline for these sliders from the Californian rock-climbing brand Gramicci, which has been having a bit of a moment thousands of miles from any giant sequoias. They’re the perfect pair of lightweight slides for pool lounging or campsite pootling – this summer, and for many more to come.View image in fullscreenAlohasSwayvanillaballet flats£150 at AlohasAlohas’ “on demand” system is an effort to make only what will be bought. Given thatoverproduction is a huge problemin the fashion industry, it can only be a good thing. These shoes are made in Spain, and a similar pair I bought a few years ago is still going strong, even as the leather has become more supple. These would look great worn to lunch, the office or a wedding.View image in fullscreenBodenhardware mule sandal£80 at Boden£80 at John LewisThe single, big, curved buckle is the thing here. With contrast stitching, they look pricier than they are. Easy to slip on and off, the hardware means they still look put together, even as they communicate insouciance. The tan, black and deep olive are all equally appealing.View image in fullscreenFlabelusMary Janes Oe£118 at Flabelus£120 at SelfridgesUnderstandably, a Mary Jane slipper this expensive is going to raise some hackles. But some people will fall so hard for these well-made ballet flats that they won’t mind the price tag at all. The inside is made from organic cotton, the outside from cotton velvet – so make the weather app your friend if you choose to buy them. Having bought a pair for a birthday nearly four years ago, I can vouch that these apparently flimsyshoes are still going strong since they first graced the pavement.View image in fullscreenEverlanethe studio slingback flat£165 at EverlaneA pointed toe instantly gives a look direction, and these silver slingbacks from sustainability-centric brand Everlane make me think it’s a good one. If you have an event to go to, need something for work or just want to shoehorn some smartness into an otherwise laid-back season, these shoes are a step in the right direction.Warm weather essentials: 42 ways to make the most of the sunshineRead moreThe best men’s summer footwearView image in fullscreenDuneIdda utilitarian strap sandals£79 at Dune£79 at John LewisI know some men find the idea of sandals a bit tricky, intimidating even. If this is you, but you’re still curious to try, then this pair of entirely inoffensive soft leather Dune sandals may be just the pair. You couldn’t fall out with them if you tried.View image in fullscreenFracap leather sandals£175 at ToastMade in Puglia by the family-run Fracap – the grandad apparently crafted his first pair of shoes in 1908 – these sandals are an investment. A truly timeless shoe, even if 2025 is shaping up to be a big one for fishers everywhere, they’ll lend style to feet for years to come. The company’s designs have been worn by the Italian Army and air force, so they should be able to withstand at least the next five summers’ worth of barbecues.View image in fullscreenChacoZ1 classic sandals£42 at Ellis BrighamFrom £65.28 at AmazonOriginally designed in the late 1980s in Colorado by rafting guide Mark Paigen, these simple yet sophisticated sandals are far more understated than their birth-decade might imply. Less“boom boom”excess and hedonism, and more supportive footbed and streamlined silhouette, they would work with tailoring as well as on a trail.View image in fullscreenBirkenstockUtti lace£140 at John Lewis£140 at AsosThese might not look like much, but that’s sort of the point. Between Birkenstock’s unmistakable footbed and the soft suede material in which they’re finished, the Utti lace are a treat for feet. Totally acceptable for wear with suits and jeans; just maybe avoid wearing with anything too tonally similar unless you want to look like a walking granola bar.50 men’s summer wardrobe updates under £100, from classic jeans to the perfect white T-shirtRead moreView image in fullscreenJohn LewisGurkastrappy sandals£79 at John LewisFisher meetscorpcorein these sleek leather sandals that can be dressed up or down. Apparently made using the Blake stitch, whereby stitching runs directly through the insole, upper and outsole, they’ll be a lighter weight and more flexible foot-companion than most. In a win for longevity, this construction method even allows for resoling. These shoes have a debonair air to match their slickness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Founded in Maine in 1946, it makes quality footwear. Just don’t feel obliged to wear this pair with red trousers. In fact, quite the opposite.View image in fullscreenNovesta StarMaster contrast shoes£59 at Working Class Heroes£69 at ToastWho among us can say that our shoes have been baked in the oven? You – if you invest in a pair of Novestas. These military-inspired trainers are still made in the same Slovakian factory they have been made in since the 1930s, using a baking technique to gel them together rather than glue. The ecru is classic and preppy, but other colours can dial that minimalism up or down, depending on your taste.View image in fullscreenMahabisDreamer sandalsFrom £89 at MahabisSummer doesn’t have to mean flimsy-soled shoes that make feet vibrate on concrete pavements. These sandals from Mahabis, the brand that brought us very smart slippers, will be a great foil to seasonal foot-ache. A note of caution: some colours are much,muchbetter than others – black, seaweed and navy look much less like something Frasier Crane’s dad would have worn than the lunar grey, for instance.View image in fullscreenTomsSantiago mule espadrille£65 at Toms£65 at John LewisI once heard an espadrille caught in the rain described as like a crumbling Weetabix. I know some people aren’t a fan, but I, for one, like the rustic, seaside spirit of an espadrille. This pair from Toms is the perfect shoe to slip on for any jollies. In the navy suede, they could just as easily work for a smarter day.View image in fullscreenDr MartensJosefslide sandals£120 at Dr MartensFrom £126.40 at AmazonDr Martens is best known for making the perfect boots for trudging through wintry weather. It might come as a surprise, then, to learn that the brand also makes shoes for less meteorologically challenging days. These leather slide sandals are super-comfy and lighter than they look.View image in fullscreenOnitsukaTiger Mexico 66£150 at Onitsuka TigerIf you’re wondering where a lot of the post-Rishi Sambas footfall went, it went to this trainer by a Japanese sportswear brand founded in 1949, now owned by Asics. While my sentiment is that wearing trainers in summer is a waste of an opportunity not to wear trainers, I know that many don’t see it that way. But if you’re going to wear a trainer, at least make it a bright yellow one.View image in fullscreenMerrellSpeedFusion sport RMX£64.99 at Sports Direct£80 at MerrellDo you remember when, a few years ago, everyone started wearing Tevas? This pair from Merrell feels like the 2025 replacement for anyone whose Tevas are now good for retirement after many years of walks and commutes. The treads on this pair from the decades-old outdoor specialist will feel like an upgrade, as will the design – plus the straps are a bit more stylish, particularly if you stick to the black.View image in fullscreenRussell& BromleyDalvey cross-strap sandal£125 at Russell & BromleyThere’s something very The Talented Mr Ripley, Amalfi coastline about these cross-strap sandals, especially in the tan colour. Perhaps it figures, given they’re made in Italy. They’d work well with seersucker clothing to a summer wedding, but are just as respectable for mooching around on a summer’s day.View image in fullscreenFitFlopF-Mode Gostrappy slides£42 at FitFlopFrom £60 at AmazonAnother pair of slides, but this time more outdoors-coded than suited to the south of Naples. If you’ve been wearing bog-standard pool sliders for a few years now, these would be a great shoe to graduate to. Slick but still super-practical, they also feature a “Microwobbleboard” midsole, which gains them the American Podiatric Medical Association’s seal of approval for footwear found to promote good foot health.View image in fullscreenM&Ssuede corkbed mule£38 at M&SA man in mules used to be a fairly controversial sight, but not any longer. There’s even an Instagram account,Muleboyz, where you can check what good company you’d be keeping if you decide to become a mule-wearer yourself – as well as the more out-there models you could be wearing. This M&S pair is a great, unfussy version for mule newbies.Footwear for little feetView image in fullscreenSalt-Watershark fishersandals£47.95 at Salt-WaterAvailable in beautiful colours, well-made and, particularly in this model with a thicker sole, comfier than could reasonably be expected of a sandal, Salt-Water’s fisher sandals are a classic. I like the caged toe for added protection, and they can stand up to water. They’re not cheap, but certain styles and sizes areoften reduced. Truth be told, I’m yet to buy a pair new – you’ll find plenty of barely worn pairs on Vinted for less. I just picked up a pair for my daughter for £12.View image in fullscreenClarksPlaysun leather sandals£18 at Clarks£18 at DebenhamsFor the footwear equivalent of a Shirley Hughes poem, look no further. This sweet pair of Clarks sandals has childhood and innocence written all over them. Available in three colours, they’re another classic from the children’s footwear maker.View image in fullscreenBensimonElly Liberty slip-on tennis shoe£22.50 at Junior EditionBensimon makes brilliant plimsolls in general, but this pair in the Libby Flowers print is particularly special. Made from rubber and cotton, they’re super lightweight, and their slip-on style will save you the hassle of having to deal with laces when popping them on to your kid’s feet. And – joy of joys – they’re machine-washable.View image in fullscreenLiewood Morris sandalsFrom £24.75 at SmallableMarshmallows in shoe form, this pair would be great for boinging from playground to paddling pool. The shell pattern is cute, ditto the crabs. They’re designed by a Scandi company that brings more tastefulness to kids’ clobber than most.View image in fullscreenTevaHurricane XLT 2 boys juniorFrom £21.99 at SchuhFrom £31.49 at SportsShoesI know I said earlier that Teva had their moment a few years ago, but that isn’t to say they don’t still do the job very well – I still wear mine. Plus, they’re great sandals for kids. The colourful versions are fun, and I can vouch that they can withstand a lot of walking, being kind to feet along the way.Vintedis abundant with good-as-new options.View image in fullscreenHermosillaBouton d’Or ballerinas£34 at SmallableAt £34, you might not want to put these very sweet Spanish-made ballet pumps through their paces in the sandpit. But if you’re after something special, these pretty pumps are well made and might just be the perfect shoe for the occasion.View image in fullscreenTrottersHampton plum canvas plimsollsFrom £32 at John LewisOften spotted on the feet of the royal children, these slip-on-and-off plimmies from British brand Trotters are the incarnation of kites and sandcastles in shoe form. The cotton canvas should be pretty durable and, crucially, they’re machine-washable. TheT-bar versionis also very sweet.View image in fullscreenStart-Ritetrekker sandals£30 at Start-Rite£30 at John LewisThis Norfolk company has apparently been making shoes since 1792 – although not this exact model, which looks very much like a more childish take on the kind of gorpcore sandal that’s being worn in towns and cities around the country. The rugged treads will be as good for playgrounds as craggy footpaths.View image in fullscreenMountain WarehouseBermudaaqua shoes£7.99 at Mountain WarehouseMaybe you’re already in on it, but until recently, aqua shoes felt to me like a well-kept secret. They’re super-comfy and make stone or shingle beaches more fun to paddle and play on. This pair from Mountain Warehouse has good grips and won’t break the bank.View image in fullscreenMori Kidlyjelly shoe£11.20 at MoriTo my mind, it wouldn’t be a childhood summer without a pair of jellies. But some jellies can be rigid and uncomfortable. Thankfully, these ones are squidgier than your average. Looks-wise, the buckle is a nice touch, but the fact that it hides Velcro beneath is the real coup – so much less fiddly when you’re in a rush to get out of the door. If the thought of buying plastic shoes new doesn’t spark joy, the secondhand market for them is booming.View image in fullscreenCrocsclassic clogFrom £26.24 at Crocs£27.99 at SchuhA modern-day classic, the Croc is the shoe we reach for most during the warmer months. With or without socks, with Spider-Man Croc-gems or splodges of yesterday’s ice-cream, they keep young feet comfy and well protected with aplomb. Plus, they work for older kids and toddlers alike. Again, check out Vinted, eBay and so on for options for about a third of the price of new.View image in fullscreenBirkenstockNew Yorkjunior£45 at John LewisFrom £45.98 at AmazonEver-comfy, ever-versatile, it feels right to round things off with one more Birkenstock. The wide-strapped New Yorks are a great shout for kids; the ones with an ankle strap make most sense on the end of legs prone to running at any moment. They don’t come cheap, but they’re sturdier than most sandals, and can be worn with socks early in the spring and into autumn, too. Plus, they’ll make great hand-me-downs.Ellie Violet Bramley is a writer who has been delving into style and what it means for nearly a decade – mostly for the Guardian’s fashion deskExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterWomen's shoesMen's shoesChildren's clothesAccessoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s Orwell, man. I’m a free man. You’re not going to tell me who to hate.”Bannon – a manager of Trump’s 2016 election campaign – said Trump would wreck his domestic agenda of deporting undocumented immigrants if he ordered US forces to strike Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities.“If we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it’s going to happen on the combat side, it’s going to not just blow up the coalition, it’s also going to thwart the most important thing, which is the deportation of the illegal alien invaders who are here,” he said.Trump madecriticism of US “forever wars”– particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan – a mainstay of his 2016 election message and has maintained that posture ever since, although he has frequently sent out mixed messages on Iran.On Tuesday,he demanded “unconditional surrender”from the country’s theocratic rulers over their nuclear program – a message conveying the impression that US military action to bomb the facilities could be imminent.While he has repeatedly said that Iran must be prevented from having a nuclear weapon, he has also expressed a desire to negotiate a deal – despite having withdrawn in 2018 from a previous agreement negotiated during Barack Obama’s presidency.Maga confusion over Trump’s current stance was embodied inthe comments of Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and one of the president’s most loyal activists.“No issue currently divides the right as much as foreign policy,” he posted on X. “Trump voters, especially young people, supported President Trump because he was the first president in my lifetime to not start a new war.”In a separate post, he said: “The last thing America needs right now is a new war. Our number one desire must be peace, as quickly as possible.”Skepticism has also been voiced by rightwing Republicans in Congress, notablyMarjorie Taylor Greene, the pro-Trump representative from Georgia, who defended Carlson after Trump called his pronouncements “kooky”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what millions of Americans voted for. It’s what we believe is America First.”The Washington Post quotedan unnamed former Pentagon official as saying the conflict between Israel and Iran had brought the America First movement to an “inflection point”.“A lot of people in the Maga movement, ones that have really invested a lot in electing Trump and [vice-president] Vance, will be incredibly disappointed if this turns into a larger war, and it will lead to some fractures,” said the official, adding that many Trump supporters were afraid to express a “bubbling frustration with Israel” for fear of being labeled antisemitic.The ex-official added: “I would argue that Iran is the defining issue on the political right right now. It’s not trade. It’s not spending. It’s not even the culture war stuff. It is foreign policy, and specifically Iran.”Her sentiments were echoed byRand Paul, a Republican senator for Kentucky, who said: “Diplomacy comes from restraint. The president has shown restraint in the past … And I’m hoping the president will not get involved in the war.”Pitted against them are establishment Republicans such asMitch McConnell, the former leader in the Senate, who has previously warned Trump of the dangers of “isolationism”.“What’s happening here is some of the isolationist movement led by Tucker Carlson andSteve Bannonare distressed we may be helping the Israelis defeat the Iranians,” McConnell told CNN, noting that it had been “kind of a bad week for isolationists” in the GOP.Two other pro-Trump loyalist in the Senate, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have also been hawkish for action on Iran.Graham said the administration should “go all in” in destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities. “If that means providing bombs, provide bombs,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation. “If that means flying with Israel, fly with Israel.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansIranDonald TrumpIran's nuclear programmeTucker CarlsonSteve BannonMarjorie Taylor GreenenewsShareReuse this content"

In a post on X, Predatory Sparrow said it had targeted Nobitex and would release its source code and “internal information”.Predatory Sparrow is regularly described in Israeli media as being Israel-linked, although there has been no official confirmation of the hackers’ identity or their nationality.“Although there is no confirmation yet that the funds were moved by Predatory Sparrow, the hack appears to be motivated by the recent escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran,” Elliptic said.Rafe Pilling, the director of threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Sophos, said there was no firm evidence linking Predatory Sparrow to a particular state, but it had the characteristics of a government-backed group.“It bears all the hallmarks of a false persona used by a government-sponsored threat group to conduct disruptive operations against targets linked to illicit Iranian revenue generation, logistical entities, transport infrastructure and other strategic sectors,” he said.He added: “While we don’t expect to find strong technical links between Israel and Predatory Sparrow, the actions of the group align strongly with Israel’s regional priorities you’d be hard pushed to find another candidate country in the region with the capability to perform these attacks.”Nobitex said on X it had experienced a “security incident” and was “actively working on implementing a secure and efficient recovery plan”.Predatory Sparrow claimed in a post on X that it had “destroyed the data” of Bank Sepah and accused the bank of financing the Iranian military. Bank Sepah’s international branch in London has been approached for comment.Meanwhile, companies tracking global internet activity have reported a near-total internet blackout in Iran, Cloudflare told the Guardian that traffic volumes were 98% below where they were at the same time last week.However, hackers do not appear to have been the cause of the shutoff. An Iranian government spokesperson, Fatemeh Mohajerani,said this weekthat internet access had been slowed down to “maintain the network’s stability” and to ward of cyberattacks.Explore more on these topicsHackingCryptocurrenciesIranIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The clock started ticking on 12 April, the date of thefirst round of US-Iranian negotiationsin Oman.Netanyahu seems to have accepted the same 60-day window to hold off on military action and to give diplomacy a chance. He has said that Operation Rising Lion had originally been planned for April. It was postponed and last Thursday marked day 61 on Trump’s calendar. That night about 200 Israeli planes took off on their first sorties.As the deadline approached, the US withdrew non-essential personnel from embassies in the Middle East, but Trump appeared to discourage an Israeli attack, saying it might “blow” the chances for a sixth round of negotiations due on Sunday.It is unclear whether this was a ruse to put Iran off its guard, assome Israeli officials claimed, or a genuine call for a few more days leeway. If the latter, it was already too late.Reported Israeli airstrikes on Iran in June 2025The Israeli attack plan involved precise coordination. Mossad commandos and drones had been pre-positioned, and waiting several days for talks – which Trump was pessimistic about anyway – would have compromised the prospects for the whole operation as well as the safety of Israelis already behind Iranian lines.The diplomatic option was almost certainly doomed from the start. After some initial wavering immediately after the Israeli attack began, Trump stuck to the inflexible and maximalist position that Iran stop enriching uranium permanently – now one of Israel’s primary war aims.Once the operation had begun, Trump quickly swung his support behind it, noting on his Truth Social platform: “Two months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to ‘make a deal’. They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!”The “second chance” seemed to be an option to return to the table and bow to Trump’s demands, using the leverage of Israel’s military might to produce a diplomatic triumph for the president.With every passing day of Israeli battlefield success, however, Trump has warmed to a military solution, declaring himself on Tuesday to be “not too much in the mood to negotiate”, and even claiming ownership of the campaign, announcing: “We now have complete and total control of the Iranian skies.”Iranian missile strikes on Israel in June 2025Israel is counting on Trump to stake a direct claim to glory and join the operation, now that the risks of failure and downed planes have been minimised.“The whole operation is premised on the fact that the US will join at some point,” anIsraeli official told CNN.“We are waiting for the decision of the president,” another senior official told the network.Israel has yet to attack Iran’s most secure enrichment facility, at Fordow, which is built into a mountain with up to 100 metres of rock above it. Only the US air force has penetrating bombs of the size that have the best chance of making a dent in such defences, although even with those 13,000kg (30,000lb) munitions, success is not guaranteed.As the war has progressed, so has the clamour in Israel for US involvement, along with uncertainty over whether Netanyahu has a plan B if Trump opts to watch from the sidelines.“We need to hope that this actually happens, and possibly very soon,” the veteran commentator Ben Caspit wrote in Ma’ariv newspaper on Wednesday. “Take all the credit, Donald. The important thing is that you ultimately decide to join.”Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, Shimon Shiffer argued: “Without the involvement of the United States, the war with Iran will not reach a decisive conclusion that justifies our assault on the ayatollahs’ regime and the heavy price that Israeli citizens are paying with their lives and property.“Mr President, come save the world,” Shiffer wrote. “Come save us from Iran. Come save us from ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneianalysisShareReuse this content"

We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now … Our patience is wearing thin.” Three minutes later, in a second post, he added: “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”When Mehnaz*, a 24-year-old student activist in east Tehran, heard the news, she did not think of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Instead, she thought of her fellow students who were detained, shot and executed by Iranian security forces during the “woman, life, liberty” protests in 2022.“AfterMahsa [Amini]’s death, we tried to stand up. Teenagers were shot point blank, our compatriots were hanged. We could never get rid of the Islamic Republic on our own. Now, someone from outside is helping us,” Mehnaz told the Guardian via text on Wednesday after a sleepless night of Israeli bombing.‘You worry what’s going to come next’: Iranians brace themselves as war loomsRead moreThe prospect of imminent US involvement in an Israeli bombing campaign, which is suggested to be in pursuit of regime change, has laid bare deep divides in Iran’s population, even among the opposition. Many are deeply suspicious of the US’s intentions in Iran, which has a bitter history of foreign adventurism gone awry. Others do not care who is the one to topple the government.A large portion of Iran’s population is bitterly opposed to the government, which has only grown more repressive as the country slips deeper into economic crisis. Just two weeks ago, much ofIranwas paralysed by a nationwide strike in protest at the dismal economic situation.To some of the opposition, anything that could topple the Iranian government is welcome, whether it comes from street protests or US bunker busters.Mehnaz said: “Yes, we’ll probably have massive destruction in Tehran and other cities, but this regime will fall – and then we can rebuild everything again.”The toll of fighting – now in its sixth day – is growing. Israeli strikes have killed at least 585 people and wounded 1,326 others in Iran, according to Iranian media. At least 24 people have been killed and 600 injured by Iranian strikes in Israel.Fighting started after Israel launched hundreds of pre-dawn strikes on Iran last Friday, which it said were aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly retaliated by firing a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel, kicking off a steadily escalating tit-for-tat war.Israel’s assumption US would get drawn into Iran war is being put to the testRead moreTo Alborz*, an athlete from Tehran, the cost of Israeli bombing was already too high.“I can’t explain how we pass each day, in fear. It feels like I am walking on a street of hot coal and having acid rain down on me,” Alborz said via text. “We want to get our freedom on our own terms, not through US bombs,” he added.Iran has a long history of foreign intervention that has left the population suspicious of offers of help.A 1953 coup that deposed the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, wasbacked by the CIA and MI6 to protect western oil interests. The intelligence plot features heavily in the national narrative of the current government, which overthrew the western-backed Shah of Iran in the country’s 1979 revolution.The more recent 21st-century history of US adventurism in the Middle East has inspired further scepticism among Iranians.“Look at Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq – they destroyed the countries, then walked away. It’s funny how they call this ‘exporting democracy’ while they always have paralysed all the democratic institutions in those countries,” Abbas*, a 26-year-old artist from west Tehran, said.The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has called for Iran’s opposition to rise up, suggesting in an interview on Monday that his military operation could help liberate Iranians from an oppressive regime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the time, your hour of freedom is near, it’s happening now.”His calls rang hollow in Iran, which has seen nightly news broadcasts of starvation, displacement and mass killings in Gaza over the last 36 months.Abbas said: “Now Trump wants to unite with Israel – and people here are scared. If they come here like they did in other places, we will be left with nothing but ruins and extremist groups.”While Israeli bombings have battered Iran, its security services have intensified their crackdown on dissidents and political organisation.“Activists and former political prisoners have been rearrested. They’re basically targeting anyone who’s talking about the war,” said Bahar Ghandehari, the director of advocacy and communications at the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.Iranian authorities have restricted internet access, detained activists, and on Saturday arrested 16 people on charges of “spreading rumours” on social media.The renewed wave of oppression has hardened the desire for regime change for some of the opposition, who now find themselves having to deal not only with Israeli bombings but also fear of arrest.“Yes, 585 people were killed in this war till now, but in four days of demonstration after Mahsa Amini’s killing, almost 1,000 people were killed by the regime,” said Mohammad Reza, a resident of Tehran in his 50s who took part in the 2022 protests.* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Antisemitic harassment, for example, should not be tolerated on any campus and we fully expect universities to take robust steps to tackle it.”The OfS guidance also suggests that universities refuse places to international students whose funding requires them to follow the policies of foreign governments, potentially threatening state-sponsored students from a number of Asian and Middle Eastern countries.A spokesperson for Universities UK said: “We strongly agree that universities must be places where free speech is protected and promoted.“These guidelines cover complex issues, and we are pleased to see that the OfS has taken onboard some of the feedback from the previous version.“We will continue to work constructively with the OfS and with government as these changes are introduced, and will make sure universities are appropriately supported to comply with them.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationFreedom of speechProtestOffice for StudentsHuman rightsStudentsUniversity management and administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It would also require carbon dioxide to be sucked from the atmosphere in future to restore the stable climate in which the whole of civilisation developed over the past 10,000 years.The carbon budget is how much planet-heating CO2 can still be emitted by humanity while leaving a reasonable chance that the temperature target is not blown. The latest assessment by leading climate scientists found that in order to achieve a 66% chance of keeping below the 1.5C target, emissions from 2025 onwards must be limited to 80bn tonnes of CO2. That is 80% lower than it was in 2020.Emissions reached a newrecord high in 2024: at that rate the 80bn tonne budget would be exhausted within two years. Lags in the climate system mean the 1.5C limit, which is measured as a multi-year average, would inevitably be passed a few years later, the scientists said.GraphScientists have beenwarning for some timethat breaching the 1.5C limit isincreasingly unavoidableas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels continue to rise. The latest analysis shows global emissions would have to plummet towards zero within just a few years to have any decent chance of keeping to the target. That appears extremely unlikely, given that emissions in 2024 rose yet again.However, the scientists emphasised every fraction of a degree of global heating increases human suffering, so efforts to cut emissions must ramp up as fast as possible.Currently, the world ison track for 2.7Cof global heating, which would be a truly catastrophic rise. The analysis shows, for example, that limiting the rise to 1.7C is more achievable: the carbon budget for a 66% chance of keeping below 1.7C is 390bn tonnes, which is about nine years at the current rate of emissions.View image in fullscreenGreenland’s ice sheet, the melting of which has contributed to ever-rising sea levelsPhotograph: Tom Chudey/PA“The remaining carbon budgets are declining rapidly and the main reason is the world’s failure to curb global CO2 emissions,” said Prof Joeri Rogelj, at Imperial College London, UK. “Under any course of action now, there is a very high chance we will reach and even exceed 1.5C and even higher levels of warming.”“The best moment to have started serious climate action was 1992, when the UN [climate] convention was adopted,” he said. “But now every year is the best year to start being serious about emissions reduction. That is because every fraction of warming we can avoid will result in less harm and suffering, particularly for poor and vulnerable populations, and in less challenges to living the lives we desire.”Rogelj said it was crucial that countries commit to big emissions cuts at the UNCop30climate summit in November.Thehottest year on record was 2024, fuelled by increasing coal and gas burning, and setting an annual average of 1.5C for the first time. There is no sign yet of the transition away from fossil fuels promised by the world’s nations at Cop28 in Dubai in December 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But energy demand is rising even faster, leading to more fossil fuel burning andturbo-charging extreme weather disasters.The analysis, produced by an international team of 60 leading climate scientists, is an update of thecritical indicators of climate changeand ispublished in the journal Earth System Science Data. It aims to provide an authoritative assessment, based on the methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but published annually unlike the intermittent IPCC reports, the most recent of which was 2021.The study found that the Earth’s energy imbalance – the excess heat trapped by the greenhouse effect – has risen by 25% when comparing the past decade with the decade before.“That’s a really large and very worrying number,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, UK, and lead author of the study. “I tend to be an optimistic person. But things are not only moving in the wrong direction, we’re seeing some unprecedented changes and acceleration of the heating of the Earth and sea level rise.”Sea level rise has doubled in the past 10 years, compared with the period 1971-2018, the analysis found, rising to 4mm per year. Theflooding of coasts will become unmanageableat 1.5C of global heating and lead to “catastrophic inland migration”, a study in May found.Sea level is rising because about 90% of global heating is absorbed by the oceans, making the water expand, and because the climate crisis is melting glaciers and ice caps.Dr Karina Von Schuckmann, at Mercator Ocean International, said: “Warmer waters also lead to intensified weather extremes, and can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. In 2024, the ocean reached record values globally.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsSea levelOceansPollutionExtreme heatExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Sex Matters intervened in the supreme court case that was brought by For WomenScotlandagainst the Scottish government over a law aimed at improving gender representation on public boards.Maya Forstater, a founder of Sex Matters, said the supreme court was clear that legal protection for trans people “does not translate into a right to use opposite-sex services”, adding that allowing trans women to use women’s toilets, showers and changing rooms had “created a hostile environment for women”.Sex Matters is particularly concerned about the Scottish government’s guidance for schools, which encourage teaching staff offer flexible arrangements for young transgender people and states that the use of toilets is governed by social convention rather than law.The Good Law Project, which is challenging the EHRC’s interim advice in court next month, revealed earlier this week that the commissionappeared to be rolling backon its initial blanket position.Last weekend, For Women Scotland co-director Susan Smith encouraged individuals to “keep pressure on MSPs and MPs”, and make use of the fighting fund announced by the author and activist JK Rowling to launch their own actions.Rowling said the fund was “not going to be sharing any details or figures about applications and inquiries, as it’s a private fund, not a fundraising charity, and funding details are strictly confidential”.A Scottish government spokesperson said that they would respond to the letter in due course.They said: “The Scottish government has been clear that we accept the supreme court judgment. We are reviewing policies, guidance and legislation potentially impacted by the judgment.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGenderScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

He suggested the government would have to come down hard on contractors and renegotiate the engineering contracts awarded in 2020, or costs would continue to rise.He also said assumptions about future timelines were wrong and that the testing phase alone would be likely to take three years rather than 14 months.Alexander said it would be several months before she could confirm an updated schedule for completion or cost for the project. She also said she was “drawing a line in the sand”, detailing what she called a “litany of failure” since thecoalition government took on the project in 2010.A map showing H2S routeThe government published the findings of a review it commissioned last autumn into the troubled scheme, alongside the letter from Wild outlining steps for a “reset” of construction.Wild said HS2 Ltd had spent a year trying to “stabilise” the main works civil contracts [MWCCs] awarded in 2020 without success, and that “the nature of the contracts is such that the programme bears the vast majority of the financial risk [and] they will continue to rise without intervention”.“Regaining control of the MWCC will involve a challenging negotiation and may require robust action in support from government,” he said.Wild suggested that to minimise delays, the new line could initially have trains running at slower speeds – thought to be 200 rather than 225mph – and without the installation of automatic train operation until enough services run to require the enhancement.Alexander said Wild had been told to build the line as safely and cheaply as possible, even if took longer. She said: “We won’t reinstate cancelled sections we can’t afford. But we will do the hard and necessary work to regain public trust and build this line.”She told MPs the last government had mismanaged HS2 in numerous ways, including signing contracts against advice and repeatedly changing plans forredesigning London Euston station.“Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been wasted by constant scope changes, ineffective contracts and bad management,” she said. “It’s an appalling mess. But it’s one we will sort out.”Alexander told MPs that among the mistakes made by the Conservative government was the decision to sign the 2020 contracts, despite having been advised by a review that year not to do so until the scope of the project had been fully decided.The government-commissioned review by the infrastructure industry veteran James Stewart into what went wrong and lessons for future projects, which waspublishedon Wednesday, also identified the contracts as an issue. “Cost overruns on the MWCCs are by far the most significant contributors to the overall cost increases,” he said.Stewart’s report also said political decision-making had been a large factor in cost and then delay, with HS2 Ltd not having a “buffer” from government, making it “subject to evolving political aims, which pushed forward on the schedule before there was sufficient design maturity and caused progressive removals of scope”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That committee was to have included ministers from the Treasury, and the transport and levelling up departments. “Unbelievably, that taskforce never met,” Alexander said.She said there would be a “new era of leadership” to get the project back on track, including the appointment of Mike Brown, a former commissioner ofTransportfor London, as the new chair of HS2 Ltd.Alexander worked with Brown and Wild when she was deputy mayor of London. Wild carried out a similar role to his current one when he worked with TfL on the Elizabeth line, eventuallycompleting it successfullywithin a revised timescale and budget.She told MPs: “Mark and Mike were part of a team with me that turned Crossrail into the Elizabeth line. We’ve done it before and we’ll do it again.”Responding to questions, she said: “It will be a number of months before I am in a position to confirm with any certainty the schedule and estimated final costs.”Wild’s assessment, however, appears to indicate that HS2’s opening, even on a reduced scale, will be pushed back for two years or more.Explore more on these topicsHS2Transport policyRail industryRail transportTransportHeidi AlexanderLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The Fed chair,Jerome Powell, cautioned that officials expect tariffs imposed by Trump to increase prices over the course of the summer.“Increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity,” Powell told reporters. “The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could be more persistent.”Avoiding persistent inflation “will depend on the size of the tariff effects” and how long it takes them to affect prices, Powell added.Hours before the central bank announced its latest decision, Trump calledPowell“stupid” and accuratelypredicted rates would be maintained on Wednesday.Can Trump fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell?Read more“He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune,” Trump, whose attacks have raised questions over the Fed’s independence, claimed of Powell. The central bank has repeatedly stressed it makes decisions based on economic data, rather than political interventions.Federal interest rates have remained flat after some cuts in 2024 for the first time since 2020.Policymakers at the central bank expect inflation to increase by a median rate of 3% this year, according to projections released alongside its latest decision on Wednesday, up from aprevious estimate of 2.7%– and highlighting how far the US remains from the Fed’s inflation target of 2%.As Trump’s aggressive tariffs agenda continues to disrupt the global economy, and raises concern about price growth, officials at the Fed have repeatedly warned of an uncertain road ahead.They expect theUS economyto grow by a median rate of 1.4% this year, down from March’s 1.7% estimate, which itself was a significant downgrade from the previous 2.1% estimate in December.As the Fed confirmed on Wednesday that a targeted federal funds rate had been held at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%following its rate-setting open market committee’s latest two-day meeting, it said: “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated.”A closely watched “dot plot”, which shows policymakers’ predictions for the trajectory of rates, indicated that most expect to cut rates at least twice in 2025, with further cuts in future years.But officials do not universally agree on the path ahead. Seven of the nineteen officials on the committee do not expect to cut rates at all this year.“We have a pretty healthy diversity of views on the committee,” Powell told reporters, citing differences in economics predictions and views on how the Fed should respond.“Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the committee said in a statement. “The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid.Inflationremains somewhat elevated.”The central bank has so far defied Trump’s attacks on its decisions, holding firm on its independence from the White House. After Powell spoke with the US president last month, the Fedsaid that he had made clearthat its actions “will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook”.Wall Street rose after the announcement on Wednesday,but later slipped back. By mid-afternoon in New York both the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were broadly flat.Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The Federal Reserve’s crystal ball is still clouded and feeds into its bias toward being reactionary, rather than preemptive.”Looking ahead, Powell expressed concern over cuts to US statistical agencies that produce data on the economy. While he stressed the Fed was still able to do its job, he warned of “more volatility” in surveys as a result of layoffs.“The United States has been a leader for many, many years in this whole project of measuring, and understanding what’s happening in our very large and dynamic economy,” he said. “And I hate to see us cutting back on that, because it is a real benefit to the general public.”Explore more on these topicsUS interest ratesFederal ReserveJerome PowellDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

She said the country’s £326bn social security net might cease to exist if costs continued to escalate.The bill includesseveral concessionsdesigned to win over fractious Labour MPs as ministers look to ward off the biggest rebellion of Keir Starmer’s premiership. But the efforts were met with hostility by many in the party, who said they still intended to vote against the bill next month.Kendall said: “Our social security system is at a crossroads. Unless we reform it, more people will be denied opportunities, and it may not be there for those who need it. This legislation represents a new social contract and marks the moment we take the road of compassion, opportunity and dignity.“This will give people peace of mind, while also fixing our broken social security system so it supports those who can work to do so while protecting those who cannot – putting welfare spending on a more sustainable path to unlock growth.”The bill will cut personal independence payments (Pips) for more than 800,000 people with disabilities, as well as carers’ support for 150,000 people who care for them. Claimants only able to wash half of their body or who are unable to cook a meal for themselves will no longer be able to claim Pips unless they have another limiting condition.The cuts are at the heart of an overall package of nearly £5bn in welfare savings whichministers argueare necessary to protect the financial sustainability of the benefits system.Kendall has tried to dispel widespread anger in theLabourparty over the plans by introducing new concessions. Under the terms of the bill, people losing their disability benefits will get additional financial support for 13 weeks, while those with severe conditions such as heart disease or spinal injuries will not have to face reassessments.The work and pensions secretary has set out a separate £1bn plan to help unemployed people get back to work, but this is not related to Pips, which are unconnected to employment status.Whips are also issuing threats, and the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner,refused on Wednesday to rule outthe possibility of suspending any Labour rebels when the bill is put to a vote next month.The mixture of concessions and threats did not appear to have won over wavering Labour MPs, however, and many went public with their criticism after the bill was published.Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, said: “Having read the bill, it is clear that disabled people will lose significant support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poverty will be the legacy of this bill.”Andy McDonald, the MP for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East, said the bill was “a huge attack on the incomes of disabled people”.“MPs are being expected to vote these through whilst the green paper consultation continues, before the Pip assessment review is conducted, and without any evidence the separate employment support package – which is not in this bill – will work.“This bill will be a yes or no on impoverishing disabled people. It’s a no from me.”Those feelings were echoed by disability campaign groups and charities.James Taylor, the director of strategy at the disability equality charity Scope said: “This bill will be catastrophic for disabled people. Cutting benefits will plunge hundreds of thousands into poverty. Over 800,000 will lose at least some financial support from Pip.“It will have a devastating effect on disabled people’s health, ability to live independently or work.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He is then seen eating a microwave dinner for one and chuckling, with the now-deflated ball pinned to the table next to him by a large kitchen knife.TheTV advert for the Scotland-based Strathmore Foods, maker of the McIntosh of Strathmore ready meals stocked by most big supermarket chains, has been identified in a report by the UK advertising watchdog as showing an “offensive” portrayal of older people – by stereotyping them as grumpy and intolerant, and implying many are lonely and isolated.The report by theAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) says too many brands are behind the times when it comes to the issue of ageing in advertising.It says older people feel they are bombarded with adverts for funeral services, care homes and mobility aids. Many older people feel invisible because a lot of advertising reduces them to outdated stereotypes, the report says.A survey and focus groups involving 4,000 adults of all ages found that more than a third thought people over the age of 55 tended to be negatively stereotyped in ads.Almost half said ads that showed older people as unable to understand or use technology were potentially offensive.More than a fifth of those surveyed believed that depicting ageing as something to be “fought”,especially in beauty advertising, had the potential to cause harm by influencing how an older person saw themselves, or how society might view and treat them.Focus groups comprising a range of different age groups were shown 34 ads featuring older people made by brands including Amazon, Cadbury, Land Rover, L’Oréal, Pure Cremation and Tesco.View image in fullscreenA LinkedIn ad with the strapline ‘Parents don’t get B2B’ was considered the most likely cause harm.Photograph: LinkedInAn ad by the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, which used the strapline “Parents don’t get B2B”, was considered the most likely to cause harm. “If you think other people think you are stupid and that’s how you come across, I don’t think that is good for self-esteem,” said one female participant.An ad for the fashion brand JD Williams that featured older women in bright, colourful and “trendy” clothes used the strapline “Feeling more girlfriend than grandma”.“I can imagine some older women seeing beauty ads and thinking the goal for women is to look 20 years younger,” said one participant. “As if that is what will make you feel happier. This could be quite harmful because it forces an ideal on older women. It is kind of pushing the idea that they should aim to look young.”Some of those surveyed felt it was a positive and atypical depiction of older women, while others felt it reinforced the idea that ageing was a negative thing and that women were not going to look or feel good unless they tried to fight the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And more than a third said they found stereotypical portrayals of older people, such as always being wealthy, grumpy or only mixing with older people, to be irritating.Survey respondents also raised concerns about how ads were targeted, saying they were frequently shown promotions for “end-of-life” services – such as funeral or cremation services, life insurance and care homes – in media that supposedly drew a higher proportion of older people than others, such as daytime TV.And 44% of those surveyed believed older people were either underrepresented or not represented at all in ads, particularly in categories such as fashion, beauty, technology and household goods.Kam Atwal, the research lead at the ASA, said: “As a society, we’re living longer, richer and more varied lives. Our research reveals that some of today’s portrayals of older people in advertising are not being received positively, and that the public wants ads to better reflect the varied lives older people lead today.”Strathmore has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingOlder peopleAdvertising Standards AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

Thailand has imposed border restrictions with Cambodia in recent days, whileCambodiahas banned Thai films from TV and cinemas, closed a border checkpoint, and cut internet bandwidth fromThailand. Both countries have shortened visas stays for visitors for one another’s citizens.A ban on imports of Thai fruit and vegetables to Cambodia came into effect on Tuesday. This follows an ultimatum by Cambodia’s former leaderHun Sen, who ran the country for almost four decades before handing over to his son in 2023, who said those imports would be blocked unless Thai border restrictions were lifted.On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Cambodians, carrying national flags and pictures of the country’s leaders, took to the streets of Phnom Penh for an official rally to support the government’s stance.View image in fullscreenPeople march in support of the Cambodian government's actions in its recent border dispute with Thailand, in Phnom Penh on Wednesday.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe deputy prime minister, Hun Many, brother of the prime minister, told the crowd the march was “an encouragement and additional energy for the government and our forces”.“When the country faces a threat or any insult, the Cambodian people will not stay still, we will stand up in united spirit,” he said.Cambodia has asked the international court of justice (ICJ) to resolve the border dispute. However,Thailanddoes not accept the court’s jurisdiction and has said it prefers to solve the matter through direct negotiations.The long-running dispute dates back more than a century, to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border.The dispute has, over the years, has repeatedly fanned nationalist sentiments in both countries.

Cambodia sought a clarification of the ruling in 2011, and in 2013, the ICJ verdict stated that anarea next to the temple was also Cambodia.Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has said the government is committed to protecting Thailand’s sovereignty, and ensuring peace along the border.

He said the research highlighted the increasing strain placed on the Metropolitan police during large-scale public events.“Limited resourcing has restricted the police service’s ability to respond to growing operational pressures,” Comfort said in the letter.He went on to say that increased investment in stewarding and crowd management was “now essential to allow the police to focus on their primary role of crime prevention and public protection”.Comfort added that a failure to secure immediate additional funding “risks compromising public safety and jeopardising the future of the carnival”.View image in fullscreenAbout 7,000 Met police officers were on duty for last year’s carnival.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe carnival chair said although the GLA and the two councils had provided “substantial support” for stewarding during past festivals, they could no longer “meet the growing operational requirements identified in the review”.The Met police’s assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, previously raised concerns of a “mass casualty event” at the carnival due to crowd density.Giving evidence to the London Assembly police and crime committee last September, Twist said: “While we acknowledge that crime often gets the headlines, the thing that worries me most is the crowd density and the potential for a mass casualty event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she can’t access his online accounts – so she has given up everything to take on the social media giantsWed 18 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 11.48 EDTShareThe last day of Jools Sweeney’s life, 13 April 2022, was sunny and fun-filled. It was the Easter holidays and Jools, who was 14, had spent the day with a bunch of friends in Cheltenham, where he lived. They played football. They walked through fields to a lake and tried to reach the middle in a small wooden boat. Back home, he and a friend had pizza for dinner, then got the fire pit going and toasted marshmallows. At 8.46pm, his friend left, leaving Jools, an only child, on his own. Their laughter as they said goodbye was recorded on the Ring doorbell.Jools’s mum, Ellen Roome, had been out all day but she had been in constant contact with her son. At 9.56pm she rang him to say she would be back soon – she rang three times but there was no answer. When she arrived home, less than 20 minutes later, with her then-partner, she went straight to Jools’s room, just to say hello, and for a moment, made no sense of what she saw. “I said: ‘What are you doing?’” says Roome. “I remember thinking he was messing around. Then I screamed and screamed.” Roome’s partner, a pilot trained in first aid, rushed upstairs and delivered CPR. The house filled with firefighters, paramedics, police officers, Jools’s dad who lived close by, and Roome’s dad, too. Jools was defibrillated. Eventually, a detective took the family aside and said they needed to stop treatment. “We were told that even if they brought him back, he’d be brain dead,” says Roome.She is still struggling to comprehend it.“What just happened? You can’t take it in. This made no sense at all. He was a really happy, fun-loving, popular kid … there’d been no sign of mental health issues – nothing.”Her first thought that night was that Jools had acted under the influence. Had he taken drugs earlier? She rang the parents of his friend who insisted no, they hadn’t – which the toxicology report later confirmed. Jools had no drugs or alcohol in his body. “Then I was absolutely paranoid, I thought someone must have done this to him. I thought there must be somebody else in the house,” says Roome. But that night, a detective assured them that a scene of crime investigation showed no sign of an intruder or a struggle. Police believed this was something her son had done to himself.Police took Jools’s phone and iPad, and the next day, they picked up his computer. Nothing was done with them though: Roome was later told that the forensics machine in Gloucester wasn’t working. Just days before Jools’s death, the case of 12-year-oldArchie Battersbeehad begun to make headlines. Archie had suffered a catastrophic brain injury that was ultimately fatal. His mother had voiced her belief that he had killed himself by accident, while taking part in an online “blackout” challenge. “I asked police if this could have been the same thing, a blackout challenge. I’ll never forget their answer,” says Roome. “They said: ‘It could be but we can’t prove it.’” (Meanwhile, Jools’s phone, iPad and computer, which could surely have given them a better answer, remained untouched.) “If it had been a murder, I think there would have been more investigation,” says Roome. It felt as if, “the police response was: ‘Well, he’s taken his own life … so let’s move on.’”View image in fullscreen‘You can’t take it in. It made no sense at all’ … Roome and Jools fishingBut how could she? Instead, Roome has spent the last two years searching for the truth, trying to understand something utterly incomprehensible – and this means fighting for the right to see her son’s social media data.The Bereaved Families for Online Safety group, of which Roome is now a member, has campaigned for legislative change through theOnline Safety Actand the data (use and access) bill. Under these, technology companies will be required to provide a user’s app history if requested by a coroner. The agonising experience ofMolly Russell’s family showed the need for this. After 14-year-old Molly killed herself, they fought for five years to access her social media, eventually uncovering horrifying content that the coroner believed played a significant part in her death.For Roome, the legislative change is welcome but nowhere near enough. She wants a national system in place whereby a coroner notified of a child’s death immediately applies to Ofcom to send out an order to social media companies to preserve the child’s data. “It should be as standard as a postmortem or a toxicology test,” says Roome. “It will show who they were talking to, what was on their mind, the content they were seeking and the content that was being offered up. A young person’s entire life is on their phone.”At present, there seems to be no system at all. “I’ve become close to so many bereaved parents and we all have such different experiences,” she says. “Ros Dowey’s son Murraytook his own life and within two weeks, Police Scotland had got into his phone, established that he was a victim of sextortion and were tracking the people blackmailing him. Jools’s phone just sat in somebody’s desk. In the case of Mia Janin who was bullied and killed herself at 14,the police lost the phoneand the sim card [they were later recovered]. How can it be so different? Shocked, numb parents are saying, ‘What happened to our beautiful child?’ and there’s such a lack of giving a damn.”For the first year after Jools’s death, Roome had none of this fight in her. “I was struggling to even breathe,” she says. “I collapsed into just about existing and I was in denial. Three years down the line, I still expect him to walk in the door sometimes.” Instead, Roome assumed the inquest would deliver all the answers. “I expected to go in and be told: ‘This is what happened and why.’” Instead, they learned nothing. “It was just me, Jools’s dad, my partner at the time, and the coroner – and it was over in half an hour,” says Roome. They were presented with a folder containing statements from various people, including Jools’s friends, none of whom had seen any sign of mental health problems. (His friends believe the blackout challenge is the only answer that makes sense.) “The coroner said: ‘I can’t be certain he was in a suicidal mood,’” says Roome. “So Jools’s death certificate is just a narrative description of how he took his life. We walked out, thinking: ‘Now what?’”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got nothing left to lose’ ... Ellen Roome.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianReturning to her old life wasn’t possible. Roome ran a finance company. “I remember trying to go back to work – I had staff who were reliant on me – and hearing people complain about the coffee. I thought: ‘I’ve got to get out.’ I decided to sell the business and then look for answers and that’s exactly what I did. I sold it in March 2024. Then I went back to being a fighter.”Her first step was to contact the social media companies to request Jools’s data. “Even contacting them was hard and took a lot of time,” she says. Instagram answered: “With regard to your son’s messages on our services, we are not able to provide private messages without a valid legal order.” “TikTok arranged a Zoom meeting where I was told that they ‘might’ have deleted the data. They didn’t say that they’d looked and they had deleted it, only that they ‘might’ have,” says Roome. “The line they give you is that, without a court order, they’re not releasing anything.”Next, Roome began lobbying and meeting MPs.Her petitionto give parents the right to access their child’s social media accounts gained more than 120,000 signatures in nine days and was debated in parliament. At that debate, MP Caroline Voaden described a meeting with senior representatives of all the social media companies and hearing their “pathetic excuses” for not releasing Jools’s data. “They said they would be fined for releasing the data. By whom? Who is going to press charges in their right mind?,” asked Voaden. “It’s a pathetic attempt to avoid the potential bad publicity that will follow if it becomes clear that Jools’s short life ended after taking part in a challenge. It’s about protecting their reputation. I believe it’s about the accountants who fear the lawsuits.” Roome agrees: “Who are they protecting? Surely, they should be saying: ‘Here you are, bereaved parents, I hope you get some answers.’ I believe they’re protecting themselves.”’The Guardian also contacted Instagram. A spokesperson apologised for the delay in responding to Roome, which it said was the result of an unstaffed email address, something it has now rectified. Instagram has created a new facility that enables parents to request and download their child’s account history, the posts they are engaging with and the accounts they are following. They have offered to help Roome use this.View image in fullscreen‘His room is exactly the same. I’m not ready to pack up his stuff’ … Jools.Photograph: Ellen RoomeWhen approached by the Guardian, TikTok declined to give a statement, but did say that it is not the case that it is trying to prevent Roome from obtaining answers. According to TikTok, it is legally required to delete personal data unless, for example, it receives a valid request from law enforcement to preserve it. By 2024, when it was contacted about Jools’s account, it was no longer available.Roome doesn’t believe this. She has Jools’s phone back now, she has worked out his pin and paid £20,000 for a forensic examination. Though she can see Jools’s TikTok account, much of the content is faded out and inaccessible – Roome doesn’t know why – but each inaccessible video has an ID number. She is applying to the high court to request a fresh inquest so that a coroner can apply for Jools’s data.She is also suing TikTokfor her son’s alleged wrongful death, alongside three other parents who believe their children died while taking part in an online blackout challenge. One of the children, Isaac Kenevan, 13, had three videos stored on his phone (one with a TikTok logo) showing Isaac making himself pass out, then recovering, laughing. There are other factors related to the way the children died that have led their parents to suspect it was not deliberate. “God forbid anyone heard our conversations: we’ve talked in graphic detail and pieced together similarities,” says Roome. “In the lawsuit, we only need to show a 50% chance that this could have been the result of social media in order to progress … then they’d have to release the data.”According to TikTok, the blackout challenge has been banned from its platform since 2020 and it has found no evidence of it trending. Roome disputes this and says she has been contacted by parents who believe their children have since participated in it, some as recently as this month.For now, this fight is Roome’s life. “I’m haemorrhaging money every month and at some point, I’ll have to get a full-time job,” she says. She also has to leave her house, which she bought with her partner, as they’ve now separated. “I’m not ready to go yet, I’m not ready to pack up Jools’s stuff,” she says. “His room is exactly the same. I washed all the clothes in his laundry basket and put them back in his drawer. I wash his bedsheets now and again, too – even though that feels weird when I know he’s never going to sleep in his bed again.” Twice a year – on the anniversary of Jools’s death and his birthday in July – that room fills up with his friends. “I love it,” she says. “There’s this pile of shoes at the bottom of the stairs. Last year they showed up in cars – they were all learning to drive. I found that particularly hard. This July, Jools would be 18. One of the girls is bringing a lemon drizzle cake because that was his favourite.”There may never be answers. “Since the beginning, I’ve said that we don’t know if social media was involved,” says Roome, “but it’s the only thing we haven’t checked. If I get to the very end of all this, and we’ve checked and we’ve seen and we still don’t know, then maybe I’ll have to accept it.” There’s a pause, and then she adds: “But if we get to the end, and we find that social media did play a part, I will not let them get away with it. I’ve got absolutely nothing left to lose.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

But Russia’s priority remains avoiding any moves that could undermine its warming ties with the new US administration or prompt a shift in Trump’s stance on Ukraine,” the source said.Still, the Kremlin stands to lose from a prolonged US-backed Israeli military campaign that devastates Iran’s economic and military infrastructure and threatens the survival of the regime in Tehran.“If the current Iranian regime collapses, it would be both a strategic and reputational blow for Russia,” the source with ties to the Russian foreign ministry said.“A bigger loss than the fall of Damascus,” the source added, referring to Moscow’sdiminished influence over Syriaafter the fall of Bashar al-Assad, a longtime Kremlin ally whose eventual defeat marked the end of a costlydecade-long Russian intervention.On the surface, Russia’s muted response and restrained condemnations stand in contrast to thedeepening ties it has forged with Iransince its 2022 invasion of Ukraine – a war that placed Moscow alongside Tehran among the regimes most heavily hit by sanctions.In the early months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Iranprovedto be an important partner to the Kremlin, supplying Moscow with thousands of combat drones used to strike Ukrainian cities. Tehran also later sent instructors to Russia to help set up a drone production facility, based on Iranian designs, deep in the Ural mountains.Vladimir Putin in turn praised the deepening ties between the two countries. In January he and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, signed a wide-ranging “comprehensive strategic partnership treaty” aimed at strengthening military cooperation and intelligence sharing.Still, the two nations’ relationship has always been complex, observers say. When signing the military agreement, both countries insisted on omitting a mutual defence clause, meaning Moscow now is under no legal obligation to provide military assistance to Iran. Russia has also been slow to deliver a range of weapons Tehran has requested.“Despite repeated requests from the Iranian side for various types of weapons – air defence systems and fighter jets – none of this has been transferred to Iran by Russia to date,” Smagin said.Partly due to its entanglement in Ukraine and its growing ties with other regional players,including Saudi Arabia, Moscow has shown little urgency on propping up Iran, even as Tehran’s position has weakened after blowsagainstits key proxy, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah.The Kremlin, meanwhile, has largely decoupled its reliance on Iranian military support, having already acquired the expertise to mass-produce drones domestically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For one, oil prices have surged to their highest level in four months – and are expected to rise further – offering Moscow a much-needed economic boost at a time when falling global energy prices had threatened to squeeze its wartime budget.The conflict has also drawn the full attention of Trump, who in recent days has barely mentioned Ukraine. Hecut short a trip to the G7 summit, skipping a previously scheduled meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow defence thinktank, wrote on Telegram: “It is likely that Ukraine will suffer the greatest military and political damage in this situation, apart from Iran itself, of course. A new war in the Middle East will not only distract the world’s attention from the [conflict in Ukraine] but will also, apparently, contribute to the final reorientation of the US towards providing military assistance to Israel.”But while these may offer short-term gains, the long-term picture is far more precarious for Russia, analysts and insiders say.Russia risks losing a key strategic partner – along with years of political and economic capital – in a blow that could seriously undermine its broader geopolitical ambitions. Over the past two years, Moscow has become Iran’s leading foreign investor, committing billions to gas, energy and infrastructure projects – all of which could be jeopardised if the regime in Tehran falls.And unlike some of Moscow’s other allies, such as Belarus, Russia shares little in the way of historical or cultural affinity with Iran. Their partnership has been forged less through tradition than through a shared hostility towards the west – and the experience of navigating life under sanctions.“If this regime falls, I think it will be much harder for Russia to retain its assets and influence in the country,” said Hanna Notte, a Berlin-based expert on Russian foreign policy.Notte said the worst-case scenario for Moscow would be a Middle East dominated by US-aligned powers. “That would be a heavy blow to Russia.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaIranMiddle East and north AfricaEuropeIsraelDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

How would the PM sell a third way?Mahmood says UK will seek reform of human rights conventionWed 18 Jun 2025 12.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 18.26 EDTShareCan a lefty human rights lawyer be the one to take on Britain’s uneasy relationship with the European convention on human rights (ECHR)?It is the most unlikely of causes forKeir Starmer. But there is a growing feeling in government that he should seize the initiative.It will not just be a renegotiation in Europe, which ministers fear would echo the failed EU one attempted by David Cameron, but unilateral reform in the way the fundamental rights in the convention can be applied.Convention on human rights must adapt, says Council of Europe headRead moreIt is fraught with complication and risk and no one knows that better than the prime minister. Starmer is steeped in the language and history of the Strasbourg court. Allies say he can – and does – reel off the most important cases and precedents from memory.The first time Starmerwrote for the Guardian was in 2009on the fundamental importance of human rights, saying that to dismiss them was to “lose all notion of justice and surrender to the sometimes understandable but always inappropriate yearning solely for retribution”.But it is from this position that those in government – and a growing number ofLabourMPs – believe there is an opportunity to lance the boil of the far-right argument to leave the convention altogether.“Under this government the question of whether to stay in the ECHR is settled, it’s not even a question,” one senior government minister said.“But this is not the EU – it’s not about in or out – it’s about whether we can use our national sovereignty to address what is a legitimate concern from the public to how this law is being applied in order to preserve what are really fundamental human rights laws which we all believe in.”The rightwing press have made a bogeyman of the ECHR – making wildly misleading accusations of it being responsible forallowing criminals to stayin Britain because their children don’t like foreign chicken nuggets.It is the bete noire ofRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, and leaving the ECHR was the platform for his Conservative leadership attempt. It looks almost certain to be adopted as a policy by Kemi Badenoch. Nigel Farage said it would be his first act to leave, if he were PM.But a growing number of Labour MPs say that although much of the criticism of the ECHR is hyped-up nonsense that falls apart when details of the cases are revealed, some of the commentary is valid. Many are in Reform-facing seats and want the government to seize the issue and act decisively.The two key aspects of the convention that have caused the most controversy are article 8, which includes privacy and right to family life; and article 3, freedom from torture and degrading treatment. The Home Office is undertaking reviews of both – and how courts apply them.View image in fullscreenThere is a strong feeling that seeking European-wide agreement to change the ECHR is a non-starter.Photograph: Jean-François Badias/APITV’s investigation this week is an obvious illustration; two fugitives wanted for murder and child rape, one of whom has offended again in Britain, cannot be deported because of overcrowded conditions in Brazilian prisons.In a joint article responding to the ITV investigation, two of the most vocal Labour MPs of the 2024 intake – Jake Richards and Dan Tomlinson – said the government needed to neutralise the calls from the Tories and Reform to leave the ECHR. To do that, it should “offer serious and practical changes to see off this threat and deliver for the British people”.Many more MPs say they believe there are examples the world over of voters reacting violently against international law and treaties because of their perceived anti-democratic inflexibility, which they believe stops them getting the changes they vote for.The way to stop this growing backlash happening in Britain, they say, is to show that change can happen without throwing away decades of long-fought-for human rights.The attorney general, Richard Hermer, a veteran human rights lawyer like Starmer, whose legal career has made him a big target for the right, has hinted he is in agreement. His view will be essential to the path Starmer takes. “British leadership to strengthen and reform the international rules-based system is both the right thing to do and the only truly realistic choice,” he said in a recent speech.Senior government figures say there may be a path for a bill that sets out the principles on how the ECHR can be applied going forward, shaped by modern circumstances.But there is a strong feeling that seeking European-wide agreement to change the ECHR is a non-starter – it would take too long, be too tortuous, and give the impression the UK is going “cap in hand” to Strasbourg to ask for permission to change things.It is true that nation states, including France, have begun to vary their interpretations of those laws, especially article 8. Some cabinet minsters believe that the change can come through guidance, especially to the first-tier immigration tribunal, about how to apply the law.But MPs in favour of change would like to see the government seize the cause more robustly and publicly than that, which is why they favour legislation. “There have been too many occasions where the centre left haven’t seized a cause that could turn very ugly and found a way to respond to public concern in a way that is progressive,” one said.The challenge is how to land that message of a third way, instead of the binary choice the populist right will present between leave or remain. That will feel queasily familiar to veterans of the Brexit years – Starmer again is among them.Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsKeir StarmerLabourReform UKHuman rightsEuropeConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their creators reveal the story behind the projectMatthew Cantorin Los AngelesWed 18 Jun 2025 15.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 15.18 EDTShare“Missing son.” “Missing father.” “Missing grandmother.”The words are written in bright red letters at the top of posters hanging on lampposts and storefronts aroundLos Angeles. At first glance, they appear to be from worried relatives seeking help from neighbors.But a closer look reveals that the missing people are immigrants to the US who have been disappeared by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Some of the faces are familiar to anyone who has been following the news – that missing father, for instance, is Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man who wasdeported to El Salvador in March without a hearing, in what the Trump administration admitted was an error. “Abducted by Ice,” the poster reads, under a picture of Ábrego García with his small son. “Did not receive constitutional protections. Currently being held in detention.”The missing grandmother is Gladis Yolanda Chávez Pineda,a Chicago womanwho wastaken by Icewhen she showed up for a check-in with immigration officials this month. She had arrived in the US seeking a better life for her daughter and was in the midst of applying for asylum. “Lived in the US for 10 years,” the poster states. “No criminal history.”View image in fullscreenMarchers stop to look at flyers with photos of people detained by Ice.Photograph: David McNew/Getty ImagesThe missing son is Andry Hernández Romero, amakeup artist who fled persecution in Venezuela. On arrival in the US, he was detained, withUS authorities claiminghis tattoos indicated gang membership. His family and friends say that’s ridiculous. He was among hundreds of people deported to the El Salvadormega-prisonknown as Cecot in March. “Currently being held in a concentration camp,” the poster says.The posters are just a few examples of a campaign of quiet resistance on the streets of Los Angeles. On Monday, a walk down Sunset Boulevard in the historicSilver Lake neighborhoodmeant encountering an array of flyers, artwork and spray-painted messages of support for disappeared immigrants and fury at the administration.The “missing” posters, which have also appeared in other neighborhoods, were particularly effective. Duct-taped to telephone polls amid ads for comedy shows, guitar lessons and yard sales, they reminded passersby of the individual lives derailed by Trump’s immigration crackdown – instead of names in the news, these were families and friends who might have lived just down the road.View image in fullscreenPosters around Silver Lake, Los Angeles, supporting immigrants.Photograph: Matthew Cantor/The GuardianHumanizing people’s stories was precisely the goal, said the creators behind the posters.“I just wanted to reframe this idea of immigrants as criminals, and put into perspective that these are people – this is someone’s grandmother, this is someone’s father, this is someone’s son,” said Ben*, the posters’ 28-year-old designer. He worked with his friend Sebastian*, 31, to distribute them around town.What began as a friends-and-family effort expanded after Ben shared the PDF: “I shared it with a few friends, then they shared it, and so it kind of just blew up.”For Sebastian, the issue was personal. “I moved here from Colombia 14 years ago, and ever since the first Trump administration, I’ve seen my community being attacked,” he said. “So as soon as I saw these posters that my friend was doing, that I felt something in me that needed to go out and help.”While they worked, “people started taking photos, and I had a moment with this one elderly woman where she was looking at it, and she really just started tearing up,” Ben said. “At that moment, I was like, ‘OK, this is actually connecting to people.’”The images have appeared in recent days as the city has become a focal point for protests against Trump’s immigration policies, which began on 6 June amid raids targeting immigrants at several locations in the city.As the protests emerged in parts of LA, Donald Trump called in the national guard without the governor’s consent – an action no president has taken since 1965. Shortly afterward, he summoned hundreds of marines. Much news coverage painted the city as a kind of post-apocalyptic hellscape, with protesters facing off against troops and cars on fire, fueling Trump’s narrative of a lawless city hopelessly embroiled in chaos.In fact, much of the unrest was confined to a small area of downtown LA. Across most of the vast city and county, life continued as normal, the sun shining over familiar traffic jams, studio lots and suburban sprawl. Still, the protests – and the federal government’s wildly disproportionate clampdown – served as a spark that has helped to fuel a national outcry, as well as this subtler demonstration of local solidarity.Alongside the “Missing” posters were a series of alternative descriptions of Ice – rather than Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, stenciled messages on the pavement and shop windows condemned “Illegal Country-wide Embarrassment”, “Institution of Child Endangerment” and the perhaps less clear “Insecure Confused Ejaculation”.View image in fullscreenMore posters stuck up around Los Angeles.Photograph: Matthew Cantor/The GuardianOther flyers advertised Saturday’s “No Kings” protests, while still others noted that “Undocumented hands feed you”, with an illustration of a person working in a field. Those latter posters were created by Sydney*, 29, who works in the music industry in Los Angeles. Her 9-to-5 job makes it impossible to attend protests, she said, so creating this image was an alternative way to participate in resistance. “You read something tragic every morning lately about the Ice raids,” she said.She was particularly moved by the plight of agricultural workers, toiling for low wages under the threat of immigration crackdowns. “I just felt very compelled to speak up for them in places that people probably don’t think about them, like Silver Lake and the city,” she said. “I am Latina. I have many family members that came here and are immigrants, and so it just touches home for me.”Inspired by a slogan she saw in protest photos and Mexican decor flags, Sydney created the stylized image as a social media post. “I just wanted to tie something beautiful with something very political and loud,” she said. A friend saw the post, asked if she could print it out, and plastered it around town.That DIY approach adds to the posters’ power: there is a sense of neighbors helping neighbors. As the administration conjures a tale of a city in crisis, the images – unpretentious and haunting – serve as a reminder of what the protests are actually about.* The Guardian is withholding full names for privacy reasonsExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesUS politicsUS immigrationCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Don’t start with me, seriously.What does it mean?To the TikTok generation, to crash out is to become suddenly, uncontrollably angry or distressed.As opposed tofall asleep really quicklyorexit a tennis tournamentearly?This sense of crashing out originated as a slang term in African American Vernacular English and may be more than a decade old.But it’sbecome better known recently thanks to TikTok?Correct. The young people of today, overwhelmed by stress and emotionally impaired by their social media addictions, are finding themselves prone to visceral outbursts.Are they now?You really don’t want to take that tone with me today.Sorry, carry on.The widespread nature of this phenomenon among gen Z has in turn popularised the expression. “I like that there’s a term for it now,” one 24-year-old social media usertold the New York Times.There was always a term for it.Don’t say “hissy fit”, because it’s not the same thing.I wasn’t going to say that.It’s also true that similar outbursts were once covered by the term “meltdown” – the emotional equivalent of a collapsing nuclear reactor core – but crashing out is more nuanced.I wasn’t going to say meltdown, either.Perhaps you’re from the era when such behaviour was known as “acting out”, suggesting a performative element to the outburst.Actually, I was going to say “conniption”.That really does date you. To about 1833.I suppose crashing out isn’tas full blown as having a conniption.It depends – the definition has stretched to include everything from a momentary loss of composure to a mental breakdown.However youlabel it, it’s all just “losingit”, isn’t it?I’m going to do some breathing exercises now.Is that apreventive measureto avoid crashing out?One of them. Others include self-soothing – calming some or all of your senses – and taking a break from social media.So one of the cures for a condition popularised by TikTok is … getting off TikTok?Inevitably, yes.Do say:“Regulating stress levels is central to maintaining an emotional balance.”Don’t say: “Don’t worry, you’re just having what is technically known as a tantrum.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesWritten languageLanguageSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Erotic Vagrancy by Roger LewisA gloriously gossipy portrait of Hollywood power couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Roger Lewis’s twin biography is read with just the right amount of archness by actor Justin Avoth. The “erotic vagrancy” of the title refers to a statement issued by the pope during the pair’s brazen antics in Rome while filming Cleopatra when they frolicked on a yacht in full view of the paparazzi. Both were married, but not to each other.Available via Riverrun, 22hr 58min2. James by Percival EverettThis Pulitzer prize-winning retelling of Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is seen through the eyes of “Jim”, an enslaved Black man and friend of teen runaway Huck and his pal Tom Sawyer. It is read by Dominic Hoffman, whose performance is wry and charismatic, highlighting the code-switching of the protagonist and giving the character an agency denied him by Twain.Available via Mantle, 7hr 49min3. Tom Lake by Ann PatchettPatchett brought in the big guns for the audio version of her novel about a family who are reunited for the cherry harvest on their Michigan farm. Meryl Streep gives terrific voice to matriarch Lara and her three adult daughters Maisie, Emily and Nell. As they set to work, the girls quiz their mother about an idyllic summer in her youth when she joined a production of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, during which she had an affair with the leading man.Available via Bloomsbury, 11hr 22minDavid Nicholls: ‘I’m genuinely deathly at a dinner party’Read more4. You Are Here by David NichollsNicholls’s sixth romcom is ideally set up for a dual narration, which comes courtesy of actors Lydia Leonard and Lee Ingleby. Leonard is Marnie, a divorced copy editor from London who has come to the Lake District for a group hike along Alfred Wainwright’s coast-to-coast route. Leading the walkers is Ingleby’s Michael, an earnest geography teacher with a passion for rock formations. The pair are frosty at first but, as others in the group flake out, they find they have more in common than they thought.Available via WF Howes, 8hr 27min5. The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha ChristieMove over David Suchet, there’s a new Hercule Poirot in town. This adaptation of Christie’s first novel stars Peter Dinklage as the moustached sleuth called to investigate an incident at an Essex country house. Emily is a widow who has recently remarried a man 20 years her junior. When she cries out in the night, her adult children find her bedroom is locked from the inside. But when they break down the door, she is already dead.Available via Audible Originals, 3hr 53min6. A Voyage Around the Queen by Craig BrownYou don’t have to be a royalist to enjoy this portrait of Elizabeth II, expertly narrated by Harriet Walter, which also examines the psyche of her subjects. Instead of a biographical account, it is a patchwork of news reports, documentary excerpts, letters, diary entries, overheard anecdotes and even dreams. From these we learn that Kingsley Amis loaded up on Imodium before meeting Her Majesty lest he fart in her orbit and that Paul Theroux dreamed about leaning his head in her bosom.Available via 4th Estate, 19hr 46min7. The Lost Loves of Boysie Singh by Ingrid PersaudA fictionalised account of a real-life gangster from Trinidad, Persaud’s evocative novel tells of a pirate who terrorised the inhabitants of Port of Spain and the Gulf of Paria in the 1940s and 50s. Told in Trinidadian dialect by four women with whom he was involved, it is alternately narrated by Persaud (who reads Mana Lala), Melanie La Barrie (Popo), Martina Laird (Doris) and Chanel Quesnel (Rosie). Each give lively and nuanced readings as they provide troubling glimpses into the life of a charismatic yet dangerous man.Available via Faber, 14hr 11minWhere to start with: Patricia HighsmithRead more8. The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia HighsmithThe world is not short of versions of Highsmith’s novel – the first of five – about a scammer who inveigles his way into the lives of the rich and well heeled, but this audio edition is excellent. Actor David Menkin shines as Tom Ripley, who blends guilelessness and duplicity as he wins the trust of Dickie Greenleaf, son of a shipping magnate, who is living the high life on Italy’s Amalfi coast.Available via Little Brown Audio, 9hr9. Rosarita by Anita DesaiA captivating tale of identity and discovery, Desai’s novella opens with Bonita being accosted by an elderly stranger who recognises her as the daughter of an old friend from art school. This triggers memories of a painting that hung in Bonita’s childhood home that, in turn, leads her to explore her family’s past. Narrator Meera Simhan leans into the dreamlike quality of Desai’s prose in which reality and imagination collide.Available via Picador, 2hr 33min10. The Summer Book by Tove Jansson“Do you know what it feels like when you dive?” asks six-year-old Sophie. “Of course I do,” replies her grandmother. “You let go of everything … And you glide.” Set on a tiny Finnish island, this 1972 novella by the Moomins creatorTove Janssonfinds the pair beach combing, making up stories, bickering and laughing. All the while, Sophie’s grandmother teaches her young charge about respect for nature. Julie Walters’s narration is a delight: her Sophie is insistent and curious while her grandmother is variously playful, cranky and wise.Available via Saga Egmont, 4hr 1minExplore more on these topicsAudiobooksPercival EverettAnn PatchettDavid NichollsAgatha ChristiePatricia HighsmithAnita DesaifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the west continually turns away from this realityWed 18 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 07.31 EDTShareAs the G7issues a statement declaringthat Israel has a “right to defend itself”, you have a right to ask if you are losing your mind. Israel launched an unprovoked onslaught on Iran. Its excuse – that Tehran may acquire a nuclear weapon – renders its attack illegal under the UN charter, which forbids wars justified by the claim of a future threat.“Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror,”declares the G7 statement. Even though Donald Trump’sintelligence chief testifiedthree months ago that the US intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”. Even though it’s Israel thatactually possesses nuclear weapons, while refusing to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and refusing International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. Even though, as progress was being made in nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Israel targeted Iran’s chief negotiator and proceeded to exterminate scientists, including their families, alongside countless other civilians,including children, an athlete, a teacher, a pilates instructor. Even though Israel’s leader issubject to an arrest warrant, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. And even though Israel has erased Gaza in a genocidal frenzy, and subjected the illegally occupied and colonised West Bank to an escalating pogrom, attacked southern Lebanon and Beirut, and invaded and occupied Syria. No country in the Middle East is as great a source of regional instability and terror as Israel: it’s not even close.Yet even as polling shows that Britons overwhelminglywant no partin this literal crime, we hear the same tunes sung to demonise opponents of the latest carnage. Scottish politicians demanding peace “are siding with a mediaeval theocratic dictatorship”,declares former flagshipBBC interviewer Andrew Neil. Recall how opponents of the Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya calamities were monstered as lackeys of Saddam Hussein, the Taliban and Muammar Gaddafi. Yet who, Mr Neil, was vindicated – catastrophically so?In Gaza, Israel destroyed its reputation. Attacking Iran is a belated and dangerous attempt to restore it | Nesrine MalikRead moreHere is a tragedy paid with the blood of an estimated more than 4.5 million human souls – the combined number of direct and indirect deaths in the post-9/11 war zones, according to aBrown University study. There have been no reputational consequences for those who cheered on each calamity, allowing them to walk away whistling from each crime scene demanding yet more violence without shame. About six months before the Iraq invasion, and believing the war in Afghanistan to already be a great success, Neil wrote a column warning “the suburbs of Baghdad are now dotted with secret installations, often posing as hospitals or schools” which were developing chemical and biological weapons and, “most sinister of all, a renewed attempt to develop nuclear weapons”.One sentence he deployed against advocates of peace should surely become the epitaph of the warmongers: “It is unclear how many more times they have to be wrong before we are released from the obligation to take them too seriously.” Benjamin Netanyahu, of course,shared his hubris, promisingUS Congress in 2002: “If you take out Saddam – Saddam’s regime – I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.”No amount of objective failure can change their minds. This fanaticism can only be sustained by mocking reality itself. Unlike Israel,the Iranian regime“targets civilians”, says a prime minister accused of war crimes. At the same time, an Israeli military spokespersonbrands Tehran a “terror regime”because of these killings. The concept of terrorism, in practice, has come to mean violence perpetrated by regimes and militants hostile to the west, used to portray such acts as illegitimate and immoral, unlike the vastly more lethal missiles and bullets of Tel Aviv and Washington.Israel’s gall is something to behold. It has butchered tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza –mostly women and children– yet24 Israelis killed by Iranian attacksapparently exposes the unique evil of Tehran’s regime. More than twice as many hungry Palestinians looking for food in Gazawere slaughtered in a single massacreby Israeli troops overnight: note how this mass killing receives the tiniest fraction of media attention. There is no attempt to disguise this hierarchy of death.A comprehensive new reporton the BBC’s reporting of the Gaza genocide finds that each Israeli fatality received 33 times more coverage than each Palestinian. The west’s facilitation of Israel’s atrocities relies on treating Arab and Iranian lives as worthless.Iran, too, of course, has a legal responsibility to avoid killing Israeli civilians. As Kenneth Roth, former Human Rights Watch director,observes: “Israel’s close intermingling of military and civilian sites makes it difficult to know what Iran is aiming its missiles at.” In Gaza, this was defined as using civilians as “human shields”, but no such standards are applied to Israel. This narrative was used to wipe Gaza from the face of the Earth, even as Israel used actualPalestinian human shieldson an industrial scale.You may indeed feel like you are losing your mind. After all, Israel’s military has reportedly committed every war crime under the sun. It attacked Iran without evidence or provocation. The same cheerleaders for past bloodbaths strut around advocating yet more slaughter as though recent history never happened, while opponents of dropping bombs on terrified civilians are once more smeared as dangerous extremists. Yet western states issue a statement portraying the genocidal, expansionist, nuclear-armed Israeli state as the victim, and our government refuses to rule out military support for Tel Aviv.The truth is you are not losing your mind. The actual mad men are those in power. And unless they finally face a reckoning, the abyss awaits.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But just staying at home is no answerWed 18 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTShareAfter coordinatedprotests across Europe last weekend, it’s easy for the ethically conscious tourist to feel uncertain. Across southern Europe – and particularly in Spain, Italy and Portugal – there are headlines blaming visitors for everything from overcrowding to housing shortages. In gentrifying neighbourhoods, slogans such as “Tourists go home” have appeared on walls and windows, with some angry residents grabbing headlines bysquirting water pistols at tourists.Does that mean a golden age of tourism is over? No. Does the complicated relationship between those who want to visit the world’s most interesting places and those who live in them need a reset? Probably.For the most part, protesters are calling for a total overhaul of a model of tourism that, they argue, drives up housing costs, harms the environment and creates low-paid, unstable jobs – while concentrating profits in the hands of a few.I’ve seen this first-hand. I live inLavapiés, a vibrant and multicultural neighbourhood near Madrid’s main train station. When I moved here 12 years ago, the area was a haven of traditional bars and restaurants and independent shops. Today, many of those restaurants – once offering a fullmenú del díafor €8 (£6.80) – have doubled their prices. A recently built Ibis hotel, complete with a digital price board resembling a petrol station display, now advertises fluctuating nightly rates of about €150 to €250. Local businesses have been replaced by ground-floor tourist accommodation, with passersby able to peer straight into capsule bedrooms from the street.Lavapiés has one of the highest concentrations of unlicensed tourist rentals in Madrid. These small flats, originally built in the 18th and 19th centuries to house the city’s growing industrial workforce, remained affordable for centuries. Now, thousands of such flats are listed on Airbnb at rates rivalling those in the city’s wealthiest neighbourhoods. But tourists aren’t choosing these places maliciously – short-term rental platforms offer cheaper, more flexible options for groups, especially in a market where a basic hotel room can easily cost €100 or more a night.This is not just a story of tourists replacing local people; it’s one of policy failure and economic imbalance. In Madrid, decent food is often still relatively affordable – but the same can’t be said for accommodation. The charming, no-frills guesthouses with lace curtains and wrought-iron balconies are disappearing fast, and the gap they leave behind is being filled by unlicensed rentals in former homes. There are roughly 15,000 illegal tourist apartments in Madrid alone, rising to more than 66,000 across the country.To its credit, Spain’s leftwing coalition government has attempted to regulate rents and pledged to build more housing. But these plans, combined with resistance from regional governments, fail to address the immediate impact that tourist rentals have on the availability of affordable homes. In the case of Madrid, the regional government, presided over by the rightwing People’s party (PP), has refused to declare “high-tension areas” in order to allow city councils to limit rent increases as provided for in the new national legislation.View image in fullscreenGraffiti at a protest in Barcelona, Spain, 15 June 2025.Photograph: Marta Perez/EPALikewise, the PP-dominated Madrid city council recently approved a modification of town planning rules, formally separating tourist accommodation from residential buildings. Although the official line is that this is a step towards protecting housing for local people, it has in reality paved the way for entire buildings to be converted into tourist-only properties and made it easier to transform ground-floor commercial premises into tourist lets.As southern Europe’s cities and islands have passed a tipping point, some are calling for an outright ban on tourist flats, starting with those that are unlicensed. That may be necessary, but solving the housing crisis will take more than just tighter regulations and housebuilding – the other half of the equation is addressing the lack of decent, mid-range places for tourists to stay. Spain continues to build hotels, but too many new developments are glitzy four- and five-star projects aimed at luxury travellers. This shortage of modest, comfortable accommodation mirrors the broader shortage of affordable housing for residents.As Europe responds with growing resentment towards tourists, many people are asking: is it even possible to enjoy a trip without contributing to the problem? Can you still visit Madrid, Barcelona or the Canary Islands without encountering the “Tourists go home” signs – or being squirted with water pistols? Should you?Campaigners mount coordinated protests across Europe against ‘touristification’Read moreThe answer is yes. First, it’s important to put the water pistol incidents in perspective: these are symbolic, isolated acts and far from the norm. More importantly, tourism is vital to Spain’s economy,accounting for roughly 12% of GDP. The country wants tourists, but that doesn’t mean business as usual should continue. National and regional governments, and city councils, must do far more to regulate short-term rentals, support local communities and invest in affordable infrastructure – for residents and visitors.But travellers have an important role to play too: by choosing accommodation designed for tourists wherever possible; by learning about housing pressures in the places they visit; or by exercising judgment about where and when to travel. Opting to visit a resort town on the mainland rather than a city on an island might put less pressure on local communities and resources, for example.Times can be tense, but don’t let guilt define your presence as a tourist. Feeling bad for visiting a place only plays into resentment and shifts the focus away from where it belongs: on deficits in housing and tourist accommodation. My advice is no more water pistols: instead, plan and build so countries work for residents and tourists.Leah Pattem is a multimedia journalist based in SpainExplore more on these topicsOvertourismOpinionSpainItalyPortugalEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

When it comes to facial hair, I’ve learned it’s best to go big or go homeWed 18 Jun 2025 12.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 13.31 EDTShareWhat is it with all these wispy moustaches suddenly decorating young men’s faces? These things, which have crawled their way on to so many upper lips, aren’t fully formed moustaches. There’s no depth to them. They’re straggly, patchy, with skin showing through them. They look as though their owners aren’t fully committed to them. Or, worse, that they are trying their best, but this apology of a moustache is all they can manage. It’s the kind of moustache you grow when puberty first makes it possible to do so, the debut facial hair with which you aim to convince publicans that you’re old enough to be served alcohol.The only thing I can say in their favour is that they are at least equal opportunity moustaches, in that even those who can’t muster much in the way of facial hair can have a fair crack at producing one of these. But otherwise, my firm view on moustaches, for the infinitesimally little it’s worth, is to go big or go home. I’m working on a documentary about Sir Edward Elgar. Now that’s what I call a moustache. Full, bushy, yet neat. A veritable symphony of bristle. It may be that spending so much time with Sir Edward lately is what led me to suddenly start seeing these miserable creepy-crawlies sullying faces everywhere.View image in fullscreenLuxuriantly ’tached … Edward Elgar.Photograph: Reginald Haines/Getty ImagesInitially, I felt a bit sorry for their owners. I took it they were doing it for a charity thing and, even though they plainly looked crap, were sticking with it in aid of a good cause. Respect. But I checked my calendar, and it turns out we’re in the month of June, notMovember.Could it be, could it really be, that they think these things look good? It would seem to be so. I sought confirmation that this rubbishy apology of a moustache has been confirmed as an actual trend. And, if so, who started it, when and why?I asked everyone I know who is trendier and more trend-aware than I am, which is almost everyone I know. So I narrowed the cohort down to various dandies of my acquaintance, my daughters, their friends, and anyone I got within range of who happened to be in their late teens or 20s.A consensus soon emerged that the sporting of these awful ’taches is indeed a thing. But getting to the root cause of this troubling trend is quite the challenge. No sooner do you think you’ve got there than someone pops up insisting it goes back a lot further than that. I was sent a piece from the Cut, part of New York magazine, describing it thus: “It’s petite, it’s well-groomed, and like its wearer, it’s decidedly queer: the skinny mustache.” Pardoning the American spelling there, I read on with interest. It was good to know I was on to something with writers as on-trend as this. Then I checked the date: 2019. I’m just six years behind the curve, then – quite good for me. And one thing’s for sure: this trend is now close to its end. Because if a trend has become entrenched enough for my dopey ungroomed self to notice it, then it has surely peaked and the end is nigh.I knew everyone would hate my mustard shorts. That didn’t stop me buying them | Adrian ChilesRead moreFor example, when I was at school there was a phase when all the other boys, as if by some agreement made behind my back, started wearing shoes called Pods. But my mum had just bought me some other new school shoes and wouldn’t hear a word about this Pods business. I kept on at her, but by the time I’d begged her to buy me some, everyone else – again by some secret agreement, apparently – had ditched their Pods and moved on. And I got laughed at for wearing them. There you go, confessions of a failed dandy.Anyway, this piece out of New York reports a Brooklyn barber saying of this “mustache” that “its two most crucial descriptors aresubtleandunderstated”.Obviously, having applied other adjectives, I snorted at this, but reading on I started worrying I was getting into some culturally sensitive areas. A point is made about it all being a legacy of the 1960s, when lip fuzz was seen as a form of rebellion against authority, particularly military masculinity. And this new wispy 2019 version is said to have a “whiff of deviancy” about it. I don’t doubt it for a moment but, six years on, if every other young dude on the tube is wearing one, the deviancy has surely been diluted.So what we’re seeing now is probably a revival of something from six years ago that was itself a revival of something significant that started 60 years ago. Fascinating. But I’m sorry, I still think they look crap.It was a photograph of Benson Boone, the American singer, that started me on all this. It seems you can draw a direct line back from him, via Paul Mescal and Harry Styles, toTimothée Chalamet, upon whose face one of these aberrations appeared last year. Interestingly, if you think about it, that acute accent in Timothée’s name might be said to resemble one half of his trendsetting ’tache.Anyway, I’m indebted to one of my Guardian colleagues for sharing with me an article about it from Vogue – not a publication I generally read. It says that Chalamet’s wispy whiskers are “not so much a symbol of masculine gruff as a free agent coming of age”. I’ve no idea what that means but it sounds about right, even though I’ve a better theory: noting that Styles, Mescal and Boone all followed where Timothée led, it struck me that what these chaps have in common is the feverish sexual desire they excite in millions of people. This must get a bit tedious after a while, so I wonder if they’re wearing these terrible ’taches to try to make themselves less attractive?A clever move, gentlemen, if I may say so, though it doesn’t seem to have worked. The whole world’s still hot for the lot of you. And boys everywhere, poor deluded souls, thinking your magic resides in your bumfluff, are now all at it.This must stop. They look awful. Fellas, either grow a proper one. Or get rid.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The markets say no – but I fear they’re wrongLarry ElliottThe oil shocks of the 1970s-90s had brutal economic impacts. As Israel attacks Iran, a moderate rise in oil prices rests on questionable assumptionsWed 18 Jun 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTShareFinancial markets picked up the clear message when Donald Trumpcut shorthis stay at the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies this week. Despite calls from fellow western leaders to de-escalate the crisis, the president’s early return to the White House was taken as a sign that the US is considering joining Israel in its military action against Iran. Trump says hewants Iran’s unconditional surrender.This is where modern summitry came in half a century ago. In 1975, the first meeting of what eventually became the G7 was convened at Rambouillet in France in an attempt to work out a joint response to the oil shock that accompanied the Yom Kippur war betweenIsraeland its neighbours.Back then, the impact of higher crude prices was immediate and brutal. The cost of crude rose fourfold in a matter of months and killed off the post-second world war boom, leading first to higher inflation and then to recession. A second dose of stagflation arrived a few years later when the Iran-Iraq war led to a further doubling of oil prices. Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 again led to higher oil prices and weaker activity. History suggests the Middle East can cause all sorts of problems for the global economy.The response to the latest conflict has been much more muted. Oil prices have risen by about $10 a barrel but that will give only amodest upward jolt to inflationand certainly nothing to compare with the shocks of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. At least so far. The region has form and given the risks, the financial markets are taking a remarkably sanguine view of events, even though there are reasons for a moderate degree of optimism.The first oil shock of the mid-1970s was triggered by an embargo orchestrated by Opec, a producers’ cartel that isless able to affectcrude prices than it was half a century ago. Some countries – the US in particular – are much less dependent on imported oil than they once were. Wind and solar power provide alternatives to fossil fuels. The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has been raging for almost two years, with only a small and short-lived impact on oil prices.All that said, it is less than three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in global oil and gas prices,contributing to a cost of living crisisthat is only just abating. The latest UK inflation figures released on Wednesday showed theannual increase in prices at 3.4%– well down on the recent 10.9% peak but still above the Bank of England’s 2% target.The comparison between the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and Israel’s attacks in the past week is not exact. Russiaaccounts for 17%of global gas production, while Iran is responsible for just4% of oil productionand China is the biggest customer for its crude exports. That helps explain why the financial markets have been relatively relaxed, with the $10 a barrel boost to oil prices reflecting a sense that the conflict will be contained.The US’s potential involvement raises the stakes. One possibility is that the deployment of US military firepower will quickly overcome Iran’s resistance and lead to regime change in Tehran. Another is that Iran will retaliate by seeking to close the strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage through which 20% of the world’s oil passes daily. That would send the price of oil rocketing from its current $75 a barrel to well over $100 a barrel. The shock would be more severe and longer lasting were Russia and China to get dragged into the conflict.The markets are betting that none of this happens.Oilprices are at their current level because dealers think Iran has had its military capability depleted by Israel’s attacks, that Iran would damage its own economy by seeking to close the strait of Hormuz, and that Russia and China will be wary of becoming involved.Iran and Israel crisis: what does it mean for the price of oil?Read moreThings may indeed pan out this way, but the call by the non-US members of theG7for a de-escalation of the crisis highlights the real risk that it might not. Western economies are still feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, higher energy prices and a cost of living crisis, and could well do without another setback. Petrol prices are already set to rise, the first evidence of higher inflation and a fresh squeeze on disposable incomes. It goes without saying that it would be better for the global economy to avoid yet another Middle East oil shock.But if the financial markets have called it wrong and oil prices do start to spiral upwards, it is important that policymakers don’t panic. Higher energy prices are initially inflationary but are then deflationary because they add to business costs and leave consumers with less money to spend. Central banks should resist the temptation to respond by raising interest rates because that would only add to the risks of recession and higher unemployment. Likewise, finance ministers should avoid raising taxes or cutting spending if weaker activity pushes the public finances deeper into the red.In the longer term, countries like the UK need to make themselves self-sufficient in renewable energy and thus reduce their exposure to the Middle East’s fossil fuels. The lesson to be drawn from the damage caused by the repeated oil shocks since the 1970s is that we have been here before and it doesn’t end well.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One wasa scathing report on HS2 from the National Audit Office(NAO), the first of many, when the project was still at the planning stage. The NAO concluded it was impossible to say whether the programme was likely to deliver value for money; the cost and benefit estimates were “uncertain”; there had been “past errors in the underlying model”; the Department for Transport had “poorly articulated” the strategic need for a transformation in rail capacity and how HS2 was supposed to rebalance economic growth. In short, there was “a weak foundation for securing and demonstrating success in the future”.Then there was Peter Mandelson’s remarkable insider confessionin the pages of the FTof how Gordon Brown and his cabinet came to approve HS2 in the first place in 2010. It was a tale of collective short-termism; in the grim post-banking crash era, the Labour government didn’t want to be outdone by the Tories in their enthusiasm for a shiny new big project.Labour had the chance to finally kill off HS2. Instead, it’s throwing more money into the pit | Simon JenkinsRead moreThe cost estimates were “almost entirely speculative”, wrote Lord Mandelson, but “the vision was exciting” and “we were focusing on the coming electoral battle”. Laughably, ministers had imaginedHS2would attract private sector backers. By 2013, Mandelson had changed his mind on HS2 and feared “an expensive mistake”.If only others had rethought. It would have been a painless option for David Cameron’s coalition government to ditch the whole adventure. There was an excuse to do so because an earlier report in 2006 by the former British Airways chief Sir Rod Eddington, which was being reread with fresh eyes at the time, had rejected the idea of new high-speed rail links. For a country the size of the UK, the best value will usually lie in improving existing rail and road networks, it argued.Instead, the HS2 show rolled on, fuelled by more political puff and short-termism. Some of the passages inthe review by the ex-KPMG infrastructure adviser James Stewart, published by Alexander on Wednesday, are excruciating. Key decisions such as the passing of the first parliamentary bill in 2017 and the letting of works contracts prioritised the schedule over costs.“I have heard a range of reasons for this but pressure from politicians to maintain momentum, fear of HS2 being cancelled, and the belief that costs will increase as a result of delay have featured strongly,” says Stewart. Meanwhile, “the top-down vision of building a railway that would be the best and fastest has been a major factor in undermining attempts to introduce a culture of cost control”.This is tear-your-hair-out stuff because it breaks the golden rule about getting plans hammered down in detail before you start building large-scale infrastructure projects. Even now half of Euston sits as a wasteland before a plan has been agreed for a design for a HS2 terminus.The main source of cost overruns, as Stewart and Mark Wild (the ex-Crossrail chief executive now charged with salvaging the shambles) agree, were the works contracts. The contracting model, combined with unrealistic targets, turned the contracts into “cost-plus” arrangements whereby contractors had little to no incentive to hit cost targets. Companies rang rings around the department and its arm’s-length body, HS2 Ltd.The Institution of Civil Engineersconcluded roughly the same in its report last year: huge contracts created “an imbalance of power”, especially in the context of a political demand to hurry up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was Johnson who pushedthe formal “notice to proceed” buttonin 2020, in full knowledge thatthe review he commissioned from Douglas Oakerveesaid HS2 only made sense if built in full. Within 18 months, and with costs hurtling out of control, ministersamputated most of HS2’s eastern arm to Leeds in 2021; the section to Manchester followed.In shrunken circumstances, it makes sense, as Alexander and Wild say, to slow down and complete the rump Birmingham-London link to a slower timetable in the interests of minimising yet more cost overruns. It will involve running the high-speed trains at slower speeds initially, a suitably farcical postscript to a project that has wasted tens of billions of pounds and consumed the lion’s share of spending on rail for years.

Now a precedent has been setCharles Watson is chair and founder of River ActionWed 18 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe recent ecologicalcollapse of the River Wyedue to pollution from intensive agriculture has been well documented. But the slow-motion repetition of this ecocide on the neighbouring River Severn has largely unfolded out of sight.For years, local authorities have been waving through industrial-scale livestock production units across the catchment of this iconic river. These toxic megafarms produce vast quantities of animal waste, which is spread on local land with minimal consideration for the cumulative environmental destruction it can cause.This week, the high court called time on this practice. In a landmark ruling, the court quashed Shropshire council’s planning permission for a230,000-bird intensive poultry unitnear two protected wetland sites and a mile from the banks of the Severn. The court found the council had unlawfully failed to assess the cumulative impact of adding yet another waste-spewing chicken megafarm to an already bloated cluster ofintensive poultry units(IPUs).Digestate, the byproduct of these plants, is often spread excessively on farmland. It can be highly toxic and rich in nitrates and phosphates, the very substance fuelling ecological collapse in rivers such as the Wye and Severn. The court found this risk was not incidental but a foreseeable impact that should have been evaluated under the law.This judgment sets a critical precedent. Local planning authorities can no longer ignore the full environmental footprint of these developments. They cannot assume waste vanishes once it leaves the farm gate. Most significantly, they cannot continue treating each factory farm unit as isolated when together they create a systemic environmental crisis.In Shropshire, more than 28m chickens are crammed into anescalating number of industrial sheds. The proposed site was just 400 metres from another unit housing nearly half a million birds. Satellite images show many others blanketing the surrounding landscape.This slow death by poultry units has been made possible by a negligent planning system. It also exposes a gaping hole in how environmental waste is regulated. Digestate is not benign. The dense concentrations of nitrates and phosphates it carries fuel catastrophic algal blooms. Yet councils have routinely treated it as someone else’s problem. The court was clear: those days are over.It also struck down Shropshire’s vague, unenforceable planning conditions, which tried to shift responsibility for manure disposal to third parties without oversight or accountability. This legal sleight of hand no longer holds. Local authorities now must know, and can enforce, exactly what happens to the waste. “Somewhere else” is no longer a defence.The ruling lands at a crucial political moment. The Labour government has made clear its intent toloosen planning restrictionsin the name of growth. But environmental protections are not bureaucratic burdens. They are the last line of defence against irreversible harm. This case reaffirms that environmental law has teeth and must be upheld even as politics shifts towards deregulation.So what happens now? Shropshire council has confirmed it will not appeal. The developer may resubmit a new application, but any future proposal must address the court’s findings: a lawful environmental impact assessment and a rigorous, science-based assessment of cumulative harm under the habitats regulations.More broadly, this judgment should send shockwaves through the planning system. Councils will have to stop rubber-stamping similar poultry applications and should review their processes. Developers will face greater scrutiny. And communities fighting to defend their rivers now have powerful new legal tools at their disposal.Revealed: More than 24,000 factory farms have opened across EuropeRead moreOf course, there will be resistance. The big agri lobby will whine about red tape. But what it calls red tape is simply the law – which is put in place to protect public and environmental health, not industrial convenience. If you want to dump another 200,000 chickens into a river catchment already choking on phosphates, the burden is now on you to prove you won’t make things any worse.Having instigated and funded this landmark legal action, River Action will now go into overdrive to ensure this case law is embedded across the UK’s planning system. We’ll also support other courageous local campaigners – like our advisory board member Dr Alison Caffyn, who personallyled the Shropshire claim. Backed by our legal team, we’re fully armed for the fight againstindustrial factory farming.Had this ruling come a decade earlier, the River Wye’s collapse might have been prevented.

This has spooked the establishment, which is now doing everything it can to stop Mamdani’s rise.TakeMichael Bloomberg, whoendorsedCuomo earlier this month and followed this up with a$5m donationto a pro-Cuomo Pac. The largesse appears motivated not by admiration for Cuomo – during his mayoralty, sourcestold the New York Timesthat Bloomberg saw Cuomo as “the epitome of the self-interested, horse-trading political culture he has long stood against” – but animosity towards Mamdani and his policies.Mamdani wants to increase taxes on residents earning more than $1m a year, increase corporate taxes and freeze rents: policies that aren’t exactly popular with the billionaire set.Bronx congressman Ritchie Torres (who was once progressive but moved steadily away from that and now receives fundraising assistance fromfar-right donors) is another establishment Democrat trying to prevent a Mamdani win at all costs. Torres, who makes his pro-Israel positions explicit, has criticized Mamdani for pro-Palestine comments. Torres has even said he won’t run for governor in 2026 if a socialist like Mamdani becomes the mayor because it will “revolutionize the political landscape”.The New York Times’ editorial board is also aghast at Mamdani’s sudden popularity. On Monday, itpublished a pieceurging New Yorkers to completely leave the candidate off their ranked-choice ballot, arguing that the assemblyman is woefully underqualified for office and has a bunch of wacky progressive ideas that will never work including free buses and frozen rent. The Times, whichannounced almost a year agothat it will not make endorsements in local elections, did not officially endorse a candidate but it certainly didn’t tell people not to put Cuomo on the ballot. It seems being accused of sexually harassing multiple women and then going after those women in an aggressive and intrusive way (including demandinggynecological records) isn’t as disqualifying as progressive policies. And, of course, the sexual harassment is just one of many scandals that Cuomo has weathered, including allegations hecovered up nursing home deathsduring the pandemic.Nobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great, yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring about changeThe Atlantic also came out withan anti-Mamdani piece, albeit one that was more subtle and which focused on the process rather than the personality. Staff writer Annie Lowrey argued that ranked-choice voting in a mayor primary, used by New York City since 2021, is not truly democratic: “Without ranked-choice voting, Cuomo would probably steamroll his competition. With ranked-choice voting, Mamdani could defeat him.” While there are problems with ranked choice (as there are with first-past-the-post systems), I think the bigger democratic threat might be a system in which a billionaire can swoop in with millions to prop up their preferred candidate at the last minute.All of this is anti-Mamdani mobilization is depressingly predictable: the Democratic establishment is allergic to fresh blood and new thinking. Shortly after Trump won the election last year, and the Democrats also lost the House and the Senate, Ocasio-Cortezlaunched a bidto become the lead Democrat on the House oversight committee, which is an important minority leadership position. Ocasio-Cortez has become a lot more establishment-friendly since getting into power in 2018 (New York Magazine even decreed in 2023 that she is just a “Regular Old Democrat Now”), but she’s still not centrist enough for the Democrats, it seems.Nancy Pelosi reportedly sabotagedthe 35-year-old congresswoman’s ambitions and ensured that 74-year-old Gerry Connolly, who had esophagus cancer at the time, got the job instead. Connollydied age 75earlier this year, becoming thesixth House Democratto havediedin office in 12 months.Then there’s the Democratic backlash to David Hogg, the young Parkland shooting survivor turned politico. The 25-year-old was briefly vice-chair of the Democratic national committee but stepped on powerful toes bycriticizing the partyfor its “seniority politics”. Hogg, who has said that he’s worried about his generation losing faith in democracy, pitched competitive primaries which challenged Democratic incumbents who had become too complacent, injecting new blood into the party. This did not go down well and various members of the DNC had voted to hold new vice-chair elections that could have led to his ouster. Instead of waiting to be kicked out, Hogg recently said he would stepaway from the role.I am not a Mamdani evangelist, but while some of his ideas are a little pie in the sky, he’s authentic and ready to fight for normal people rather than corporate interests. Sure, he doesn’t have a lot of experience. But he has a huge amount of potential. He’s managed to get at least 26,000 New Yorkers to volunteer for him. And I don’t mean they’ve sent a couple of text messages: one week they knocked on almost 100,000 doors. Michael Spear, a professor of history and political science at a Brooklyn college,told Jacobinthe degree to which Mamdani’s campaign has galvanized New York City voters is unprecedented: “I don’t think there is anything like it” in New York history.Nobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great. Everyoneknowsthere is a need for change and yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring that change. Instead of rallying around fresh talent like Mamdani that can clearly mobilize young voters, the Democrats aremulling a $20m planto try to manufacture a “Joe Rogan of the left” who can connect with young men, rather than support an authentic grassroots candidate who is already connecting with them.Will centrist interests prevail in New York? We won’t know until, at the very earliest, late on primary night, 24 June. Whatever happens, though, you can bet thatDemocratswill continue to do their very best to kneecap anyone who wants to drag them way from their obsession with doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkOpinionDemocratsBernie SandersMike BloombergAlexandria Ocasio-CortezAndrew CuomoUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But military action only increases the dangers instead of ending the threatWed 18 Jun 2025 14.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 20.18 EDTShareEighty years after the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and 40 years after the US and Soviet Union pledged to reduce their arsenals, the threat of nuclear war has resurged with a vengeance. The age of disarmament is over, a prominent thinktankwarnedthis week: “We see a clear trend of growing nuclear arsenals, sharpened nuclear rhetoric and the abandonment of arms control agreements,” said Hans M Kristensen of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.The world’s nine nuclear-armed states have amassed the equivalent of145,000 Hiroshima bombs. Israel’s illegal attack upon Iran is purportedly a last-ditch attempt to prevent it joining this club – as Israeldid long ago, though does not admit it. While Tehran possesses the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon if it chose to, US intelligencebelieves it has not made that decision– and would still need up to three years to build and deploy one. Israel does not appear to be striking Iran because US nuclear diplomacy has failed, but because it fears it might succeed. Many of its targets are unrelated to the nuclear programme, and some even to Iran’s military. Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly invoked regime change: more honestly,regime collapse.Few believe Israel can destroy Iran’s nuclear programme without the US. The Israeli prime minister seeks to bait Donald Trump into joining this assault: if he can’t get one of the peace deals he wants, how about taking a military triumph? Mr Trump’s shifting rhetoric has suggested he is beingdragged along, tothe alarm of Maga isolationistsand others who recognise the folly of seeing an easy win. But he may still hope to threaten Iran into a deal.The bigger threat is nuclear proliferation globally. The remaining US-Russian nuclear arms control treaty, New Start, is due to lapse in February – leaving themwithout limits on their arsenalsfor the first time in half a century. Both are already pursuing extensive modernisation programmes. China is still far behind, but its armoury is growing fastest, at around 100 warheads a year. This month’sstrategic defence reviewcommits the UK to spending £15bn on new submarine-launched warheads and opens the door to the reintroduction of air-launched nuclear weapons. North Korea appears to bebuilding a third uranium enrichment site. Taboos elsewhere are eroding, in an increasingly unstable world where impunity reigns. Support for an independent deterrent has soared in South Korea, no longer confident of the US umbrella.Weapons are becoming not only deadlier, but riskier, withthe integration of nuclear and conventional capabilitiesincreasing the prospect of miscalculations. And potential flashpoints dot this bleak landscape. Russia has repeatedlytalked up the threatof nuclear war in Ukraine – but that does not guarantee it is an empty one. India’s unprecedented use of Brahmos cruise missiles in last month’s clash with Pakistan signals a new and dangerous phase in south Asia’s strategic balance.The 2003 US invasion of Iraq, coupled with the survival of North Korea, sent the message that the safest course is not to shun weapons of mass destruction but to pursue and cling to them at all costs. Attacking Iran, whichlimited its programme in exchange for sanctions relief, will only fuel that conviction. It may set back Tehran’s nuclear progress somewhat, but makes it more likely torush for the bomb– and avoid the international scrutiny it previously accepted. Saudi Arabia and others would surely follow fast. Arab and Muslim countries have rightlydenouncedIsrael’s strikes and called for disarmament “without selectivity”. The current crisis makes that look a more hopeless cause than ever – but is the clearest evidence of why it is needed in place of a nuclear race which can have no winners.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Getting it done would signal renewalWed 18 Jun 2025 14.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 20.19 EDTShareOne day there will be a high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham. Maybe. Not soon. WhenHS2was first proposed, an opening date for the first phase was planned for December 2026. After multiple delays and cost overruns, a revised target of 2033 was set.That is no longer realistic, according to Heidi Alexander. The transport secretarytold MPson Wednesday that two more years are likely to be required, blaming the last Conservative government for mismanaging the whole project and wasting billions of pounds in the process.The record is indeed dismal and, while HS2 was originally conceived in the last days of a Labour government, the systemic failure to bring it to fruition has happened under successive Tory prime ministers. Citing the findings of two new reviews into the scheme, Ms Alexander highlighted inadequate ministerial oversight as a consistent problem. Construction contracts were signed that failed to give value for money and, it is alleged, may haveenabled fraud.The cost has ballooned while theambition has shrunk. Originally there was to be a whole high-speed network, extending north from Birmingham to Crewe and branching into the East Midlands. Meanwhile, the budget has soared. In 2012, phase one was forecast to cost £20bn. That rose over the ensuing decade to £57bn and the latest estimates are closer to £100bn. HS2 is a case study not in why the state shouldn’t build major infrastructure, but in how it must do so better.Opponents of HS2 – and it has had many from its inception – feel vindicated in having warned that it was a money pit and a folly. These concerns are not trivial – nor should they be casually brushed aside. Infrastructure must serve the future, not scar it. That means designing and delivering projects that respect both nature and people.But the benefit of the new line is not just in getting people to their destination faster but also freeing up capacity on the existing route. Although there is much to regret about the way HS2 has evolved so far, the case for aborting it is flawed, amounting to defence of a plainly inadequate status quo. Laying tracks and digging tunnels is environmentally disruptive, but railways are ultimately a more sustainable way to move volumes of people around than roads. Every precedent from modern transport history says the alternative to HS2 is not more green pasture but more cars.London and Birmingham are not far apart, nor are they separated by vast mountains. High‑speed railways are not an experimental 21st-century technology. Other European countries have networks covering thousands of kilometres. It is embarrassing that the UK has managed justone line, from London to the Channel tunnel, opened in 2007.Ms Alexander is right that the last government mismanaged HS2, but that failure also expressed a deeper malaise in the capacity of the British state to modernise. Pressing ahead with HS2 must mark a turning point: embracing greener construction, tighter cost control and democratic engagement. If lessons are learned, HS2 can still be salvaged and become a model – not a cautionary tale – for public infrastructure.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the event this was something more downbeat in Miami, 90 minutes of pub-rock, at times even a meandering shoe-gaze as a well-drilled Al-Hilal kept the new-era Madrid at arm’s length.Madrid had a chance to win it at the death, but Federico Valverde missed a dubiously awarded 92nd-minute penalty. A 1-1 draw felt fair at the end of a Group H opener that flickered but never caught fire.Real Madrid v Al-Hilal: Club World Cup – live updatesRead more“We don’t expect the team to work perfectly on the first day,” a phlegmatic Alonso said. “But we weren’t frustrated. We need to do things differently, to correct a few details. We saw a good reaction in the second half. It has only been nine days and three training sessions.”As expected the Hard Rock was a sun-dappled sea of white at kick-off, Madrid the greatest portable source of eyeball-power at this made-for-TV show. The club announced before the game that they had sold 60,000 tickets for this 65,000 capacity stadium, which seems a little hard onAl-Hilal, who are owned by the Saudi government and as a result are basically paying for the whole show. So, thanks for that.It was another strange day at the mothership of all strange footballing events. Most obviously the game kicked off at 3pm local time in mid-June, when just trying to cross the road in South Florida is likely to induce a state of sock-soaking dehydration, and trying to run is like hurling yourself headfirst into the heart of the sun dressed in a fleece bodysuit and thermal slipper socks.View image in fullscreenGonzalo García put Real Madrid in front in the 34th minute after a rapid counterattack.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersIn other staging news, Fifa revived its No To Racism messaging, running a short video to that effect on the big screen before kick-off. It felt like a clear response to suggestions it has once again kowtowed to the nearest authoritarian leader by watering down its message to Football Unites The World, which has the added drawback of being demonstrably incorrect. It also felt like pre-emptive PR opportunism. Vinícius Junior, who started here, is the most vocal anti-racism campaigner in La Liga.Alonso also said before the match that Madrid needed “closure with the past”. Good luck with that one. Madrid feasts on the past. But he picked a fresh-looking team, with the re-branded “Trent” making his debut alongside fellow newbie Dean ­Huijsen, and 21-year-old Gonzalo García at the point of the attack.Kylian Mbappé was absent with a fever, possibly even the strain of football fever Gianni Infantino has claimed is sweeping the US, albeit in asymptomatic form judging by the world beyond the stadiums.So we got to see Trent Alexander-Arnold for the first time in match-day kit, a familiar shambling, bandy-legged figure, starting at right-back in a regulation 4-3-3. But it was Al-Hilal who almost opened the scoring after two minutes, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic’s drive drawing a save from Thibaut Courtois. And with 13 minutes gone Marcos Leonardo really should have scored for Al-Hilal, deflecting a mis-hit shot just wide. Vinícius was booked for the crime of evading a potential Kalidou Koulibaly shin-raker. Alexander-Arnold gave the ball away a few times, most notably before a break that ended with the ball in the Madrid net, only to be rescued by an offside flag. Alonso had spoken a lot about the need for Jude Bellingham to be “in the right position”. At times in the opening half hour Madrid had little to offer beyond his roving note of menace.View image in fullscreenRúben Neves fires home a penalty late in the first half to level the scores.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APBut they scored after 34 minutes from a break the length of the pitch, started by Alexander-Arnold winning a challenge outside his own box. The ball was shuttled through midfield to Rodrygo on the right. His cross was perfectly curved into the path of García. The finish bobbled off one foot on to the other, the end result a dink into the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it conceded its first seven minutes later after Raul Asencio gave away a needless penalty, wrapping an arm around Leonardo as he veered away. Rúben Neves buried the kick.Arda Guler came on for ­Asencio at half-time, Aurélien Tchouaméni dropping into the back four. And Guler immediately hit the bar, before García drew a goalline reflex save from Yassine Bounou as Al-Hilal lived, briefly, on the edge.Bellingham showed some drive on the right. He wandered to the left. He gestured at his teammates. Madrid dominated possession for a while, playing in the merciful shade of the Hard Rock’s vast wedding cake roof.Alexander-Arnold came off after 65 minutes of a so-so, occasionally bright debut. The game became a little sluggish and fretful in temperatures that never strayed below a brutally humid 90 degrees. Al-Hilal might have taken the lead after Lucas Vázquez gave the ball away, but Leonardo clumped his finish over the bar with pond-wader finesse.And at the death it seemed Madrid might produce a classic late assertion of their Darwinian right to victory as they were awarded a very soft VAR-reviewed penalty. Valverde’s kick was saved. It felt like justice for a spunky Al-Hilal.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupReal MadridAl-Hilalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The firm represented the former Juventus and Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba in his appeal against a four-year doping ban, which wasreduced to 18 monthsby the court of arbitration for sport.Mudryk denied knowingly breaking any rules. It has been claimed that he tested negatively last August and has not changed his behaviour since.Mudryk said on Instagram last December: “I can confirm that I have been notified that a sample I provided toThe FAcontained a banned substance.

Guardiola said: “For the speed they go to touch the ball – for the Newton’s theory your leg has to be a little bit higher and the other player was down. Rico has never had an intention to hurt anyone. It’s a little unnecessary. I said that to the referee, he disagreed and he is the boss.”Empty seats are everywhere at the Club World Cup. But does this miss the real point?Read moreThis midday kick-off in the Phila­delphia heat against Morocco’s Wydad AC offered a glimpse of City’s hopes for 2025-26 as theirClub World Cupdefence enjoyed lift-off. It told us Tijjani Reijnders can operate in the No 6 or “Rodri role” for Guardiola despite being bought to scheme, ­primarily, as a No 8. It said City’s high line remains a weakness though mitigation could be found in Rúben Dias and John Stones being substitutes only.In Phil Foden’s opener plus assist for Jérémy Doku’s second we may have witnessed the start of a renaissance following City’s season horribilis. And in the near instant takedown of a first-half pitch invader, wearing a T-shirt protesting against Morocco’s cull of stray dogs and cats, there was a sign of the high alert this divided country is on.Guardiola said: “The first game is always really important. [Foden was] really good. He’s always there. We’re really pleased. [Reijnders] is a really good player. You feel it, smell it. When he gets the rhythm he will be top.”After claiming the previous seven‑club tournament, City’s bid to retain this revamped 32-team iteration was about victory, and walking Guardiola’s pre-match message. Our season begins here, the Catalan posited, before sending out an XI that intrigued. Erling Haaland and Rodri enjoyed a centre-circle pow-wow before this Group G opener, then sat down on the bench as replacements. Instead, their manager handed debuts to Rayan Cherki and Reijnders but not Rayan Aït-Nouri, his other major summer signing.Rodri’s omission could be filed as odd given he had not started since 22 September after sustaining a ­serious knee injury against Arsenal that excluded him until the side’s final home game of last season. He was in need of match time, as emphasised by a rusty second-half cameo.Bernardo Silva – named by Guardiola as City’s new captain – went unused throughout a display that has to be caveated by the shockwaves that Wydad, despite being the 22-time Moroccan champions, would have caused if the 2022-23 treble victors were defeated.View image in fullscreenJérémy Doku struck Manchester City’s second shortly before the break.Photograph: Caean Couto/IMAGN IMAGES/ReutersOne minute 53 seconds were clocked when Foden stroked beyond El Mehdi Benabid. This ended a move initiated by Nathan Aké’s ball down the left to Doku and took in Savinho, a scramble in Wydad’s area, then Foden’s strike.This was the first answer to how Wydad would fare. A second came when Omar Marmoush, City’s No 9, sprayed a shot marginally wide moments after. In the heat, Amine Benhachem’s men had the same issue many do against City: trying to stymie their attacks. But they also prospered, via invention beyond the high line, as copious foes enjoy.A Mohamed Moufid raid down the left splayed City and, if his pass had found Thembinkosi Lorch, ­Ederson’s goal may have been breached. Then Lorch, near halfway, nabbed the ball and aimed a chip over City’s No 1, but the captain recovered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The forward’s swivel sat Reis down as he tried to recover but, in refusing the shot, the Brazilian and City escaped.The team from Casablanca did not, though, when Foden dropped a corner in from the right: Doku, first time, hit past Benabid and so Guardiola’s men ambled off at the break two up.The Catalan, cutting a dashing figure in white shirt, safari pants and sneakers, refused instant changes for the second period. The decision seemed prudent when the same unit manoeuvred Doku into a scoring zone but the wingman could only locate Benabid, who saved.Then a triple change. Rodri, ­Haaland, Oscar Bobb for Cherki, Doku and Foden. This pushed ­Reijnders ahead of Rodri, Marmoush into Cherki’s inside-forward berth behind Haaland in attack, with Bobb on the right, Savinho switching to the right.At a Lincoln Financial Field just over half full (capacity 67,500), Wydad’s support offered incessant drums and noise. And derision when Rodri flipped a pass straight out, this usually magisterial footballer ­hanging a hand up in apology.As the contest tailed off a flare in Wydad’s red was let go behind Ederson’s goal and then the card of the same colour was seen by Lewis – which had Guardiola, correctly, in a fury. A crowd of 37,446 departed mildly entertained and with City knowing Lewis is now unavailable for the contest with Al Ain in Atlanta on Sunday, and maybe beyond.Foden, who has two years left on his deal, confirmed afterwards that there is no news from the club on a fresh one. Continue how he did today and there may be soon.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His side will now face Spain in the last eight on Saturday night, although having beaten the pre-tournament favourites, who are looking for their record sixth title at this level, in the final two years ago in Georgia, the England manager will know that his side cannot defend like this again.“It has not quite clicked but it is a matter of time before it all comes together,” said Scott. “We’re going to recover from this and look into Spain and pick them apart. Hopefully we can put in a good performance and get to the semis.”Carsley said this week that this group “needs more leaders” so leaving James McAtee, the captain, on the bench as one of four changes from the side that was held toa 0-0 draw against Sloveniaon Sunday was perhaps an attempt to throw some of the less experienced squad members in at the deep end. It didn’t work and a disjointed England found themselves behind after just three minutes.Although Germany impressively sealed progression to the last eight by scoring seven times in their opening two matches, it was still a surprise to see their coach, Antonio Di Salvo, field a completely different side from their first two matches. Yet having already defeated Spain in a friendly back in March thanks to a hat-trick from Nick Woltemade –the towering Stuttgart strikerwho already has four goals in this competition – they didn’t seem too concerned about potentially losing top spot in the group.It was easy to see why when the left-back Lukas Ullrich caught Jarell Quansah napping with a perfectly weighted ball over the top. A deft piece of control and precise finish from Knauff gave Germany the lead. Quansah was almost on the end of a flowing move involving Ethan Nwaneri as England attempted to hit back. But despite enjoying the lion’s share of possession and the stand-in skipper Harvey Elliott’s best efforts, they again struggled to create  chances.Weiper was allowed to head home Knauff’s cross minutes later despite the attentions of Jack Hinshelwood and Charlie Cresswell. Carsley was probably nervously checking the score in the group’s other match just in case when a floodlight failure with 45 seconds left of stoppage time brought a premature end to the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England began to look more of a threat as news that the Czech Republic had taken the lead over Slovenia filtered through, with Norton-Cuffy, a former Arsenal academy player, providing some much-needed impetus down the right flank. But even though a second goal for the Czechs removed any remaining jeopardy, England still showed desire to get something from the game.Scott should have done better with a great chance just after he had been booked for a late challenge before Hinshelwood headed over with the goal gaping. The Bournemouth midfielder gave the travelling England supporters something to cheer when he tapped home following a mazy run from Omari Hutchinson. Cresswell came closest to completing the comeback as England laid siege to the German goal in the final 10 minutes but could not direct his header away from the goalkeeper Tjark Ernst.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21smatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ireland’s Tadhg ­Furlong will be given the chance to prove his fitness after struggling with a calf injury that ruled him out of Leinster’s United Rugby­Championship final win against the Bulls last weekend. Furlong is included on a bench that also features the hooker Ronan ­Kelleher, the only player to be involved against Argentina six days after taking part in the end-of-season finale.Farrell’s injury list looks like being clear by next week – it will most likely be clouded somewhat by the final whistle against the Pumas – but for now it is a good place to be. The players not distracted by club calls got a head start over the five days at the training camp in Portugal; since then they have been joined by the next wave who quickly got up to speed.“It’s quite a diverse group in terms of combinations and guys not playing with each other,” Farrell said on Wednesday at the Aviva Stadium. “So it’s nice for that group to have a week where they get settled in and for the other guys to join them – some on a high, one not – but it’s nice for them to have a bit of time to spend with the lads, get to know everyone and see what’s been going on, and they’ve had one training session together so it was nice to get everyone together finally.”What does the head coach expect against Argentina? “Cohesion – connection,” he replied. “An ability to attack the game from the off to be the best version of themselves, not just indivi­dually but collectively as well, so you can’t give yourself excuses as far as time together, etc. We’ve had good prep, and if you want to be a good Lions player you’ve got to hit your straps straight from the off. So we want to see these players compete.”The Breakdown | End-of-season rugby union awards: best games, players and moreRead moreFarrell acknowledged, though, that getting to grips with a new system was one of the hills to be climbed. Surely it is not compatible to tick all those boxes at short notice against a Pumas side he described repeatedly as one ­playing very good rugby over the past 18 months? If it is a climb then Tadhg Beirne does not consider it category one.“Why wouldn’t they be compati­ble?” he said. “You’re talking about world-class players here, the best of the best. The expectation we would have of each other is that you can adapt to any system you’re given.“That’s the challenge laid in front of us. That’s the challenge of being a Lion. Every four years, there’s going to be a new system. The coach is going to want to play a certain way. If you want to be a Lion, you’re going to have to adapt or you’ll get left behind.”So, full steam ahead on Friday night against quality opposition. “Yeah, when we played them [Argentina] back in November with Ireland they really put it to us,” Beirne said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’ll be their World Cup final on Friday and that’s the way we’re going to treat it as well. Every game you get to play for the Lions is the most important game. This Friday is a huge opportunity for us to set the tone for the tour.”For players such as Duhan van der Merwe, Sione Tuipulotu and Furlong, all of whom are desperate for minutes after injury layoffs, it is the perfect platform. Is Farrell praying it stays that way until the squad fly out to Perth on Saturday? “That’s the furthest thing from my mind, because, you know, it’s just the nature of sport in general – never mind a contact sport that we love to watch and play,” the head coach said. “It is what it is and we certainly, in the back of our minds, wish that we’ll have a healthy squad going to Australia.”Farrell said his ideas for the XV in the first Test in Australia are still in flux. “I did an exercise a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve done it about five times since, of choosing what the Test side could be. You actually can’t even go there because there’s such good competition and that’s how it should be. The exciting thing about Friday night is these guys get to show the teammates who are sat in the stand what they’re all about.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionArgentina rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling is a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for a stream of lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.Explore more on these topicsJuventusJuventus WomenClub World CupClub World Cup 2025US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The British No 1, and second seed, had started poorly: he had struggled to find his range on his groundstrokes for much of the occasion and then two match points passed him by. Deep in the third-set tie break, he trailed 2-4.Over the past year, though, a period during which he has established himself as one of the best players in the world, Draper has continually shown his ability to find a path to victory no matter what. In the first week of his grass-court homecoming, the 23-year-old offered a forceful demonstration of his supreme competitive spirit as he recovered to defeat Australia’s Alexei Popyrin, the world No 21, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (5) to reach the quarter-finals at Queen’s Club.“I have always been a really good competitor,” Draper said. “That’s something I pride myself on: trying my absolute best for every point whenever I play. I think that comes from when I was younger. I think I have an older brother that helps with that. I was lucky enough to have coaches who made me very competitive as well.“I played up as well, so I was always quite small, and I had to fight hard for every point if I wanted to make any headway in the match. I think I have always had that, and I think that’s one of my biggest strengths, to be honest. Especially on a day like today where I wasn’t my best, wasn’t feeling my best, but I came through and I gave myself another chance.”Having started last year’s grass-court season ranked No 40, Draper returned to London, his home city, at a career-high ranking of No 4. An underdog for so long, he is now a title contender in every tournament he enters. The next four weeks mark another significant moment in his career as he takes a step into the unknown and tries to navigate the pressure that will continue to grow as Wimbledon approaches.View image in fullscreenJack Draper stretches for a return in his win against Alexei Popyrin. One more victory would land him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThat extra tension was evident early on as Draper was punished for a sloppy service game at 3-4 and quickly found himself down a set. He gradually found his range, building rhythm on his serve and returning with greater depth and consistency as he forced a final set. Although his forehand was erratic and he was tentative behind his backhand, Draper served well in set three and it seemed as if he might be rewarded for his patience when he generated two match points on Popyrin’s serve. Instead, the Australian saved both before forcing a tiebreak.In the most tense moment of the match, in that tiebreak, Draper gave a full demonstration of his toughness. From 2-4, Draper won five of the six points with a flurry of clutch winners, including a winning forehand down the line, an ace, a searing backhand down-the-line winner and then another ace on match point. He took the match into his own hands with courage and character, producing his best level when he most needed it. It was the mark of a player who continues to grow into a champion.In addition to remaining in the equation for his first Queen’s Club title and potentially securing a top-four seeding at Wimbledon, which he would acquire with one more win, perhaps the most important part of this victory is that Draper will have another match on grass before Wimbledon. He will face Brandon Nakashima in the quarter-finals on Friday after the American defeated Britain’s Dan Evans 7-5, 7-6 (4).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Buick was forced to switch twice in the straight, but when he did eventually take aim at the lead, Ombudsman’s response was ­immediate and overpowering.Royal Ascot 2025 updates and news as Ombudsman rules on day two – liveRead moreOmbudsman was around two lengths behind Anmaat, the ­Champion Stakes winner last season over the same course and distance, ­passing the furlong pole, alongside 100m later and then two lengths ahead and going further clear at the line.“The plan was to just relax off the pace, which was strong and set up for [O’Brien’s] Los Angeles,”John Gosdensaid, “but to that extent we knew we’d be comfortable where we were. It was just the question of when you get in the straight, would you get the luck?“William wasn’t in a position where he could swing around the field, it was more a case of waiting for the gap. And he was very patient, but I knew when he got a gap at the furlong pole, that this horse has an ­extraordinary turn of foot. He was patient and he was rewarded.“Ombudsman is a mile-and-a-quarter horse [with] a wonderful turn of foot and has done nothing but grow in stature.”Ombudsman’s win was the ­Gosdens’ fourth of the meeting, ­putting them two clear of O’Brien – who saddled True Love to win the ­opening Queen Mary Stakes – with three days remaining. Their ­double, meanwhile, was worth nearly £750,000 in prize money, more than enough for them to leapfrog O’Brien to the top of the overall Flat trainers’ championship.The Gosdens also have two live runners – Trawlerman and Sweet ­William – on Thursday in the Gold Cup, where O’Brien will saddle the likely favourite, Illinois, as they go in search of a win in the feature event for the third day running.The success on Wednesday sets up the intriguing possibility of a rematch between Ombudsman and Ed ­Walker’s Almaqam, the horse that ended Ombudsman’s previously unbeaten record in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown last month.Almaqam was steered around the Royal meeting due to a preference for some ease in the ground, but weather – and/or watering – permitting, the two colts could renew their rivalry in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, with the International Stakes at York in August and the Champion Stakes back at Ascot in October also on the agenda.The only disappointment for the Gosden stable on Wednesday was the ­failure of the King and Queen’s ­Rainbows Edge to justify strong support as the 3-1 favourite for the ­Kensington Palace Stakes. She ­finished mid-division under Ryan Moore as Miss Information gave Oisin Murphy his first win of the week.View image in fullscreenTethered hot air ballons in the Royal Enclosure during day two of the Royal Ascot meeting.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe punters had a much better time of it in the Royal Hunt Cup, ­however, as Roger Varian’s My Cloud, the 3-1 favourite in a 30-strong field, came home as one of the shortest-priced winners in the race’s 182-year history.Like Buick in the feature, Silvestre de Sousa had to bide his time on My Cloud at the back of the stands’ side group, but he made smooth progress to lead when his rider found running room to beat Bullet Point by three-quarters of a length with the 50-1 shot Bopedro, owned by the Brighton & Hove Albion footballer Georginio Rutter, in third.“I thought that was a mighty performance for an inexperienced horse,” Varian said. “We hope he is a horse who could progress out of handicaps and into Group company.”The second day ended with three jockeys – Ryan Moore, James Doyle and Billy Lee, the winner of the Queen’s Vase on Wednesday on Carmers – tied on two winners for the ­meeting and all to play for in the race for the jockeys’ prize with 21 races to come.Candelari can strike Gold for FrenchThe recent retirement of Kyprios, who would have been attempting to win the Gold Cup for the third time in four years, has robbed this year’s Royal meeting of one of its major stars, but it also creates an intriguing contest for supremacy in the division between the seven-year-old Trawlerman and two up-and-coming four-year-old stayers, Illinois and Candelari.The front-running Trawlerman forced Kyprios to dig deep for his victory 12 months ago, and ran close to that level when finishing five lengths clear of his field in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown last time out.But he is unlikely to improve significantly at seven years of age and while Illinois, who was just a neck behind the winner in last year’s St Leger, has obvious scope to progress this summer, Francis-Henri Graffard’sCandelari (4.20)has even fewer miles on the clock and could improve past his two market rivals on Thursday.Candelari did not see a racecourse until December 2024 and progressed rapidly through the ranks this spring to win last month’s Group One Prix Vicomtesse Vigier at Longchamp by three-and-a-half lengths. He showed an impressive turn of foot to seal his victory there and that could again prove decisive when battle is joined in the home straight.Royal Ascot 2.30By his own sky-high standards, Aidan O’Brien has as surprisingly poor record in this juvenile event with only three wins in 25 years, and his colt Whistlejacket was the beaten odds-on favourite 12 months ago.

The nine existing SLB clubs are refusing to join, and have had their interim licence to run their own league next season suspended by the BBF.In an attempt to resolve matters it is understood that the BBF last week offered the SLB another 12-month licence that would enable the league to operate next season, a proposal that was rejected by the clubs.The BBF’s position is that as the SLB is operating without a licence it cannot endorse applications to join competitions organised by the Federation of International Basketball Associations, as doing so would jeopardise their own position.The BBF has informed Manchester that their application to join Europe’s premier competition, the Basketball Champions League, would not be endorsed and the club have now missed the deadline to register.An email from the BBF to Manchester sent earlier this week read: “As Fiba’s national member federation, the BBF will only endorse clubs competing in our officially sanctioned national championship competitions. Since notification of termination of the licence held by Super League Basketball Ltd has been issued, Manchester does not currently meet this requirement for the 2025-26 season. We are therefore unable to consider endorsement at this time.”Manchester are exploring legal action on the grounds of restraint of trade, while the BBF also faces the threat of being sued by the other clubs over the GBBL licensing process. The other SLB clubs are believed to be united in their support for Manchester.View image in fullscreenLondon Lions in action against Manchester Basketball in February.Photograph: Carol Moir/AlamyThe BBF has also made it clear that it will not back the Lions’ bid to join Europe’s second-tier competition, the EuroCup. In addition, the governing body is not supporting attempts by the Eagles and the Flyers to join the European North Basketball League. Those competitions are not organised by Fiba, however, so it is unclear at this stage whether the BBF can block them.The BBF rejects claims that it is blocking visa applications, an allegation the federation regards as symptomatic of the entitlement of certain clubs. As the sport’s governing body the BBF is charged with submitting governing body endorsements for potential overseas signings to the Home Office, and feels it is unable to do so for unlicensed clubs. The BBF declined to comment.A spokesperson for the London Lions told The Guardian: “The London Lions stand unequivocally for the principle that British clubs should have the freedom to pursue excellence wherever it exists, to grow the game on the biggest stages.“We hope that the decision to keep Manchester Basketball Club out of Basketball Champions League is reversed, which will allow growth of professional basketball in the UK, providing opportunities for British athletes, coaches, and clubs to compete at the highest level.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those whose use followed an increasingly addictive trajectory had roughly double the risk of suicidal behaviour at the end of the study.The findings do not prove screen use was the cause of mental health problems. But they highlight that compulsive use, which appears to be very common, as a significant risk factor that parents and healthcare services should be alert to.Dr Yunyu Xiao, an assistant professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and first author of the study, said: “For parents and educators, the discussion around mobile phones and social media has focused on limiting or banning use, but our results indicate more complex factors are involved.“Testing interventions that work against other types of addiction may be one way to approach this type of social media and mobile phone use.”The findings come amidescalating mental health problems in young peopleand as governments are grappling with how to enforce safeguards around smartphones and social media. Against this backdrop,scientists have faced a near-impossible challengeto try to pin down evidence of how rapidly evolving and highly personalised screen use might be linked to young people’s mental health.The latest study tracked almost 4,300 adolescents aged nine to 10 when they started the study. Rather than simply measuring screen time, the scientists assessed participants for “addictive use”, such as whether technology was interfering with activities like schoolwork and exercise and whether people experienced craving or feelings of distress when screens were withdrawn. Machine learning was used to cluster participants into groups based on their screen use trajectories.For mobile phones, about half of the children reported high addictive use from the start of the study that remained high through early adolescence, and a quarter developed increasing addictive use as they aged.For social media, 41% of children had high or increasing addictive use. For social media and mobile phones, the high and increasing addictive use trajectories were associated with a two to three times greater risk of suicidal behaviours and suicidal ideation compared with the low addictive use trajectory.More than 40% of the youths had a high addictive use trajectory for video games. These adolescents were significantly more likely to report suicidal thoughts or behaviours, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression, aggression or rule-breaking.By contrast, the total amount of time spent on social media, mobile phones and video games was not associated with future suicide-related or mental health outcomes. What mattered most was whether their use showed signs of compulsion, distress or loss of control.Xiao said: “There are many factors that would induce addictive feelings, such as the designs of the social media or video games, some kids may also experience bullying and more adverse childhood that they find using phones more comfortable, but later they cannot stop using it.”The findings,published in the journal Jama, raise further questions over how parents should manage children’s screen use. “We do not know if just taking away access will help, unless it is taking away access 24/7, because we know from studies of addiction management that partial access can quickly reinforce the addiction,” Xiao said.Prof Amy Orben, who leads the Digital MentalHealthGroup at the University of Cambridge, said the study could not prove that technology use caused mental health problems. An alternative explanation would be that poor self-control could be the root cause for problematic screen use and mental health outcomes.“Yet the study importantly highlights that why and how young people use technologies, and how they feel technologies affect their lives, may matter more to their mental health than the time spent online,” she added.“As those reporting such issues are not a small proportion of the population, supporting them should be taken seriously.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthMedical researchMobile phonesTelecomsSmartphonesYoung peopleParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

In response, Democrats have claimed that Trump is sending the country into a constitutional crisis.California has sued over Trump’s deployment of national guard troops to Los Angeles, and, last week,a federal judge ruledthat control of soldiers should return to California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. An appeals court stayed that ruling and,in arguments on Tuesday, sounded ready to keep the soldiers under Donald Trump’s authority.Trump keeps national guards in LA for now as appeals court puts brakes on banRead more“I don’t believe district courts should be determining national security policy. When it goes to the supreme court, we’ll see,” Hegseth told the Democratic senator Mazie Hirono. Facing similar questions from another Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, he said: “If the supreme court rules on a topic, we will abide by that.”Hegseth was confirmed to lead the Pentagon after three Republican senators and all Democrats voted against his appointment, creating a tie vote on a cabinet nomination for only the second time in history. The tie was broken by the vice-president, JD Vance.There were few hints of dissatisfaction among GOP senators at the hearing, which was intended to focus on the Pentagon’s budgetary needs for the forthcoming fiscal year, but Democrats used it to press for more details on the deployment of troops toLos Angeles, as well as the turmoil that has plagued Hegseth’s top aides and the potential for the United States to join Israel’s attack on Iran.The Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin asked whether troops deployed to southern California were allowed to arrest protesters or shoot them in the legs, as Trump issaid to have attemptedto order during his first term.“If necessary, in their own self-defense, they could temporarily detain and hand over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. But there’s no arresting going on,” Hegseth said. On Friday, marinestemporarily took into custodya US citizen at a federal building in Los Angeles.The secretary laughed when asked whether troops could shoot protesters, before telling Slotkin: “Senator, I’d be careful what you read in books and believing in, except for the Bible.”An exasperated Slotkin replied: “Oh my God.”Trump haspublicly mulledthe possibility that the United States might strike Iran. Slotkin asked if the Pentagon had plans for what the US military would do after toppling its government.“We have plans for everything,” Hegseth said, prompting the committee’s Republican chair, Roger Wicker, to note that the secretary was scheduled to answer further questions in a behind-closed-doors session later that afternoon.In addition toan aggressive purgeof diversity and equity policies from the military, Hegseth has also ordered that military bases that were renamed under Joe Biden because they honored figures in the Confederacy to revert to their previous names – but officially honoring various US soldiers with the same name.The Virginia senatorTim Kainesaid that in his state, several bases had been renamed under Biden in honor of accomplished veterans, and their families were never officially told that the names would be changed back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She does a fantastic job, and … any suggestion that I or her or others are party to antisemitism is a mischaracterization.”“You are not a serious person,” the Nevada lawmaker replied. “You are not serious about rooting out, fighting antisemitism within the ranks of our DOD. It’s despicable. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”Rosen then asked if the far-right activist Laura Loomerwas involved in the firingof a top national security staffer. Hegseth demurred, saying the decision was his to make, but the senator continued to press, even as the committee chair brought down his gavel to signal that she had run out of time for questions.“I believe your time is up, senator,” Hegseth said. A furious Rosen responded: “It is not up to you to tell me when my time is up. And I am going to say, Mr Secretary, you’re either feckless or complicit.

Ramesh escaped through a small space by his seat and stumbled through the flames and smoke into the arms of rescuers.View image in fullscreenThe funeral of another Air India victim, Mariam Syed, who died with her husband and children, is held in Mumbai.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPA“It’s a miracle I survived,” he told the Sun. “I am OK physically, but I feel terrible that I could not save Ajay.”The streets were filled with mourners as Ramesh walked with his brother’s coffin on his shoulder, his mother beside him in a monsoon-rain-drenched blue sari. More than a dozen of the crash victims were from Diu, a beach town on the Arabian Sea once ruled by the Portuguese.The funeral was held asthe Wall Street Journal reportedthat crash investigators believe flight 171’s emergency power system, known as a ram air turbine (RAT), was deployed during takeoff.Establishing the definitive cause of the crash could take years. But the preliminary finding prompts questions about whether the plane’s engines functioned properly in the crucial moments after takeoff.Flight data from Flightradar24 showed that the Dreamliner climbed to 625 feet. Moments before the plane crashed, the pilot made a distress call: “Thrust not achieved … falling … Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”A CCTV video clip showed the plane begin to descend about 17 seconds after takeoff.View image in fullscreenAir India’s chair said the aircraft’s maintenance history showed nothing of concern.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersThe RAT is a small propeller that drops from the underside of the Dreamliner’s fuselage to provide emergency electricity. While the engines usually supply power for electrical and flight-control systems, the RAT is designed to step in when normal systems fail. It is considered a last resort in aviation emergencies.“The most common occurrence is when a pilot thinks that both engines failed,” Anthony Brickhouse, a US-based aerospace safety consultant, told the Wall Street Journal. He said in commercial aviation, “a dual engine failure is extremely rare … Our engines today are more efficient and reliable than ever.”The Air India crash and the miracle of seat 11A - podcastRead moreThough widely praised for its fuel efficiency and long range, the 787 Dreamliner has been dogged by quality control issues. Last week’s crash was the first fatal incident involving a 787, but its fallout could be far-reaching.Boeing, which manufactures the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, which makes the engines, had declined to comment, the newspaper said.Findings from the wreckage suggest the flaps and other control surfaces were correctly configured for takeoff, indicating the flight crew followed standard procedures, the newspaper said, citing investigators.The report comes a day after India’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said its own inspections found no “major safety concerns” in the Dreamliner fleet but did flag recurring maintenance issues.Air India’s chair, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, toldthe Times Now Indian news channelon Wednesday that the aircraft had nothing of concern in its maintenance history.Air India plane crash: investigators to examine pilots’ voice recordingsRead moreHe said the right engine was installed in March, and the left engine was serviced in 2023. Chandrasekaran added he expected preliminary findings to be out in 30 days. “Everybody needs closure,” he said. “We need to know.”So far, DNA tests have identified 190 of the badly burned victims, and the bodies of 19 have been handed to their families, the Press Trust of India reported. Forensic teams are working around the clock to identify the dead.As of Wednesday, at least 13 Dreamliner flights were grounded and the DGCA confirmed that 66 Boeing 787 flights had been cancelled since the crash. Air India officials cited “technical issues” and “extended precautionary checks” as the reasons for the cancelled flights.The schedule disruptions are the latest blow to the Tata Group-owned airline’s ambitious overhaul of the former state-owned carrier, and the timing could not be worse, with summer travel demand surging.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportSouth and central AsiaPlane crashesBoeingAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Using official data to March 2023, the report found that 409 of every 1,000 black inmates were subjected to use of force, compared with 208.6 per 1,000 white prisoners.View image in fullscreenMost children in youth offender institutions are from ethic minority backgrounds, according to government statistics.Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/PADavies urged ministers to hold back on rolling out Pava spray in the youth system until the racial disparities were properly addressed.“We’ve got evidence that the growing reliance on visible weapons – such as the rollout of Pava spray in the male youth state and the trial of Tasers in the adult male prison state – is deeply concerning for people with lived experience,” she said. “Our board members have been told that the visible presence patterns make [prisoners] feel constantly afraid, and that’s increasing tension rather than easing it.”According to the IMB’s national annual report, released on Wednesday, black prisoners at HMP Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent were significantly more likely to have force applied to them than white prisoners.At HMP Birmingham, the category B jail once known as Winson Green, there was evidence of “clear racial disparities in the use of force”, despite the diversity of prison staff and the introduction of cultural awareness training.Amid a deepening overcrowding crisis, some prison officers will be trialled with stun guns this summer, while the Conservatives have said some should begiven access to live ammunition.It follows anattack on three officersat HMP Frankland by Hashem Abedi, a terrorist involved in the Manchester Arena bombing.Davies said prison officers showed “remarkable bravery’ in challenging conditions but the majority of assaults were actually between inmates.“We’re seeing violence driven by overcrowding, by mental health crisis and rapid drug use,” she said. “One of the most effective ways to reduce violence is through strong and respectable relationships between staff and prisoners.”Squirted from a canister, Pava spray, or pelargonic acid vanillylamide, causes searing pain and discomfort in the eyes for about 40 minutes and a burning sensation to skin. It was rolled out in men’s prisons in England andWalesin 2018.There are three publicly run YOIs and one that is privately run, holding young offenders up to the age of 21. According to government statistics covering 2022, most children in prison were from ethnic minorities.Data obtained in April by theHoward Leaguethrough freedom of information requests showed that black men were almost three times more likely to be sprayed with Pava than white men in prison, and young black men under the age of 25 were five times more likely to be sprayed than their white counterparts.Responding to Davies, Mark Fairhurst, the national chair of the POA, said IMB members were “not the ones on the receiving end of life-changing injuries” from violent youths.“It would be wholly irresponsible of the government not to give my brave colleagues the protections they need when dealing with violence,” he said. “Using the ethnicity or age of offenders to excuse their violent behaviour is shameful … Nobody should ever enter their workplace and be expected to become a victim.”A Youth Custody Service spokesperson said: “Pava will only be used as a last resort to protect staff and young people from serious harm, such as violent incidents involving weapons. Staff will receive specialist training, and every use will be closely scrutinised with strict controls in place.”Explore more on these topicsYouth justicePrisons and probationUK criminal justiceRaceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Watermelons became symbols of Palestine amid censorship of the Palestinian flag because of its similar colours.Barts, which runs five London hospitals, introduced the ban in March in its updated uniform and dress code policy, which extends to items on workstations, laptops and iPads, even if staff are working from home and not seeing patients.The policy says it is in keeping with the trust’s responsibility to be “completely apolitical and non-biased in our care”, but the claimants point to Barts’support for Ukraine.Baker said: “As a Palestinian, I should be able to express my identity and solidarity with my people, especially during a humanitarian crisis. Being told that a still-life painting containing a watermelon could be perceived as antisemitic and being threatened with disciplinary action is deeply upsetting.“I’ve worked for the NHS for over a decade – this is not the inclusivity I thought we stood for.”Baker, along with Dr Aarash Saleh, a respiratory consultant at Whipps Cross, and Dr Sara Ali, a haematology registrar who previously worked at the Royal London hospital, claim the policy amounts to indirect discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, disproportionately affecting staff who wish to express pro-Palestinian beliefs, particularly considering events in Gaza.They also say that it say it unlawfully discriminates against them because of their anti-Zionist views, which were found to be a protected belief under the Equality Act byan employment tribunal last year. Baker has also raised separate claims of direct discrimination and harassment.Ali said: “To suggest that expressing support for the Palestinians who are facing one of the most catastrophic humanitarian crises in recent history is somehow threatening, after the trust had rightly expressed support for Ukraine, is not only manifestly discriminatory but is antithetical to the values of universal empathy and compassion that underpin our practice as healthcare workers.”A letter before action sent on behalf of the healthcare staff by Liana Wood from the law firm Leigh Day also argues that there was “inappropriate consultation” with a pro-Israel advocacy group, while sidelining internal staff voices.UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), having complained to the trust about pro-Palestinian symbols worn by staff,published an articleon its website about the new policy eight days before it was officially implemented.Saleh said: “It’s especially troubling that UKLFI publicly announced the policy before the trust itself had communicated it to staff – this raises serious concerns about transparency and whose voices were prioritised in the process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, as an NHS organisation our primary responsibility is care for patients.”They said the policy aimed to “uphold political neutrality, creating an inclusive culture at work, and a safe space for patients in their time of need”.Explore more on these topicsNHSPalestinian territoriesAntisemitismDiscrimination at workMiddle East and north AfricaLondonIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

A major source of uncertainty is the extent to which farmers will adapt to hotter temperatures by changing which crops they use, when they plant and harvest them, and how they grow them.The team of researchers from the US and China used data from 12,658 regions in 54 countries to capture the extent to which food producers have adapted to different changes in the climate. They applied these historical relations to models simulating future crop production as temperatures rise and economies grow, and compared the losses with a hypothetical world in which global heating stopped in the early 2000s.In an extreme heating scenario, the study found, the relative yield for a crop such as soy would fall by 26% by 2100, even after accounting for adaptation, rising incomes and the effect of plants growing faster due to extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.A more realistic heating scenario – closer to the level that current policies will cause – would lead to yield losses of 16% for soy, 7.7% for wheat and 8.3% for corn, the study found. Rice was the only one of the six crops the researchers studied whose yields would rise because of climate change, with an expected gain of 4.9%.The global population is projected to rise from about 8 billion today to 10 billion by the end of the century, increasing demand for food as carbon pollution warps weather patterns. The researchers found the greatest losses would hit modern-day “bread basket” regions with highly productive lands, but added that people in poorer countries would be among the ones least able to afford food.“In a lot of climate impact studies, the global poor get hurt, and that’s true here too,” said Hultgren. “What is different from a lot of the previous work out there is that relatively rich, well-to-do portions of the world that are bread baskets are actually hit the hardest.”The research, which uses econometric methods to gauge the total effect of adapting, contrasts with previous studies that explicitly model biophysical interactions. Astudyin Nature Communications in 2022 using the latter approach found timely adaptation of growing periods would increase actual crop yields by 12%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

With five decades worth of data spanning a period of long-term warming and temporary cooling between 1998 and 2014, they were able to draw a comprehensive picture of how seal populations react to changing ice conditions, something shorter-term studies would not be able to achieve.View image in fullscreenFur seal populations have declined by 47% in recent decades.Photograph: Derren Fox/see infoThe study, published in the scientific journal Global Change Biology, found Weddell seals (leptonychotes weddellii), which rely on stable sea ice to rest, breed and feed, had declined by 54% since 1977. Similarly, Antarctic fur seals (arctocephalus gazella), which breed on land but are affected by food chain shifts, have declined by 47%.The findings challenge previous assumptions that the population in the South Orkneys had stabilised.Southern elephant seals (mirounga leonina), despite sharing similar population trends, presented “no significant overall long-term decline”.View image in fullscreenSouthern elephant seals showed no significant decline.Photograph: see infoThe study serves to emphasise the “vital importance of long-term ecological monitoring” as well as the interconnectedness between the three species of seal and sea ice conditions. Michael Dunn, lead author of the study, said: “For once, we’re not just predicting how wildlife might respond to shrinking sea ice and environmental shifts, we’ve had the rare opportunity to confirm it, using solid, long-term data.

In anearnings call last month,company top brass praised the new administration and more supportive regulatory environment.Among Trump’s moves that have benefited the company: a day-one move to end Biden’s pause on liquefied natural gas exports, which enables Energy Transfer to proceed with a long-sought-after LNG project in Lake Charles. On 13 May, Trump’s Federal Energy Commission (Ferc) also granted a three-year extension for the LNG project, which the company said wasnecessaryfor the project to succeed.They’re really creating this environment that’s great for oil and gas. The message is ‘We’ll give you what you want’Sarah Cohen of the Climate Accountability Research ProjectIn the week after the Ferc decision, Warren’s wealth rose by nearly 10%, noted Sarah Cohen, who directs the climate and wealth inequality-focused non-profit Climate Accountability Research Project (Carp).“That decision wouldn’t have been possible under Biden’s LNG pause,” said Cohen, who calculated the change using theBloomberg billionaires index.Since that Ferc decision, Energy Transfer Partners has also secured a20-year dealto supply a Japanese company with up to 1m metric tons of LNG a year.Other Trump orders to “unleash American energy” and declare an energy emergency to promote fossil fuels despite already booming production, for instance, are set to benefit Energy Transfer Partners by making it easier to expand the use all kinds of fossil fuels, thereby boosting the demand for pipelines.Also fueling that demand: the projected boom in datacenters. Energy Transfer Partners has received requests to power 70 new ones, the Guardianreportedin April, marking a 75% rise since Trump took office.View image in fullscreenCoal miners greet Donald Trump at an ‘Unleashing American Energy’ executive order signing event at the White House on 8 April 2025.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesBy appointing fossil fuel-friendly officials to top positions, such as the former energy CEO Chris Wright to head the energy department and the pro-oil and -gas Doug Burgum to the interior department, Trump has also “showed his allegiance to companies like Energy Transfer Partners”, said Cohen.“They’re really creating this environment that’s great for oil and gas,” she said. “The message is ‘We’ll give you what you want.’”Energy Transfer did not respond to requests from the Guardian to comment.Ties to TrumpWarren ranks among the richest 500 people in the world, with Forbes placing his net worth at $7.2bn. He has long deployed his wealth to support the GOP, including by becoming the13th-largest corporate funderto Trump’s Make America Great Again Super Pac last year with a $5m donation.He has also spent his fortune in more eccentric ways. His $30m, 23,000 sq ft Dallas mansion includes amovie theater and bowling alley, and among his other assets are a 8,000-acre ranch near Cherokee, Texas, which is home to zebras, javelinas and giraffes; a 20,000-acre golf resort in Lajitas, Texas; a private island near Roatán, Honduras; and numerous private aircraft, including a Dassault Falcon 900 jet.A lover of folk music, Warren also started arecord labelin 2007 alongside the singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave, with whom he has also written songs. “If you hear me now,” goes one song for which Warren penned the lyrics, “maybe you could pull some strings.”The pipeline mogul accumulated most of his wealth from Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates about130,000 milesof energy infrastructure in the US. In recent months, the firm has been criticized by advocates for its successful lawsuit against the environmental non-profit Greenpeace, which in March yielded a verdict that threatens to bankrupt the organization.Warren has long enjoyed a relationship with the president, donating generously to his first campaign and attending closed-door meetings during his first term. Though Warren is not known to have attended the infamous May 2024 meeting during which Trump asked oil bosses for $1bn and pledged to overturn environmental rules, he did co-host a fundraiser for the president in Houston weeks later.He is one of a handful of the most powerful oil billionaires from Texas, where there are no limits on contributions to candidates and political committees.“Texas has always been kind of a testing ground for the most extreme politics and issues that the Republicans pursue,” said Matt Angle, founder of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic Pac in the state. “In Texas, people like him are used to being able to donate to get their way.”Unlike some other Texas energy barons, such as the Christian nationalistTim Dunn, Warren is not driven by dogma, said Jones.“Kelcy Warren is not necessarily ideological,” he said. “He may be in sync with Trump on some other issues, but his support forDonald Trumpis largely because of what Trump proposed to do [for] the energy sector.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Known as the “one big beautiful bill”, it is expected to slash Biden-era incentives for renewable energy, tamping down competition in the energy market.A number of more esoteric provisions in the bill will also prove beneficial for the company, according to a review by Carp shared with the Guardian. One provision in the House-approved version, for instance, would allow the Department of Energy to determine that a proposed LNG export facility is in the “public interest” if the applicant pays $1m – something Energy Transfer Partners could afford to do. It’s a “pay to play” scenario, said Carp co-founder Chuck Collins.View image in fullscreenThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, after his chamber narrowly passed a bill forwarding Donald Trump’s agenda, at the US Capitol on 22 May 2025.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesOther provisions would expedite the build-out of LNG export infrastructure, force the government to hold lease sales for fossil fuels even when demand is low and reverse protections to allow drilling in some areas without any judicial review. Still others would stymy federal agencies’ ability to implement new climate rules by requiring that major changes obtain congressional approval, allow gas developers to pay a $10m fee to bypass permitting processes, limit who can bring lawsuits over gas infrastructure and allow firms to pay taxpayers less to use public land, Carp found.‘This is the looting of America’: Trump and Co’s extraordinary conflicts of interest in his second termRead moreThe bill is also set to hand fossil fuel companies huge tax breaks – including by extending tax cuts in the Trump-backed 2017 reconciliation bill, from which Energy Transfer Partners reported a tax benefit of$1.81bn.In one example, the House’s version of the bill would reinstate 100% “bonus depreciation” for qualified properties, allowing companies such as Energy Transfer Partners to completely write off new infrastructure such as pipelines on their taxes, and see the benefits immediately. It’s also expected to apply to private jets, Collins noted.Other tax breaks in the proposal are expected to personally benefit ultra-wealthy Americans such as Warren.“The most wealth I’ve ever made is during the dark times,” WarrentoldBloomberg a decade ago.PipelinesUnder Trump, Energy Transfer Partners will also probably save money on pipeline safety compliance. Since the president re-entered the White House in January, enforcement from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has dropped. Across the pipeline industry, the PHMSAopened only fourenforcement actions in April, and zero in March – marking the first month since the subagency’s 2004 launch when no cases were initiated, E&E Newsreported.“That fits right in with the philosophy or paradigm of the Trump 2.0 deregulation agenda,” said Carp’s Cohen.A lack of action from the body could lead to savings for Energy Transfer Partners, which has paidmillionsin fines to the PHMSA.In March, Energy Transfer Partners also sued the PHMSA, claiming that its enforcement system is “unconstitutional”. Success in the suit could mean the company is forced to pay fewer penalties.Shielded from tariffsAnother Trump policy from which Energy Transfer Partners will benefit: an exemption for oil and gas from his new tariffs. The president provided the industry wide shield after a meeting with the American Petroleum Institute lobby group, of which Warren’s company is a member.The firm’s profits may still be blunted by other tariffs, such as those on aluminum and other products needed for pipeline construction, but the energy sector expects those losses to be offset by the soon-to-be-passed reconciliation bill,Politico reportedin April.“The energy companies would prefer not to have the tariffs, sure,” said Jones. “But those are not a negative that outweighs what they view as the existential threat that Democrats represent … the existential threat of net zero.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceOil and gas companiesEthicsDonald TrumpEnergy industryUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We heard her niece shouting: ‘Somebody help me, somebody help’ and we went out and asked: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said: ‘I haven’t heard from my aunty in four days. Something’s wrong – break the door down.’“I was holding the door open downstairs and my son was upstairs and then I heard her niece screaming and saying: ‘Oh my God, she’s been murdered.’ She had tape across her mouth.“Her corgi was locked in the bathroom for three days. That poor dog, he couldn’t even drink any water, it’s amazing he was even still alive.”The neighbour added that Abbott “had done a lot of things in her life”.They added: “She was a doctor but she was also an actor and director in America.

Often using a concealed camera to avoid getting it confiscated by police officers, he captured scenes of overturned cars, smouldering buildings and growing anger at police tactics.Asked to explain the riots, one of his interviewees said: “Jobs, money, National Front, and all the rest, we’d just had enough, so we just explode.”In aninterview for the Guardian in 2021, Salmon said he filmed everything he saw during the riots. “For three days, I went up and down different places, everywhere I heard that they were fighting, riding my bike. And I always take my camera with me.”Salmon came to Brixton from Jamaica in 1954 as part of the Windrush generation and has left behind an archive with hundreds of hours of footage covering many aspects of community life in southLondon. In the Great Conflict of Somerleyton Road, he documented a struggle to build the first black church in Brixton in the mid-1960s.He was also known locally as Sam the Wheels for his cycle repair business and his collection of secondhand bikes that tumbled on to the pavement of his house on Railton Road.View image in fullscreenClovis Salmon (also known as Sam the Wheels), a documentary filmmaker from Brixton, has died aged 98.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSalmon’s varied career included stints working in factories in Jamaica and cane fields in Florida, and later as a deacon in a Pentecostal church in London. As a mechanic, for Holdsworth Cycles, he could build wheels twice as fast as his white colleagues and soon earned a reputation as the“fastest wheel builder in Britain”.Salmon’s significance as a film-maker was not recognised until very late in his life. In 2021 his documentaries featured at the Barbican arts centre in London, as part of its Decolonising Lens series. And last year he was awarded an OBE for services to culture and the black community.Mark Sealy, director of the arts agency Autograph, said: “Sam was a maverick self-taught recorder of black life, and probably Britain’s most important overlooked black film-maker.”‘I went wherever there was fighting’: how Sam the Wheels filmed Brixton ablazeRead moreLucy Davies, director of 198 Contemporary Arts and Learning, has been promoting Salmon’s work since 2006 and is coordinating a project to digitise his archive and make it accessible online. “Sam got his flowers in the end, but not until the end of his life,” she said.Davies added: “Sam did something that was unique – he filmed and documented the black community of Brixton at a time when the only other recording of the community was done by established media like the BBC or Pathé News.“And because he kept going over many decades, his work serves as an archive of the black community in the postwar migration period.”She added: “He took it upon himself to document his own community during a really important period without any external support.”He is survived by his wife, Delores. In a statement his family said: “He was a proud father of five children, grandfather to 10, and great-grandfather to many.”An installation of bicycles remains on Railton Road in his honour.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsLondonBlack British cultureRacenewsShareReuse this content"

But it is understood she is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public-facing engagements.Racegoers had been hoping to see Catherine, after the Prince of Wales was named as one of the figures awarding race prizes during the second day of the meeting.Ascotofficials had announced in a carriage list that the princess was due to be in the second carriage in the royal procession, alongside William.Less than half an hour later, Kensington Palace confirmed that Catherine would not be attending and Ascot published a revised carriage list.Kate revealed in January she was in remission from an undisclosed form of cancer on a visit to the Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, London, where she had previously been treated, receiving chemotherapy since late February last year.Announcing in September her treatment had ended, she described in an emotional video message how the previous nine months had been “incredibly tough for us as a family” and “doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus”. William later described in a separate interview how 2024 had been “brutal”.Explore more on these topicsCatherine, Princess of WalesMonarchyRoyal AscotHorse racingAscotPrince WilliamKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

It has endured because it has evolved. Now, it must do so again.”Concern has been sparked in government by cases raised in an ITV documentary where two Brazilians wanted for murder and for rape have been able to stay in Britain because of overcrowded conditions in Brazilian prisons, using article 3 of the ECHR.The Home Office is already undertaking a review of how article 8 of the convention – which covers the right to respect for family life – is applied by the courts.Some MPs have been pushing the government to legislate to set out formally how those rights should be interpreted, amid a populist campaign by Reform UK and rightwing Conservatives to leave the convention and dismantle human rights laws altogether.Mahmood said she wanted member states to push for change in order to maintain voters’ trust in human rights and the rule of law.She said the government remained absolutely committed to the principles set out in the convention, but said: “Commitment is not the same as complacency. And across the continent, trust is being tested. Rules are increasingly being broken and undermined.“And the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law – once widely assumed – now face distortion, doubt, even hostility.”The UK was not a signatory to a recent letter from the leaders of nine European countries – including Austria, Belgium, Lithuania and Poland – calling for a change in how the Strasbourg court interprets the convention. Government sources said the UK was not asked to sign but agreed with much of the letter’s content.“Our convention was never meant to be frozen in time,” Mahmood said. “It has been amended, extended and interpreted over decades – responding to new threats, new rights and new realities.“And we must consider doing so again. That is why the UK is not only open to this conversation, we are already actively pursuing it in how we implement the convention domestically – not to weaken rights, but to update and strengthen them. This is not a retreat from principle. It is the very essence of the rule of law.”Mahmood – the daughter of Pakistani immigrants – said the UK’s commitment to the rule of law was one of the reasons her own parents had found refuge in Britain.“They believed in a country where institutions were independent, where power was accountable and where justice didn’t depend on who you were, but on what was right,” she said.But she said there was a growing feeling – “sometimes mistaken, sometimes grounded in reality” – that human rights were too often being used by criminals to act with impunity.“When the application of rights begins to feel out of step with common sense, when it conflicts with fairness or disrupts legitimate government action, trust begins to erode,” she said.“If a foreign national commits a serious crime, they should expect to be removed from the country. But we see cases where individuals invoke the right to family life, even after neglecting or harming those very family ties.“Or take prison discipline. Being in custody is a punishment. It means some privileges are lost. But dangerous prisoners have been invoking article 8 to try to block prison staff from putting them in separation centres to manage the risk they pose.“It is not right that dangerous prisoners’ rights are given priority over others’ safety and security. That is not what the convention was ever intended to protect.“Prisoners claiming a right to socialise – under article 8 – is not just a legal stretch. It damages the public perception of human rights altogether.”She said it was the job of politicians to respond to those concerns in order to safeguard faith in democracy and the law. “We cannot leave these questions to the courts alone,” she said.“If judges are being asked to solve political problems that parliaments avoid, we weaken both institutions. That is why reform must be a shared political endeavour amongst us as member states, to preserve our convention by renewing its moral and democratic foundation.”Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodHuman Rights ActLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Cook Islands prime minister Mark Brown didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Relations between other Pacific islands and their larger regional backers Australia and New Zealandhave stumbled over ties with Chinain recent years as Beijing has vied to increase its Pacific sway.On the ground in the Cook Islands, controversial deal with China stirs debateRead moreBut the latest move by New Zealand’s government was striking because it reflected growing friction between two countries with strong constitutional ties – Cook Islands is self-governing but shares a military and passports withNew Zealand– over two countries’ diverging approaches to managing relations with Beijing.News of the NZ$18.2m ($11m) funding halt on Thursday, which emerged only when a Cook Islands news outlet saw its brief mention in a government budget document, is likely to prove difficult for New Zealand’s prime minister, Christopher Luxon, who is inChinafor his first official visit and is due to meet President Xi Jinping this week. Beijing has defended its Cook Islands pacts before, saying in February that the deals were not intended to antagonise New Zealand.In a report tabled in the Cook Islands parliament this week, the public accounts committee registered “concern” about a reduction of NZ$10m ($6m) in the government’s purse, the first known mention of the finance freeze. The money was earmarked for “core sector support”, which funds the Cook Islands’ health, education and tourism sectors – with audits by Wellington on how it’s spent.The money is part of NZ$200m directed to the Cook Islands by New Zealand over the past three years as part of an almost 60-year-old arrangement. The links demand consultation by Cook Islands leaders with Wellington on its agreements with other parties that might affect the relationship and the deals with China were the first serious test of those rules.The Cook Islands, population 15,000, has a large and lucrative exclusive economic zone, with Brown’s government exploring prospects for deep sea mining activity, and Cook Islanders can freely live and work in New Zealand. That prompted dismay in Wellington when officials learned of the raft of agreements Brown signed in February.The agreements didn’t promise security cooperation between Beijing and Cook Islands, but they did pledge more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Not all of the documents Brown signed were released publicly.The spokesperson for New Zealand foreign minister Peters said on Thursday said the agreements illustrated “a gap in understanding” between the governments “about what our special relationship of free association requires”, which included consultation to ensure the preservation of shared interests.The “breadth and content” of the deals and lack of consultation with Wellington about them in advance prompted a review of funding to the Cook Islands, Peters’ office said.“New Zealand has therefore paused these payments and will also not consider significant new funding until the Cook Islands government takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust,” the spokesperson’s statement said.Brown said in February that the deals did not “replace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships.” News of the agreements prompted protests in Avarua led by opposition lawmakers.New Zealand’s latest action was an “entirely avoidable consequence of Cook Islands’ strategic flirtations with China,” said Mihai Sora, analyst with the Australia-based thinktank Lowy Institute.“It’s a bit cute to sign up to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2025 and pretend there is no strategic angle for Beijing, given all the mounting evidence of China’s malign strategic intent in the Pacific,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandCook IslandsPacific islandsAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

When these activities are deceptive, clandestine or threatening, they are deemed to be foreign interference,” the report said. “These activities attempt to steer Canada’s positions into alignment with India’s interests on key issues, particularly with respect to how the Indian government perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent homeland that they call Khalistan.”Lawrence Bishnoi: the feared Indian mob boss implicated in Canada killingsRead moreThe report singled out the killing of Nijjar in the British Columbia city of Surrey two years ago, noting investigators had established a “link between agents of the Government of India and criminal networksto sow violent activity in South Asian communities in Canada”.Since becoming prime minister last year, Carney has sought to restore relations withIndia, which cratered after his predecessor accused the Modi government of orchestrating the high-profile assassination. Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.India temporarily stopped issuing visas in Canada and, soon after, Canada expelled six senior diplomats, including the high commissioner, Sanjay Verma. India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner.Carneyinvited Modi to the G7 summit over the objections of Sikh organizations and human-rights activists as well as lawmakers from within his own party,framing the decision as pragmatic step to restore engagement with one of the world’s largest economies.At the time, Carney said there was a “legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced inCanada”.In a joint statement at the conclusion of the G7 summit in Alberta, leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan said they were “deeply concerned by growing reports of transnational repression” amid efforts to “intimidate, harass, harm or coerce individuals or communities outside their borders”.The statement did not name India.Following the meeting, Carney’s office said the two leaders had agreed to return high commissioners to each other’s capital “with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries”.Modi said Canada and India were “dedicated to democratic values” and that the relationship between the two countries was “very important in many ways”.But Carney declined to tell reporters whether he raised the killing of Nijjar during the encounter.Sikhs for Justice, an advocacy organization calling for the establishment of a Sikh homeland in India, issued a statement on Wednesday calling on Carney to provide specifics of his meeting.“Did Prime Minister Carney question Narendra Modi about the role of Indian agents in the assassination of Shaheed Hardeep Singh Nijjar – yes or no?” said Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, chief legal counsel for SJF.Pannun was listed as a key target for India’s campaign of violence andan attempt on his life was foiled by US federal agents.“Accountability for Nijjar’s killing cannot be sidestepped in the name of diplomacy or trade. Diplomatic normalization with the Modi regime must not come at the expense of justice and transparency,” he said.British Columbia’s premier, David Eby, announced on Tuesday that he had asked Carney’s government to designate an Indian criminal gang implicated in the Nijjar killing as a terrorist organization in order to help police tackle extortion cases targeting south Asian businesses in the region.“There are allegations that gangs in India are operating here in our province, and in other provinces, to intimidate and extort business owners,” Eby told reporters.The Bishnoi gang – led by Lawrence Bishnoi from an Indian jail cell – was named by the RCMP as playing a possible role in violent crimes on Canadian soil that have led to diplomatic tensions between Canada and India.“This is a serious step,” Eby said. “We don’t make this recommendation lightly, but this activity strikes at public confidence in the justice system, in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyNarendra ModiSikhismAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We will come to the Pride. We will show the Hungarians that they are not alone.”Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, and a junior Dutch minister have also said they will attend the event,according to local media.The European commissioner for democracy and justice, the Irish politician Michael McGrath, who took part in the debate, did not respond to repeated requests to join the event in Budapest.McGrath confirmed the commission was examiningthe Hungarian law that outlaws Pride marchesover its compatibility with EU law and provisions on fundamental rights. “The European Commission is ready to use all its tools to ensure that EU law is upheld right across our union,” he said.The commission is already taking legal action against Hungary over a 2021 law thatbans LGBTQ+ content from schools and primetime TV, meaning pupils wondering about their sexuality cannot access help, while shows or adverts reflecting themes of tolerance may be impossible to air during peak viewing hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court follows the advocate general’s opinion in most cases.Kinga Gál, a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party and the vice-president ofthe far-right Patriots for Europe group, said the debate was “nothing new” and “perfectly fits into the witch-hunts and hysteria we have experienced for several years about Hungary”.In the right-leaning parliament, Hungary found vocal support from far-right and nationalist MEPs from France, Italy, Spain and Germany.Christine Anderson of the Alternative für Deutschland party, said: “Where you see scandal, I see reason, common sense and decency,” while accusing the commission of running an “inquisition”.MEPs from the centre-right were muted in support of gay rights, focusing on concerns over freedom of assembly and democratic standards. “Opposition is rising in Hungary and Orbán is clearly afraid,” Tomas Tobé, a Swedish member of the European People’s party (EPP), said. “They are doing everything they can to limit freedom of speech, restrict freedom of assembly and prevent people from determining their own future.”The EPP is allied toPéter Magyar,a former Fidesz insider who is widely seen to present the most serious electoral challenge to Orbán since his return to power in 2010.Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánPrideLGBTQ+ rightsEuropeEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Many of them reclaim trash from its biggest landfill site, sell it to buy-back centres, then spend the money on heroin’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 18 Jun 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.16 EDTShareThis was a tough assignment. I was making images around Johannesburg for World Environment Day 2018 and I thought I’d follow the trash to Robinson Deep, the oldest and biggest landfill in the city. I had a basic idea of where the things we throw away end up, but seeing our trash in real life, in that quantity, and not disintegrating, was eye-opening. The smell was overpowering. The sounds of tractors churned against the constant noise made by baby mice squeaking under the huge mounds of waste. I was probably stepping on them but I couldn’t see them, nor do anything differently. At one point I stepped on a cow’s head. Thank God I was wearing rubber boots that day – boots that the dozens of people eking out a living on the landfill didn’t have. They didn’t have any proper protective gear: no gloves, masks or proper shoes.This image of a man carrying a giant bag that looks like a cape, with an ibis hovering over him, was made with a long lens. I was too far away to get to him in time to ask his name before he disappeared over the hill, but I spoke to many others there. They spoke of being ill from working on the landfill but not having a choice. Some of them cook and eat their meals on the site. Some even live there. I recall the moment when a truck arrived bearing a new load and everyone ran toward this waterfall of garbage to get whatever they could – the plastic or glass that could be taken to the buy-back centres and exchanged for a few rand. This scene is not particular to Johannesburg. It happens every day in landfills all over the world.These reclaimers, like the man in the picture, are the “invisible people”, to the upper classes in particular. They are part of the landscape but are living on the precipice. Many of them are very vulnerable and have a reliance on substances. Particularlyrife in Johannesburg isnyaope, or heroin. At some of the buy-back centres, drugs are sold at the doors. People take in the waste they’ve collected, get their money, then buy their shot for the day. It’s a cycle of violence. I cannot fathom why we are living in a society that allows this to happen to our most vulnerable people.The bird gives the impression of a vulture – which carries with it the idea of hunger and deathA lot of my work is about understanding the world and how I live in it. It takes me to places I wouldn’t ordinarily go to, and I speak to people I wouldn’t usually interact with. It helps me overcome my blind spots. We always talk about our separation from the natural world when we talk about the climate crisis, but this image is a reminder that we are an intrinsic part of it. The bird and the man are both searching. It reinforces that we are in this together: our wellbeing is interconnected. There is symbolism too. The bird gives the impression of a vulture, though it’s not, which carries with it the idea of hunger and death.My photography is a balancing act. I want to compose images that are visually attractive and draw attention, but also create dialogue and, at the very least, a stirring of the heart. It is so important to talk about the meaning and not be taken up by the beauty of an image. I want to create empathy without reinforcing those blindspots. But the idea of objectivity in journalism is a myth. You can have ethical and balanced reporting, but what you choose to leave in and out of your frame is your bias.As a South African, I feel a deep responsibility to stand against injustice. My generation was the last that grew up under apartheid, before the “born-frees”, and I come from a family of anti-apartheid activists who were very involved in our community. I understand segregation and systemic injustice and discrimination. I remember my mum being dragged off to jail by security forces. I remember coming home and a piece of furniture would be gone. My mother would have given a table or bed away because someone needed it more than we did. Helping the community survive and thrive meant sharing resources. It helped me understand a radical care that stems from our inextricable interconnectedness in this world, and that still informs my work.Gulshan Khan’s CVView image in fullscreenGulshan Khan.Photograph: Zubair SaderBorn:KwaZulu-Natal, SouthAfrica, 1983.Trained:The Market Photo Workshop, Johannesburg.Influences:Santu Mofokeng, Toni Morrison, Nan Goldin, bell hooks, Nina Simone.High point:“Having my work acquired by the Iziko South African National Museum.

Also known in agricultural circles as the hare moon or the corn planting moon, it’s closely associated with new life and new beginnings.“Happy flower moon day!” beams Durand Jones, leader of soul outfit Durand Jones and the Indications, whose forthcoming album Flowers – led by the single Flower Moon – also deals with the theme of fresh starts. We’re serendipitously speaking on 12 May, along with his bandmates Aaron Frazer and Blake Rhein.Jones is at home in New Orleans, and dressed rather fabulously in a kimono and a battered old baseball cap. Frazer, the band’s falsetto-singing drummer, is in Los Angeles, where he moved in 2024 after 10 years or so in New York, while Rhein, in Chicago, doesn’t turn his camera on throughout our interview and – despite being the band’s guitarist and core producer – interjects only once or twice over the course of our hour-long conversation.Fittingly, there’s been a great deal of growth and maturation since Durand Jones and the Indications’ 2021 album Private Space. We’re still in the world of retro soul with modern, hip-hop-tinged production, but the disco and funk influences of that third album have given way to gentler, altogether more romantic moods; the O’Jays, William DeVaughn and other Philadelphia soul heavyweights; the Chi-Lites and even Barry White.Their popularity is certainly blooming: they’re gearing up for a long US tour, followed by European shows in early 2026, and have just got off the road supporting Lenny Kravitz in arenas. Frazer says the experience was “absolutely sick” and, pleasingly, they never once saw him not wearing sunglasses. “Whether it’s on stage or in the hallways, no cameras or crowds, his default is strut,” Frazer says. “That brand of rock’n’roll, with the tight leather pants and the swagger, has been mimicked so much, but when you see an original version of it, it’s super cool.”On the personal side, meanwhile, the past couple of years have also been transformative. Jones used his 2023 solo album Wait Til I Get Over to open up about being queer, something he tells me has set him free in every aspect of his life. “The biggest thing I realised was that I had spent most of my life trying to make people around me feel comfortable, and I hadn’t realised I wasn’t comfortable myself,” he says. “Now, I feel like a whole different person. I feel settled. With my solo album, my intent was to put out art, but it was also a chance to reflect on the things that I felt most insecure about. Coming back to the Indications, I felt ready to be vulnerable with my art in a way that I wasn’t before.”View image in fullscreen‘I feel like a whole different person’ … Durand Jones performing in London, September 2022.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianFrazer also got candid for his second solo album, last year’s Into the Blue, mining heartbreak, grief and loneliness in the aftermath of a breakup and relocation to LA. There is a worry that a group with two vocalists, both of whom release solo material, could have an inherent tension, perhaps exacerbated by the trio living in three separate corners of the US.But Flowers could not sound more harmonious, and Frazer says “the emotional health of this unit has never been better”. Their extracurricular activities only serve to enhance the spirit of collaboration once the band reconvenes, he argues, and “having other avenues for expression only helps longevity”.The band (which features two further auxiliary members) formed after Jones, a virtuoso saxophonist, met Frazer and Rhein in 2012 at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music. They released their self-titled debut album in 2016, a collection of gloriously retro gems rooted in 50s doo-wop and early 60s vocal harmony groups. Their music caught the ear of theChicano lowrider community, who became fierce champions of the band, and the album was rereleased to wide acclaim in 2018.Second album American Love Call took the Indications further towards the mainstream. Released in 2019, a year before George Floyd’s murder and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, it was prescient and politically charged, examining the fractures in American society and the crisis in racial equality.But no matter how despairing (“It’s morning in America / but I can’t see the dawn”), the band’s music is underpinned by the idea that love will always win. Flowers is no different, although Jones and Frazer say it can be hard to remain positive in the face of such dire politics.“It’s so scary to see what’s going down here in the US. It feels like the start of a dictatorship,” says Jones. “To see this administration literally disregard the orders of the supreme court is insane. Fascism starts with silencing folks, and we’re seeing that. After you’ve silenced the news media, you go after the arts. We’re starting to see that and it’s alarming. I am afraid, and that’s crazy to say out loud. It’s only been a little over 100 days, but there’s a lot of … what’s the word … evil happening in America. And I feel as if I’m idly standing by.”One song on Flowers, I Need the Answer, Jones’s favourite, takes a softer, conciliatory approach. “We’ve been out on the streets protesting, and we’ve been trying to talk to our fellow man in many ways, about the injustices that we feel. I Need the Answer is about just stopping and saying: ‘I disagree with you, you disagree with me, but let’s sit down and talk about this.’ I think we can find some ground that we can walk on together. We have to.”View image in fullscreen‘It doesn’t even faze me when someone says we’re on their sex playlist’ … Durand Jones and the Indications.Photograph: Elan WatsonA source of power for him and Frazer in the face of such polarised times is the number of fans who have approached them to tell him how the Indications’ music has changed their lives. “I’ve lost count of the number of grown-ass men who have cried in my arms,” says Jones. “People on the brink of suicide who say our music has saved them.”“These interactions mean more than any interview, radio play, TV appearance or whatever,” continues Frazer. “Getting to hear from someone about how your music is in their life, or seeing a video of a marriage proposal and your song is playing in the background is just incredible,” he says. “It doesn’t even faze me any more when someone says we’re on their sex playlist. I say: ‘Great, very happy you invited us into your space, glad we could help.’“I heard from a janitor who told me our music helps them get through a shift, someone who was locked up in a state penitentiary who told me our music was played by people waiting out their sentences. Hearing that our music has a very concrete role in someone’s life, that, to me, feels like making it.“And to take a song like I Need the Answer, that’s a salve. We can be a soundtrack to someone’s lovemaking or their work or their cooking or whatever. We have the opportunity to speak to people with an open mind.”Flowers is released via Dead Oceans on 27 June. Durand Jones and the Indications are at Rough Trade East, London, on 3 July, Love Supreme Jazz festival, East Sussex, on 4 July and will be touring the UK in February 2026.Explore more on these topicsSoulPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what this powerful documentary from Sophie Compton and Daisy-May Hudson (the latter of whom is the director of just-released filmLollipop) does is to demonstrate the cruelty and injustice of a system that incarcerates the vulnerable.Shot in 2021, it follows six women returning to HMP Holloway in London before demolition began a year later. In the first scenes, they walk back into the prison, some into their old cells. The building is abandoned, ivy creeps up through the floorboards, but it’s still Holloway: “Fuck, I remember this smell,” says one. During a week-long workshop the women – brave and unfailingly articulate – share their stories. All of them experienced trauma in childhood, most masked it with drugs or alcohol, or unhealthy relationships. Of the six, two are now charity CEOs: Aliyah Aliand Mandy Ogunmokun, who both work to support disadvantaged women.The poet Lady Unchainedis also in the group.‘Prison was the first place we felt sisterhood’: six women return to the ruins of HollowayRead moreThe sessions, chairs arranged in a circle in the old prison chapel, are intimate and tough to watch. “I’ll always be sad my whole life,” says one woman, reflecting on her experience of childhood sexual abuse. Leading the seasons is workshop facilitator Lorraine, and a trauma psychotherapist sits in too. In the hands of other film-makers, this could feel exploitative – or at the very least leave you concerned for the mental wellbeing of the participants after the cameras switch off. But the film producers explain at length in notes provided that their process involved working with the six women, who had a say in the final edit and were given access throughout to a psychotherapist. Their collaborative documentary feels like essential viewing for policymakers.Holloway is in UK cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPrisons and probationWomenUK criminal justiceDomestic violencereviewsShareReuse this content"

P-Orridge challenged gender identity but it is clear from the interviewees that there were no wrong answers when it came to pronouns: “he”, “she” and “they” are all used. This is a sympathetic and amiable official docu-biography in which the subject comes across as a mix of Aleister Crowley, Charles Manson and Screaming Lord Sutch. The “P-Orridge” surname makes me suspect that Spike Milligan might have been an indirect influence, although there’s also a bit of Klaus Kinski in there as well.Genesis P-Orridge: fantastic transgressor or sadistic aggressor?Read moreGenesis P-Orridge, known to friends and family as Gen, started as a radical conceptual artist, rule-breaker, consciousness-expander and tabloid-baiter who with Throbbing Gristleinfluentially coined the term “industrial music”, a term later to be borrowed without acknowledgment by many. They were, in the words of Janet Street-Porter, shown here in archive footage, “too shocking for punk”. P-Orridge formed a new band, Psychic TV, in the 1980s, and then also formed a group of likeminded occultist provocateurs called Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. (The film tactfully passes over how very annoying that spelling is.)At the beginning of the 90s, P-Orridge and his family, including first wife Paula P-Orridge, went to the US to escape a (later retracted) allegation of ritual sexual abuse. In the US, they were the guests of counterculture figure Michael Horowitz, father of Winona Ryder, and P-Orridge’s career in art, music and peripheral celebrity blossomed. After divorce from Paula, P-Orridge married the artist Jacqueline Breyer, known as Lady Jaye, with whom Gen pursued a radical project of “pandrogynous” fusion, involving breast and lip surgery.By the end, there is maybe a you-had-to-be-there factor with all this, and the film leaves you with a nagging feeling that P-Orridge was not seriously important in either art or music – but was pugnaciously sincere, too unselfconscious to be a narcissist and certainly a real one-off.S/he Is Still Her/e: The OfficialGenesis P-OrridgeDoc is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGenesis P-OrridgeThrobbing GristlereviewsShareReuse this content"

Hus opens with force: Helicopter, Triumph, Fight for Your Right, Fortune Teller, Reckless, and No Denying come in quick succession. He spits with braggadocious swagger, jumping from a protruding platform into the throes of the adoring crowd standing in the stalls. Even looking up towards the gallery, the venue’s grandeur feels entirely fitting for commemorating such a heavy-hitting UK No 1 album, which has become embedded in British rap, Afrobeats, dancehall, and general culture over the past five years.But sound-balancing issues persist throughout. The orchestra is barely audible and placing them behind Hus, while logical for crowd interaction, doesn’t seem to have been accounted for in the mixing. Hus offers no insight into his decision to introduce classical elements and hardly speaks throughout.After that vibrant (if somewhat rushed) opening run, he vanishes and we reach the show’s nadir. For 15 minutes, throwback hits Common Sense, Bouff Daddy, Dem Boy Paigon and Friendly play through speakers with minimal accompaniment, and energy ebbs exponentially – dangerously – from the audience.View image in fullscreenOne and Only … J Hus.Photograph: Eva PentelReturning with 2019’s Daily Duppy freestyle fails to jumpstart the evening. Even the orchestra members, idle, begin filming on their phones. So when Play Play finally drops, its impact is dulled: a disappointing moment for Big Conspiracy’s biggest song, which cemented Hus’s status as the godfather of Afroswing.Did you see what I done? How J Hus became the voice of young black BritainRead moreThere are still spellbinding moments, though. For Big Conspiracy’s title track, strings swell as fog fills the lower stage and Hus performs seated on a stool next to iceè tgm; during One and Only, he stands at the end of a platform, illuminated by a single spotlight. Hus’s hooks are in a league of their own but are sometimes underappreciated, so the tenderness lent by this staging helps to amplify his melodic gifts. It’s a shame, though, that when Hus closes with 2023’s Who Told You, leaving Repeat, Big Conspiracy’s third-biggest track, notably absent.Hus himself is an engaging, impulsive performer and his catalogue will go in the annals of British music. But this experimental return to live music, coming after an arena tour was cancelled in 2023 and never rebooked, needs a clearer vision. The crowd leaves with questions about how rigorously planned this all was, despite the spectacular moments when venue, band, orchestra and rapper align perfectly.Explore more on these topicsJ HusPop and rockRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Smith’s comes when he is caught in the corner of a restaurant in the Hamptons on the last night of summer, snorting cocaine from a key. He walks calmly out with the two khaki-clad police officers, poses for a mugshot and posts his $500 bail.Smith is Black, which won’t help, but he comes from wealth, which will. So he calls his sister, who calls his father in Atlanta, who tells his mother, who collapses on the floor in shock then starts calling lawyers. Smith prepares for his court date with a series of AA meetings and counselling sessions that will make it clear that this promising young man is on the road to redemption.The contrite lines Smith rehearses have some truth, and his legal troubles are not the only thing on his mind. He was a model student as a boy, living up to the pedigree of his family of Atlanta landlords, lawyers and professors. At university, new social worlds opened thanks to newfriends Elle, the effervescent Black daughter of a successful soul singer, and Carolyn, an impulsive white art-world scion.After graduating, Smith shares a New York apartment with Elle, mixing brunches, hook-ups and club nights with fairly half-hearted work. A content strategist at an arty startup, he is in an investor meeting when his phone buzzes with the news that Elle has been found dead of an overdose. Revelations and rumours spread and Smith spirals, partying harder until his arrest a few weeks later. Before long, a Vanity Fair journalist is pestering him with questions, and Carolyn won’t answer his calls.Brooklyn-based writer and academic Rob Franklin, like Smith, moved from Atlanta to New York. He shared an apartment with a young woman, Lyric McHenry, who died from a widely reported overdose. His watchful and poetic debut does not dwell on the obvious drama of arrests or police investigations. It is about a gay twentysomething trying to figure out his place in the world, and plenty more besides: this is a book about New York that’s part love letter, part reckoning; a tale of glamorous club kids and their sometimes bleak inner lives; and an account of the way privilege and race intersect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Carolyn’s set seem to live “entirely by what looked best in retrospect”, moving from impossible-to-get dinner reservations and bleary afterparties to stage-managed meet-ups in which a picnic is “incomplete without a tuft of bundled peonies, a sketchbook casually strewn”. One apartment has “an emerald slab topped with a polar bear hide” instead of a couch; Smith’s workplace is built of “polycarbonate and Lucite” and peopled by “ex‑bankers in boot-cut denim and software engineers in Yeezys”.There are moments when Smith relishes this life and finds joy in his friendships and the release of the dancefloor. But shadows are ever present. Smith claims he isn’t addicted to a substance as much as a desire to “negate or obliterate” time. As his court date beckons, he looks back on the detritus of Elle’s life: the piled gift bags and cosmetics that were her payment for interning, the inverted drugs baggies that filled the bin.Smith’s status and connections grant him access to exclusive circles, but his entry is conditional: he is a “brown, queer interloper” who offers Carolyn’s group a multicultural veneer. Elle’s death is made to fit a tragic story: “Black pain”, Smith reflects, “was always spectacle, was always entertainment.” The Instagram comments quickly descend: “junkie”, “whore”, “u got wut u deserved”.If Smith’s race lends a fragility to his privilege, others are broken already. He passes “scattered, limp bodies splayed out on benches” in a park and joins a new crowd who hand out emergency supplies and drug test kits. Franklin charts Smith’s slow, uncertain journey towards stability with sometimes overheated prose: rather than addiction, he speaks of “a desire inescapable, and often ruinous to those who possess it, to scrape with fanged nails against the marbled flesh of being”. Yet for the most part he grounds his lyrical writing with granular details, from sidestreets and brand names to vivid late-night conversations, in a book that really convinces. This fine debut probes grief, friendship, hedonism and the hard edges of the city as it walks a young man towards a second chance he knows others may not get.Great Black Hope by Rob Franklin is published by Summit (£16.99).

A great many of these vivifyinggenii lociare birds, although their identities aren’t always obvious because language evolves over time. We need a guide.Enter Michael Warren: teacher of English, amateur ornithologist and a man who lives in a Britain different to the one most of us inhabit: a medieval one, which by some magic has “survived in another dimension parallel to our own”. The gift he bestows in this gorgeous book is that, by the end, we live there too, newly able to read the growth rings of place, and to perceive an alternative land shimmering over the one we already know.The secrets lie in plain sight and plain speech, spelled out on maps, road signs and along urban streets: toponyms invoking cranes and crows, hawks and geese, eagles and owls, swallows and thegeac– an old name whose pluralgeacsbecame theExofExbourne (Devon)and theYaxof Yaxley (Cambridgeshire).That bird, unlikely as it may seem, is the cuckoo. I’ve just spent a week in the species’ stronghold of Dartmoor, hearing them close to our tent and recognising for the first time, thanks to this book, their neurotic yikker and throat-clearing “gowk”,which is still the bird’s northern and Scots name.Some may already know that theecoof ecology and economy is from the Greekoikos, meaning “home”. But go back further, explains Warren, and we reach a proto-Indo-European root wordueik, which via the Old Englishwicalso gives uswick, a word relating to settlement: literally, a place where life happens. For our forebears, birds oftenwerethat life, a presence that turned space into place: the cuckoo clearing (Yaxley), owl valley (Ousden), buzzard stone (Wroxton), jackdaw stream (Cabourne); woodpecker pool (Finmere), cranes’ brook (Cranbrook).Warren’s wordcraft is sublime. His description of a perching tawny owl, for example: “In the monochromatic shades of night, sharpened to high contrast by the glare of intrusive light [its] eyes are sunless planets … two gaping bores, as though someone blew the night clean through the back of its skull.” If there is something ofThe Peregrineauthor JA Baker in that example, Warren’s style is more textured and generous, weaving fascination, family life, and lightly carried expertise. There are other voices too: those of naturalists, writers and a gamekeeper-turned-goose-guardian who accompany him on some of his quests, plus the time-worn words of poets, scribes, monks and scholars. Of particular importance are 131 sheets of bound vellum held by Exeter Cathedral since at least AD1072. TheExeter Bookcontains almost all we have of Old English poetry and the earliest written mention of many of our birds.The bird most often invoked in English toponyms is not the cuckoo, nor the ubiquitous crow. It is the crane – a species we lost for a few centuries and whose persona now seems hitched to ideas of unpeopled wilderness. It was not always so, suggests Warren. While cranes have been elevated by rarity, gulls were once quasi-angelic, their clinging to inhospitable coastal rocks evoking the monks who established their cells at the extreme edges of these islands. Now diminished in popular perception, they are seen as gutter-life, scavengers on the trash-tides of our consumerism.Given the loss of many of the birds Warren references from the places named after them, this book comes to seem like a long-form prayer of sorts, a eulogy – or, to put it another way, a recalling of fire from embers. No journey in Britain will be quite the same again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Last year, almost 20,000 new titles were released on the PC gaming platformSteamalone, the majority disappearing into the content blackhole that is the internet. So when a smaller studio is offered the chance to get on the stage at the Summer Games Fest, an event streamed live to a global audience of around 50 million people, it’s a big deal. Not something that you want to spectacularly misjudge.Enter Ian Proulx, cofounder of 1047 Games. His short slot at the event earlier this month had him walking on stage with a baseball bat to promote the online shooter Splitgate 2 by announcing that he was “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year”, while wearing a cap bearing the slogan “Make FPS great again”. It did not go well. Gamers and fellow developers criticised his decision to diss another studio’s game as well as his politically charged use of a Maga/Trump meme, especially withanti-ICE protestersbeing beaten and arrested just across town. Proulx defended his actions, denying that his use of the cap slogan was political, but four days later hemade an apologyvia X explaining: “We needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.”What Proulx failed to anticipate is that in the fast-paced meme culture of 2025, context, nuance and sociopolitical intricacy are vital and constantly changing. You can’t simply put on a cheeky grin and appropriate whatever signs and symbols are floating around 4Chan – look atElon Muskand how embarrassingly dated his mid-2000s edgelord shtick has become. You can’t deploy the Maga anthem without contextualising it; and you definitely can’t claim to be the cutting edge saviour of the FPS while promoting not only a sequel but a battle royale mode of all things. In 2025 – are you kidding?View image in fullscreenBacklash … will anyone play Splitgate 2 now?Photograph: 1047 GamesI don’t know the exact situation at 1047Games, but I’ve visited hundreds of game development studios all over the world. No matter how progressive they want to appear, there is often, at the very top, a familiar monoculture of middle-class men of a certain age, with certain tastes, who can sometimes overlook the fact that their experiences and views might not reflect those of everybody else. Proulx said something telling: “We tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.” In the boardroom, surrounded by likeminded pals, it probably seemed like a laugh, but perhaps they should have checked with someone else first.Splitgate 2is now in the unfortunate position where a portion of its potential customers were turned off by this ill-judged Maga bit, and an entirely separate portion hate that Proulx apologised for it, thereby capitulating to the woke mind virus. Multiplayer games rely on an engaged community to spread the word about them, so this is very much not ideal.There are smarter things Proulx could have done on that stage with his 30 seconds of fame. When you look back at greatest E3 moments of years gone by, the memorable spectacles have been positive: former Xbox chief Peter Moore and hisHalo 2 tattoo; game artist and director Ikumi Nakamura charming the whole world with her unguarded enthusiasm for Ghostwire: Protocol; actorKeanu Reevesshouting, “You’re breathtaking!” at an audience member during the Cyberpunk 2077 stage show; Swedish developer Martin Sahlin tearing up talking about the platform game Unravel. In a culture heavy with faux machismo and attitude, these charming, funny, daft moments broke through like shards of sunlight. You don’t need to take to the stage with a slogan or a baseball bat. The greatest asset you can wield in this highly digital, massively anonymised creative industry is humanity.What to playArcade-y … Rematch.Illustration: Sloclap/SteamThere are a few eye-catching games our this week, includingDate Everything, a game in which you can flirt with your toaster; Tron: Catalyst, a novel take on Disney’s cyber-universe from Bithell Games of Subsurface Circular fame; andFBC: Firebreak, a three-player co-op spin-off from cult studio Remedy’s oeuvre.I’m personally most interested inRematch, however, an arcade-y 5-v-5 football game whose developers have clearly played a lot of Rocket League. Unlike EA Sports FC, you inhabit just the one player rather than the whole team, and all those players have the same flashy skills, so there’s none of the stats and strategy of EA Sports FC. In other words, this is a football game that you can enjoy without knowing much about football.Available on:PC, PlayStation 5, XboxEstimated playtime:whatever you want to put into itWhat to readView image in fullscreenElegance … Anna Williams in Tekken 7.Composite: Guardian Design;  Bandai NamcoAs part of the Guardian’s Pride month series aboutunexpected queer icons, Keza MacDonald wrote about the Zelda series’Link as a non-binary icon; Jason Okundaye wrote aboutthe divas of the fighting game genre; and Jordan Page wrote aboutthe gender-playfulness of Pokémon.

I’ve always thought Edmund Spenser’s 16th-century epicThe Faerie Queenewould make a great open-world game.”Conveniently, as an English literature graduate myself, this is something to which I have given a lot of thought. In terms of classic works that would make great games, I’d play The Rime of the Ancient Mariner as a dark, rogue-like take on The Oregon Trail with the visual style of The Return of the Obra Din; I’d play Conrad’s Heart of Darkness as a Silent Hill-style psychological horror; or Pride and Prejudice as rules-heavy dating sim (we came enticingly close to this with the now sadly defunct multiplayer online game,Ever, Jane); both Tom Jones and Middlemarch would make incredible open-world adventures.In the category of “historical writers who would now be game designers”, I would put two obvious candidates: Mary Shelley and HG Wells, writers who were interested in and profoundly inspired by science and technology. I’d also say Bertolt Brecht, a dramatist who used various technologies to capture the interest of popular audiences, and August Strindberg, who wrote plays, but also took photographs and dabbled in the occult. I could see him presenting some wild, densely symbolic role-playing adventure at the Summer Games Fest – and he wouldn’t need a baseball bat or a cap with a dumb slogan.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterGame cultureNintendo Switch 2featuresShareReuse this content"

We all know that Mario Kart World isundoubtedly a multiplayer masterpiece, and original Switch games from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet to Zelda have been updated to look amazing on the new console, but there’s otherwise a severe lack of Nintendo-made launch games for the Switch (beyond the £8 tech demo, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour).Thankfully, other developers have stepped in to fill the gap, releasing a bunch of updated versions of games that have been out on other consoles for a while. What should you pick up when you’re tired of Mario Kart World?Hitman World of Assassination: Signature EditionView image in fullscreenShimmering with energy … Hitman: World of Assassination.Photograph: IO InteractiveBuilt to be replayed over and over, Hitman is a series of intricately designed assassination scenarios in settings from the Amalfi Coast to a creepy old UK country manor, each one teeming with tantalising ways to take out your target. Developer IO Interactive maintains a schedule of live events to keep you sneaking back into this morally questionable stealth game. In handheld mode, World of Assassination looks especially stunning, the Switch 2’s HDR screen lending extra vibrancy to a classic Berlin nightclub level. Thankfully, Agent 47’s antics fare just as well in docked mode, each locale shimmering with energy as characters bustle about their routines – all at a good framerate.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate EditionView image in fullscreenImpossible port … Cyberpunk 2077.Photograph: CD ProjektPolish developer CD Projekt Red is back again with another impossible port, the most high profile third-party launch title on Switch 2. Years ago, The Witcher 3 was crammed on to the original Switch at the lowest possible resolution, losing its beauty, atmosphere and arguably something of its essence – but Cyberpunk 2077 fares far better. While this sci-fi RPG infamously chugged along on PS4 and Xbox One, Cyberpunk 2077 is perfectly playable on Switch 2. It supports a litany of motion control options, including new mouse controls, and indoor missions and cutscenes look startlingly good. Yet the futuristic facade begins to unravel whenever you hop into your cybercar. When hurtling around Night City’s seedy streets – especially in the Phantom Liberty expansion – the processors visibly strain under the load, blurring and softening the city around you. If you’re keen to lose yourself in Cyberpunk 2077 wherever you go – or this is your only console – this is a solid enough effort. For everyone else – you’d be best off roaming Night City on PlayStation 5, Xbox or a capable PC.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HDView image in fullscreenStealing away the hours … Bravely Default: Flying Fairy.Photograph: Square-EnixOf all the games I was excited to see running on my shiny new £400 console, an upprezzed 3DS game certainly wasn’t the top of my list. It should have been, as Bravely Default HD breathes new life into one of the best RPGs of yesteryear. Freed from the shackles of a teensy screen, this painterly storybook world suddenly glistens with life and detail. While the simplistic character models betray their 3DS origins during cutscenes, against all odds this endearing playable diorama looks stunning in 4K and even better on Switch 2’s 1080p handheld screen – proving that a good art style really is timeless. Bravely Default is the closest we’ll ever get to a Final Fantasy IX sequel, so if you’ve had enough of getting blue-shelled and are pining for an eye-catching RPG to steal away the hours, look no further.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Sonic X ShadowGenerationsView image in fullscreenBlue blur beauty … Sonic X Shadow Generations.Photograph: SegaWith Mario busy zooming across the racetrack and Donkey Kong’s banana-fuelled escapades still a month away, it falls to the blue blur to bring platforming to Nintendo’s new console. Luckily Sonic’s Switch 2 debut is a thing of beauty. In handheld mode, this remake truly shines, offering a sublime marriage of colour and speed as you’re hunched over that chonky screen. A remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations, this redux adds an all-new Y2K-esque Shadow-centric expansion, a la Super Mario 3D World expansion Bowser’s Fury. What leaves a sour taste, however, is how publisher Sega has priced this. Despite launching on the original Switch last year, owners of the Switch 1 version have no discounted upgrade path for Switch 2, forced to pay full whack once again. This is a fast, fluid and furious port – it’s just a shame for the people who already bought the inferior version.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Kunitsu-Gami: Pathof the GoddessView image in fullscreenCriminally overlooked … Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.Photograph: CapcomOne of 2024’s weirdest games dances and slashes its way on to Switch 2 with delightful results: you are a demon-hunter accompanying a dancing priestess through mythological Japan. A cut above most other launch ports, Kunitsu looks remarkably similar to the PS5 version when playing docked, giving this criminally overlooked game a second lease of life on Nintendo’s new machine. Melding demon-dismembering action with engrossing village defence, Path of the Goddess’s pick up and play game loop fits the Switch 2 perfectly. It takes a noticeable visual hit in handheld, however, so playing on the TV is the optimal way to go.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Yakuza0: Director’s CutView image in fullscreenGraphical highlight … Yakuza 0.Photograph: SegaThis reimagining of Tokyo’s 1980s gangster underground is a game I’ve started multiple times and always abandoned. Yet after playing this sublime Switch 2 port, I’m determined to finally see Kiryu’s story through. Boasting gorgeous lighting and running at 4K and 6OFPS when docked, along with Hitman, this Director’s Cut is a graphical highlight for Nintendo’s new hybrid console. With a drama-laden storyline filled with betrayals, oddball side quests, back alley fisticuffs and drunken karaoke, Yakuza 0 offers the meatiest – and strangest – narrative-led experience currently on Switch 2. With 25 minutes of brand new cutscenes, and an all-new four-player co-op multiplayer mode, this is the definitive version.How good is it on Switch 2? 5/5Street Fighter 6View image in fullscreenSlick and responsive … Street Fighter 6.Photograph: CapcomI can’t help but think fondly about the 3DS launch game Super Street Fighter IV 3D as I batter seven shades of cells out of Ryu on Switch 2. Featuring every mode and fighter yet released, this is a generous package. Battles feel slick and responsive, keeping that core frame rate as reliably consistent as you need in a fighting game. Yet where Street Fighter 6’s art style shone on PS5, its roster of iconic fighters look oddly off-brand on Switch 2. Chun Li’s legs feel disproportionate. Zangief’s eyes bulge as if he’s been straining his bladder during a long haul flight – it all feels like a Temu version of the real thing. If you’ve yet to play Street Fighter 6 elsewhere, these visual quirks will probably go unnoticed, but for those who can hadouken on other platforms, this is one fight worth sitting out.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Puyo Puyo Tetris 2SView image in fullscreenLazy … Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.Photograph: SegaSega has let the side down again with Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S: it’s another “upgrade” of an existing Switch game, at full price. Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds a few new multiplayer modes and little else. This puzzle game barely benefits from enhanced resolution or framerate improvements, and there is little point in buying this insultingly lazy launch title. Stick to the Switch 1 version for your fix of gooey globules and trance-inducing tetriminos.How good is it on Switch 2? 1/5Fast FusionView image in fullscreenPulse-pumping … Fast Fusion.Photograph: Shin’en MediaThe Switch 2 launch title least likely to break the bank. A download-only release, this four-player futuristic racer is Wipeout meets F-Zero – and only costs £13.49. Just like Shinen’s Fast Racing Neo on Wii U and Fast RMX on the original Switch, Fast Fusion is a glorious technical showcase, putting the Switch 2’s processors through their paces with stunningly rendered 4K racetracks. With fuse-able vehicles, online showdowns and a predictably pulse-pumping soundtrack, Fast Fusion is the perfect edgy racing counterpart to the saccharine Mario Kart World.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Explore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2GamesNintendoNintendo SwitchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Neck Study II a woman, eyes closed, holds up her head so we can study the curves and dips of flesh on her stretched neck. Saville notes these anatomical realities with a pencil in precise nuances of shading, also observing every contour of her face and the bones under her thin shoulders. It is beautiful. It is true.So what the hell – I thought – was she doing in the adjacent gallery where massively enlarged faces, pummelled by life and her art, are lit as harshly as flash photographs? They include her portrait of a boy with a bloodied beaten face, lip twisted, eyes dazed, used for the cover of a Manic Street Preachers album that was banned from supermarkets for being too disturbing. That was just a small reproduction. Here you are confronted by the colossal real thing, faces that truly get in your face.View image in fullscreenLip twisted, eyes dazed … gallery view of Stare, 2004-05, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: David Parry/National Portrait GalleryI ran away, at first, from this massive panorama of damage to look at some lovely drawings of motherhood in charcoal and pastel that take inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo to create tender moments between mother and baby, the figures seen through clouds and storms of exploratory drawing suggesting ever-moving life. Through this turmoil she finds monumental moments of intimacy. In Study for Pentimenti IV a baby boy sits cockily on his pregnant mother’s naked tummy: he’ll always be top child.The tenderness continues, this time between consenting adults in bed. A white woman and her Black lover lie together in naked union, she placing a hand on his bare leg, feeling the flesh. In other scenes it’s him holding her, or their heads at opposite ends of the bed, her foot feeling his ribs. In the most beautiful, charcoal is immersed in a pink pastel rain that turns the room into a rose bower. This is a 21st-century Degas – as it obviously wants to be.View image in fullscreenUnabashedly erotic … Compass, 2013, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Mike Bruce/© Jenny Saville. All rights reserved, DACS 2025. Courtesy GagosianOne artist it does not make you think of is Lucian Freud. Ever since the early 1990s, Saville has been compared with the late British figurative master, hyped as a young female Freud, or criticised as “just not as good as Freud”. This exhibition proves how utterly different they are. He never drew anything as unabashedly erotic as Saville’s Degas daydreams.Saville’s drawings and pastels ground her art. If you need your figurative artists to be properly skilful – and if they’re depicting the human face and body, you should – here’s her diploma art. But when she paints, she knowingly overrides every rule she follows as a draughtswoman. When she paints, she goes wild.Jenny Saville: ‘I want to be a painter of modern life, and modern bodies’Read moreIt’s there in her gargantuan early canvases, epically thrusting nipples, tummies and hips towards your eyes. Seated on a stool with meaty legs protruding, or lying at an angle that puts a great hairy nest of pubic hair right up by you, these women wonderfully overwhelm you. Walking among them, one physical detail after another looms up, expanded, so alive they still seem to be growing.Scale in art can do more than just look impressive, or important, or freakish. It can change the relationship between art and beholder, even magically invert subject and object. When Saville paints big naked people they’re alive. And when she paints pain, the effect is terrifying, because she takes you behind the eyes of the injured.View image in fullscreenThe eyes of a prophetess … Rosetta II, 2005-2006, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Unknown/© Jenny Saville. All rights reserved, DACS 2025. Courtesy GagosianI’m ready as I’ll ever be, now, to go back and look at her paintings of violence. Witness, painted in 2009, is a brightly lit face with a smashed mouth that gushes blood. A woman has been assaulted. Her eyes are closed, her teeth bared in a bloody scream, but that makes it sound melodramatic and nightmarish, like a Francis Bacon painting, whereas this is real. You know it’s no exaggeration. The painting is photorealist.Other faces are similarly troubling. A young woman looks at you, her face horizontal – she could be dead on a slab. All around you, it’s equally horrible and real – scarred girls and battered boys. You feel guilty for looking at them. Yet, equally, they are looking at you. Because these faces are so much bigger than you, they seem more real than you. It is not your civilised morning in an art gallery that is real, but their living, or dying, hell.In her mysterious painting Rosetta II, a towering lost face sways as if remembering tragedy, but her eyes are blue, glazed and clouded, the eyes of a prophetess. Looking, suggests Saville, is not really the point. You have to see beyond the details of skin and bone, beyond anatomy, to feel the ungraspable but omnipresent realness of others. When that understanding hits you it’s a shock.Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Paintingat the National Portrait Gallery, London, opens 20 JuneExplore more on these topicsJenny SavilleExhibitionsPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

During a Tinder date, a woman found herself in a pretty awkward situation: her poo wouldn’t flush, and in an attempt to discreetly dispose of it, she ended up wedged between two windows. The story was turned into a viral meme, and even made the headlines. Now, a musical by two of the creators of the hit podcast My Dad Wrote a Porno (Jamie Morton and James Cooper) has been spawned from the incident, too.The central premise remains, but with a few creative tweaks. Lucy and Peter have been raised on Disney movies but are chronically unlucky in love. Misguided help arrives in the form of Lucy’s cutting anti-guardian-angel, Miseraie, and Peter’s insufferable finance bro flatmate, David. After matching on a dating app, they meet at a Mexican restaurant and do their best to keep up appearances. But, would you believe it – it turns out they might just be each other’s perfect match after all.View image in fullscreenEvery number is a hit  … Lovestuck.Photograph: Mark SeniorWith Alison Steadman’s voice guiding us through the show as a romcom style narrator, everything falls, predictably, into place. But with a powerhouse score by Bryn Christopher and Martin Batchelar, the stage erupts into a celebration of modern love at its most mortifying. In Picture Perfect, Lucy sings of the flawless lives she sees online. In Shit!, her embarrassment spills out of her at a panicked rate. Every number is a hit.After the original actor playing Lucy suffered an injury in rehearsals last week, Ambra Caserottihas stepped in last minute. Though you’d never guess it: her voice melts like butter, and she brings a dry sense of humour to the role. Coupled with Shane O’Riordan as Peter, the pair make an endearing and suitable awkwardly match.By the end, it turns out it’s better to be yourself, even if you happen to be the internet sensation known as “poo girl”. It’s hardly revolutionary stuff. But with stylistic traces of Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss’s Why Am I So Single?, the musical glistens with wit, intelligence and a high gag rate. There’s a hell of a lot of poo chat, but if you can get onboard the toilet train, you’re sure to leave laughing.AtStratford East, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDatingreviewsShareReuse this content"

As Delilah looks down on the unconscious form of the great biblical hero, her accomplice is cutting the very tangled locks that hold his superhuman strength. Meanwhile, at the door, soldiers are waiting by torchlight. At the heart of it all is Samson’s rippled naked back, nestled on the woman’s pink silk skirts.Is this a painting by the Flemish baroque master Peter Paul Rubens? Hell, yes. The wonder is that anyone would ever think otherwise. And yet some do. Michael Daley and his campaigning group ArtWatch UK, and the art historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis (among others), are getting traction with their claims that theNational Galleryowns a “fake” or “modern copy” and is covering up that reality.Only Rubens could have painted both this lavishly sexualised male body and, just inches away, dote on Delilah’s breastsThey appear to be talking about a different painting from the one I know. In an UnHerdarticleabout her long struggle to disprove this painting’s attribution to Rubens, Doxiadis reveals that, from the moment she first beheld it at the National Gallery in the 1980s, she rejected it – and still does – as “a shoddy artefact, lacking the brilliance of my favourite European painter”.We’ve all got our own tastes, but I cannot recognise this description. Shoddy artefact? Samson and Delilah currently hangs in a gallery of other Rubens masterpieces and easily takes its place there – it commands the room, draws you in, and it repays detailed, repeated looking. I looked at it again only last week, as I have been looking at it for years, always finding new nuances.Fresh doubt cast on authenticity of Rubens painting in National GalleryRead moreThis lovely painting, however, has been confusing people since the National Gallery bought it in 1980 because it doesn’t look like the cliche of a Rubens. Where are the swirly draperies, fiery skies and flouncy paintwork? But it doesn’t look typical of him for a good reason: it is his passionate attempt to paint like someone else.When Rubens painted Samson and Delilah in 1609-10, he had recently returned to his home in Antwerp, Belgium, after an eight-year working holiday in Italy. While this was typical of north European artists in the dying years of the Renaissance, he stayed longer than most, studying the dead greats such as Leonardo, Michelangelo and Titian but also becoming obsessed with one living artist – Caravaggio, whose works were prominent in Rome and Florence.They never met because Caravaggio went on the run after killing a man in 1606, but unknown to him, he had an eloquent champion in Rubens. After Caravaggio’s shockingly real, even godless painting The Death of the Virgin was rejected by a church in Rome, Rubens persuaded the Duke of Mantua to buy it and when his collection was sold to Charles I this radical Caravaggio came to Britain – before ending up in France after Charles was beheaded. Rubens also clearly copied Caravaggio’sMedusainto his own works, more than once, including on Athena’s shield in the National Gallery’s Judgement of Paris.View image in fullscreenA Caravaggio-esque Medusa (far left) in Rubens’ The Judgement of Paris.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesBut Samson and Delilah is Rubens’s most extravagant homage to Caravaggio, a painting in which he tries to fully understand this outlaw artist’s lighting, sensual shocks, and even his creamy yet exact brushing, which means a much smoother, more consistent surface than you get with later, more expressive and “painterly” Rubens canvases. The soldiers at the door, the old woman with the candle, the hair-cutting – though Caravaggio preferred to sever the whole head – are gloriously Caravaggio-like.The way that Rubens lingers on every shadowed furrow of that exposed male back is very like Caravaggio, too. It also resembles Rubens’s powerfully erotic drawings of male nudes – including his enthusiastic portrayals of classical statuary. Yet only Rubens could have painted both this lavishly sexualised male body and, just inches away, dote on Delilah’s breasts with that strip of linen setting off their fleshiness. This is more than voyeurism. Delilah is one of many powerful women who appear in Rubens paintings –so frequently, indeed,that it’s another clue to his authorship.Even when he’s imitating Caravaggio, Rubens can’t help being himself. The light is his, the candle glow is buttery and warm, like a pancake in an Antwerp kitchen. That mixture of southern sensuality and northern homeliness is another Rubens trait.The quirkiness of this painting that gets some people’s goat – its cocktail of Caravaggio-ism and Rubens’s own carnal abandon – is actually a clue to its authenticity. What copyist would have been so subtle as to recreate this moment when Rubens takes on Caravaggio – especially in the earlier 20th century when Caravaggio was not rated as he is today? The window for such a faking is improbably narrow – between the 1950s when Caravaggio started to be rediscovered and 1980 when this was bought by the National Gallery.I’ve criticised the National Gallery plenty but it does not engage in cover-ups. In 2010, it put on an exhibition owning up to “fakes” in its collection. That information is also on labels in its rehang: for example, the label for Giorgione’s The Sunset reveals that Saint George and the dragon are a modern addition. It is not confessing anything about the Rubens because there’s nothing to confess.Is Samson and Delilah a “shoddy artefact” that a 20th-century copyist could have slapped together? No, it is a superb, seductive masterpiece about the power of desire, in which Rubens assimilates the vision of Caravaggio while remaining utterly himself.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingNational GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On stage at the Minetta Lane Theatre, the 56-year-old movie star andBroadwayveteran appeared startlingly undefended and vulnerable. In character as a middle-aged university professor infatuated with his 19-year-old pupil, Jackman addressed the audience for a play called Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes with the lights up, as if helming a lecture full of shy students put on the spot; when one viewer sneezed during Jackman’s monologue, he paused to say bless you.The show goes on: how did Broadway achieve a record-breaking season?Read moreI fretted a few rows from Wolverine, more aware of my fellow audience members’ faces and cellphones than I’ve ever been at aNew Yorkshow and acutely attuned to the fact that this all could go awry at any moment. Theater is always a contract between audience and performer, but years attending big Broadway shows have inured me to its fragility. At the Minetta, with just the commanding presence of Jackman and the lit audience at his feet, that contract felt thrillingly, temporarily exposed.That electric current was the point of Together, a new initiative prioritizing intimate, affordable theater founded by Jackman, director Ian Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman, which has occupied the Minetta for the better part of the spring. “The starting point for this company was to not have a filter between [actors] and the audience, and for there to be a real connection, an intimate connection,” said Friedman, recently deemed the “most prolific and powerful theater producer working today” by theNew York Timesfor launching such Broadway and West End juggernauts as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Stranger Things and Funny Girl. “It’s a partnership spiritually, creatively, artistically, and we’re all there to support one another.”The company, launched in conjunction with the Amazon subsidiary Audible, seeks to provide an alternative toBroadway’s ballooning ticket pricesand large, technically intricate productions. Together’s first two shows – Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes, a #MeToo-themed play from the Canadian writer Hannah Moscovitch, and a reworking of August Strindberg’s 1888 play Creditors – are heady, relatively low-tech and actor-forward, with two and three performers, respectively. (Notably, all performers have big screen credits – Liev Schreiber, Maggie Siff and Justice Smith starred in Creditors.) And at a time when theaverage Broadway ticketgoes for over $120 – or as much as $921 this spring, for a starry production ofOthello– a quarter of Together tickets are comped and distributed through the Theater Development Fund to seniors, students, veterans, teachers and other community groups. Another quarter are sold the day of performance, via digital lottery or in-person box office, for $35.View image in fullscreenJustice Smith in Creditors.Photograph: Emilio Madrid“We’re trying to make theater less elitist,” said Rickson, a veteranBroadwayand West End director who is based in London. “I have felt existential about curating work for an increasingly elitist audience, but I hate saying that because they’re people too. What you want is a range of people to experience the work.”The company’s ticket model “in and of itself is allowing for a different demographic”, said Jackman via email. “You can absolutely feel it. The audience is wildly different for every show.”In production and in ethos, Together emphasizes a return to basics: an actor, a director, a stage and community. The trio, who worked together on the Broadway 2014 show The River, first conceived of the idea on, fittingly, a river walk in London in 2020. It was the height of the pandemic, and the group longed not just for the return of theater, but the return of a certain freedom from their early careers, when the pressure was off, the stakes were low and the enthusiasm was high. “There’s huge expectations when Hugh’s in a play, there’s huge expectations when I’m producing a play,” said Friedman. “And we just thought, how can we approach this work as if we were doing this at the beginning? Can you have that fearlessness? Why can’t we go back to basics?”“Together was created with the idea of community – removing barriers so that everyone is able to participate in theater,” said Jackman. “Making sure that everyone can see the plays no matter who they are. Also, encouraging experiences of theater that are electric, elemental and relatively simple in terms of bells and whistles. Material that goes right to the heart.”$921 to see Denzel Washington’s Othello? How Broadway tickets got so expensiveRead moreRickson returned to the history of radical, public-art theater inNew York, from the Yiddish theater district of the early 20th century, to the pioneering Group Theatre collective of the 1930s, to the New York outfit of the New Deal’s Federal Theatre Project, to the Actors Studio. “There’s a radical ancestry here,” he said, that inspired the new company’s rules: equal pay for actors, no star billing, an element of public access and no designated press nights.The group tinkered with Together over several years, meeting every few months in New York or London to discuss ideas. Meanwhile, the financial landscape for live theater in New York only grew more challenging. Costs shot up anywhere from 20 to 30% after the pandemic, and never came back down. On Broadway, “something that was going to cost $4m pre-pandemic is now $7m”, said Friedman. “If it costs so much to put on a piece of work, and it costs so much to run that piece of work, you have to charge a particular ticket price.”View image in fullscreenHugh Jackman outside the Minetta Lane Theatre.Photograph: MEGA/GC ImagesTogether self-consciously stops short of proposing to fix Broadway’s price creep – “I don’t have the answers,” said Friedman. “If what we are doing helps create a conversation about how the system might change, fantastic. But that is not our driving force.” But it does provide an alternative to that system, from power players within that system who espouse, as Friedman put it, “huge respect for the industry I work in, but also with a huge sense of concern and caution about the way we’re going”.It’s worked financially, at least so far, because, unlike Broadway, Together is a non-commercial business. Audible, the audiobook subsidiary of Amazon, funded its first season. The corporation recorded the works for distribution on its platform, and Together got access to the Minetta, which has been inpartnership with Audiblefor live theater since 2018. The shows are deliberately low-tech, the sets minimalist – a few pieces of furniture, drinks and, in the case of Sexual Misconduct, one (non-functioning) lawnmower – keeping costs low. The first technical rehearsal, a process of moving from the rehearsal room to the theater that can take weeks on Broadway, took a single day. The changeover between plays takes just 15 minutes.Though the company has attracted big names so far, Together retains a sense of a scrappy, experimental theater group with no set path. All three founders described the company as a sort of professional pressure release valve, an ideas generator rather than an endpoint. “I love the idea of it being ephemeral – it could happen in London, it could happen in Sydney, it could happen anywhere,” said Rickson. Creditors wraps in June, but the trio is already in brainstorming mode, positing potential future iterations of Together that could include a mentoring program, a different home base, a continuation of its inaugural panel series, or allowing big-name screen actors the chance to test out theater without the pressure of an eight-days-a-week Broadway commitment.“When we announced it and launched it, I think we were quite timid in terms of what we’re trying to achieve, because we don’t want to come across as having found the answers to Broadway or finding the answers to how you do work,” said Friedman. “But we’re ambitious about the future and we’re talking about it constantly.“I think the only thing we absolutely know is we’re going to make a commitment for as long as we feel we can,” she added. “Is that years? Is it the rest of our lives? Who knows? But we’re in. We’re in for the long haul with Together.”Explore more on these topicsUS theaterHugh JackmanSonia FriedmanNew YorkTheatreBroadwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blacklisted, a new show at New York Historical, profiles the lives of the so-called Hollywood Ten, who were creatives caught up in the communist witch-hunt – to disastrous consequences affecting their lives for decades thereafter. It brings to mind suggestive, and uncomfortable, parallels with politicized persecution in the US today.“At this point, TV was just beginning to become influential,” said Anne Lessy, an assistant curator who coordinated the show. “There was a lot of anxiety around these mass entertainments and how much power they had, in part because the second world war effort had been so successful in propaganda. A lot of the blacklisted artists were important in those efforts.”‘We live in a second Red Scare’: what can we learn from a chilling book about Florida’s past?Read moreIn addition to rising fears around the newly unleashed power of television, Lessy added that there were powerful backlashes around rising equality, promoting racism, xenophobia and antisemitism. Politicians and other opportunists were keen to take advantage of these social fissures – persecuting members of the Hollywood elite was widely viewed as a stepping stone for ambitious politicians.“This was a way to give yourself a real bounce in terms of your political career,” Lessy said. “A relatively junior member of congress, Richard Nixon, was on the [House Un-American Activities Committee], and then in just a few short years he’s elected senator from California, and then vice-president. So it really did become a platform that many politicians saw as a way to advance their own ambitions.”View image in fullscreenCivil Rights Congress, America’s ‘Thought Police’: Record of the Un-American Activities Committee, 1947.Photograph: Courtesy of the Unger FamilyBlacklisted explores this crucial history through the lives and stories of various Americans, including the Hollywood Ten – a group of screenwriters and directors who were held in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions before HUAC. While the show was originally curated by Jewish Museum Milwaukee in 2018, when things such as book bans and “don’t say gay” bills were just beginning to pick up steam, its resonance with the US political situation has only increased in the years since.The president and CEO of New York Historical, Louise Mirrer, explained that when she found out about Blacklisted, it felt like a slam dunk. “The exhibition was brought to our attention by a member who saw it a few years ago at the Skirball [Cultural Center] in Los Angeles. Even already at that time, around the country, we were starting to see a lot of attention paid to books in school libraries, the curriculum taught in schools – it just seemed like this theme of being blacklisted really resonated and was important to bring to our audience.”One of the narratives that Blacklisted explores is that of Dalton Trumbo, an award-winning screenwriter known for films such as Roman Holiday and Spartacus. Because of his blacklisting, Trumbo actually worked on these films and others under a pseudonym, and was not able to receive any credit for his Academy award–winning work. It was only in 1960 that he was again given screen credits – for his films Exodus and Spartacus – and it was not until 2011 that he received full credit from the Writers Guild of America for his work on Roman Holiday. “So many screenwriters had to work under fictitious names or fronts,” said Lessy, “and it was often not until the 80s or 90s that they got credit for their work.”Beyond not being able to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor, such blacklisted writers and actors experienced serious limitations to their careers and ability to support themselves. Among the historical ephemera collected in Blacklisted is the unemployment benefits application of actor Madeleine Lee, who was unable to earn a living due to the witch-hunt that buried her career. Such consequences could be lifelong. “Blacklisted artists struggled to survive,” said Lessy, “and the impacts often lasted for a very long time. Many blacklisted creatives were not getting an accurate pension into the 80s and 90s. Films were still crediting an alias or front.”View image in fullscreenAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAgainst this governmental persecution, Hollywood creatives deployed many forms of resilience. They relied on community ties for mutual aid, and they carried on their creative practices outside Hollywood. For this version of the show, New York Historical has added an examination of how New York theater was a lifeline for so many who had run afoul of state-sponsored attacks. “New York theater never adopted a formal blacklist, and so the theater world became an important refuge,” Lessy said. “Actors’ Equity was one of the few entertainment unions to actually pass an anti-blacklist resolution.”One of the cases that Blacklisted examines is that of a stage production of the book The World of Sholom Aleichem. Considered a forerunner of Fiddler on the Roof, the book delves into 19th-century Jewish diasporic communities throughout southern Russia. It was turned into a very popular theater show that consisted largely of blacklisted staff, even garnering a rave from the New York Times and going on to become a prime-time TV presentation. “They took this Russian-Jewish folktale and turned it into a really popular show,” Lessy said.The show also looks at how figures such as playwrights Arthur Miller and Lillian Hellman were given a lifeline by New York. Miller was held in contempt of Congress in 1957 and subsequently blacklisted from Hollywood, while Hellman was blacklisted early on, in 1949. “They had such undeniable talent and were able to continue to thrive on the New York stage,” said Lessy.Ultimately, individual citizens fighting back helped to erode the powers of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In the 1957 supreme court case Watkins v United States, the labor organizer John Watkins won a ruling that HUAC’s power was not unlimited. “I really love the fact that the legal curbing was very much an ordinary person who decided to fight back,” said Lessy. Subsequent rulings further limited Congress’s power to persecute individual Americans, offering some hope for curbing the Trump administration’s abuses of power and avoiding yet another American witch-hunt.Blacklisted: An American Story is on view at the New York Historical until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsMuseumsFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is behind the ‘6ft fixation’ in dating – and could it be scuppering the chance of true connection?Leah HarperWed 18 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 00.06 EDTShareHeight is often seen as a dealbreaker when it comes to romance, particularly within heterosexual relationships. But when Tinder recently said that it was trialling a feature that allows some premium users to filter potential matches by height, it quickly proved controversial. “Oh God. They added a height filter,” lamented oneReddit thread, while an X user claimed: “It’s over for short men.”“I’ve experimented with not putting my height on my dating profile, or lying about it just to see, and the number of likes I get shoots up massively,” says Stuart, who is in his 50s and from the Midlands. “I know I get screened out by the majority of women from the off.” At 5ft 7in (170cm), Stuart is just two inches belowthe UK and US male average height of 5ft 9in, but a height filter would probably prevent him from receiving as many matches.Since height is such a sticking point, it’s no surprise that some apps, including Bumble and Hinge, already allow users to filter by this metric. A recent YouGov poll found that most Britons thinkbeing able to filter by height is acceptable; it was least popular with under-30s, of whom 36% were not in favour of height filters, compared with 26% of the wider public. (A common counter-argument is that, if users can filter by height, they should also be able to filter by weight – something that the same survey found 51% of men supported, compared with 36% of women.)Tinder has been quick to point out that height is a paid preference feature being trialled in select markets, not including the UK. It is also not a hard filter; profiles that don’t match the selected height criteria will not be blocked outright. A spokesperson said: “This is part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally on Tinder.” The app hasgained a reputation for initiating hook-ups, rather than relationships.View image in fullscreenThe height of fashion … research has shown that most men inflate how tall they are by two inches.Photograph: Panther Media/Alamy (posed by models)“I’ve not usedTinder, but I have paid once to filter for height on Hinge,” says one Guardian reader who wishes to remain anonymous. “I am a tall woman – 6ft without shoes – and dating is a challenge, because I am only attracted to men who are taller than me. This is not a question of vanity, or of wanting to be seen with a man who is more alpha or impressive … holding hands with and hugging a shorter man feels like I’m being affectionate with a child. It makes me feel enormous, even though I have a slim figure and am confident in my appearance.”Like many of those who cite height as a prerequisite, she has faced pressure from family and friends to loosen her requirements – someone shorter, they tell her, may be better able to meet her needs. “But attraction is a need – and it seems it is only possible for me with men who are over 6ft.”Jo, 33, who is 5ft 10in and from Northern Ireland, is also “most comfortable” with partners who are 6ft and above. “While I’ve had a deeply meaningful relationship with someone shorter than me, I realised over time that I didn’t enjoy the physical dynamic of feeling like I was towering over my partner,” she says. “It affected how I felt in my own body, particularly around feeling ‘large’, which in turn affected my confidence.”In 2022, a former product manager at Bumble claimed that most women on the platform seta 6ft minimum for men– a statistic Bumble said was inaccurate – which would limit their dating pool to about 15% of the population. According to the dating app Badoo, thetop keyword for men to get matches was “6ft”(perhaps surprisingly, for women, it was “love”).Of course, as with much of the information provided in dating profiles, there is no guarantee the height given will be accurate. In 2010,OkCupid said its researchshowed that most men inflated their height by two inches. In 2019, Tinder made an April Fools’ joke about the launch of a“height verification” feature, to try to prevent such exaggerations.“Height and strength are generally associated with dominance and power,” saysSandhya Bhattacharya, a relationship therapist. “Having both predicates a greater disposition towards endurance and survival.”Research has confirmedthe idea that taller men are seen as having an advantage when it comes to social status, access to resources and heritable fitness. In Bhattacharya’s experience, this holds across most cultures, although genetic predisposition to attributes such as height and strength can vary globally. “Unconsciously perhaps, we are re-enacting biological preferences.”Anna Machin, an anthropologist and the author ofWhy We Love: The Definitive Guide to Our Most Fundamental Need, agrees that the search for a taller man is partly down to an “evolutionary drive”. But, she says, studies on non-western populations have found variable outcomes. Within the Tsimané people of the Bolivian Amazon, for example, “while men prefer the male to be taller, the women are not bothered”. This implies that there is “a major cultural element to our western preference for men to be taller”, says Machin.View image in fullscreenShort king? Sophie Dahl and Jamie Cullum.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockIn 2022,“short king spring”trended on TikTok, although the moment was short-lived. While some Guardian readers apportion blame to “TV, films and (especially) romantic novels” for the notion that a man must be tall to be attractive, a number of mixed-height celebrity relationships subvert preconceptions about height: Zendaya (5ft 10in) and Tom Holland (5 ft 8in); Sophie Dahl (about 6ft) and Jamie Cullum (reportedly 5ft 4in); and, until recently, Sophie Turner (5ft 9in) and Joe Jonas (5ft 7in), among others.Yet heightism remains so entrenched when it comes to dating that some men have taken to wearing heel lifts – shoe inserts that boost height by as much as six inches – orelevator shoes;Tom Cruise(reportedly 5ft 7in) andRon DeSantis,who says he is 5ft 11in, are both thought to be fans. But while heterosexual women may place the greatest importance on their partner’s height, filters could benefit men too.Research has shownthat most men prefer to be a little taller than their female partners and that satisfaction with their partner’s height can lead men to feel greater satisfaction with their own height – more so than with women.“I’ve made peace with the fact that, statistically, I’m very unlikely to find someone shorter than me,” says Michael, 31, who is 5ft 2in and from Hampshire. He thinks it’s reasonable for women to want to date someone taller, but believes that being able to filter by height when using a dating app is a bad idea. “Even the most generous, inclusive person is unlikely to select the whole range that’s offered, even if they don’t care about it or would be willing to look past it for the right person,” he says. “It excludes anyone at the extremes by default.”He has had mixed dating experiences in relation to his height. “About half of the women either weren’t bothered by it or were willing to look past it,” he says. “Most of the other half ghosted me as soon as they learned about it. One woman, whom I’d gotten to know quite well, said my height was shocking when I told her on a phone call, then cried for half an hour. She turned out to be 5ft 8in.”Height may not play such a pivotal role in attraction when it comes to gay relationships. A2014 study of queer menfound that most preferred a partner slightly taller than themselves, although these preferences weremodulated by sexual role. Elsewhere,other studies have foundthat, on average, gay men and women preferred partners with body heights that were equal to their own.“For most of high school and college, I felt ugly and unwanted, in large part because of comments I heard from straight women about short men being undesirable,” says Charles, 26, who is 5ft 6in and from San Francisco, California. “In my senior year of college, I came out as bisexual and started dating men. I was shocked by how attractive queer men found me. Even those who had a preference for height were generally less strict about it than the women I’d been around. So I date in queer spaces, where I feel more valued.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve worked with couples where there is a significant height difference and it makes no difference to their physical or emotional compatibility.’Photograph: ModernewWorld/Getty Images (posed by models)Height has become such a bone of contention on dating apps that some users have taken to addressing it outright. Taller-than-average women can often be found to quip that they are “probably taller than you” within their profile bios, while so many men list their height followed by the phrase “because apparently that matters” thatit has become a cliche.Away from the apps, the 6ft fixation seems to be less of a hard‑and-fast boundary when meeting by chance. “I’ve worked with couples where there is a significant height difference and it makes no difference to their physical, emotional or sexual compatibility,” says Bhattacharya. “Ultimately, the couple ‘fit’ well because they choose to be respectful, engaged and invested in the relationship.”Machin says “anything that focuses people down so closely on one attribute is detrimental”. A list of checkpoints, she says, is not the best way to choose a partner. “Ultimately, in long-term relationships, it is who someone is at their core – their beliefs, values, personality, creativity, ambitions – that we fall in love with and is the best predictor of compatibility.”Jenny, 40, who is 5ft 10in and from Sacramento, California, believes that prioritising height is a “remnant of caveman days when you had to rely on someone larger than yourself to protect you and your offspring”. Her husband, whom she met at work, is 5ft 7in – but height, she says, is just a number. “I’d prefer someone shorter who protects me emotionally and provides psychological safety,” she says. “I say kill your filters, online and in person – let life surprise you in the best way.”Some people featured in this article responded toa community callout.

But in tune with the times, this season’s show at the baroque Palace of Caserta outside Naples opened with a pair of very short shorts.Tight and high-waisted, the vibe was Vogue but the inspiration was the 1949 Italian realist film Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice) and a 19-year-old Italian actor, Silvana Mangano, in a paddy field wearing damp shorts and stockings, which ended up on global billboards.“Cinema was the thing that really took Italian style into people’s lives, and where Italian style was effectively invented,” saidIan Griffiths, Max Mara’s designer. “But afterwards, Silvana said she didn’t know her image would be so sexualised, and she wasn’t entirely comfortable with it”, he said. “So, I wanted to take this image, and look at how the position of women, real women, had changed”, he said. “The idea is to give [women] something they want to wear, or at least to aspire to.”Griffiths designs clothes for real women, rather than the image of women. Yet it’s sacrilege to mention Neapolitan style without thinking of Sophia Lauren, too, and after the shorts came models in Bardot tops, full skirts and silk hair scarves. “Think how many women watched her in [1954’s] L’Oro di Napoli (The Gold of Naples), went out and bought a checked table cloth, Chianti and a low-cut blouse,” says Griffiths. “Plus Sophia Loren was more in control of her sex appeal.”View image in fullscreenSophia Loren in 1952. She was ‘more in control of her sex appeal’ than Mangano, says Griffiths.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockThere were camel coats of course – of the 100,000 pieces the brand makes each year, three-quarters of them are coats. But there were ever-popular pyjamas-as-daywear too.

In Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, Lila’s shoes represent social mobility and financialopportunity. Here, among the four-figure coats and the patrician arches of an Italian palace, they are virtually an act of rebellion.As for whether it is right to glamorise Naples’s postwar style – and its poverty – Griffiths said: “What should fashion do? We can draw attention to times and places and create an idealised, perfected vision of a reality. Art is about truth, and fashion is about fantasy.” The designer, who by his own admission has been called a cultural vampire, added: “I’ve never claimed to be an artist!”View image in fullscreenMax Mara abandoned its conservative look.Photograph: Alena Zakirova/Getty ImagesThe show was the culmination of cruise season. Historically what people wore on Caribbean yachts, it now taps into the “little treat” post-Christmas market. A relatively recent fixture whereby brands fly journalists, influencers and notables to unusual places, it’s a way of paying homage to a place too, but also of getting our attention. “We’re lucky if journalists pick up a press release from a seat,” says Griffiths of the back-to-back fashion weeks.Obviously, only the megabrands can whip up these spectacles, of which Max Mara – Italy’s “silent giant” – is one. The Max Mara fashion group’s turnover was £1.6bn last year. “It’s also about flexing your muscles as a brand,” said the Derbyshire-born ex-punk who has overseen the brand after winning a student competition in 1987 – and has remained ever since.View image in fullscreenNancy Pelosi in a Max Mara coat for a meeting at the White House in December 2018.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesMax Mara was one of the first labels to do ready-to-wear fashion for the middle classes, and is relatively speaking, more affordable than most big brands. But it has since become synonymous with a clean, no-nonsense look – not to mention women in power. In 2018, Nancy Pelosi’s tomato-red coat worn to a meeting with Trump became a symbol of the well-dressed opposition.Founded in 1951, this was also the year of Ruth Orkin’s infamous Florentine photographAmerican Girl in Italy, which became a conversation starter about feminism, freedom and the male gaze – including for Griffiths.Drawing on a collection of totemic women as an extension of Neapolitan glamour is not without its complications. “We had a discussion about [this]”, said Griffiths. “But [in the case of Mangano particularly] we felt it was right, because we gave her her dignity back. These are clothes that you wear, not clothes that wear you.”Explore more on these topicsMax MaraFashion industryItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even the empty pods have so much flavour and sweetness, which makes them perfect for a quick salad on the side (toss thinly sliced raw, blanched or even griddled pods with chopped tomato, sliced onion and coriander, drizzle over some fresh mint raita and sprinkle with chaat masala). Blanch the fresh peas without any seasoning before you make the curry, then add them to the simmering gravy near the end. You can swap them for frozen peas, too, if you like.Spiced green pea and coconut curry (pictured top)AKA Maharashtrianambat vatana rassa, this is a family recipe from our home in Mumbai. Traditionally, we use kokum, or dried wild mangosteen, to impart a sour, tangy flavour and a hint of colour, but you could use tamarind instead – the curry should be tart and tangy, so add to taste and according to the quality of your tamarind paste (the one I use is a pretty weak one, so I needed two tablespoons). We usually serve this with a buttery spiced ghee rice.Prep10 minSoak20 minCook20 minServes4300g podded fresh green peas, or frozen peas, defrosted2 tbsp vegetable oil12 fresh curry leaves½ tsp ground turmeric350g boiled potatoes, cut into chunks5 kokum petals, soaked in 50ml warm water for 20 min, or 2 tbsp tamarind paste, or to taste(see recipe introduction)Salt, to tasteCooked rice, to serveFor the coconut paste3 dried kashmiri red chillies1 tbsp coriander seeds1 tsp black peppercorns120g grated fresh coconutCook the fresh green peas in boiling water for two to three minutes, then drain and refresh; if you’re using frozen peas, there’s no need to cook them first, because they’ll get cooked directly in the curry sauce.Now for the paste. Soak the red chillies in 100ml warm water for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a blender, grind the coriander seeds and peppercorns to a rough powder. Add the soaked chillies, their soaking liquid and the coconut to the blender and blitz to a smooth paste.Put the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat. When it’s hot, add the curry leaves and coconut paste, and fry, stirring, for two minutes.Stir in the ground turmeric, fry for a minute, then pour in 250ml cold water, bring to a simmer and cook for a minute.Turn down the heat, add the peas, the cooked potatoes, the kokum and its soaking liquid.

It’s usually made with ripe but firm fruit, which aren’t all that dissimilar to the under-ripe and slightly flavourless apricots and plums found in most UK supermarkets and which make a great British stand-in for ume.Umeboshi (Japanese-style fermented dried plums, apricots and peaches)Our global food system is a wondrous thing, but as a Slow Foodist, consultant and food systems thinker, I can’t ignorethe benefits of shorter food chains, from lower transport emissions and reduced waste to improved quality and flavour. Of course, food miles are only one piece of the emissions pie, but that doesn’t mean they’re inconsequential, and we ought to consider them alongside other contributory factors such as livestock production and deforestation.Many fruits such as mangos, bananas and apricots continue to ripen after harvest, so these delicateclimactericfruits are usually picked hard and green, and ripened in climate-controlled rooms filled with natural ethylene gas. It’s an ingenious process, but it can produce floury, tasteless fruit with fewer nutrients.By comparison, local, seasonal fruits tend to be tastier and more nutritious, but if you’re unlucky and end up with fruit that just won’t ripen, you can either cook it or turn it intoumeboshi, which is a fun fermentation project. Like most fermentation recipes, the essence of this one is very simple, yet it’s still a scientific process that requires care and attention to detail. Everything needs to be very clean and sterilised with vinegar or alcohol. Also, due to their high sugar content, fruits such as plums, apricots and peaches are prone to mould during fermentatation, so keep your hands and utensils scrupulously clean. And make sure the fruit stays submerged in its brine, or “plum vinegar”, to help prevent mould forming; if at any stage specks of mould do appear, it’s best to compost the entire batch. There are plenty ofdetailed umeboshi guides onlineif you’d like a more in-depth explanation.Firm apricots, plums or peachesA splash ofwhite-wine or cider vinegar18% sea salt– that is, 1kg fruit will need 180g saltA clean vessel with a lidA weight– a plate, fermentation weight or bag of salt, say)Soak the fruit in water with a generous splash of vinegar for a couple of hours. Using a toothpick or tweezers, remove the little stem from the fruit, taking care not to cut into the flesh itself, and save any bruised or blemished fruit for something else, because they’re more likely to develop mould. Weigh the fruit, then measure out 18% of its total weight in sea salt (that is, 180g salt for every kilo of fruit). Wipe out a clean storage jar or fermentation pot with vinegar or alcohol, then start packing in the fruit in layers, scattering each layer with the salt. Put a small clean plate or fermentation weight on top, then weigh that down with a clean weight or a sealed bag of salt.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app, scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Leave to ferment in a cool place out of direct sunlight for four weeks. Over the first three to seven days, the juices will slowly draw out of the fruit and submerge it. Make sure the fruit remains submerged, but don’t crush it down.When hot weather is forecast, drain the fruit (save the brine for dressings), then lay it on a rack and dry in the sun for three to five days, until it shrinks and turns crinkly. Store the dried fruit in a clean, airtight jar. Traditionally, umeboshi is aged for one to three years, but to be on the safe side, aim to consume it within a month or so.Explore more on these topicsPickling, fermenting and preservingWaste notFoodFood wasteJapanese food and drinkFruitSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, in Australia, tomorrow has finally come.After a two-year-long approval process,FoodStandards Australia New Zealand has given Australian food technology startup Vow foods the green light to sell three products made from cultured quail cells.Vow’s “forged” whipped pate, foie gras and an edible tallow candle, all made from cultured Japanese quail cells, will soon be on the menu at high-end Australian restaurants including Bottarga in Melbourne and Nel in Sydney. The products have been available in Singapore for over a year, with Vow stating demand has grown by 200% a month.View image in fullscreenGeorge Peppou, CEO and founder of Vow.Photograph: The GuardianCultivating animal cells is an error-prone process. Vow is one of only three companies worldwide approved to sell lab-grown meat for human consumption. US-based start upEat Justhas sold lab-grown chicken on and off in Singapore since 2023 under the name Good Meat; while another US company, Upside Foods, has regulatory approval to sell cultured chicken cell products in the US, but does not currently have any in the market.The CEO of Vow, George Peppou, is taking a very different approach from these competitors. Rather than asking customers to pay $71 a kg for frozen shredded “chicken”, he says the company is embracing the high cost of cultivating cells by creating products to match the price.World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards: Sydney’s Saint Peter named in the longlist for a second yearRead more“We selected going with these very high end products, very high end positioning … as a way of trying to shape and influence food culture as much as possible,” he says. While foie gras prices fluctuate significantly, at the time of writing Vow’s Forged foie was cheaper than the real deal.A few weeks before Vow’s offerings gain approval, I visit the company’s Sydney factory to taste them. Unlike other Guardian Australia reporters, who have had to sign liability waivers before eating lab-grown foods, this sample session came with no paperwork.View image in fullscreenSynthetic parfait on potato chips with chopped chives and lemon myrtle oil.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianFirst, Vow’s product development manager Kevin Condon pipes portions of their synthetic parfait on to potato chips, which he tops with chopped chives and lemon myrtle oil.Velvety, savoury and very rich, it tastes close enough to chicken liver parfait that I could easily be fooled. Made with 60% cultured cells, the rest is a mixture of cognac, garlic, olive oil, thyme and butter, emulsified to give it a silky texture. Condon says they wanted the flavour to be “very familiar”, while the texture is preternaturally fluffy. “Livers have that inherent grittiness and graininess,” Condon says, so making a parfait this mousse-like the conventional way would be impossible, “no matter how many times you sieve it”.The foie is far less convincing. Served seared with scallop, berries and micro-greens, it is intensely savoury with a browned, meaty crust. Inside the texture is almost bouncy, like spam, without the unctuous, mouth-coating effect of foie gras. It has none of the metallic, organ funk either. When I tell the Vow team I haven’t tasted anything like it, they break into smiles. Making something new, rather than an alternative, is sort of the point.Peppou says that talking with chefs taught them foie gras’ heavy, offal flavour is something “a lot of people find really unpleasant”.View image in fullscreenServed seared with scallop, berries and micro-greens, the foie gras is intensely savoury with a browned, meaty crust.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian“And so instead we’ve toned it down”.The tallow candle, which melts down so bread can be dipped into it, tastes remarkably like a candle. It turns out the flavour is all in the wick.The reason for cultivating quail cells, then turning them into products with fairly homogenous textures, isn’t all about perceived luxuriousness. Over the years, Vow has cultivated cells from about 50 species – including a giantmeatball made of woolly mammoth– and have found that “smaller is easier,” Peppou says. Japanese quail was one of the first cells they found to “grow really well”.As for the texture, Vow isn’t growing whole quail breasts in petri-dishes. Cells are nourished in a vat, then harvested using a centrifuge. The end result is a homogenous, pale pink goo that is “not much to look at,” Peppou says. To get cells from this state into viable foodstuff requires manufacturing processes that are less scientifically advanced, but no-less technically challenging, than growing them in the first place.View image in fullscreenThe end result is a homogenous, pale pink goo that is “not much to look at,” Peppou says.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian“We knew we could get really consistent high quality with homogenous textures much faster than we can with the more complex texture,” Peppou says.Vow’s cavernous 2,071 square metre factory is home to the world’s largest food-grade bioreactor, nicknamed Andromeda.Andromeda resembles a whiskey still designed by MC Escher. It is seven metres tall, with dozens of pipes running in and out of it. “If you talk to people that have come from biopharmaceutical cell culture, they will tell you it’s very complex, it’s very difficult,” Peppou says. In reality, he finds it is “incrementally more complex than beer brewing”.Several Vow factory employees are former brewers, though they’ve also hired biomedical and aeronautical engineers, and Vow’s CTO is a former SpaceX employee. This disparate group has managed to build what Peppou says is “by orders of magnitude the cheapest factory for cell culture in the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reason, Howitt says, comes down to financing. “If you think about the pharmaceutical industry, they’ve already built facilities at scale that do precision fermentation. But when you’ve got a high-value product, it’s easier to build a business case around investing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars upfront, before you even start producing the product. When you’re talking about the food industry which has lower margins, it’s just a harder business case.”‘My one special treat’: Guardian Australia readers react to rising costs of cafe coffeeRead moreVow’s ability to get to market has been helped by “some big backers like Blackbird and Square Peg Venture and some international investors,” Peppou says. To date, the company has raised around $80m.“We are very capital efficient … And so we’ve been able to turn a relatively small amount of capital into a lot of commercial progress.”Capital efficiency has come at other costs – in January of this year, Vow laid off 20% of its workforce. At the time, Peppou told the AFR the layoffs came from a need to “focus our entire efforts on activities that put our products into more markets and on to more consumers’ plates”.Vow has completed a single harvest of 538 kilograms – a world record for cultured meat, and say they have the capacity to harvest up to three times that amount a week. This number may sound large, but compared to the 388,000 tonnes of chicken meat Australia produced in March this year, it is minuscule.Peppou and Howitt both say that to move from a tiny, high-end niche to mass consumption, lab-grown animal products will need not only to scale, but to become cheaper, more delicious and ideally healthier than the food people already eat.View image in fullscreenAlyx Gorman samples lab-grown delicacies made by Vow Foods.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThe industry has learned a lot from the hype and subsequent commercial disappointment of other novel food products. “It’s no secret that the plant-based burgers have not gone as well as people anticipated originally,” Howitt says. “It’s because they’re jumping into a very established market with very defined [consumer] expectations.”Peppou is more blunt: “Hey, do you want a worse burger at a higher price so the planet benefits? … Not really. If I want to eat a beef burger, I’ll eat a beef burger, which tastes really good. And if I don’t want to eat a beef burger, because I want to eat sustainably, I’ll eat a carrot.”This is why, in Vow’s marketing, you will see very few references to the ethics of their products, and a lot of emphasis on the taste. “To change the behaviour of people like me, that like meat, we need to offer things which are different to what I already consume,” Peppou says.“It’s not an alternative, it’s not a replacement, it’s something which is different and the excitement comes from that difference.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkAustralian lifestyleFood (global)Meat industryFood (Environment)Meat-freefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is also used to prove you are who you say you are for a plethora of accounts, from banks to messaging services.But if it gets hacked or stolen, in what is known as a “sim swap” or “simjacking”, the consequences can be far worse than just being cut off from mobile data or calls. Unfortunately it is the kind of hack you don’t see coming. It happens in the background, with hackers using your personal data such as date of birth and address to con your network provider into swapping your phone number to a new sim in their possession.If that happens it is important to act as swiftly as possible. Here’s what to do.How to spot itKeep an eye on notifications from your mobile network, which are usually delivered by SMS. These include information about activity elsewhere and alerts of change requests, such as your phone number being activated on another device.Be aware of scams. Fraudsters may and try to trick you out of information using fake notifications. If you receive a message asking you to get in touch, double-check that any number you are given is legitimate before calling, or use a number from the provider’s website or a bill.Any loss of service that prevents calling, texting or accessing mobile data and is not explained by outages or missed payments may be a sim-swap attack.Loss of access to various accounts such as your bank or social media linked to your phone number could indicate hackers are in the process of trying to break in or have already changed your password and stolen the account.Frequently review statements and account for unexpected charges, which may be a sign that you’ve been hacked.What to do if you’ve been sim swappedCall your provider on the customer service number listed on its site using another phone. Have your phone number and details ready, including any account passwords you may have set. Explain what has happened and make sure your provider begins the recovery process and investigates how this has happened.Ask your provider to block any “charge to bill” activity.Contact your bank, crypto and other financial services immediately to ensure the hackers cannot get into your other accounts, which are typically their primary targets.Contact your immediate family and anyone who could fall victim to a scammer pretending to be you and texting from your number.Check any account you use your phone number for two-step verification. Change the two-step method if you can and set a new strong password.Check your WhatsApp and other messaging services that use your phone number as the user ID.What to do when you get back your phone account or a set up a new oneActivate any and all security measures on your provider’s account. This includes using a strong password and two-step verification, and setting a sim pin on your phone, as well as adding a telephone customer service password and a sim transfer pin, if available.Find out from your provider how the hack happened, and if possible, what personal data was used to break into your account. Consider using fake security question answers that cannot be guessed rather than real ones, just make sure you store them safely such as in a password manager.Set a spend cap on your phone account.As soon as you are sure you have full control again, reactivate two-step verification on your accounts and transition any that you can to authenticator app-based two-step verification, which is more secure.Set pins on messaging services such as WhatsApp or Signal to make it much harder for someone else to register new devices or take over your account.Contact your financial services providers to reactivate your accounts but keep watching out for fraud and query any unexpected transactions.Look at your social media and other public-facing accounts for any information that could enable criminals to steal your identity to perform hacks such as this.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesLost or stolenScamsConsumer affairsTelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I mean, isn’t summer supposed to be lovely and warm? Isn’t that sort of the whole point of a summer wardrobe? Sandals and shorts exist to celebrate carefree, balmy days. Sunshine is the raison d’etre of a sundress. The very existence of a jacket is a summer buzzkill. But you need one. Sorry, but you do. Seasons are unpredictable, heatwaves break, darkness brings a chill. So you definitely have to put some thought into a summer jacket unless you want your fabulous summer outfits to end up hidden beneath some random hoodie you grabbed off the banister.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Your summer jacket needs to do two things. It needs to keep you warm and dry when the weather turns chilly or wet. And somehow, at the same time, it needs to keep your summer vibe bouncing along, rather than kill the mood. Like I said: tricky.The vibe works best when the jacket is deliberately mismatched, a contrast to the summery pieces beneathThe most common mistake we make is to buy a summer jacket that is all summer and not enough jacket. Case in point: I once bought a jacket made of broderie anglaise. I was young and foolish, but still, what on earth was I thinking? In the changing room mirror, it paid visual lip service to the concept of jacket-wearing. The problem was, once I got outside, it wasn’t actually warm.View image in fullscreenAlexa Chung at Glastonbury in a waxed Barbour jacket.Photograph: Wenn/AlamyThe most iconic summer jacket looks are where the jacket is there to do a job. It feels like a simple, low-key foil to summery clothes. I’m thinking of Alexa Chung at Glastonbury, in a waxed Barbour jacket over hotpants and bare legs. I’m thinking of Marilyn Monroe, hugging a sturdy Lee Storm Rider denim jacket over her flimsy white blouse on the set of The Misfits. The vibe works best when the jacket is deliberately mismatched, a contrast to the summery pieces beneath. You know that thing when you sling a tuxedo jacket – yours or someone else’s – over your party dress to walk home? That.A Barbour jacket still works. I love my Barbour and will be once again wearing it at Glastonbury this year – the classics are classics for a reason, after all. And a denim jacket can be a brilliant holiday piece: it has pockets; blue denim is basically a neutral, so the colour works with everything; you can shove it on a luggage rack and it won’t crumple, and the texture is a nice contrast over beachy crochet or linen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The barn jacket (squared off and contrast-collaredlike this one by H&M) works for exactly the same reason a Barbour jacket does, so if you invested in one this winter, you are in clover. The leather blouson (roomy at the shoulders and sleeves, collared, and gathered at the hip) is the more lo-fi cousin of the biker jacket. Your reference here is either John Nettles in Bergerac, or Justin and Hailey Bieber on a courtside date night, depending on your vintage. At the most recent round of shows, the slightly geezerish leather blouson was edging out the blazer as the look to be seen scooting around town in, accessorised with a slicked-back bun and a banana-shaped bag under one arm.View image in fullscreenMarilyn Monroe on the Set of The Misfits in a Lee Storm Rider denim jacket.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveThe haute anorak,like this onefrom Iets Frans, meanwhile, is exactly what it sounds like: a raincoat, but fancy. A raincoat like this which has main character energy is also a smart choice if not getting your hair wet in the rain is of equal concern to you as keeping warm. With Oasis back on stage any minute, this is the perfect moment to pull out your most obnoxious anorak. Wear it zipped to the chin for extra attitude.A caveat to this. None of it is going to work if you are going to, say, a wedding. For that you need a summer jacket that harmonises sweetly with your outfit, rather than riffing off it. A sleeveless dress with a matching jacket is a summer occasion investment worth considering here.

Changing my hairstyle has never just been about fashion – what it symbolises culturally runs far deeperPrecious AdesinaWed 18 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 03.01 EDTShareAt the start of 2023, a couple of months after a trip to Jamaica with friends, where we spoke extensively about our hair, I made my first new year resolution in more than a decade. I was going to try a wider variety of hairstyles. For most of my 20s, I had two styles: long, dark, medium-sizedbox braids(where hair is divided into square sections, and each is then braided into a single plait) or, veryoccasionally, a weave.Now, I decided, I would switch things up – whether trying a new colour, length or type of braid.This may not seem groundbreaking but for me it genuinely was. It was never just about hair, it ran deeper than that. I had come to realise that my own understanding of stereotypes about Black women had been learned from years of experiencing microaggressions: from comments on how good my English was, despite being British, or being followed around supermarkets by security guards – as well as seeing how women who looked like me were portrayed on TV. Without my knowing, on some level, I had become increasingly conscious of the “vibe” I was giving off, before I even spoke. This, in turn, had influenced my hair, dress sense, and, at times, my very behaviour. I wanted to break free from internalised prejudices I didn’t even realise I had.Growing up in the UK, my hair was my way of trying to minimise false assumptions about me based solely on the colour of my skin. Throughout my 20s, the styles I went for were “safe”, nothing that could be misconstrued as conforming to some sort of stereotype, such as being “messy”, unkempt, or even unclean. Society is already unfairly rigged against Black women:more than two in three Black professionals have experienced racial prejudice at work, and Black women are considered theleast desirable on dating apps. Why give society another excuse to treat me unfairly?Emma Dabiri, an Irish academic and author of the 2019 bookDon’t Touch My Hair, also feels a shift in how others engage with her when she wears different styles. With straight-back cornrows, she is “treated more aggressively by people,” she says. But beyond hostility alone, “the difference in how I’m treated when I have my afro v goddess braids, a style which is long and conforms to established notions of femininity, is night and day,” too, she adds. Goddess braids see strands of hair added to plaits to create a long wavy flowing effect. Natural black hair “generally grows up rather than down,” she says, which doesn’t fit into “a western construction of femininity that has now been spread all over the world.”View image in fullscreenMesmerising … Emma Dabiri’s Fulani braids.Photograph: TiktokThenatural hair movement, which saw Black women embrace their hair texture rather than straightening it, originated in the US during the 1960s. At the time, the movement centred on wearing an afro and was on a small scale, often limited to homemade hair products.It had a resurgence in the early 00s, though, thanks to technological advancements and to an extent, social media, and online tutorials. At the same time, there was an increasing awareness of the dangers of products that were once widely recommendedwhich have been linked to severe health problems. For better or worse, new products appeared on the market which seemed to reflect not simply an acceptance of Black hair, but an embrace.93% of Black people in the UK have faced microaggressions related to their afro hairMany women used this as an opportunity to embrace new styles. In 2009,Solange Knowles, did the Big Chop, a term used in Black communities to define a dramatic haircut one does to get rid of chemically processed or damaged hair. She has since become known for platinum blonde braids and a full head of beads. But, in turn, this embrace of textured hair came with unwanted comments, touching and judgment, perfectly exemplified by Knowles’s subsequent song Don’t Touch My Hair in 2016. Indeed, 93% of Black people in the UK have faced microaggressions related to their afro hair,according to a 2023 study. However, Dabiri says: “We’re seeing a shift back towards hairstyles that conform to Eurocentric beauty standards.”According toSt Clair Detrick-Jules, author of My Beautiful Black Hair, which features more than 100 first-person accounts from Black women on their hair, texturism – discrimination against someone based on their hair texture often under the premise that hair that more closely resembles a white person’s is more desirable – is a prevailing issue in Black communities. “Even within the natural hair movement, within our own community, people with looser curl patterns are considered more beautiful, attractive, or professional,” she says. Dabiri agrees: “We have to develop a genuine love for Black hair that is not long, that is not curly, that is tightly coiled.”As a child, my mother embraced my natural hair and encouraged me to try a variety of looks. That all came to a halt in my teens when hairdressers began refusing to do my hair because it was “too afro-y” and, therefore, in their eyes, too difficult to manage. This is all the more eye-opening when you consider that I grew up in east London, a place seemingly known for its diversity. I remember a white male teacher calling me into his office to explain why he thought my hairstyle wasn’t nice. Hair mishaps are a rite of passage for most teenagers – but a bun with a fringe is hardly a reason to be taken aside. Yet even to this day, Black girlsare still more likely to be sent home for “inappropriate” hair. On some level, I must have internalised what he said though; relaxing my hair and putting it into “neat” braids became my go-to style for years.View image in fullscreenEmbracing more Afrocentric hairstyles … Michelle Obama.Photograph: Yen Duong/ReutersFor me it wasn’t until 2019, when I saw a video of Dabiri in a style known as Fulani braids, a mixture of cornrows and single plaits, which she wore with brown and blond hair extensions, that things changed. In the video, she explained the term“blackfishing” for i-D magazine. Mesmerised by the mixture of natural and gold colours, I did the same to my own hair.That same year, Dabiri releasedDon’t Touch My Hair, a series of essays on Black women and hair. In it, she wrote: “In our desire to see our own beauty acknowledged, we forget that the beauty regime is an oppressive construct designed to keep women in a state of heightened insecurity.” Six years later, Dabiri says: “When I wrote that book, I felt very optimistic about many things. It was just a different era and I’m glad I wrote it then.”Detrick-Jules says “representation really does matter, and there have been positive changes,” pointing out two notable examples of women in the public eye wearing their natural hair: Michelle Obama, who “started embracing more Afrocentric hairstyles” after leaving the White House, andViola Davisin the American legal drama How to Get Away with Murder, where her character, “takes her wig off and reveals her natural hair.”It’s important for people to see somebody like them in the mainstream with cornrows or even a big 'fro“It’s not that I think celebrities are superior, but they have such a huge impact on how we, especially as women, perceive ourselves and our beauty,” she adds. The fact that a new crop of hair brands by and for Black women, which includesCécred by Beyoncéand Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross, have made it into the mass market is not insignificant.Looking back, my copying Dabiri’s hairstyle is a prime example. My hairstyle had been intransigent for years. All it took was for someone I admire, and who looked like me, to push me in a new direction. “It just goes to show that you never know what will influence someone,” Dabiri says. “It’s important for people to see somebody like them in the mainstream with cornrows or even a big 'fro.” Detrick-Jules adds: “We also see it on an everyday level. The more you see your Black female teachers with natural hair, for example, it has a positive upward spiral – a domino effect.”Community helps too.Charlotte Mensah, founder of the award-winning salon Hair Lounge on Portobello Road, west London, remembers the joy she felt on seeing a Black female employee at Google “confidently wearing a beautiful full head of auburn faux locs,” a dreadlock-style look which involves blending synthetic hair extensions with natural hair and which felt happily unexpected in this setting. “Few things have made me smile as much this year,” says Mensah. “A style that might once have been dismissed as ostentatious was being worn proudly at one of the largest corporations in the world.”When I was a teenager, it was hard to find extensions that properly emulated the look of natural hair let alone salons that catered to it. But during the pandemic, when I was thrust into doing my own hair again, I realised things had changed. I even tried a wig for the first time. Clients atA-list Lace Hair, a shop in West Kensington founded in 2009, include Naomi Campbell, Knowles – and now me. The brown wavy mid-length wig allowed me to put my hair in a protective style underneath (a technique used to shield hair from environmental and styling stress).View image in fullscreenThe braids that started it all …“Over the past 15 years, I’ve seen a remarkable shift in how our clients view wigs,” says founder Antonia Okonma Shittu. “What once may have been seen as a necessity for managing afro-textured hair, or adhering to professional standards, has evolved into an empowering form of artistry.” Wigs, she says, “are deeply emotive for many Black women because they represent more than just a styling choice – they’re tools of self-expression, reinvention, and empowerment.”As I gained confidence in my ability to look after my natural hair, and grew out the chemically altered parts, I then began wearing afro-textured hair extensions byRuka Hair. The hair looked so close to my own that it essentially enhanced my afro, adding length rather than truncating it “Growing up and navigating the beauty industry as a Black woman, I constantly felt excluded,” says one of the founders, Tendai Moyo, who knew something had to change when she realised that this wasn’t just her struggle “but a universal pain point for Black women.”Reflecting on how I styled and treated my hair all these years has allowed me to unlearn a lifetime of being told that my Blackness made me less beautiful, less equipped for the job, less worthy of a Tinder match. I still love my braids – my weaves, too. Funnily enough, when I recently got my hair done (the style you see in this piece), I went for the braids that started it all, but now they take on a new meaning for me, one that doesn’t include beauty standards designed for me to fail.Explore more on these topicsBeautyBlack British cultureWomen's hairfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It existed for aeons, with the best of them (Urban Decay’sAll Nighter, £29.50, which still has second-to-none longevity) rarely threatened by anything new. But countless sprays have launched in the past year, all of them promising to significantly increase the lifespan of makeup.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s an argument that “fixing sprays” and “setting sprays” have different purposes (locking down makeup versus providing a more unified, less powdery finish, respectively), but I dismiss it because it’s based on the generous assumption that the marketeers who name products according to popular Google search terms give a hoot for semantic nuance. Here, I mean sprays that do all of the above, drastically reducing makeup fade and wear, even during dancing, hot flushing or perspiring.My favourite in recent years is Charlotte Tilbury’sAirbrush FlawlessSettingSpray(£32), since it best combines staying power with a natural, complexion-enhancing look. It scores extra points for its ability to stay smooth when powder or an evening makeup change is later applied over the top.When I arrived for a 16-hour day and realised I’d forgotten to apply this spray, I went to buy oneBut giving it a run for its money is Fenty Beauty’s newYou Mist(£28). This has a finer spray, no fragrance and comparable staying power. It doesn’t have the same satiny look, but is similar in that it doesn’t alter the texture of makeup. It’s a fantastic product upon which I’ve become so dependent that last month, when I arrived in London for a 16-hour day and realised I’d forgotten to apply it, I went straight to Boots to buy one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The lasting effect of L’Oreal’sInfallible 3-SecondSettingMist(£9.99) is phenomenal, but it is pipped by the Milani because it smells a bit too much like hairspray.If you find setting sprays feel too wet upon application, Kosas’s newCloud Set AirySetting+SmoothingMist(£32), does exactly what it says on the pack.

The Frick Collection in New York and Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom at theMusée Carnavaletin Paris both hum with a timeless energy that transcends the exhibits on display.The Little Museum of Dublinis also such a space.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The modern world disappears and I imagine myself back in Georgian times, when this red-bricked terrace was built along with so many of the beautiful squares and parks throughout the city centre.DublinerTrevor Whitepersuaded Dublin city council to lend him this building back in 2011 to open the first museum in the city dedicated to all things Dublin. Armed with a great idea and no collection, he took to the airwaves and asked the listeners of the belovedMarian Finucane show on RTÉ(Ireland’s national broadcaster) to trawl through their attics and cupboards for one-of-a-kind curiosities and mementoes relating to the Irish capital.Armed with a great idea and no collection, Trevor White asked RTE radio listeners to trawl through their cupboards for curiosities relating to DublinMore than 1,000 exhibits flooded in, ranging from a pair of Bono’s iconic sunglasses to a ticket for the only Dublin concerts the Beatles played, in 1963. James Joyce’s death mask was donated along with a first edition of Ulysses. A bottle of unopened lemonade rescued from the wreck of a mail boat torpedoed off Dublin during the first world war was offered for display coupled with an unopened jar of Sudocrem from 1931 (the antiseptic cream was invented in the city). A 1980s ledger from a nearby Magdalene laundry (where pregnant, unmarried women were forced into servitude) was unearthed with listed clients including the president’s residence and state agencies. All the items were carefully curated according to the decade of their provenance and exhibited throughout the museum’s high-ceilinged rooms.The museum became an immediate hit with locals and visitors and more than a million people have taken the 29-minute guided tour of the exhibits over the past 14 years. Tripadvisor rates it as thethird best visitor attraction in Ireland, and the12th best in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe U2 room includes a photo of the band members when they were schoolmates.Photograph: Gintaras VarnagysI often find myself there, early on a Sunday morning, when very little else is open in the city, sitting in the recreation of Irish Times editor Bertie Smyllie’s office on the top floor with views across Stephen’s Green to the Dublin mountains. Eccentric Bertie pedalled his bicycle to the newspaper until 1954 with a typewriter balanced on his handlebars. He was responsible for championing many of Ireland’s greatest writers including Patrick Kavanagh and Flann O’Brien. Next door, in the U2 room, I like to pick out the teenage incarnations of the band from a black-and-white class photo at Mount Temple, the school where they famously first met as schoolboys. This photo, just like this museum as a whole, brings a sense that the past can still be accessed.As visitor numbers rocketed, the museum sought funding to expand its exhibits and shop into the basement and garden and to install a long-overdue lift to provide universal access to all the floors. After a year of renovations, at a cost of €4.3m, the museum reopened on 5 June with a new library and archive, a screening room and a new exhibition of fearless women snaking up the stairwell, taking its cue from a quote by President Mary Robinson: “I was elected by the women of Ireland, who instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the system.”One of the world’s finest doll’s houses has taken up residence on the first floorOne of the world’s finest doll’s houses has taken up residence on the first floor. Modelled on Leinster House round the corner, the seat of the Irish government, Tara’s Palace took more than 20 years to build and it has been given to the museum along with a slew of new donations to celebrate the reopening. President Mary McAleese has sent in her rosary beads; the original maquette for the sculpture of singer Luke Kelly (of the Dubliners fame) in the Docklands has found a perch; and a whole room of wild and wonderful taxidermied animals with a Dublin connection have taken up residence.View image in fullscreenThe death mask of celebrated Irish author James Joyce.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyIn 1988, Dublin marked the millennium of its founding with a year-long celebration of civic events. Many homes in the city still proudly display a famous milk bottle from this time, embossed with the Dublin City coat of arms, and you can find one of these on a mantelpiece at the museum. After decades of neglect and inner-city dereliction, 1988 marked a sea change in how many Dubliners viewed their capital. Trevor White also traces the igniting of his passion for Dublin to this time. Everything he has worked for at the Little Museum of Dublin, along with his equally passionate team, has been designed to inspire an ongoing appreciation and love of Dublin, the little city that could.Little Museum of Dublinis open9.30am to 5pm, with the guided tourbookable for€18,littlemuseum.ieExplore more on these topicsDublin holidaysIreland holidaysCultural tripsMuseumsEurope holidaysCity breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I could be as fierce as I wanted. Those three minutes set me freeKia AbdullahWed 18 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTShareOn meeting me, you would never guess that I used to be an angry person. I’m talkative, sociable and self-possessed – but for nearly 20 years I lived with a quiet fury. It started with my parents, whose strict conservatism restricted everything in my life: what I ate, what I wore, where I went, what I thought. As immigrants from Bangladesh, they believed that control was the best way to protect their daughters, but it suffocated me.I had to fight to go to university – for all the things that men in my community were given as a right. At first, my anger felt ambient – mild and ever-present – but it became something harder, more bitter, when I was pressured into an arranged marriage at the age of 24.The marriage lasted days, but the fallout lasted decades. I remember researching a magazine feature years later and speaking to a relationship expert who referenced my “forced marriage”. I was quick to jump in and say: “It was arranged; not forced.” She tilted her head gently and said, “An arranged marriage you did not want?” It was the first time I realised how angry I was.My anger manifested in different ways. I was irritable and snappy with my mother, emotionally guarded in relationships, and fiercely self-sufficient when it came to money. I never again wanted to be in a situation I could not easily escape.I considered therapy, but the cultural context in which I grew up does not sit easily with western techniques. I can’t imagine explaining my anger to my mother or expecting some form of apology. Instead, I accepted that anger was something I would just have to live with.View image in fullscreen‘Hit harder!’ … Kia with her coach, Mickey Cunningham, 2025.Photograph: Justin PolkeyThen, in the spring of 2023, I walked into a boxing gym. I had never boxed before but I wanted to try it so that I could depict it accurately in the novel I was writing. I remember standing sheepishly by the ring at Mickey’sBoxingGym in east London while the eponymous Mickey finished his morning class.He noticed me and told me to warm up ahead of our one-to-one session. I had never been in a gym before, let alone a boxing one, and had no idea how to “warm up”. I retreated around the corner, out of view, and fiddled with my phone instead. As the morning class filtered out, I gingerly returned to the ring.We began with some basic footwork and the fundamental punches: the jab, the cross, the hook. We worked in three-minute “rounds”, punctuated by 30-second breaks, all announced by a digital bell.Midway through the session, we moved on to the pads. Mickey held up two padded mitts and called out different combinations – patterns of punches I had to land on the mitts. As I punched, he called out instructions – “keep your chin down”, “let me hear you breathe”, “hide behind your shoulder” – and then came the moment that changed things for me.“Hit harder,” he instructed. I punched. “Harder!” I punched again, the sweat dripping off me. “Harder! Use your power!” I punched again with all my strength. “Let me hear you!” he shouted.I cried out loud as I punched – an ugly, guttural sound, so different to everything I’d been taught. In that moment, I didn’t have to be demure, delicate or diplomatic. I could be as fierce and angry as I wanted. I pounded the pads, shouting out with each punch. Over the course of those three minutes, I felt my anger lift: the years, maybedecades, of it.The bell sounded and I crumpled on to the ropes, sweaty and euphoric. I was emotional as I took off my gloves. I felt lighter, freer, unchained from something heavy.I went home and told my partner: “I think I’ve finally found my sport.” This was revelatory. South-Asian women are one of the least active demographics in the UK and the idea of finding “my sport” – and that sport being boxing – felt somehow absurd.The two sessions I had booked for research turned into two years of boxing. As a result, I am much calmer, happier and more patient. Best of all, I no longer dread spending time with my mother. Where once I found it emotionally draining, I now know that an hour in the gym will re-energise me. Boxing has given me a sense of equilibrium that was missing for so much of my life. After decades of battling my anger, I have finally found some peace.The guys at the gym often ask if I’ll ever take part in a boxing fight. They say that, after two years of training for three to four sessions a week, with dozens of sparring partners, I’m ready to get in the ring for real. I smile and tell them that I only box for fun. What I don’t say is that I’ve already won the longest fight of my life.What Happens in the Darkby Kia Abdullah is published 19 JuneExplore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meBoxingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dissidents who spoke to the Guardian alleged he was subjected to torture during his imprisonment.It was the first high-profile killing of a journalist by the Saudi state since the 2018 murder ofJamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and prominent critic of the Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, who was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and murdered by Saudi agents. A UN report concluded that the murder was an extrajudicial killing by the state, and an intelligence assessment released by then president Joe Biden in 2021 concluded that Prince Mohammed approved the murder.But the circumstances around that murder and al-Jasser’s killing, and the international response to it, are markedly different. Most dissidents and experts who followed al-Jasser’s case say he was probably detained by Saudi authorities in 2018 after being identified as the writer behind a popular anonymous Twitter account that accused the Saudi royal family of corruption and human rights abuses.In public, al-Jasser was the founder of the news blog Al-Mashhad Al-Saudi (The Saudi Scene), which press freedom group Reporters Without Borders said regularly addressed topics such as women’s rights and Palestine. But it was the account on what was then known as Twitter (and now as X) that is believed to have riled Saudi authorities and led to his arrest during a broader crackdown on dissent.“Turki had two Twitter accounts. While he was vocal using his real name, he was even more satirical and vocal with the other account, which was in the crosshairs of the Saudi government,” says Abdullah Alaoudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at Middle East Democracy Center. “The government assumed his and other anonymous Twitter accounts were part of a coordinated effort and delusional conspiracy to topple the Saudi government.”The Saudi government gained access to the real identities and IP addresses behind thousands of anonymous Twitter accounts following Saudi agents’ infiltration of the company in 2014-2015. The Department of Justicecharged two former Twitter employees and a Saudi nationalin the plot. Ahmad Abouammo was found guilty by a federal jury of fraud, conspiracy, acting as a foreign agent for bribes, and conveying user information to the kingdom on behalf of the royal family. At the time, assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen of the justice department’s national security division, said the guilty verdict showed the justice department wouldhold accountable anyonewho aids “hostile regimes in extending their reach to our shores”. Two other indicted men fled to Saudi Arabia before they could be arrested.A Twitter spokesperson said in 2021 that it acted swiftly at the time of the incident when it learned there were malicious actors accessing Twitter user data. That view has been challenged by the family of another man who was arrested after the Twitter breach, who believe the social media platform is at least partly responsible for dissidents’ arrests.Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, a former aid worker, was arrested in 2018 and sentenced three years later to 20 years in prison and a 20-year travel ban. He is alleged to have maintained an anonymous account that mocked the kingdom’s leaders.“They broke his hand, smashed his fingers, saying this is the hand you tweet with,” Areej al-Sadhantold CBS Newsin a 2023 interview. “They tortured him with electric shocks, beating and sleep deprivation.”Reporters Without Borders said al-Jasser was the first journalist to be sentenced to death and executed in Saudi under the rule ofMohammed bin Salman, and the second in the world since 2020, when the Amadnews director, Ruhollah Zam, was put to death in Iran.The state department did not respond to a request for comment.When the Saudi crown prince was asked by Fox News’s Brett Baier in 2023 about a case in which a Saudi court sentenced a man – Mohammed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi – to death for posts on X and his YouTube activity, Prince Mohammed blamed “laws” in the kingdom and said he was doing his best to “change them”.“Do we have bad laws? Yes. We are changing that, yes,” he said. Asked whether al-Ghamdi would ultimately be killed Prince Mohammed said: “I’m hoping that in the next phase of trials, the judge there is more experienced, and they might look at it totally different.”Al-Ghamdi’s death sentence was later commuted.Legal scholars have pointed out that the crown prince could legally have intervened in al-Jasser’s own execution. Under Saudi law the crown prince or the king must approve every execution.The Saudi government has been approached for comment.“With Jasser’s execution, Mohammed bin Salman has once again shown us that he remains a vindictive, thin-skinned tyrant who kills people who criticize him,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Dawn, a pro-democracy group founded by Khashoggi.“He has weaponized the Saudi judiciary to prosecute and execute a Saudi man under the country’s bogus counter-terrorism law exclusively because of his critical commentary about the country on social media. Western governments are eager to pretend that MBS has morphed into some kind of reputable statesman, but it’s hard to reform a sociopathic autocrat with zero domestic guardrails.”This article was amended on 18 June 2025 to clarify that the US intelligence assessment of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was released by Joe Biden in 2021, not in 2020, as we originally said.Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaMohammed bin SalmannewsShareReuse this content"

Simply making something on a ship stop working could lead to a blackout on a vessel or systems malfunctioning, says Lars Benjamin Vold, Norma Cyber’s managing director.And there is mounting evidence that states are looking to harness these powers against their adversaries at sea.View image in fullscreenAn oil tanker pumping ballast water, one of the functions that could be hit in a cyber-attack.Photograph: Islandstock/AlamyIran is already understood to have researched how to use cyber-attacks to disrupt ballast systems – which pump water into vessels to ensure stability–to affect ships and satellite systems. And April saw an unprecedented hack that allegedly took out116 Iranian Vsat modems– used in satellite communication by ships – simultaneously.“When you talk about nation states, it is about their will to do something,” says Vold.While potential “threat actors” such as Russia and China have extensive capabilities, these also have to align with their mission, which could change at any time.So while the threat level has been relatively consistent, maritime vulnerabilities are on the rise. “Things are digitalising more and more, so there are more potential ways in,” says Vold.Norma Cyber has also reported civilian vessels such as fishing boats, research ships and cargo vessels being used for espionage in the Baltic, north Atlantic and the Arctic. USB devices have also been used to infiltrate maritime systems, including by a China-linked threat actor calledMustang Panda.Last year, Norma Cyber noted 239 disruptive cyber-attacks on the maritime sector, with the pro-Russian group NoName057(16) behind most of them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When crews come up against jamming of satellite navigation systems in the Baltic – Finland has accused Russia of being behind such disruptions – they are left with little option but to navigate without it. “Good seamanship is the best mitigation measure,” says Vold.But as well as the invisible threats of the digital world, the maritime industry is also facing unprecedented physical problems. Vladimir Putin’sgrowing shadow fleetof hundreds of unregulated vessels carrying sanctioned crude oil from Russia to predominantly China and India poses a growing threat to the environment and the global shipping infrastructure.The shadow fleet is made up of ageing oil tankers, the identities of which are hidden to help circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow. Estimates oftheir number range from 600to 900 vessels, according to some sources.View image in fullscreenFinnish authorities investigated Russia’s shadow fleet oil tanker Eagle S forthe suspected ‘sabotage’of a power cable in December 2024.Photograph: Finnish Border Guard/AFP/GettyThreats to ships can also come from within. Engines, elevators and water purification systems are all potential targets on board. And with15% of crew membersinternationally either Ukrainian or Russian, the composition of crews on ships has taken on new significance since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.“If you have a Russian captain on a ship carrying aid to Ukraine, those don’t mix that well, right?” says Svein Ringbakken, managing director of DNK. “So those are sensitives that are being addressed in the industry.”View image in fullscreenLine Falkenberg Ollestad, adviser to the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and an expert on Russia’s shadow fleet.Photograph: Sara Aarøen Lien/The GuardianLine Falkenberg Ollestad, an adviser at the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and an expert on the shadow fleet, fears its growing presence is creating a “parallel fleet” of underinsured substandard ships operating on the sidelines, where they do not know what is happening on board or the conditions and wages of its seafarers.If there were to be an environmental incident on one of the vessels, she says, it also poses a threat to Norway’s coastline. Some ships listed as sanctioned by the US are still operating, she says. Most of them are at least 15 years old. “Our concern is that the situation is getting worse the longer it continues.”‘Losing hope with every day that passes’: torment of the ships’ crews abandoned at seaRead moreAnother big question, she adds, is whether the whole situation has already gone too far to come back from.“Is the shadow fleet that is operating outside the western jurisdictions the new way? Or can we reverse this?” Ollestad asks. “And the answer is: we don’t know.”View image in fullscreenTwo rubber ducks keep a close watch over Norma Cyber’s security room.Photograph: Sara Aarøen Lien/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSeascape: the state of our oceansShipping industryCybercrimeNorwayEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The principle behind the right to an assisted death is that one should be entitled to determine the time and manner of one’s passing.If one were always to prioritise the right to good medical care above the right to have control over one’s death, it is unlikely that assisted dying would ever be legalised, as there will always be some medical care for somebody that could be better funded. But that is to choose to prioritise one principle over another.Quite simply, MPs need to decide whether, as a matter of principle and within strict limits, a person should be entitled to determine the time and manner of their own death. Implementation of that principle will be difficult in just the same way as the implementation in law and practice of any principle. The numerous revisions to the assisted dying bill reflect that difficulty, but do nothing to undermine the principle behind the bill.Dr Alistair MacdonaldHuddersfield, West YorkshireGordon Brown states that“every year, more than600,000 peopledie in the UK. It is estimated that between 75% and 90% of them should have thebenefit of palliative care, and that100,000 terminally ill peopledo not receive the palliative care they need.” I agree that this is a dreadful situation. But I don’t see the logic in denying an assisted death to those who meet all the safeguards in the bill and do not want to suffer due to the shortage of palliative care. This seems to be punishing individuals because successive governments have failed to sort out sufficient funding for palliative care.He also states that “we should not deny terminally ill people the freedom to choose. But there is no effective freedom to choose if the alternative option, the freedom to draw on high-quality end-of-life care, is not available.” Perhaps he should put himself in the shoes of someone whose pain cannot be relieved even by high-quality end-of-life care, or someone with a neurodegenerative disease where palliative care cannot always help. For these people, there is no other option but to continue suffering. Where is the compassion in saying: “Sorry, you can’t have an assisted death until we have sorted out palliative care for all?”Katy BarnettLondonWhile we can all agree withGordon Brownthat hospice and palliative care need more funding I don’t feel that this is an argument against assisted dying. Palliative care doesn’t always work. My son died in his local hospice with the highest level of palliative care available. I was with him at his admission when the consultant said: “I will not be able to control your pain well enough for you to sleep.” This turned out to be the case and he suffered horribly for several weeks. I believe that assisted dying doesn’t shorten life, it shortens death.In his article, Brown worries about people being coerced by their families. In my 17 years as a nurse I looked after many dying patients and don’t remember any incidence of a family wanting to speed the process (unless their loved one was clearly suffering). It was usually the opposite, with the patient ready to go and the family pleading with the doctors to try anything else to keep them alive.Brown argues that taking part in assisted dying would change the role of the medical profession from one of purely caregiving, but I disagree. I always did my utmost to minimise my patients’ suffering and if the ability to shorten that suffering had been available, I would have felt it to be wholly appropriate to my caring role.Amanda McGeeRedcar, North YorkshireThank you, Gordon Brown, for stating cogently why MPs should reject the assisted dying bill at the free vote on Friday. If the vote is passed, some of the responsibility for when terminally ill people die will pass from palliative care teams and GPs to lawyers. This will just make it more expensive and conflictual, and will deflect from the need to invest in palliative care that Brown pinpoints.Legislators, and people approaching death who fear losing control, should read the literature on shared decision-making, which is basically how GPs interact with patients. If used correctly, it is just as empowering as “patient choice” and obviates the need for lethal injection. Shared decision-making could become the legal framework for end-of-life care decisions, if accompanied by expert, empathic and properly funded primary care and palliative care.Dr Jeremy SeymourSheffieldThank you, Gordon Brown, for wisely and eruditely voicing concerns with the assisted dying bill. Having just retired from NHS primary care service in a deprived area, I have witnessed the progress over 40 years of palliative care services, which remain hamstrung by an unfair funding model. This will not change if the impetus to provide universality is removed by focusing on the right to die. A doctor’s oath to do no harm does not, in my view, extend to ending life.Dr Martin BelshamThetford, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Tens of thousands of experts have been trained since, and have attended university-certified programmes. Other providers have followed suit.There are hundreds of cases every year where experts have been involved without any problems, and many experts have assisted by giving evidence to overturn wrong convictions. Suggesting expert witnesses are the weakest link in the system is perhaps unfair. Solicitors must exercise due diligence in the selection and instruction of experts to make sure that they have the right expert for the issues in dispute and that any expert they instruct is aware of the full extent of their legal obligations.Experts can be cross-examined on their qualifications and experience, and judges can determine whether their evidence is admissible.

I am for ever grateful to have been a student at BSix. I came in the UK as an unaccompanied minor aged 16 and English isn’t my first language. I didn’t understand a word of it. A friend of mine helped me get into BSix to learn English in January 2007 – the course was called English as a second language (Esol) then.The staff really supported me until I was confident enough to read, write, listen to and speak English. After a year, I was given the opportunity to do my BTec first diploma in sciences, equivalent toGCSEs, and GCSE English and maths.Afterwards, I did my BTec national diploma in sciences for two years, equivalent to AS and A2, which enabled me to go to university to study biomedical sciences and then further my studies in adult nursing. I am currently working as a theatre nurse in Eastbourne district general hospital.I would say that BSix gives great opportunities to young people from different backgrounds to get basic requirements to further their studies in the UK. It hugely contributes to our integration into British society and we later contribute positively towards the development of the country.Fatim NikoulareEastbourne, East SussexExplore more on these topicsEducationA-levelsGCSEsExamsSchoolsNursinglettersShareReuse this content"

However, as a precautionary measure it was assessing health workers and close contacts to offer vaccination where necessary.Rabies is a deadly virus spread via the saliva of infected animals, and people usually contract it after being bitten.Animals such as cows, cats and foxes can carry the virus but, in some countries, stray dogs are the most likely to spread rabies to humans.Once a person shows signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal, but treating a wound immediately after being bitten may prevent death.The first symptoms can be similar to flu, while later symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, agitation, anxiety, difficulty swallowing and excessive saliva.The case is only the seventh time this millennium that a person in the UK has been diagnosed with rabies after exposure to an infected animal. All cases started with the person becoming infected abroad.In the UK rabies is not found in wild or domestic animals and, aside from cases linked to individuals being bitten by bats, which can carry a rabies-like virus, there has not been a reported case of a person becoming infected in the UK from an animal other than a bat since 1902.Inflected people may develop fears over such things as swallowing drinks and can experience hallucinations and paralysis.Dr Katherine Russell, the head of emerging infections and zoonoses at the UKHSA, said: “I would like to extend my condolences to this individual’s family at this time.“If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal in a country where rabies is found, then you should wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay in order to get post-exposure treatment to prevent rabies.”Explore more on these topicsYorkshireHealthEnglandAnimalsMoroccoAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Local people complain that their fishing nets, waterways and beaches are clogged with synthetic fast-fashion garments exported to Ghana from the UK and the rest of Europe.video clipIn a third dump on the banks of the river leading to the conservation site, Unearthed reporters found garments from M&S, Zara, H&M and Primark.The fashion labels acknowledged that the industry faces challenges in processing textile waste. M&S, George and Primark said they ran take-back schemes intended to help address the issue. H&M, Zara and George said they would support an extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework to hold labels accountable for their products’ end-of-life impact.The global fast-fashion overspill has overwhelmed Ghana’s capital, Accra, with tangled clothes carpeting city beaches and lining canals.View image in fullscreenTextile waste on the beach at Jamestown in Accra.Photograph: Misper Apawu/The GuardianNew dump sites are springing up beyond urban areas and in conservation areas that are vital for wildlife, the investigation found. Reporters also found textile waste, including UK labels, tangled in vegetation, half-buried in sand, and in waste washed up at a beach resort where a manager said he burned piles of clothes every week.At the heart of Ghana’s used clothing trade is Kantamanto, one of the world’s biggest secondhand clothes markets. It receives more than 1,000 tonnes of clothes every week, but one trader said the quality was worse than it used to be. “In the past, we had good clothes to sell to take care of our families, but these days the used clothes we find in the bales are not fit for resale,” said Mercy Asantewa. “They are poorly made and are already falling apart when we open the bales.”There is only one engineered dump site in the region, and another is being built. The head of Accra’s waste management department, Solomon Noi, calculates that 100 tonnes of garments leave the market daily as waste. The city is able to collect and process just 30 tonnes.1:35Clothes from UK brands found discarded in Ghana wetland dumps – video“The remaining 70 tonnes end up in waste dumps, drains, lagoons, wetlands and the sea and other environmentally sensitive places,” he said.UK consumers discard about 1.5m tonnes of used textiles every year. Many do not get recycled. About 730,000 tonnes a year are incinerated or go into landfills. Of the 650,000 tonnes sent to be reused and recycled, 420,000 – more than two-thirds – are exported. Ghana receives more than any other country.A group ofGhanaian traders visited Brusselsin 2023 and argued that the EU should introduce EPR legislation to hold fashion companies accountable for the end-of-life impact of their products. The UK’s Textile Recyclers Association has asked the government to consider something similar.Ghana’sDensu deltais designated a site of international importance under the intergovernmental Ramsar convention on wetlands. Endangered leatherback and green turtles lay their eggs there, and the mudflats also support rare roseate terns, which migrate from the UK, and curlew sandpipers.View image in fullscreenA man sorts through bales of secondhand clothes at Kantamanto market.Photograph: Misper Apawu/The GuardianUnearthed’s reporters found two recently opened dump sites in the wetland’s protected area and a third dump upstream on the banks of the Densu.Properly engineered landfills include a lined bottom, a system for collecting and treating leachate, groundwater monitoring, gas extraction and a cap system. Drone footage of the Akkaway dump, the newest site, shows a large area of the wetlands where the vegetation had been removed. Piles of waste sit on bare earth, close to lagoons and streams, with no lining or other visible pollution mitigation systems.An official from the local government, the Weija Gbawe municipal assembly, told a reporter that it was in charge of the Akkaway dump and supervised the work there. Siting a new dump site in protected wetlands, however, appears to violate Ghana’s environmental policy and landfill guidelines, and the country’s obligations under the Ramsar convention.The assembly did not respond to a formal request for comment.View image in fullscreenA dump site for secondhand clothes in Accra.Photograph: Muntaka Chasant/Rex/ShutterstockPeople who depend on the wetlands for their livelihoods said they were worried about the impact of the pollution. Seth Tetteh, 31, has lived near the delta for seven years. “It’s only since three years ago that they started dumping theborla[the waste] further upstream. So when you start fishing and cast your net, it brings in fish, clothes and other things, so … the fishermen … find it very tedious,” he said.“Before, you could drink [the river water].

There were “alligators, bush cats … all kinds of birds and rabbits too”, said Ibrahim Sadiq, 19, a student who lives nearby.

Real progress will only come if the industry comes together. ”H&M acknowledged that the industry faced challenges such as a lack of end-of-life solutions and fully scaled recycling solutions for discarded textiles. A spokesperson said: “While this is an industry-wide challenge, we acknowledge our role in contributing to the problem, notably when our products reach markets with inadequate or no waste management or recycling infrastructures.”A spokesperson for Zara’s parent company, Inditex, said Zara would support an EPR policy mandated by the government: “We believe that advancing toward common legislation in this field will establish a unified framework that sets the same rules for all players. We understand that the separate collection of textile waste is the foundation of a circular model. That is why we not only promote new textile recycling technologies but also develop the necessary capabilities to make them feasible.”Next did not respond to a request for comment.Additional reporting by Viola Wohlgemuth and Richa SyalExplore more on these topicsGhanaWasteFashion industryAfricaPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

When these activities are deceptive, clandestine or threatening, they are deemed to be foreign interference,” the report said. “These activities attempt to steer Canada’s positions into alignment with India’s interests on key issues, particularly with respect to how the Indian government perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent homeland that they call Khalistan.”Lawrence Bishnoi: the feared Indian mob boss implicated in Canada killingsRead moreThe report singled out the killing of Nijjar in the British Columbia city of Surrey two years ago, noting investigators had established a “link between agents of the Government of India and criminal networksto sow violent activity in South Asian communities in Canada”.Since becoming prime minister last year, Carney has sought to restore relations withIndia, which cratered after his predecessor accused the Modi government of orchestrating the high-profile assassination. Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.India temporarily stopped issuing visas in Canada and, soon after, Canada expelled six senior diplomats, including the high commissioner, Sanjay Verma. India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner.Carneyinvited Modi to the G7 summit over the objections of Sikh organizations and human-rights activists as well as lawmakers from within his own party,framing the decision as pragmatic step to restore engagement with one of the world’s largest economies.At the time, Carney said there was a “legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced inCanada”.In a joint statement at the conclusion of the G7 summit in Alberta, leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan said they were “deeply concerned by growing reports of transnational repression” amid efforts to “intimidate, harass, harm or coerce individuals or communities outside their borders”.The statement did not name India.Following the meeting, Carney’s office said the two leaders had agreed to return high commissioners to each other’s capital “with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries”.Modi said Canada and India were “dedicated to democratic values” and that the relationship between the two countries was “very important in many ways”.But Carney declined to tell reporters whether he raised the killing of Nijjar during the encounter.Sikhs for Justice, an advocacy organization calling for the establishment of a Sikh homeland in India, issued a statement on Wednesday calling on Carney to provide specifics of his meeting.“Did Prime Minister Carney question Narendra Modi about the role of Indian agents in the assassination of Shaheed Hardeep Singh Nijjar – yes or no?” said Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, chief legal counsel for SJF.Pannun was listed as a key target for India’s campaign of violence andan attempt on his life was foiled by US federal agents.“Accountability for Nijjar’s killing cannot be sidestepped in the name of diplomacy or trade. Diplomatic normalization with the Modi regime must not come at the expense of justice and transparency,” he said.British Columbia’s premier, David Eby, announced on Tuesday that he had asked Carney’s government to designate an Indian criminal gang implicated in the Nijjar killing as a terrorist organization in order to help police tackle extortion cases targeting south Asian businesses in the region.“There are allegations that gangs in India are operating here in our province, and in other provinces, to intimidate and extort business owners,” Eby told reporters.The Bishnoi gang – led by Lawrence Bishnoi from an Indian jail cell – was named by the RCMP as playing a possible role in violent crimes on Canadian soil that have led to diplomatic tensions between Canada and India.“This is a serious step,” Eby said. “We don’t make this recommendation lightly, but this activity strikes at public confidence in the justice system, in our democracy.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyNarendra ModiSikhismAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Cook Islands prime minister Mark Brown didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Relations between other Pacific islands and their larger regional backers Australia and New Zealandhave stumbled over ties with Chinain recent years as Beijing has vied to increase its Pacific sway.On the ground in the Cook Islands, controversial deal with China stirs debateRead moreBut the latest move by New Zealand’s government was striking because it reflected growing friction between two countries with strong constitutional ties – Cook Islands is self-governing but shares a military and passports withNew Zealand– over two countries’ diverging approaches to managing relations with Beijing.News of the NZ$18.2m ($11m) funding halt on Thursday, which emerged only when a Cook Islands news outlet saw its brief mention in a government budget document, is likely to prove difficult for New Zealand’s prime minister, Christopher Luxon, who is inChinafor his first official visit and is due to meet President Xi Jinping this week. Beijing has defended its Cook Islands pacts before, saying in February that the deals were not intended to antagonise New Zealand.In a report tabled in the Cook Islands parliament this week, the public accounts committee registered “concern” about a reduction of NZ$10m ($6m) in the government’s purse, the first known mention of the finance freeze. The money was earmarked for “core sector support”, which funds the Cook Islands’ health, education and tourism sectors – with audits by Wellington on how it’s spent.The money is part of NZ$200m directed to the Cook Islands by New Zealand over the past three years as part of an almost 60-year-old arrangement. The links demand consultation by Cook Islands leaders with Wellington on its agreements with other parties that might affect the relationship and the deals with China were the first serious test of those rules.The Cook Islands, population 15,000, has a large and lucrative exclusive economic zone, with Brown’s government exploring prospects for deep sea mining activity, and Cook Islanders can freely live and work in New Zealand. That prompted dismay in Wellington when officials learned of the raft of agreements Brown signed in February.The agreements didn’t promise security cooperation between Beijing and Cook Islands, but they did pledge more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Not all of the documents Brown signed were released publicly.The spokesperson for New Zealand foreign minister Peters said on Thursday said the agreements illustrated “a gap in understanding” between the governments “about what our special relationship of free association requires”, which included consultation to ensure the preservation of shared interests.The “breadth and content” of the deals and lack of consultation with Wellington about them in advance prompted a review of funding to the Cook Islands, Peters’ office said.“New Zealand has therefore paused these payments and will also not consider significant new funding until the Cook Islands government takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust,” the spokesperson’s statement said.Brown said in February that the deals did not “replace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships.” News of the agreements prompted protests in Avarua led by opposition lawmakers.New Zealand’s latest action was an “entirely avoidable consequence of Cook Islands’ strategic flirtations with China,” said Mihai Sora, analyst with the Australia-based thinktank Lowy Institute.“It’s a bit cute to sign up to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2025 and pretend there is no strategic angle for Beijing, given all the mounting evidence of China’s malign strategic intent in the Pacific,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandCook IslandsPacific islandsAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Thailand has imposed border restrictions with Cambodia in recent days, whileCambodiahas banned Thai films from TV and cinemas, closed a border checkpoint, and cut internet bandwidth fromThailand. Both countries have shortened visas stays for visitors for one another’s citizens.A ban on imports of Thai fruit and vegetables to Cambodia came into effect on Tuesday. This follows an ultimatum by Cambodia’s former leaderHun Sen, who ran the country for almost four decades before handing over to his son in 2023, who said those imports would be blocked unless Thai border restrictions were lifted.On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Cambodians, carrying national flags and pictures of the country’s leaders, took to the streets of Phnom Penh for an official rally to support the government’s stance.View image in fullscreenPeople march in support of the Cambodian government's actions in its recent border dispute with Thailand, in Phnom Penh on Wednesday.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe deputy prime minister, Hun Many, brother of the prime minister, told the crowd the march was “an encouragement and additional energy for the government and our forces”.“When the country faces a threat or any insult, the Cambodian people will not stay still, we will stand up in united spirit,” he said.Cambodia has asked the international court of justice (ICJ) to resolve the border dispute. However,Thailanddoes not accept the court’s jurisdiction and has said it prefers to solve the matter through direct negotiations.The long-running dispute dates back more than a century, to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border.The dispute has, over the years, has repeatedly fanned nationalist sentiments in both countries.

This includes Mom Bei or Chong Bok, an area where the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet, and which was the site of last month’s clash, as well as three ancient temples.A family affair: can Asia break free from the power of its political dynasties?Read more“The royal government of Cambodia will undertake this task with strong determination and high responsibility to protect our territorial integrity and the best interest of the Cambodian people,”prime minister Hun Manetsaid in a statement earlier this week.Hun Manet has added that he wanted to maintain “peace and good cooperation” with Thailand.Cambodia has previously referred the dispute to the ICJ, and in 1962, the court ruled that Preah Vihear, an 11th century Hindu temple, was Cambodian, though it did not rule on the area surrounding it. Cambodia sought a clarification of the ruling in 2011, and in 2013, the ICJ verdict stated that anarea next to the temple was also Cambodia.Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has said the government is committed to protecting Thailand’s sovereignty, and ensuring peace along the border.

The ash column was observed to be grey with thick intensity,” it said, after the alert level was raised.There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties.Geology agency head Muhammad Wafid said residents and tourists should avoid carrying out any activities within at least 7km of the volcano’s crater.Virgin Australia confirmed some flights between Brisbane and Melbourne and Bali were cancelled on Wednesday due to the eruption.Jetstar also cancelled four flights from Australia into Bali on Wednesday morning, while Qantas said it was keeping a “close eye” on the situation with flights scheduled to leave later this afternoon.Air New Zealand cancelled two flights between Bali and Aukland on Wednesday, saying it would “continue to closely monitor” the volcanic ash cloud.“Safety is always our first priority and we will only operate into and out of Denpasar when it is safe to fly,” the airline said.Air India, Singapore’s TigerAir and China’s Juneyao Airlines also cancelled flights “due to volcano”, Bali’s international airport website said.Several domestic AirAsia flights leaving for Labuan Bajo on Flores were also cancelled.“Ngurah Rai is still operating normally but it depends on the flight schedule, but some of the flights are cancelled due to a volcano. It depends on the route and also the airline,” a Bali airport customer service agent who declined to give their name told AFP.Wafid warned of the possibility of hazardous lahar floods – a type of mud or debris flow of volcanic materials – if heavy rain occurs, particularly for communities near to rivers.He also urged residents to wear face masks to protect themselves from volcanic ash.National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesman Abdul Muhari said in a statement late Tuesday that at least one village had to evacuate, without providing numbers, and ash rain was reported in several villages outside the exclusion zone.The spokesman called on residents around the volcano “to evacuate to safe locations” as tremors were still being detected, which indicated ongoing volcanic activity.Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki erupted multiple times in November, killing nine people and forcing thousands to evacuate, as well as the cancellation of scores of international flights to Bali.Laki-Laki, which means man in Indonesian, is twinned with the calmer but taller 1,703m (5,587-foot) volcano named Perempuan, after the Indonesian word for woman.Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”.Explore more on these topicsBaliVolcanoesBali holidaysIndonesiaAir transportAsiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

If only ASX 100 companies are analysed, Wikramanayake is the highest paid CEO.The disparity between what CEOs and average workers earned grew in 2024 compared with the year before, after ASX’s top 100 companies gave their chief executives anear 14% pay rise on average in the 2023-24 financial year. The average worker’s earnings rose 4.6% in the same period, according to theAustralian Bureau of Statistics.Australian CEOs made less in 2023-24 but still earned on average 50 times a typical worker’s wageRead moreThe gap has fallen since 2014, when chief executives were paid 70 timesmore than typical workers, the report found. Average CEO pay in 2024 was only slightly higher than it was in 2014, at $5.7m, whereas ordinary wages rose by nearly a third over the past decade.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLocal chiefs were paid 55 times more than average workers but Australia compared favourably to overseas, where CEO pay packets have soared, according to ACSI’s executive manager of stewardship, Ed John.“We’re probably doing something right in Australia, where we’ve seen a real breakout in CEO pay in other countries,” he said.Chief executives at the top 100 US companies were paid 348 times the median American employee in 2024, or more than US$33m (A$51m) on average, according to research from analytics firmEquilar using a different methodology.The 100 biggest British companies paid their CEOs 78 times more than their median employees, the UK’s HighPayCentre campaign grouprevealed on Monday.Table of CEO payAustralian investors and company boards have protested against big bonuses put forward by numerous companies in recent years, includingQantas,WoolworthsandAMP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another three US-based businesses cracked the top 20.“We wouldn’t be surprised to see a number of those names continue to be represented in that list,” John said.“[But] we don’t want to see Australian companies follow that same path, particularly where these large bonuses don’t actually match company performance.”ResMed’s Farrell had held the top-paid position the previous year, with $47m pay, but took a cut to $20m after shares in the company tumbled in value over the prospectweight loss drugs would eradicate the needfor Resmed’s sleep apnoea devices.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsExecutive payBusinessNews CorporationBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it continued to perform strongly in its citations per faculty and global engagement, including international faculty members.Calderon said the poor performance came at the same time universities in Asian countries were “rapidly improving” because of increased government or private sector investment in education and research.Mainland China and India had particularly strong upward trends, with more than 40% of their universities rising in the rankings, while four of New Zealand’s eight universities also improved compared with last year.Top 10 universities in the worldThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology retained the top position for the 14th consecutive year, followed by Imperial College London and Stanford University.“The inconvenient truth is that reputation is an issue which continues to adversely impact Australian universities’ performance in global rankings,” Calderon said.“The relative decline in standing for both the academic and employer reputation measures has been in the making for several years.

But of those, five of the high-performing Group of Eight (Go8) sandstones moved down.The CEO of QS, Jessica Turner, said there were “areas of concern” for Australia’s higher education system, pointing to the reputation dip coupled with a governmentcrackdown on international students.Since 2023, the commonwealth has introduced arange of migration reformsto “restore integrity” to the international education sector, including higher visa fees and English language requirements and slowed visa processing for some “high risk” countries.“International students have been drawn into a wider national debate in Australia around migration and housing, where they are sometimes perceived ascontributing to systemic pressures,” she said.Trump administration accused of ‘blatant foreign interference’ in Australian universities over questionnaire on DEI and genderRead more“In what has been a turbulent year for Australian higher education, universities are calling for sustainable research funding models and greater policy certainty around international education.“These are critical to safeguarding and strengthening one of Australia’s greatest national assets, particularly as the country faces growing competition from across the APAC region.”At least seven Australian universities have had research programs temporarily suspended by theTrump administrationthis year, while a dozen universities were sent a questionnaire asking to confirm whether they aligned with US government interests.The chief executive of the Go8, Vicki Thomson, said the results came against a backdrop of global uncertainty and“mixed messaging” from Australia’s largest research partner, the US.“This … threatens our very capacity to deliver on our mission of education and research,” she said.“And yet despite these headwinds, Australia continues to punch above its weight … that we have two Go8 members ranked in the top 20 and six in the world’s top 50, is an outstanding result and must not be taken for granted but rather leveraged in these contested times.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesAustralian educationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s no longer enough to invent new taxes just so governments can have more money to spend,” the Groom MP told Guardian Australia.“We need a tax system that’s inclusive, that supports modern families, whatever shape they may be. If you are looking after each other, Australia should be looking after you.”Hamilton said one of the ideas that should be on the table was lifetime tax rate deductions for mothers, in recognition of the fact they faced lower salaries when returning to the workforce.Viktor Orban’sfar-right government in Hungary is introducing a radical version of the idea,offering lifetimeincome tax exemptions for mothers of two or more children as part of a plan to address the country’s falling fertility rate.Hamilton understood the fertility rate argument but said he viewed the policy as more of an incentive to work and to help womenbuild their super balances.He is also among the conservative MPs who support income splitting,a recurring policy ideathat would allow parents to split combined incomes evenly across two tax returns, lowering the household’s overall tax bill.Jim Chalmers says media’s ‘rule-in rule-out game’ on tax reform has ‘cancerous effect’ on policy debatesRead moreFor example, if one parent earned $120,000 and the other earned $40,000 then both would be taxed at the rate of someone on $80,000.One Nationpushed the policy at this year’s federal election as a means of supporting stay-at-home parents. The former Coalition senator Gerard Rennick asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to model a similar policy earlier this year, which calculated it would costroughly $12.5bn over two years.In a sign of widening support in conservative circles, the rightwing Liberal senator and shadow assistant minister for families and communities,Leah Blyth, has publicly argued the case for income splitting over the past week.“It’s not fair. It’s not sustainable. And it’s time we backed families,” Blyth said of the existing tax settings in a social media post last week.The Australian Financial Reviewreported Blyth was also working on a proposal to make private school fees tax deductible while cutting taxpayer funding to them.Speaking before Chalmers used a speech to the National Press Club to set the scene for tax changes, the shadow finance minister, James Paterson, reiterated that the Coalition was prepared to work “constructively” with the government.“It is self-evident that we do not collect tax in this country as efficiently as we could, and it holds back our prosperity and our productivity and our efficiency as an economy, and there are gains that can be made by reforming the tax system,” Paterson, who is acting shadow treasurer, told Sky News.“But that is not a blank cheque for this government to increase taxes.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal partyAustralian politicsSussan LeyOne NationJim ChalmersnewsShareReuse this content"

The court follows the advocate general’s opinion in most cases.Kinga Gál, a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party and the vice-president ofthe far-right Patriots for Europe group, said the debate was “nothing new” and “perfectly fits into the witch-hunts and hysteria we have experienced for several years about Hungary”.In the right-leaning parliament, Hungary found vocal support from far-right and nationalist MEPs from France, Italy, Spain and Germany.Christine Anderson of the Alternative für Deutschland party, said: “Where you see scandal, I see reason, common sense and decency,” while accusing the commission of running an “inquisition”.MEPs from the centre-right were muted in support of gay rights, focusing on concerns over freedom of assembly and democratic standards. “Opposition is rising in Hungary and Orbán is clearly afraid,” Tomas Tobé, a Swedish member of the European People’s party (EPP), said. “They are doing everything they can to limit freedom of speech, restrict freedom of assembly and prevent people from determining their own future.”The EPP is allied toPéter Magyar,a former Fidesz insider who is widely seen to present the most serious electoral challenge to Orbán since his return to power in 2010.Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánPrideLGBTQ+ rightsEuropeEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

But Russia’s priority remains avoiding any moves that could undermine its warming ties with the new US administration or prompt a shift in Trump’s stance on Ukraine,” the source said.Still, the Kremlin stands to lose from a prolonged US-backed Israeli military campaign that devastates Iran’s economic and military infrastructure and threatens the survival of the regime in Tehran.“If the current Iranian regime collapses, it would be both a strategic and reputational blow for Russia,” the source with ties to the Russian foreign ministry said.“A bigger loss than the fall of Damascus,” the source added, referring to Moscow’sdiminished influence over Syriaafter the fall of Bashar al-Assad, a longtime Kremlin ally whose eventual defeat marked the end of a costlydecade-long Russian intervention.On the surface, Russia’s muted response and restrained condemnations stand in contrast to thedeepening ties it has forged with Iransince its 2022 invasion of Ukraine – a war that placed Moscow alongside Tehran among the regimes most heavily hit by sanctions.In the early months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Iranprovedto be an important partner to the Kremlin, supplying Moscow with thousands of combat drones used to strike Ukrainian cities. Tehran also later sent instructors to Russia to help set up a drone production facility, based on Iranian designs, deep in the Ural mountains.Vladimir Putin in turn praised the deepening ties between the two countries. In January he and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, signed a wide-ranging “comprehensive strategic partnership treaty” aimed at strengthening military cooperation and intelligence sharing.Still, the two nations’ relationship has always been complex, observers say. When signing the military agreement, both countries insisted on omitting a mutual defence clause, meaning Moscow now is under no legal obligation to provide military assistance to Iran. Russia has also been slow to deliver a range of weapons Tehran has requested.“Despite repeated requests from the Iranian side for various types of weapons – air defence systems and fighter jets – none of this has been transferred to Iran by Russia to date,” Smagin said.Partly due to its entanglement in Ukraine and its growing ties with other regional players,including Saudi Arabia, Moscow has shown little urgency on propping up Iran, even as Tehran’s position has weakened after blowsagainstits key proxy, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah.The Kremlin, meanwhile, has largely decoupled its reliance on Iranian military support, having already acquired the expertise to mass-produce drones domestically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For one, oil prices have surged to their highest level in four months – and are expected to rise further – offering Moscow a much-needed economic boost at a time when falling global energy prices had threatened to squeeze its wartime budget.The conflict has also drawn the full attention of Trump, who in recent days has barely mentioned Ukraine. Hecut short a trip to the G7 summit, skipping a previously scheduled meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow defence thinktank, wrote on Telegram: “It is likely that Ukraine will suffer the greatest military and political damage in this situation, apart from Iran itself, of course. A new war in the Middle East will not only distract the world’s attention from the [conflict in Ukraine] but will also, apparently, contribute to the final reorientation of the US towards providing military assistance to Israel.”But while these may offer short-term gains, the long-term picture is far more precarious for Russia, analysts and insiders say.Russia risks losing a key strategic partner – along with years of political and economic capital – in a blow that could seriously undermine its broader geopolitical ambitions. Over the past two years, Moscow has become Iran’s leading foreign investor, committing billions to gas, energy and infrastructure projects – all of which could be jeopardised if the regime in Tehran falls.And unlike some of Moscow’s other allies, such as Belarus, Russia shares little in the way of historical or cultural affinity with Iran. Their partnership has been forged less through tradition than through a shared hostility towards the west – and the experience of navigating life under sanctions.“If this regime falls, I think it will be much harder for Russia to retain its assets and influence in the country,” said Hanna Notte, a Berlin-based expert on Russian foreign policy.Notte said the worst-case scenario for Moscow would be a Middle East dominated by US-aligned powers. “That would be a heavy blow to Russia.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaIranMiddle East and north AfricaEuropeIsraelDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

But there is a growing feeling in government that he should seize the initiative.It will not just be a renegotiation in Europe, which ministers fear would echo the failed EU one attempted by David Cameron, but unilateral reform in the way the fundamental rights in the convention can be applied.Convention on human rights must adapt, says Council of Europe headRead moreIt is fraught with complication and risk and no one knows that better than the prime minister. Starmer is steeped in the language and history of the Strasbourg court. Allies say he can – and does – reel off the most important cases and precedents from memory.The first time Starmerwrote for the Guardian was in 2009on the fundamental importance of human rights, saying that to dismiss them was to “lose all notion of justice and surrender to the sometimes understandable but always inappropriate yearning solely for retribution”.But it is from this position that those in government – and a growing number ofLabourMPs – believe there is an opportunity to lance the boil of the far-right argument to leave the convention altogether.“Under this government the question of whether to stay in the ECHR is settled, it’s not even a question,” one senior government minister said.“But this is not the EU – it’s not about in or out – it’s about whether we can use our national sovereignty to address what is a legitimate concern from the public to how this law is being applied in order to preserve what are really fundamental human rights laws which we all believe in.”The rightwing press have made a bogeyman of the ECHR – making wildly misleading accusations of it being responsible forallowing criminals to stayin Britain because their children don’t like foreign chicken nuggets.It is the bete noire ofRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, and leaving the ECHR was the platform for his Conservative leadership attempt. It looks almost certain to be adopted as a policy by Kemi Badenoch. Nigel Farage said it would be his first act to leave, if he were PM.But a growing number of Labour MPs say that although much of the criticism of the ECHR is hyped-up nonsense that falls apart when details of the cases are revealed, some of the commentary is valid. Many are in Reform-facing seats and want the government to seize the issue and act decisively.The two key aspects of the convention that have caused the most controversy are article 8, which includes privacy and right to family life; and article 3, freedom from torture and degrading treatment. The Home Office is undertaking reviews of both – and how courts apply them.View image in fullscreenThere is a strong feeling that seeking European-wide agreement to change the ECHR is a non-starter.Photograph: Jean-François Badias/APITV’s investigation this week is an obvious illustration; two fugitives wanted for murder and child rape, one of whom has offended again in Britain, cannot be deported because of overcrowded conditions in Brazilian prisons.In a joint article responding to the ITV investigation, two of the most vocal Labour MPs of the 2024 intake – Jake Richards and Dan Tomlinson – said the government needed to neutralise the calls from the Tories and Reform to leave the ECHR. To do that, it should “offer serious and practical changes to see off this threat and deliver for the British people”.Many more MPs say they believe there are examples the world over of voters reacting violently against international law and treaties because of their perceived anti-democratic inflexibility, which they believe stops them getting the changes they vote for.The way to stop this growing backlash happening in Britain, they say, is to show that change can happen without throwing away decades of long-fought-for human rights.The attorney general, Richard Hermer, a veteran human rights lawyer like Starmer, whose legal career has made him a big target for the right, has hinted he is in agreement. His view will be essential to the path Starmer takes. “British leadership to strengthen and reform the international rules-based system is both the right thing to do and the only truly realistic choice,” he said in a recent speech.Senior government figures say there may be a path for a bill that sets out the principles on how the ECHR can be applied going forward, shaped by modern circumstances.But there is a strong feeling that seeking European-wide agreement to change the ECHR is a non-starter – it would take too long, be too tortuous, and give the impression the UK is going “cap in hand” to Strasbourg to ask for permission to change things.It is true that nation states, including France, have begun to vary their interpretations of those laws, especially article 8. Some cabinet minsters believe that the change can come through guidance, especially to the first-tier immigration tribunal, about how to apply the law.But MPs in favour of change would like to see the government seize the cause more robustly and publicly than that, which is why they favour legislation. “There have been too many occasions where the centre left haven’t seized a cause that could turn very ugly and found a way to respond to public concern in a way that is progressive,” one said.The challenge is how to land that message of a third way, instead of the binary choice the populist right will present between leave or remain. That will feel queasily familiar to veterans of the Brexit years – Starmer again is among them.Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsKeir StarmerLabourReform UKHuman rightsEuropeConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

They have been provisionally released after pleading guilty and face up to eight years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do,” he said.1:04Iran's supreme leader rejects Donald Trump's call for unconditional surrender – videoThat lack of clarity about what comes next may extend to the president himself, who was still in deal-making mode, one ally said. The US is understood to want to keep all its options open to exert maximum pressure on Tehran.It was moving air tankers for midair refuelling to Spain and Greece, where they could be used to supply B-2 bombers on a long run from the Whiteman airbase in Missouri to Iran.MapIt is understood thatno request has been put to the UK for use of the Diego Garcia airbase in the Indian Ocean for a B-2 bombing runor of the Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus for the refuelling aircraft, though the latter is considered likely.Other US military assets are on their way. The Pentagon ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to sail from Singapore to the Middle East, which is expected to take between five and seven days. The USS Carl Vinson is already in the Arabian Sea.Qatar and Oman were trying to mediate a ceasefire, the Jerusalem Post reported, hours after at least one aircraft associated with the Iranian government flew to Muscat in Oman, flight tracking showed.Iran sent a message that it was willing to negotiate a deal with the US, but Israel needed to “calm things down”, a source told the Jerusalem Post.Trump’s claim that Iranians had offered to come to the White House for talks prompted an enraged response from Iran’s mission to the UN. “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House,” the mission posted on a social media account.The foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany are planning to meet their Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in Geneva on Friday in what could representa potential diplomatic breakthrough after five days of Israeli bombing.Final confirmation from Tehran is still pending, but if confirmed it would represent the first face-to-face diplomatic meeting since the crisis began.In a social media post late on Wednesday, Araghchi wrote that Iran “remain[s] committed to diplomacy. As before, we are serious and forward-looking in our outlook.”The talks in Geneva will focus on how Iran is willing to reduce or close its nuclear programme, and will also be attended by the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.But Araghchi has refused to meet Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, on the grounds that the US is supporting Israel’s attacks.TheTrump administrationhad initially distanced itself from the war, saying Israel had acted alone, but in recent days it has stepped up its rhetoric and its military presence in the Middle East.Bunker-busting bombsIran’sFordow nuclear facilityis at the heart of demands for the US to join the war, both in Israel and from hawks in Washington.Damage from strikes on other facilities could be repaired within months, Israeli military officials and nuclear experts say. Destroying or crippling Fordow would have much more of a long-term impact.It is buried deep below a mountain near the holy city of Qom, and the only munitions that could possibly damage or destroy it are the most powerful US bunker-buster bombs, which only US B-2s can carry.Penetration depth of bunker-busting bombIsrael’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the war had been an entirely Israeli campaign but it “will not end without damaging Fordow”, in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 television.If the US does not join, Israel may still have military options but they would be riskier and more complicated. It could fly in special operations troops for a ground operation, like one that targeted a missile factory in Syria last year, or disable Fordow by attacking critical support systems such as its power supply.Israel says it launched the war in self-defence, to destroy Iran’s nuclear programme, but Netanyahu and several ministers have made no secret of their desire for regime change.Trump reportedly vetoed an Israeliplan to assassinate Khamenei, and critics have questioned why Israel targeted civilian institutions such as the state broadcaster.On Wednesday, the defence minister, Israel Katz, said Israel was bombing “symbols of power” in Iran and suggested the regime could be in its last days.“A tornado is sweeping through Tehran,” he wrote in a post on X. “Symbols of power are being bombed and collapsing, from the broadcasting authority and soon other targets, and masses of residents are fleeing. This is how dictatorships collapse.”The escalating conflict has prompted a growing international chorus of concern. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, offered to mediate between Iran and Israel, after one of his top diplomats urged Washington not to consider “speculative options” for intervention.On a sixth night of attacks, Israel bombed a site that manufactured uranium centrifuges and also said it had targeted a missile component factory and destroyed five attack helicopters.Iran’s military has been battered but not fully destroyed. An advanced Israeli drone was shot down on Wednesday, despite Israel claiming control of the skies over western Iran and Tehran. Overnight, Iran fired 15 missiles at Israel.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Israeli strikes had hit two centrifuge productions in Iran, one in the capital and another just outside it.Iran has reported at least 224 deaths from Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, although it has not updated that toll for several days. A US-based watchdog, Human Rights Activists in Iran, says at least 585 people have been killed and more than 1,300 injured.Iranian attacks on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians. Israeli air defences have intercepted most of the 400 missiles fired by Tehran, with only about 10% hitting targets inside the country.MapIsrael could become more vulnerable if the war continues much longer as supplies of its most effective air-defence missiles are running low, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing a US official.Its Arrow interceptors are complex missiles that cost several million dollars each, and they have a long production process.Israel’s assumption US would get drawn into Iran war is being put to the testRead moreAlthough the US has been supporting Israel’s defences with Thaad ground-based systems, interceptions by F-16 jets and missiles launched by the navy, it does not have unlimited supplies of these defensive systems either.Iran is thought to still have a substantial proportion of the estimated 2,000 missiles that were in its arsenal at the start of the war. Israeli strikes have focused on launcher systems that are needed to fire them.Additional reporting by Quique KierszenbaumExplore more on these topicsIranIsraelUS foreign policyTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He added the Iranians had reached out, but he felt “it’s very late to be talking”.Starmer had said he was confident the US would not join Israel’s bombing campaign despite US military deployments to the region andmixed messages from Trump, but Downing Street was unwilling to repeat Starmer’s comments on Wednesday.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has also travelled to Washington for urgent talks with his American counterpart, Marco Rubio.British officials have repeatedly emphasised that the UK is not expected to participate with its own military in any attack on Iran, unless there were some exceptional circumstances.The UK has deployed 14 Typhoon jets at Akrotiri to protect its bases and forces and to help regional allies such as Cyprus and Oman if they come under attack.Britain has not received a formal request from the US to use Diego Garcia in the south Indian Ocean or any of its other airbases to bomb Iran, it is understood, and Trump is thought to want to keep all his options on the table for the moment – including military – to exert maximum pressure on Iran.The president is described as wanting to seek a deal, though there is a recognition that could change.Existing agreements mean the US, or any other country, needs British government permission to use any RAF airbase, including Diego Garcia, which was recently the subject of a new 99-year lease agreement with Mauritius that left the UK in full operational control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn practice, Diego Garcia is mainly used by the US, but the fact that it is ultimately a British base means that Starmer would have to approve its use for an attack on Iran. The US is thought likely to want to request the use of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus for its air tankers, used to refuel B-2 bombers.Similar permission would be required if the US wanted to use RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, where B-2s are based in Europe, though this is considered a less likely option for an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.Refusal by the UK would not prevent an attack on the deep-lying nuclear enrichment site at Fordow because it is possible for the B-2 bombers to strike from their home base in Whiteman, Missouri, but it would be interpreted as a lack of British support for the attack.The Guardian view on Israel, the US and Iran: you can’t bomb your way out of nuclear proliferation | EditorialRead moreThe deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, standing in for Starmer at prime minister’s questions, insisted the UK would continue to back a diplomatic route to resolving the conflict.“The one thing I will say is we agree with President Trump that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon, but we’ve been consistent in urging Iran to engage in the diplomatic process and work with the United States, and we continue to support that diplomatic approach,” she told MPs.The Foreign Office advised British citizens inIsraelto stay put and close to shelter, despite the families of embassy staff leaving Israel on Tuesday night.Downing Street said the government’s priority was to de-escalate the conflict, while Starmer called allies in the region to urge a diplomatic solution.A spokesperson said: “The prime minister, the foreign secretary, have spoken with partners and counterparts across the region and beyond, including all our allies, to reiterate the need for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy. Our priority is de-escalation and that is what ministers will continue to push.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyLabourKeir StarmerIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now … Our patience is wearing thin.” Three minutes later, in a second post, he added: “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”When Mehnaz*, a 24-year-old student activist in east Tehran, heard the news, she did not think of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Instead, she thought of her fellow students who were detained, shot and executed by Iranian security forces during the “woman, life, liberty” protests in 2022.“AfterMahsa [Amini]’s death, we tried to stand up. Teenagers were shot point blank, our compatriots were hanged. We could never get rid of the Islamic Republic on our own. Now, someone from outside is helping us,” Mehnaz told the Guardian via text on Wednesday after a sleepless night of Israeli bombing.‘You worry what’s going to come next’: Iranians brace themselves as war loomsRead moreThe prospect of imminent US involvement in an Israeli bombing campaign, which is suggested to be in pursuit of regime change, has laid bare deep divides in Iran’s population, even among the opposition. Many are deeply suspicious of the US’s intentions in Iran, which has a bitter history of foreign adventurism gone awry. Others do not care who is the one to topple the government.A large portion of Iran’s population is bitterly opposed to the government, which has only grown more repressive as the country slips deeper into economic crisis. Just two weeks ago, much ofIranwas paralysed by a nationwide strike in protest at the dismal economic situation.To some of the opposition, anything that could topple the Iranian government is welcome, whether it comes from street protests or US bunker busters.Mehnaz said: “Yes, we’ll probably have massive destruction in Tehran and other cities, but this regime will fall – and then we can rebuild everything again.”The toll of fighting – now in its sixth day – is growing. Israeli strikes have killed at least 585 people and wounded 1,326 others in Iran, according to Iranian media. At least 24 people have been killed and 600 injured by Iranian strikes in Israel.Fighting started after Israel launched hundreds of pre-dawn strikes on Iran last Friday, which it said were aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly retaliated by firing a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel, kicking off a steadily escalating tit-for-tat war.Israel’s assumption US would get drawn into Iran war is being put to the testRead moreTo Alborz*, an athlete from Tehran, the cost of Israeli bombing was already too high.“I can’t explain how we pass each day, in fear. It feels like I am walking on a street of hot coal and having acid rain down on me,” Alborz said via text. “We want to get our freedom on our own terms, not through US bombs,” he added.Iran has a long history of foreign intervention that has left the population suspicious of offers of help.A 1953 coup that deposed the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, wasbacked by the CIA and MI6 to protect western oil interests. The intelligence plot features heavily in the national narrative of the current government, which overthrew the western-backed Shah of Iran in the country’s 1979 revolution.The more recent 21st-century history of US adventurism in the Middle East has inspired further scepticism among Iranians.“Look at Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq – they destroyed the countries, then walked away. It’s funny how they call this ‘exporting democracy’ while they always have paralysed all the democratic institutions in those countries,” Abbas*, a 26-year-old artist from west Tehran, said.The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has called for Iran’s opposition to rise up, suggesting in an interview on Monday that his military operation could help liberate Iranians from an oppressive regime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the time, your hour of freedom is near, it’s happening now.”His calls rang hollow in Iran, which has seen nightly news broadcasts of starvation, displacement and mass killings in Gaza over the last 36 months.Abbas said: “Now Trump wants to unite with Israel – and people here are scared. If they come here like they did in other places, we will be left with nothing but ruins and extremist groups.”While Israeli bombings have battered Iran, its security services have intensified their crackdown on dissidents and political organisation.“Activists and former political prisoners have been rearrested. They’re basically targeting anyone who’s talking about the war,” said Bahar Ghandehari, the director of advocacy and communications at the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.Iranian authorities have restricted internet access, detained activists, and on Saturday arrested 16 people on charges of “spreading rumours” on social media.The renewed wave of oppression has hardened the desire for regime change for some of the opposition, who now find themselves having to deal not only with Israeli bombings but also fear of arrest.“Yes, 585 people were killed in this war till now, but in four days of demonstration after Mahsa Amini’s killing, almost 1,000 people were killed by the regime,” said Mohammad Reza, a resident of Tehran in his 50s who took part in the 2022 protests.* Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ramesh escaped through a small space by his seat and stumbled through the flames and smoke into the arms of rescuers.View image in fullscreenThe funeral of another Air India victim, Mariam Syed, who died with her husband and children, is held in Mumbai.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPA“It’s a miracle I survived,” he told the Sun. “I am OK physically, but I feel terrible that I could not save Ajay.”The streets were filled with mourners as Ramesh walked with his brother’s coffin on his shoulder, his mother beside him in a monsoon-rain-drenched blue sari. More than a dozen of the crash victims were from Diu, a beach town on the Arabian Sea once ruled by the Portuguese.The funeral was held asthe Wall Street Journal reportedthat crash investigators believe flight 171’s emergency power system, known as a ram air turbine (RAT), was deployed during takeoff.Establishing the definitive cause of the crash could take years. But the preliminary finding prompts questions about whether the plane’s engines functioned properly in the crucial moments after takeoff.Flight data from Flightradar24 showed that the Dreamliner climbed to 625 feet. Moments before the plane crashed, the pilot made a distress call: “Thrust not achieved … falling … Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”A CCTV video clip showed the plane begin to descend about 17 seconds after takeoff.View image in fullscreenAir India’s chair said the aircraft’s maintenance history showed nothing of concern.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersThe RAT is a small propeller that drops from the underside of the Dreamliner’s fuselage to provide emergency electricity. While the engines usually supply power for electrical and flight-control systems, the RAT is designed to step in when normal systems fail. It is considered a last resort in aviation emergencies.“The most common occurrence is when a pilot thinks that both engines failed,” Anthony Brickhouse, a US-based aerospace safety consultant, told the Wall Street Journal. He said in commercial aviation, “a dual engine failure is extremely rare … Our engines today are more efficient and reliable than ever.”The Air India crash and the miracle of seat 11A - podcastRead moreThough widely praised for its fuel efficiency and long range, the 787 Dreamliner has been dogged by quality control issues. Last week’s crash was the first fatal incident involving a 787, but its fallout could be far-reaching.Boeing, which manufactures the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, which makes the engines, had declined to comment, the newspaper said.Findings from the wreckage suggest the flaps and other control surfaces were correctly configured for takeoff, indicating the flight crew followed standard procedures, the newspaper said, citing investigators.The report comes a day after India’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said its own inspections found no “major safety concerns” in the Dreamliner fleet but did flag recurring maintenance issues.Air India’s chair, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, toldthe Times Now Indian news channelon Wednesday that the aircraft had nothing of concern in its maintenance history.Air India plane crash: investigators to examine pilots’ voice recordingsRead moreHe said the right engine was installed in March, and the left engine was serviced in 2023. Chandrasekaran added he expected preliminary findings to be out in 30 days. “Everybody needs closure,” he said. “We need to know.”So far, DNA tests have identified 190 of the badly burned victims, and the bodies of 19 have been handed to their families, the Press Trust of India reported. Forensic teams are working around the clock to identify the dead.As of Wednesday, at least 13 Dreamliner flights were grounded and the DGCA confirmed that 66 Boeing 787 flights had been cancelled since the crash. Air India officials cited “technical issues” and “extended precautionary checks” as the reasons for the cancelled flights.The schedule disruptions are the latest blow to the Tata Group-owned airline’s ambitious overhaul of the former state-owned carrier, and the timing could not be worse, with summer travel demand surging.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportSouth and central AsiaPlane crashesBoeingAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He is then seen eating a microwave dinner for one and chuckling, with the now-deflated ball pinned to the table next to him by a large kitchen knife.TheTV advert for the Scotland-based Strathmore Foods, maker of the McIntosh of Strathmore ready meals stocked by most big supermarket chains, has been identified in a report by the UK advertising watchdog as showing an “offensive” portrayal of older people – by stereotyping them as grumpy and intolerant, and implying many are lonely and isolated.The report by theAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) says too many brands are behind the times when it comes to the issue of ageing in advertising.It says older people feel they are bombarded with adverts for funeral services, care homes and mobility aids. Many older people feel invisible because a lot of advertising reduces them to outdated stereotypes, the report says.A survey and focus groups involving 4,000 adults of all ages found that more than a third thought people over the age of 55 tended to be negatively stereotyped in ads.Almost half said ads that showed older people as unable to understand or use technology were potentially offensive.More than a fifth of those surveyed believed that depicting ageing as something to be “fought”,especially in beauty advertising, had the potential to cause harm by influencing how an older person saw themselves, or how society might view and treat them.Focus groups comprising a range of different age groups were shown 34 ads featuring older people made by brands including Amazon, Cadbury, Land Rover, L’Oréal, Pure Cremation and Tesco.View image in fullscreenA LinkedIn ad with the strapline ‘Parents don’t get B2B’ was considered the most likely cause harm.Photograph: LinkedInAn ad by the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, which used the strapline “Parents don’t get B2B”, was considered the most likely to cause harm. “If you think other people think you are stupid and that’s how you come across, I don’t think that is good for self-esteem,” said one female participant.An ad for the fashion brand JD Williams that featured older women in bright, colourful and “trendy” clothes used the strapline “Feeling more girlfriend than grandma”.“I can imagine some older women seeing beauty ads and thinking the goal for women is to look 20 years younger,” said one participant. “As if that is what will make you feel happier. This could be quite harmful because it forces an ideal on older women. It is kind of pushing the idea that they should aim to look young.”Some of those surveyed felt it was a positive and atypical depiction of older women, while others felt it reinforced the idea that ageing was a negative thing and that women were not going to look or feel good unless they tried to fight the process.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And more than a third said they found stereotypical portrayals of older people, such as always being wealthy, grumpy or only mixing with older people, to be irritating.Survey respondents also raised concerns about how ads were targeted, saying they were frequently shown promotions for “end-of-life” services – such as funeral or cremation services, life insurance and care homes – in media that supposedly drew a higher proportion of older people than others, such as daytime TV.And 44% of those surveyed believed older people were either underrepresented or not represented at all in ads, particularly in categories such as fashion, beauty, technology and household goods.Kam Atwal, the research lead at the ASA, said: “As a society, we’re living longer, richer and more varied lives. Our research reveals that some of today’s portrayals of older people in advertising are not being received positively, and that the public wants ads to better reflect the varied lives older people lead today.”Strathmore has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingOlder peopleAdvertising Standards AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

Antisemitic harassment, for example, should not be tolerated on any campus and we fully expect universities to take robust steps to tackle it.”The OfS guidance also suggests that universities refuse places to international students whose funding requires them to follow the policies of foreign governments, potentially threatening state-sponsored students from a number of Asian and Middle Eastern countries.A spokesperson for Universities UK said: “We strongly agree that universities must be places where free speech is protected and promoted.“These guidelines cover complex issues, and we are pleased to see that the OfS has taken onboard some of the feedback from the previous version.“We will continue to work constructively with the OfS and with government as these changes are introduced, and will make sure universities are appropriately supported to comply with them.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationFreedom of speechProtestOffice for StudentsHuman rightsStudentsUniversity management and administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They analysed the resulting spirits using gas chromatography to measure the levels of key flavour compounds.They found that berries from each region had distinct chemical profiles, and the differences could impact the woody, resinous, citrus and floral notes in the gin.The amount of rainfall in a given year significantly impacted the flavour of the berries. Wetter weather meant longer drying periods for the berries were needed, which changed the abundance of water-soluble chemicals in the berries.Prof Annie Hill, the study’s supervisor, said: “The least water-soluble compounds are most affected by post-harvest drying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sex Matters intervened in the supreme court case that was brought by For WomenScotlandagainst the Scottish government over a law aimed at improving gender representation on public boards.Maya Forstater, a founder of Sex Matters, said the supreme court was clear that legal protection for trans people “does not translate into a right to use opposite-sex services”, adding that allowing trans women to use women’s toilets, showers and changing rooms had “created a hostile environment for women”.Sex Matters is particularly concerned about the Scottish government’s guidance for schools, which encourage teaching staff offer flexible arrangements for young transgender people and states that the use of toilets is governed by social convention rather than law.The Good Law Project, which is challenging the EHRC’s interim advice in court next month, revealed earlier this week that the commissionappeared to be rolling backon its initial blanket position.Last weekend, For Women Scotland co-director Susan Smith encouraged individuals to “keep pressure on MSPs and MPs”, and make use of the fighting fund announced by the author and activist JK Rowling to launch their own actions.Rowling said the fund was “not going to be sharing any details or figures about applications and inquiries, as it’s a private fund, not a fundraising charity, and funding details are strictly confidential”.A Scottish government spokesperson said that they would respond to the letter in due course.They said: “The Scottish government has been clear that we accept the supreme court judgment. We are reviewing policies, guidance and legislation potentially impacted by the judgment.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderGenderScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Using official data to March 2023, the report found that 409 of every 1,000 black inmates were subjected to use of force, compared with 208.6 per 1,000 white prisoners.View image in fullscreenMost children in youth offender institutions are from ethic minority backgrounds, according to government statistics.Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/PADavies urged ministers to hold back on rolling out Pava spray in the youth system until the racial disparities were properly addressed.“We’ve got evidence that the growing reliance on visible weapons – such as the rollout of Pava spray in the male youth state and the trial of Tasers in the adult male prison state – is deeply concerning for people with lived experience,” she said. “Our board members have been told that the visible presence patterns make [prisoners] feel constantly afraid, and that’s increasing tension rather than easing it.”According to the IMB’s national annual report, released on Wednesday, black prisoners at HMP Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent were significantly more likely to have force applied to them than white prisoners.At HMP Birmingham, the category B jail once known as Winson Green, there was evidence of “clear racial disparities in the use of force”, despite the diversity of prison staff and the introduction of cultural awareness training.Amid a deepening overcrowding crisis, some prison officers will be trialled with stun guns this summer, while the Conservatives have said some should begiven access to live ammunition.It follows anattack on three officersat HMP Frankland by Hashem Abedi, a terrorist involved in the Manchester Arena bombing.Davies said prison officers showed “remarkable bravery’ in challenging conditions but the majority of assaults were actually between inmates.“We’re seeing violence driven by overcrowding, by mental health crisis and rapid drug use,” she said. “One of the most effective ways to reduce violence is through strong and respectable relationships between staff and prisoners.”Squirted from a canister, Pava spray, or pelargonic acid vanillylamide, causes searing pain and discomfort in the eyes for about 40 minutes and a burning sensation to skin. It was rolled out in men’s prisons in England andWalesin 2018.There are three publicly run YOIs and one that is privately run, holding young offenders up to the age of 21. According to government statistics covering 2022, most children in prison were from ethnic minorities.Data obtained in April by theHoward Leaguethrough freedom of information requests showed that black men were almost three times more likely to be sprayed with Pava than white men in prison, and young black men under the age of 25 were five times more likely to be sprayed than their white counterparts.Responding to Davies, Mark Fairhurst, the national chair of the POA, said IMB members were “not the ones on the receiving end of life-changing injuries” from violent youths.“It would be wholly irresponsible of the government not to give my brave colleagues the protections they need when dealing with violence,” he said. “Using the ethnicity or age of offenders to excuse their violent behaviour is shameful … Nobody should ever enter their workplace and be expected to become a victim.”A Youth Custody Service spokesperson said: “Pava will only be used as a last resort to protect staff and young people from serious harm, such as violent incidents involving weapons. Staff will receive specialist training, and every use will be closely scrutinised with strict controls in place.”Explore more on these topicsYouth justicePrisons and probationUK criminal justiceRaceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Massive protests have broken out in response, and CBPhas publicly announcedthat it is using drones to monitor demonstrations in the region.A critic of Joe Biden’s immigration policies and supporter of Trump’s desire to build a wall along the border with Mexico, Scott was nominated by Trump in December to lead CBP.Shortly before his confirmation hearing before the Senate finance committee in April, James Wong, a former deputy assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of internal affairs, wrote to the committee’s top Democrat with “concern” about Scott’s handling of the investigation into the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas in San Diego, after he was beaten and tased by CBP agents who were preparing to deport him.As San Diego’s police department was investigating the death, a CBP critical incident team used a subpoena to obtain Hernández Rojas’s medical records, which Wong said Scott would have known about given his position at the time as a top border patrol official in the city.“The use of a CBP administrative subpoena for this purpose was blatantly unlawful, and anyone signing it should have known that,” Wong wrote in a letter to the committee’s Democratic ranking member, Ron Wyden.“This was not an investigation, it was a cover-up – one Mr Scott supervised. This abuse of power disqualifies him from leading one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the country.”At the hearing, Scott described the subpoena as “information gathering” and a standard part of such investigations. Asked by the Republican finance committee chair, Mike Crapo, if he had acted “to interfere with the investigation of that case”, Scott replied: “Absolutely not.”In 2021, a House oversight committee report found that Scott was a member of “I’m 10-15”, a private Facebook group for border patrol agents in which participants insulted members of Congress and posted “racist and sexually violent content” directed at lawmakers.Scott told the finance committee: “There were 9,000 people on that group. To say that a few that actually posted something inappropriate, were held accountable, and were disciplined are a reflection of everyone else on that group, I think, is just a [mischaracterization].”When the committee convened again in May before voting to advance his nomination to the Senate floor, Wyden warned Scott would act as a loyalist for the president: “We don’t need to question what Mr Scott would do if given a questionable order from Donald Trump, because we already know he has a history of covering up the truth when it benefits him in a willingness to enable Donald Trump’s worst impulses to target American citizens exercising their constitutional rights.”Crapo said Scott “knows what policies make CBP effective, and I’m confident he will implement these policies as soon as he is confirmed”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS SenateUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Well, buckle up, because it’s coming,” said Kines. The humid conditions will make places that exceed 90F (30C) feel as much as 20F hotter, said Kines.A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir that traps heat and humidity, said Ricky Castro, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Illinois.According to the NWS Weather Prediction Center, daytime temperatures will be in the 90s and overnight temperatures will only drop to the mid-70s from the Great Lakes to the east coast during the heatwave that’s expected to last into next week.Moisture blown north from the Gulf of Mexico is fueling the muggy weather, said Jacob Asherman, a Weather Prediction Center meteorologist. This influx of Gulf moisture is fairly typical during late spring and summer, he said.The heat will be widespread into next week. On Friday, Denver could reach 100F, according to the weather service. Chicago temperatures could reach 96F on Sunday. On Tuesday, Washington DC could see a high of 99F and New York City could reach 96F.Several states in the midwest could see dangerous temperature impacts over the weekend, according to a weather service measure that rates the risk from zero to four. Parts of Nebraska and Kansas will be in the highest category on the scale on Saturday, meaning that anyone without effective cooling or sufficient hydration could face health risks. On Sunday, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois also see a category 4 rating.Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air, and the heat index is what the temperature feels like when the humidity outside is factored in, according to the weather service.When humans sweat, it cools the body down because it absorbs and removes heat as it evaporates off the skin. The air is saturated with water on humid days, which makes it harder for sweat to evaporate. Hot and humid days can be dangerous when the body is unable to cool itself off and can exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and even lead to heatstroke.Minimizing direct sun exposure, wearing loose and light-colored clothing, staying hydrated and spending time in air-conditioned spaces are ways to cool down during extreme heat, according to the NWS.Some parts of the US, such as Phoenix, Arizona, are famously hot without the mugginess. Phoenix and nearby desert regions experience this so-called “dry heat” due to being located far away from large water bodies, mountains that block moist air masses and weather patterns that bring scarce precipitation.Sweat evaporates faster in dry climates compared with humid ones. This can be dangerous because it is easy to underestimate how dehydrated you are, according to Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System.In places such as Iowa, crops can affect the humidity in summer months. Plants feel the effects of hot weather and some people in the midwest are familiar with “corn sweat”, which is when crops move water to their leaves and other surfaces so it can evaporate, according to the Ohio State University.Iowa, farmer Ryan Marquardt said corn sweat was “not as bad as a sauna, but it definitely would have a sauna effect. It’s humid in there [the cornfield], so you’re gonna sweat.”Cornfield contributions to the overall humidity are much lower compared with the humidity winds carry from the Gulf of Mexico, according to OSU.Explore more on these topicsUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Those who fail to do so will be suspected of hiding that activity from US officials.The new guidance, unveiled by the state department on Wednesday, directs US diplomats to conduct an online presence review to look for “any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States”.A cable separately obtained by Politico also instructs diplomats to flag any “advocacy for, aid or support for foreign terrorists and other threats to US national security” and “support for unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence”.The screening for “antisemitic” activity matches similar guidance given at US Citizenship and Immigration Services under the Department of Homeland Security and has been criticised as an effort to crack down on opposition to the conduct of Israel’s war in Gaza.The new state department checks are directed at students and other applicants for visas in the F, M and J categories, which refer to academic and vocational education, as well as cultural exchanges.“It is an expectation from American citizens that their government will make every effort to make our country safer, and that is exactly what theTrump administrationis doing every single day,” said a senior state department official, adding that Marco Rubio was “helping to make America and its universities safer while bringing the state Department into the 21st century”.US issues broad order to consulates to vet student visas over ‘terrorist activity’Read moreThe Trump administration paused the issuance of new education visas late last month as it mulled new social media vetting strategies. The US had also targeted Chinese students for special scrutiny amid a tense negotiation over tariffs and the supply of rare-earth metals and minerals to the United States.The state department directive allowed diplomatic posts to resume the scheduling of interviews for educational and exchange visas, but added that consular officers would conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all applicants applying for F, M and J visas.“To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for F, M and J non-immigrant visas will be asked to adjust the privacy settings on all their social media profiles to ‘public’”, the official said. “The enhanced social media vetting will ensure we are properly screening every single person attempting to visit our country.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But pessimism was higher for women even among Republicans and independents, according to a new Harris poll.Overall, 62% of women and 47% of men said that the economy and inflation were getting worse, a gap of 15 percentage points. The gender gap crossed party lines with both Democratic and Republican women expressing greater concerns about the economy than men did.Chart showing that women are more likely to believe that the economy and inflation are getting worse, no matter their political leaning“Here’s what everyone missed: women aren’t being pessimistic about the economy – they’re being realistic,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer of Harris Poll. “Women are experiencing the sharp edge of inflation on essentials like groceries and childcare in ways that stock portfolios can’t capture.”The news will be worrying for the Trump administration. Women are more likely than men to be registered to vote and to show up at the polls. While Trump made gains among women in the 2024 election, women were still 10%more likelyto vote for Kamala Harris. Recent analysis has shown that much of Trump’s win can be attributed to gains made among men,particularly non-white men.Across a series of questions about their outlook on the state of the economy, most respondents (78%) – both men and women – expressed concerns about the amount of uncertainty, particularly around prices.Yet women appear to be bearing the brunt of Trump’s economic policy, particularly around his tariffs.Previousresearch has shownthat women are more likely to feel the impacts of inflation because of broader gender inequality, including gaps in pay and household responsibilities.While a majority of respondents said they were primarily responsible for their household’s shopping, more women (71%) than men (62%) reported being their household’s primary shopper.This difference in household shopping responsibility translates into broader gaps in concern over affordability and prices:More women said they were very worried about food prices (52% of women compared to 39% of men)More women said they were spending more time trying to find deals or go to more affordable stores (36% versus 26%)More women said their financial security was getting worse because of their difficulty in affording essential goods and services (55% versus 46%)The differences increased when respondents were asked about their comfort in affording their lifestyles in the current economy, including affording a family, a home, life as a single individual, and childcare. Just 27% of women said they felt comfortable affording a family now, compared with 43% of men.Although confidence in switching jobs was low among all respondents, 34% of men were confident in a job switch compared with 25% of women. Women are also more pessimistic about receiving a meaningful raise this year: 54% of women said they think they will get a raise, compared with 63% of men.Bar chart showing that women are notably more concerned about rising prices than menLack of confidence in the economy can affect people’s behavior, particularly the big milestones they can make in their lives. They are more likely to delay buying homes, starting a family or switching jobs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For some, the economy can largely be defined by how the US stock market is doing; for many others, it’s the price of their weekly grocery bill.Over the last few years, certain parts of the economy thrived, while others caused serious pain. The stock market reached record highs, and the wealth of the ultra-richsoared. At the same time, the labor market has remained relatively stable, with the unemployment rate staying at about 4%.US prices continued to rise in May amid Trump tariffsRead moreBut even as Americans were holding on to their jobs, prices soared, particularly in 2022, when the inflation rate hit a decades-high of 9.1%. In attempts to bring inflation down, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which ultimately made borrowing money, particularly for a mortgage, much more expensive than it had been during the pandemic.Previous Harris polls conducted before the 2024 US election had shown that pessimism under the Biden administrationwas high. Many Americans appeared to blame the White House for the high inflation, even though inflation eventually came down to under 3% in 2023 and 2024.So far in his second term, Trump has primarily used tariffs as his main tool to balance out the economy, arguing that tariffs will increase domestic manufacturing. So far, many companies have said they will insteadpass the price increaseson to consumers. Recent data hasshown that inflation hasn’t climbed yet, but economists warn that many companies stockpiled in anticipation of tariffs, and price increases could continue into the summer.This survey was conducted online within the US by The Harris Poll from 22 to 31 May2025, among a nationally representative sample of 4,208 USadults.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTrump administrationDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Fed chair,Jerome Powell, cautioned that officials expect tariffs imposed by Trump to increase prices over the course of the summer.“Increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity,” Powell told reporters. “The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could be more persistent.”Avoiding persistent inflation “will depend on the size of the tariff effects” and how long it takes them to affect prices, Powell added.Hours before the central bank announced its latest decision, Trump calledPowell“stupid” and accuratelypredicted rates would be maintained on Wednesday.Can Trump fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell?Read more“He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune,” Trump, whose attacks have raised questions over the Fed’s independence, claimed of Powell. The central bank has repeatedly stressed it makes decisions based on economic data, rather than political interventions.Federal interest rates have remained flat after some cuts in 2024 for the first time since 2020.Policymakers at the central bank expect inflation to increase by a median rate of 3% this year, according to projections released alongside its latest decision on Wednesday, up from aprevious estimate of 2.7%– and highlighting how far the US remains from the Fed’s inflation target of 2%.As Trump’s aggressive tariffs agenda continues to disrupt the global economy, and raises concern about price growth, officials at the Fed have repeatedly warned of an uncertain road ahead.They expect theUS economyto grow by a median rate of 1.4% this year, down from March’s 1.7% estimate, which itself was a significant downgrade from the previous 2.1% estimate in December.As the Fed confirmed on Wednesday that a targeted federal funds rate had been held at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%following its rate-setting open market committee’s latest two-day meeting, it said: “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated.”A closely watched “dot plot”, which shows policymakers’ predictions for the trajectory of rates, indicated that most expect to cut rates at least twice in 2025, with further cuts in future years.But officials do not universally agree on the path ahead. Seven of the nineteen officials on the committee do not expect to cut rates at all this year.“We have a pretty healthy diversity of views on the committee,” Powell told reporters, citing differences in economics predictions and views on how the Fed should respond.“Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the committee said in a statement. “The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid.Inflationremains somewhat elevated.”The central bank has so far defied Trump’s attacks on its decisions, holding firm on its independence from the White House. After Powell spoke with the US president last month, the Fedsaid that he had made clearthat its actions “will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook”.Wall Street rose after the announcement on Wednesday,but later slipped back. By mid-afternoon in New York both the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were broadly flat.Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The Federal Reserve’s crystal ball is still clouded and feeds into its bias toward being reactionary, rather than preemptive.”Looking ahead, Powell expressed concern over cuts to US statistical agencies that produce data on the economy. While he stressed the Fed was still able to do its job, he warned of “more volatility” in surveys as a result of layoffs.“The United States has been a leader for many, many years in this whole project of measuring, and understanding what’s happening in our very large and dynamic economy,” he said. “And I hate to see us cutting back on that, because it is a real benefit to the general public.”Explore more on these topicsUS interest ratesFederal ReserveJerome PowellDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

The Japanese firm also avoids the $565m in breakup fees it would have had to pay if the companies had failed to secure approvals.Nippon Steel said on Wednesday its annual crude steel production capacity was expected to reach 86m tons, bringing it closer to Nippon Steel’s global strategic goal of 100m tons of global crude steel production capacity.The deal’s closing was hardly guaranteed, though many investors saw approval as likely after Trump headlined a rally on 30 May giving his vague blessing to an “investment” by Nippon Steel, which he described as a “great partner”.After the United Steelworkers union came out against the deal last year, both then president Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, expressed their opposition as they sought to woo voters in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, in the presidential election campaign.Shortly before leaving office in January, Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.But Trump’s public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple “investment” in US Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.Trump’s 30 May rally spurred hopes approval, and sign-off finally came on Friday with an executive order giving the companies permission to combine if they signed an NSA giving the US government a golden share, which they did.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSteel industryDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” he said.Jassy ended the memo by urging employees to be “curious about AI” and to “educate yourself” in the technology and take training courses.“Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The official added: “General measures they have in place to avoid the dissemination of illegal products do not work properly – it shows a systemic failure.”The European Commission said these were preliminary findings, pending further investigation and responses from AliExpress. If EU officials uphold the verdict, the company can in theory be fined up to 6% of global turnover underthe EU’s Digital Services Act(DSA).AliExpress has, however, persuaded EU regulators to close aspects of their investigation, by pledging to take action to tackle “hidden links” that take users to an illegal product via a legitimate one.The online marketplace promised to develop a system to monitor and detect hidden links to illegal products, such as food supplements and medicines, which have been offered for sale via legitimate items. Such hidden links were also said to have taken children to pornographic material.AliExpress also promised greater transparency over its advertising systems and availability of its data to researchers, which Brussels said addressed concerns in these areas.The European Commission described the commitments as “legally binding” and said AliExpress could face fines if it failed to follow through.The investigation comes under the DSA, which is intended to protect people from online harms such as disinformation, illegal content and dangerous products. The act imposes the strictest requirements on the largest companies with more than 45 million users, including Amazon, Google, Meta and X.AliExpress said it had “proactively engaged and closely collaborated with the European Commission throughout this process” and would continue to do so.“The commission has recognised our committed approach to ensure a high level of consumer protection and transparency through the breadth and depth of these voluntary commitments offered and agreed,” it said. “We are confident that a positive and compliant result will be achieved through continuing our mutual dialogue with the commission to address any remaining concerns on the DSA.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the event this was something more downbeat in Miami, 90 minutes of pub-rock, at times even a meandering shoe-gaze as a well-drilled Al-Hilal kept the new-era Madrid at arm’s length.Madrid had a chance to win it at the death, but Federico Valverde missed a dubiously awarded 92nd-minute penalty. A 1-1 draw felt fair at the end of a Group H opener that flickered but never caught fire.Real Madrid v Al-Hilal: Club World Cup – live updatesRead more“We don’t expect the team to work perfectly on the first day,” a phlegmatic Alonso said. “But we weren’t frustrated. We need to do things differently, to correct a few details. We saw a good reaction in the second half. It has only been nine days and three training sessions.”As expected the Hard Rock was a sun-dappled sea of white at kick-off, Madrid the greatest portable source of eyeball-power at this made-for-TV show. The club announced before the game that they had sold 60,000 tickets for this 65,000 capacity stadium, which seems a little hard onAl-Hilal, who are owned by the Saudi government and as a result are basically paying for the whole show. So, thanks for that.It was another strange day at the mothership of all strange footballing events. Most obviously the game kicked off at 3pm local time in mid-June, when just trying to cross the road in South Florida is likely to induce a state of sock-soaking dehydration, and trying to run is like hurling yourself headfirst into the heart of the sun dressed in a fleece bodysuit and thermal slipper socks.View image in fullscreenGonzalo García put Real Madrid in front in the 34th minute after a rapid counterattack.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersIn other staging news, Fifa revived its No To Racism messaging, running a short video to that effect on the big screen before kick-off. It felt like a clear response to suggestions it has once again kowtowed to the nearest authoritarian leader by watering down its message to Football Unites The World, which has the added drawback of being demonstrably incorrect. It also felt like pre-emptive PR opportunism. Vinícius Junior, who started here, is the most vocal anti-racism campaigner in La Liga.Alonso also said before the match that Madrid needed “closure with the past”. Good luck with that one. Madrid feasts on the past. But he picked a fresh-looking team, with the re-branded “Trent” making his debut alongside fellow newbie Dean ­Huijsen, and 21-year-old Gonzalo García at the point of the attack.Kylian Mbappé was absent with a fever, possibly even the strain of football fever Gianni Infantino has claimed is sweeping the US, albeit in asymptomatic form judging by the world beyond the stadiums.So we got to see Trent Alexander-Arnold for the first time in match-day kit, a familiar shambling, bandy-legged figure, starting at right-back in a regulation 4-3-3. But it was Al-Hilal who almost opened the scoring after two minutes, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic’s drive drawing a save from Thibaut Courtois. And with 13 minutes gone Marcos Leonardo really should have scored for Al-Hilal, deflecting a mis-hit shot just wide. Vinícius was booked for the crime of evading a potential Kalidou Koulibaly shin-raker. Alexander-Arnold gave the ball away a few times, most notably before a break that ended with the ball in the Madrid net, only to be rescued by an offside flag. Alonso had spoken a lot about the need for Jude Bellingham to be “in the right position”. At times in the opening half hour Madrid had little to offer beyond his roving note of menace.View image in fullscreenRúben Neves fires home a penalty late in the first half to level the scores.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APBut they scored after 34 minutes from a break the length of the pitch, started by Alexander-Arnold winning a challenge outside his own box. The ball was shuttled through midfield to Rodrygo on the right. His cross was perfectly curved into the path of García. The finish bobbled off one foot on to the other, the end result a dink into the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it conceded its first seven minutes later after Raul Asencio gave away a needless penalty, wrapping an arm around Leonardo as he veered away. Rúben Neves buried the kick.Arda Guler came on for ­Asencio at half-time, Aurélien Tchouaméni dropping into the back four. And Guler immediately hit the bar, before García drew a goalline reflex save from Yassine Bounou as Al-Hilal lived, briefly, on the edge.Bellingham showed some drive on the right. He wandered to the left. He gestured at his teammates. Madrid dominated possession for a while, playing in the merciful shade of the Hard Rock’s vast wedding cake roof.Alexander-Arnold came off after 65 minutes of a so-so, occasionally bright debut. The game became a little sluggish and fretful in temperatures that never strayed below a brutally humid 90 degrees. Al-Hilal might have taken the lead after Lucas Vázquez gave the ball away, but Leonardo clumped his finish over the bar with pond-wader finesse.And at the death it seemed Madrid might produce a classic late assertion of their Darwinian right to victory as they were awarded a very soft VAR-reviewed penalty. Valverde’s kick was saved. It felt like justice for a spunky Al-Hilal.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupReal MadridAl-Hilalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The person also said the league has fined the Fever’s Sophie Cunningham for her role in the on-court melee that occurred after she fouled Jacy Sheldon with 46.1 seconds left. Cunningham received a Flagrant-2 during Tuesday night’s game, which Indiana won 88-71.There will be no further penalties for on-court actions during the game, the source said. TheWNBAdoesn’t disclose the amount of money players are fined.The play at the end of the game was the culmination of tensions that had been building throughout the evening.Mabrey’s technical followed a skirmish in the third quarter. Sheldon poked Caitlin Clark in the eye while defending her. Clark pushed Sheldon away and Mabrey forcefully pushed Clark, knocking the star guard to the ground. Clark and Tina Charles were also assessed technical fouls.Has the WNBA become a brutal league, or are we just paying more attention now?Read moreAfter the game, official Ashley Gloss said the contact made by Mabrey didn’t rise to the level of an ejection or meet the criteria for a Flagrant-2.After the contest, both teams said missed calls and poor game management by the officials led to the melee at the end.Fever coach Stephanie White said “bad officiating” is a leaguewide issue and that “everybody [in the WNBA'[] is getting better, except the officials.”She added: “I started talking to the officials in the first quarter, and we knew this was going to happen. You could tell it was going to happen. So, they’ve got to get control of it. They’ve got to be better.”Connecticut center Olivia Nelson-Ododa was also critical of the refereeing during her team’s loss.“Obviously, there was a physical game tonight. I think when things aren’t managed well to begin with that it tends to get out of hand,” she said. “I feel like a lot of stuff was escalating throughout the game, and that’s what happens when you don’t make the proper calls or officiate the game and manage it the right way.”Meanwhile, Clark refused to be drawn into a debate on the subject. “You guys came for basketball; let’s talk about basketball,” she told reporters after the game.Tuesday’s storyline comes as the tough physical play in the WNBA this seasonhas become a talking point. While some have blamed officials, others have said the WNBA has always been a physical league, and is only coming under scrutiny due to larger audiences watching star players such as Clark.The win means the Fever will play Minnesota Lynx in the final of the Commissioner’s Cup, the WNBA’s in-season tournament, on 1 July.“Obviously, we’re excited. It’s a big deal,” Clark said of making the final. “It’s a hard thing to do, and why wouldn’t we celebrate that? We’re getting to play for a pool of money – that’s pretty fun – and you’re competing to win a trophy.

What does that mean for Canada?The NHL’s southern expansion was mocked in the 1990s. But it led to better hockey, more money and a long drought for the sport’s spiritual homeColin HorganWed 18 Jun 2025 08.31 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 09.35 EDTShare“There are a lot of things I do not understand about this proposed expansion,” New York Times sports columnist George Vecseywrotein December 1992, as the NHL wrapped up its annual Board of Governors meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. During that week’s meeting, the league received expansion proposals for two teams. One was for a team in Anaheim, California, backed by Disney. The other was for a team in Miami, Florida, put forward by waste management-and-VHS-video magnate, Wayne Huizenga. “What makes it think the Sun Belt is ready for all these hockey teams?” Vecsey wondered.At the time, the answer was money. With more time, the answer seems to be: because championship hockey teams can be built anywhere, including in the South. On Tuesday night in Florida, the Panthers won their second-straight Stanley Cup against the Edmonton Oilers,this time in six games– one fewer than they needed last season. If anything, you could now argue that there’s no better place to build a championship NHL team than the southern US. Since 1990, the Stanley Cup has been awarded to a team based in the South nine times – but five of those have come in the last six years. And three of those have also been against Canadian teams.Merciless Panthers win second successive Stanley Cup after beating Oilers againRead moreNorth of the border back in 1992, the fear of American dominance was palpable, even though, at that time, the most recent expansion to Tampa Bay and San Jose (alongside Ottawa) looked like an on-ice failure. Nevertheless, the mere presence of these teams, not to mention two more, was a concern.“This is the age of marketing, my friends, and we’re selling image, brand names, fuzzy feelings and merchandising opportunities,” Globe and Mail sports columnist John Allemang warned after the NHL’s December 1992 meeting, sarcastically proposing changes for the increasingly Americanized, commodified game. “Let’s scrap this three-period stuff, introduce the concept of half-time,” he snarked. “Emilio Estevez learned to skate for Mighty Ducks, give him a chance, tell him the wife [Paula Abdul] can sing the national anthem. The American anthem, stupid. Is there any other?” Beyond the potential for merch sales and richer owners, “does anyone else win?” Montreal Gazette columnist Pat Hickey asked around the same time. “Then there’s the question of what these new franchises do for the Canadian psyche,” Hickey wrote. “If we ever thought this was our game, the latest decision on expansion should dispel this notion.”It seems hardly worth repeating that Florida’s win Tuesday further extends the Canadian Stanley Cup drought to now 32 years, more or less fulfilling the worst fears of those sports columnists, and many others, who saw the NHL’s US growth as a threat to the sport’s true identity and thus by extension to that of its birth country, Canada. And they weren’t entirely wrong. This year, more than most others, the existential threat of American dominance on the ice spoke to a bigger Canadian national identity crisis that would have seemed unthinkable in 1992. The idea that Canada, including hockey, could be subsumed by the US has felt more pressing than ever. Canadians – likeswimming phenom Summer McIntoshorNBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander– are dominating in other sports. Youth hockey numbers may bedeclining, loosening generational ties to the game. Yet, nothing still spurs deep national anxiety like hockey failure.So yes, yet another Cup hoisted in the US – in Florida, again, no less – certainly stings a little from a nationalist point of view for Canadians. It fulfils all the worst nightmares of 1992’s sports writers. But the Oilers’ loss is frankly more frustrating strictly from a hockey perspective. Taken together, the Oilers’ undisciplined play, general lack of offence, uneven goaltending, and lacklustre defence in the clutch, made it not only difficult to believe they could win, but that they even should. The Panthers are a scary-good hockey club, with a roster filled with pure gamers, the likes of which other teams only have one or two. Florida play an aggressive, often suffocating offence, and are backed by elite goaltending. The Panthers play great hockey. They just happen to be in Florida. There may not be a lot else to it.It may be, in fact, that the quality of hockey in south Florida is so high because of, rather than in spite of, all that marketing and money and commercialization the NHL welcomed in the early 1990s. Expansion meant that the league – and by extension, the game – had to find a way to appeal to new audiences, most of whom had been living just fine without it until then. This meant that the NHL had to rethink its product. It had to embrace something much of the hockey world still often reflexively rejects – change. Over the decades, the NHL gradually morphed hockey into something new. Along the way, the game lost some aspects, like enforcers, but added things like goals. It got faster, more finessed, more exciting, more watchable, even as some argued it was somehow softer. It hasn’t always gone smoothly (it’s worth mentioning here that Atlanta is looking toget a new teamfor the third time), but its audiences and profits also grew, more or less according to plan. And so far, hockey hasn’t lost its Canadian identity. After the NHL’s buzzy, highly commercializedFour Nations tournament this past spring, it may even be more entrenched than ever.Looking back now, it’s clear that the cynical, calculated marketing — and of course the money — were indeed the point of the NHL’s expansion to a place like Florida. But they didn’t destroy hockey. Instead, it just keeps getting better.Explore more on these topicsStanley CupFlorida PanthersEdmonton OilersUS sportsNHLfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This has come as a complete shock as I have never knowingly used any banned substances or broken any rules, and am working closely with my team to investigate how this could have happened.“I know that I have not done anything wrong and remain hopeful that I will be back on the pitch soon. I cannot say any more now due to the confidentiality of the process, but I will as soon as I can.”Mudryk,who joined Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk for an initial £62m in January 2023, is fighting to salvage his career. The terms of his provisional ban have prevented him from training at Chelsea’s base in Cobham or with his teammates.The 24-year-old caused a stir when hetravelled on his own to Wroclawto watch Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Uefa Conference League final last month. He was able to join in the post-match celebrations but his No 10 shirt has since been handed to Cole Palmer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola said: “For the speed they go to touch the ball – for the Newton’s theory your leg has to be a little bit higher and the other player was down. Rico has never had an intention to hurt anyone. It’s a little unnecessary. I said that to the referee, he disagreed and he is the boss.”Empty seats are everywhere at the Club World Cup. But does this miss the real point?Read moreThis midday kick-off in the Phila­delphia heat against Morocco’s Wydad AC offered a glimpse of City’s hopes for 2025-26 as theirClub World Cupdefence enjoyed lift-off. It told us Tijjani Reijnders can operate in the No 6 or “Rodri role” for Guardiola despite being bought to scheme, ­primarily, as a No 8. It said City’s high line remains a weakness though mitigation could be found in Rúben Dias and John Stones being substitutes only.In Phil Foden’s opener plus assist for Jérémy Doku’s second we may have witnessed the start of a renaissance following City’s season horribilis. And in the near instant takedown of a first-half pitch invader, wearing a T-shirt protesting against Morocco’s cull of stray dogs and cats, there was a sign of the high alert this divided country is on.Guardiola said: “The first game is always really important. [Foden was] really good. He’s always there. We’re really pleased. [Reijnders] is a really good player. You feel it, smell it. When he gets the rhythm he will be top.”After claiming the previous seven‑club tournament, City’s bid to retain this revamped 32-team iteration was about victory, and walking Guardiola’s pre-match message. Our season begins here, the Catalan posited, before sending out an XI that intrigued. Erling Haaland and Rodri enjoyed a centre-circle pow-wow before this Group G opener, then sat down on the bench as replacements. Instead, their manager handed debuts to Rayan Cherki and Reijnders but not Rayan Aït-Nouri, his other major summer signing.Rodri’s omission could be filed as odd given he had not started since 22 September after sustaining a ­serious knee injury against Arsenal that excluded him until the side’s final home game of last season. He was in need of match time, as emphasised by a rusty second-half cameo.Bernardo Silva – named by Guardiola as City’s new captain – went unused throughout a display that has to be caveated by the shockwaves that Wydad, despite being the 22-time Moroccan champions, would have caused if the 2022-23 treble victors were defeated.View image in fullscreenJérémy Doku struck Manchester City’s second shortly before the break.Photograph: Caean Couto/IMAGN IMAGES/ReutersOne minute 53 seconds were clocked when Foden stroked beyond El Mehdi Benabid. This ended a move initiated by Nathan Aké’s ball down the left to Doku and took in Savinho, a scramble in Wydad’s area, then Foden’s strike.This was the first answer to how Wydad would fare. A second came when Omar Marmoush, City’s No 9, sprayed a shot marginally wide moments after. In the heat, Amine Benhachem’s men had the same issue many do against City: trying to stymie their attacks. But they also prospered, via invention beyond the high line, as copious foes enjoy.A Mohamed Moufid raid down the left splayed City and, if his pass had found Thembinkosi Lorch, ­Ederson’s goal may have been breached. Then Lorch, near halfway, nabbed the ball and aimed a chip over City’s No 1, but the captain recovered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The forward’s swivel sat Reis down as he tried to recover but, in refusing the shot, the Brazilian and City escaped.The team from Casablanca did not, though, when Foden dropped a corner in from the right: Doku, first time, hit past Benabid and so Guardiola’s men ambled off at the break two up.The Catalan, cutting a dashing figure in white shirt, safari pants and sneakers, refused instant changes for the second period. The decision seemed prudent when the same unit manoeuvred Doku into a scoring zone but the wingman could only locate Benabid, who saved.Then a triple change. Rodri, ­Haaland, Oscar Bobb for Cherki, Doku and Foden. This pushed ­Reijnders ahead of Rodri, Marmoush into Cherki’s inside-forward berth behind Haaland in attack, with Bobb on the right, Savinho switching to the right.At a Lincoln Financial Field just over half full (capacity 67,500), Wydad’s support offered incessant drums and noise. And derision when Rodri flipped a pass straight out, this usually magisterial footballer ­hanging a hand up in apology.As the contest tailed off a flare in Wydad’s red was let go behind Ederson’s goal and then the card of the same colour was seen by Lewis – which had Guardiola, correctly, in a fury. A crowd of 37,446 departed mildly entertained and with City knowing Lewis is now unavailable for the contest with Al Ain in Atlanta on Sunday, and maybe beyond.Foden, who has two years left on his deal, confirmed afterwards that there is no news from the club on a fresh one. Continue how he did today and there may be soon.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His side will now face Spain in the last eight on Saturday night, although having beaten the pre-tournament favourites, who are looking for their record sixth title at this level, in the final two years ago in Georgia, the England manager will know that his side cannot defend like this again.“It has not quite clicked but it is a matter of time before it all comes together,” said Scott. “We’re going to recover from this and look into Spain and pick them apart. Hopefully we can put in a good performance and get to the semis.”Carsley said this week that this group “needs more leaders” so leaving James McAtee, the captain, on the bench as one of four changes from the side that was held toa 0-0 draw against Sloveniaon Sunday was perhaps an attempt to throw some of the less experienced squad members in at the deep end. It didn’t work and a disjointed England found themselves behind after just three minutes.Although Germany impressively sealed progression to the last eight by scoring seven times in their opening two matches, it was still a surprise to see their coach, Antonio Di Salvo, field a completely different side from their first two matches. Yet having already defeated Spain in a friendly back in March thanks to a hat-trick from Nick Woltemade –the towering Stuttgart strikerwho already has four goals in this competition – they didn’t seem too concerned about potentially losing top spot in the group.It was easy to see why when the left-back Lukas Ullrich caught Jarell Quansah napping with a perfectly weighted ball over the top. A deft piece of control and precise finish from Knauff gave Germany the lead. Quansah was almost on the end of a flowing move involving Ethan Nwaneri as England attempted to hit back. But despite enjoying the lion’s share of possession and the stand-in skipper Harvey Elliott’s best efforts, they again struggled to create  chances.Weiper was allowed to head home Knauff’s cross minutes later despite the attentions of Jack Hinshelwood and Charlie Cresswell. Carsley was probably nervously checking the score in the group’s other match just in case when a floodlight failure with 45 seconds left of stoppage time brought a premature end to the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England began to look more of a threat as news that the Czech Republic had taken the lead over Slovenia filtered through, with Norton-Cuffy, a former Arsenal academy player, providing some much-needed impetus down the right flank. But even though a second goal for the Czechs removed any remaining jeopardy, England still showed desire to get something from the game.Scott should have done better with a great chance just after he had been booked for a late challenge before Hinshelwood headed over with the goal gaping. The Bournemouth midfielder gave the travelling England supporters something to cheer when he tapped home following a mazy run from Omari Hutchinson. Cresswell came closest to completing the comeback as England laid siege to the German goal in the final 10 minutes but could not direct his header away from the goalkeeper Tjark Ernst.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21smatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The new manager described Postecoglou as a “legend” as he considered how the Australian had ended the club’s 17-year trophy drought with victory against Manchester United in Bilbao on 21 May. It was not enough to save him from the sack after a dismal Premier League season.Frank, who has joined from Brentford on athree-year contract, acknowledged the barriers that his predecessor had broken down. But as he promised in his first interview at Spurs to take risks and play on the front foot, he made it clear that the goal was to create more memories by winning silverware.Spurs finally have an unpredictable head coach – but Thomas Frank is efficient tooRead moreFrank’s comments, given to the club’s website, came after the chair, Daniel Levy, said on Tuesday that hewanted to win the league and Champions League. Spurs’ Europa League success has got them back into the Champions League.“Huge congratulations to the club, to the team … huge congratulations to Ange,” Frank said. “He will for ever be a legend at Tottenham. It’s very important to understand that we all stand on the shoulders of others so I am going in on the foundations that Ange has built. I’m very humble about that and I’ll do my very best to continue the great work he put in.“But the feeling and excitement, the joy and happiness you could see in the fans’ faces [after the Europa League win], the pictures you saw were … wow! Hopefully we can create more of those moments. That would be the ultimate dream to do that and build on that. Hey, no one can say they are not winners; the team and the players are winners. Now we need to do [our] best … to see whether we can be serial winners in the future.”Frank talked about wanting to create “magic” for the fans, undertaking a journey with them, making theTottenham HotspurStadium a fortress. He also hit the right notes when he discussed how his team would play. “The intention is to play aggressive, front-footed football,” he said.“I know the ethos and the history of the club is massive on attacking football and there is so much attacking talent in the squad. I’m very, very big on principles … what we do in the final third in terms of creating chances, crosses, bring balls in the box, play [in] behind.“I always say this one-liner: if you don’t take risks, you also take risks. So it’s important we take risks. Risk is you need to play forward. If you don’t risk the ball, you can’t create things. We need to be brave.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sellés was swiftly named as Wilder’s successor on Wednesday evening with the Spaniard signing a three-year deal at the Championship club.The 42-year-old former Southampton, Reading and Hull manager said: “When we first heard about the possibility of coming here, it was a no-brainer for us to join a club with this kind of history and with a mission to move forward and try to be even more competitive. This is a very powerful and ambitious project. It was very important at the start of the conversations that everyone is on the same page.Sheffield Wednesday hit with ban on transfer spending until January 2027Read more“We need to embrace data and new technologies, but the most important thing is not to forget the football essence. I think we are capable of delivering a good model and optimise our performance by using all the tools that we have. Our identity is always very clear. We want to be aggressive, we want to make things happen.“So, the fans can expect a team which is not going to wait or be reactive, we will be proactive, we are going to go and try and be as competitive as we can in every single game. If we can do that then we’ll give ourselves a very good chance of winning games.”Wilder’s departure had been expected followingthe club’s end-of-season reviewinto their failure to win promotion to the Premier League. Despite amassing 90 points, United finished third behind Leeds and Burnley and werebeaten 2-1 by Sunderlandin the playoff final at Wembley after taking the lead. United described Wilder’s departure as a “mutually agreed decision”.The 57-year-old quickly released his own statement through the club’s media platforms, saying he was “obviously disappointed” to be leaving Bramall Lane. Wilder said: “It is with great regret that my time atSheffield Unitedhas come to an end. I’d like to thank Stephen Bettis [the chief executive] and Prince Abdullah [the former owner] for bringing me back to the club and giving me the opportunity to rebuild the team and take this great club forward.“To the fans, I’m obviously disappointed to be leaving, particularly because we were so close to getting back to the Premier League. I’m a Sheffielder through and through, I love this club and this city and that feeling will never change. I depart with some cherished memories and feel proud to be talked about in the same manner that special Sheffield United managers are remembered – leading this team over 300 times will remain an incredible part of my life.

Fixtures against Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham will be placed in category A, where prices range from £59 to £97.Premier League opening fixtures: Liverpool host Bournemouth, Arsenal at Manchester UnitedRead moreThe club say they needed to do this to maximise revenue as they seek to put United back on a stable financial footing, impeded by a lack of European football after finishing 15th in the Premier League. They say prices for season-ticket holders and members have gone up on average by £5.10 a match.Must said: “After how last season went, we might have hoped the club would reconsider their plans for this new ticketing model which will see eye-watering price increases for 20,000 supporters per game who buy tickets on a match-by-match basis. This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans.“When the club said they were introducing this new model for members’ tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower-demand games. Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they’re making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the club as a whole. The club’s stated commitment to fan representation is fine in principle, but once again is not being delivered in practice.”United insist the club’s fans’ advisory board was shown the new prices and that these were reduced after consultation. The club also say less than 1% of tickets will cost £97. Tickets for 11 league fixtures will be £57-£86 and two matches, in category C, will cost £37-£60. Category A prices start at £59. Last season members’ tickets for full-paying adults ranged from £40 to £66 untila flat £66 ratewas introduced in November.Must said: “These ticketing decisions only push those regular supporters away in favour of occasional visitors and risk pricing out the next generation of younger fans who are the very future of the club. This match categorisation model will do enormous harm and undermine the atmosphere in the ground in a season when the team will need it more than ever.”Ticket pricing under Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become an increasingly contentious issue. In another change last November concessions were scrapped, but were then reinstated for some games and remain in place. Last week the chief executive, Omar Berrada, apologised for how the changes were communicated to fans. “What we’ve done since is engage heavily with the Fans’ Advisory Board and they’ve all been good,” he told theUnited We Standfanzine. “We’ve had some robust conversations and they pushed back on a lot of the ideas that we had and the initiatives that we wanted to implement.”There have been other unpopular ticketing changes at United under Ratcliffe. Season-ticket holders in the South Stand have had to make way for more hospitality seats. This led to a number of protests aimed at the directors’ box during matches last season but Berrada claimed the decisions were made “for the good of the club”.Everton are poised to appoint Manchester United’s director of academy, Nick Cox, as their technical director.

Cuesta is in line to replace Cristian Chivu, who left for Inter to take over from Simone Inzaghi, and would become the second-youngest head coach in Serie A history.Premier League opening fixtures: Liverpool host Bournemouth, Arsenal at Manchester UnitedRead moreCuesta joined Arsenal from Juventus in 2020 after starting his coaching career at Atlético Madrid in 2014 as an 18-year-old and has become one of Arteta’s closest confidantes, with a heavy focus on improving tactical understanding among individual players. Cuesta was heavily linked with Norwich last season and is understood to have attracted widespread interest from other clubs in the Championship and beyond.He is believed to have been tempted by the challenge of being the youngest manager in Europe’s top five leagues and trying to return Parma to the top half of Serie A, the club having finished 16th last season after being promoted. Arteta said last year that he would not stand in Cuesta’s way should his assistant want to leave, although Cuesta was one of five members of Arsenal’s coaching staff who signed extensions until 2027 in April. His fellow assistant Albert Stuivenberg and the first-team coach Miguel Molina were among the others.“If that’s the will?” Arteta said of forcing someone to stay. “You cannot do that. I wouldn’t, no. With the staff as well, everybody needs to feel there is a path, there is a development plan for everyone. People don’t want to do the same thing for three, four, five years. It is a way to incentivise and inspire other people and then to explore because you don’t really know the limit of a person unless you expose him to certain things.”Arsenal are preparing to make their move for a striker having held talks with representatives of Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyökeres and their respective clubs, RB Leipzig and Sporting. It is understood that Leipzig value Sesko at between €80m (£68.4m) and €100m and are open to allowing him to leave if they can agree a deal, but Arsenal have yet to make a formal offer for the Slovenia striker.View image in fullscreenRB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is high on Arsenal’s list as they pursue a striker.Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA-EFEGyökeres has expressed a preference to play in the Champions League for Arsenalrather than join Manchester United.

A lot of us are putting our hands in our pockets to make sure that our families can get over there. We would love to see as many fans as possible and we want to thank them in advance.”It is understood that all 23 squad members defendingEngland’s European titlenext month receive a sum to help towards travel for family and friends. The figure is similar to that made available for the players who went to Australia for the World Cup in 2023 and is no less than the men’s team players receive. That money can be used for travel and accommodation and the Football Association has a travel service for bookings and guidance.“It will be a bit difficult for families who are staying out for the whole tournament,” said the midfielder Ella Toone, “but I’ll always help my family be out there and make memories ... and make sure they’re eating.”Lotte Wubben-Moy reserved praise for the supporters, including those not travelling: “A lot of people are willing to go above and beyond to be able to watch us and that’s quite inspiring for us. It creates an energy that we not only felt during the Euros but we still felt it in Australia, regardless of the time difference.”For Stanway, making the tournament in Switzerland was not guaranteed after she had surgery on a lateral collateral ligament injury in January. She did not play for Bayern Munich for the remainder of the season but joined England for their Nations League fixtures against Portugal and Spain in late May and early June and played 60 minutes across the two games.View image in fullscreenEngland play their opening game of Euro 2025 against France in Zurich on 5 July.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“I have no fears, I actually feel very ready,” Stanway said. “I probably feel more ready than if I’d played a jam-packed season. I’ve learned a lot in this process and the injury wasn’t a bad thing to happen to me. It was my first injury in 10 years in professional football, so I’ve not done too badly.”How did it help? “It gave me that time away from football to work on the weaknesses in the gym and just get a completely different mindset. Going in every day for rehab is completely different to turning up every day for training and I just feel like I got stronger and stronger every day, surrounded by good people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her left leg became the focus. “I’ve got a lot of new tattoos; that kind of became my zen. As soon as I pressed that button, my headspace was fully clear. All I had to do was perfect the thing that was exactly in front of me going on my left leg.“My brace was on my right leg so I couldn’t tattoo it, so I ended up coming across and doing my left leg.

Ireland’s Tadhg ­Furlong will be given the chance to prove his fitness after struggling with a calf injury that ruled him out of Leinster’s United Rugby­Championship final win against the Bulls last weekend. Furlong is included on a bench that also features the hooker Ronan ­Kelleher, the only player to be involved against Argentina six days after taking part in the end-of-season finale.Farrell’s injury list looks like being clear by next week – it will most likely be clouded somewhat by the final whistle against the Pumas – but for now it is a good place to be. The players not distracted by club calls got a head start over the five days at the training camp in Portugal; since then they have been joined by the next wave who quickly got up to speed.“It’s quite a diverse group in terms of combinations and guys not playing with each other,” Farrell said on Wednesday at the Aviva Stadium. “So it’s nice for that group to have a week where they get settled in and for the other guys to join them – some on a high, one not – but it’s nice for them to have a bit of time to spend with the lads, get to know everyone and see what’s been going on, and they’ve had one training session together so it was nice to get everyone together finally.”What does the head coach expect against Argentina? “Cohesion – connection,” he replied. “An ability to attack the game from the off to be the best version of themselves, not just indivi­dually but collectively as well, so you can’t give yourself excuses as far as time together, etc. We’ve had good prep, and if you want to be a good Lions player you’ve got to hit your straps straight from the off. So we want to see these players compete.”The Breakdown | End-of-season rugby union awards: best games, players and moreRead moreFarrell acknowledged, though, that getting to grips with a new system was one of the hills to be climbed. Surely it is not compatible to tick all those boxes at short notice against a Pumas side he described repeatedly as one ­playing very good rugby over the past 18 months? If it is a climb then Tadhg Beirne does not consider it category one.“Why wouldn’t they be compati­ble?” he said. “You’re talking about world-class players here, the best of the best. The expectation we would have of each other is that you can adapt to any system you’re given.“That’s the challenge laid in front of us. That’s the challenge of being a Lion. Every four years, there’s going to be a new system. The coach is going to want to play a certain way. If you want to be a Lion, you’re going to have to adapt or you’ll get left behind.”So, full steam ahead on Friday night against quality opposition. “Yeah, when we played them [Argentina] back in November with Ireland they really put it to us,” Beirne said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’ll be their World Cup final on Friday and that’s the way we’re going to treat it as well. Every game you get to play for the Lions is the most important game. This Friday is a huge opportunity for us to set the tone for the tour.”For players such as Duhan van der Merwe, Sione Tuipulotu and Furlong, all of whom are desperate for minutes after injury layoffs, it is the perfect platform. Is Farrell praying it stays that way until the squad fly out to Perth on Saturday? “That’s the furthest thing from my mind, because, you know, it’s just the nature of sport in general – never mind a contact sport that we love to watch and play,” the head coach said. “It is what it is and we certainly, in the back of our minds, wish that we’ll have a healthy squad going to Australia.”Farrell said his ideas for the XV in the first Test in Australia are still in flux. “I did an exercise a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve done it about five times since, of choosing what the Test side could be. You actually can’t even go there because there’s such good competition and that’s how it should be. The exciting thing about Friday night is these guys get to show the teammates who are sat in the stand what they’re all about.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionArgentina rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

The British No 1, and second seed, had started poorly: he had struggled to find his range on his groundstrokes for much of the occasion and then two match points passed him by. Deep in the third-set tie break, he trailed 2-4.Over the past year, though, a period during which he has established himself as one of the best players in the world, Draper has continually shown his ability to find a path to victory no matter what. In the first week of his grass-court homecoming, the 23-year-old offered a forceful demonstration of his supreme competitive spirit as he recovered to defeat Australia’s Alexei Popyrin, the world No 21, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (5) to reach the quarter-finals at Queen’s Club.“I have always been a really good competitor,” Draper said. “That’s something I pride myself on: trying my absolute best for every point whenever I play. I think that comes from when I was younger. I think I have an older brother that helps with that. I was lucky enough to have coaches who made me very competitive as well.“I played up as well, so I was always quite small, and I had to fight hard for every point if I wanted to make any headway in the match. I think I have always had that, and I think that’s one of my biggest strengths, to be honest. Especially on a day like today where I wasn’t my best, wasn’t feeling my best, but I came through and I gave myself another chance.”Having started last year’s grass-court season ranked No 40, Draper returned to London, his home city, at a career-high ranking of No 4. An underdog for so long, he is now a title contender in every tournament he enters. The next four weeks mark another significant moment in his career as he takes a step into the unknown and tries to navigate the pressure that will continue to grow as Wimbledon approaches.View image in fullscreenJack Draper stretches for a return in his win against Alexei Popyrin. One more victory would land him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThat extra tension was evident early on as Draper was punished for a sloppy service game at 3-4 and quickly found himself down a set. He gradually found his range, building rhythm on his serve and returning with greater depth and consistency as he forced a final set. Although his forehand was erratic and he was tentative behind his backhand, Draper served well in set three and it seemed as if he might be rewarded for his patience when he generated two match points on Popyrin’s serve. Instead, the Australian saved both before forcing a tiebreak.In the most tense moment of the match, in that tiebreak, Draper gave a full demonstration of his toughness. From 2-4, Draper won five of the six points with a flurry of clutch winners, including a winning forehand down the line, an ace, a searing backhand down-the-line winner and then another ace on match point. He took the match into his own hands with courage and character, producing his best level when he most needed it. It was the mark of a player who continues to grow into a champion.In addition to remaining in the equation for his first Queen’s Club title and potentially securing a top-four seeding at Wimbledon, which he would acquire with one more win, perhaps the most important part of this victory is that Draper will have another match on grass before Wimbledon. He will face Brandon Nakashima in the quarter-finals on Friday after the American defeated Britain’s Dan Evans 7-5, 7-6 (4).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Buick was forced to switch twice in the straight, but when he did eventually take aim at the lead, Ombudsman’s response was ­immediate and overpowering.Royal Ascot 2025 updates and news as Ombudsman rules on day two – liveRead moreOmbudsman was around two lengths behind Anmaat, the ­Champion Stakes winner last season over the same course and distance, ­passing the furlong pole, alongside 100m later and then two lengths ahead and going further clear at the line.“The plan was to just relax off the pace, which was strong and set up for [O’Brien’s] Los Angeles,”John Gosdensaid, “but to that extent we knew we’d be comfortable where we were. It was just the question of when you get in the straight, would you get the luck?“William wasn’t in a position where he could swing around the field, it was more a case of waiting for the gap. And he was very patient, but I knew when he got a gap at the furlong pole, that this horse has an ­extraordinary turn of foot. He was patient and he was rewarded.“Ombudsman is a mile-and-a-quarter horse [with] a wonderful turn of foot and has done nothing but grow in stature.”Ombudsman’s win was the ­Gosdens’ fourth of the meeting, ­putting them two clear of O’Brien – who saddled True Love to win the ­opening Queen Mary Stakes – with three days remaining. Their ­double, meanwhile, was worth nearly £750,000 in prize money, more than enough for them to leapfrog O’Brien to the top of the overall Flat trainers’ championship.The Gosdens also have two live runners – Trawlerman and Sweet ­William – on Thursday in the Gold Cup, where O’Brien will saddle the likely favourite, Illinois, as they go in search of a win in the feature event for the third day running.The success on Wednesday sets up the intriguing possibility of a rematch between Ombudsman and Ed ­Walker’s Almaqam, the horse that ended Ombudsman’s previously unbeaten record in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown last month.Almaqam was steered around the Royal meeting due to a preference for some ease in the ground, but weather – and/or watering – permitting, the two colts could renew their rivalry in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, with the International Stakes at York in August and the Champion Stakes back at Ascot in October also on the agenda.The only disappointment for the Gosden stable on Wednesday was the ­failure of the King and Queen’s ­Rainbows Edge to justify strong support as the 3-1 favourite for the ­Kensington Palace Stakes.

He showed an impressive turn of foot to seal his victory there and that could again prove decisive when battle is joined in the home straight.Royal Ascot 2.30By his own sky-high standards, Aidan O’Brien has as surprisingly poor record in this juvenile event with only three wins in 25 years, and his colt Whistlejacket was the beaten odds-on favourite 12 months ago.

Dortmundrejected a £42m bidfor the 20-year-old this month but Chelsea have agreed personal terms with the England Under-21 international and are likely to return with an improved offer. Chelsea have identified Lyon’s Malick Fofana as a potential alternative to Gittens, who is valued at £50m by Dortmund.Mykhailo Mudryk could face four-year ban after FA charge over failed drugs testRead moreMaresca wants a winger who can cut in from the left after Chelsea decided not to buy Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. The head coach’s options on the flanks are limited to Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke, both of whom are left-footed, and the inexperienced Tyrique George.Madueke likes to play on the right but started on the left when Chelsea opened their Club World Cup campaign bybeating Los Angeles FC 2-0. Chelsea will listen to suitable offers for the England international, not least because another left-footed winger – the 18-year-old Brazilian sensation Estêvão Willian –joins from Palmeirasafter the Club World Cup.There is also a desire to bring in a versatile forward so Maresca can rotate during a season with the added demands of the Champions League. The arrival of Liam Delap, who will compete with Nicolas Jackson, means Chelsea do not need another conventional No 9. They could benefit from lifting the creative burden on Cole Palmer, given that João Félix and Christopher Nkunku are out of favour and free to leave.Chelsea failed with an initial approach for Kudus, who is also a target for Manchester United, Newcastle and one other unnamed Premier League club. Talks took place with West Ham, who are looking to raise funds by selling Kudus, after Chelsea were offered an opportunity to sign the Ghana international.Discussions have continued but there has not been a formal bid. Chelsea have proposed including players in any transfer but West Ham want a straight sale and were similarly uninterested when United suggested a swap. Kudus’s contract contains an £85m release clause, valid for Premier League sides for the first 10 days of July. The 24-year-old, who can play on both flanks and through the middle, impressed after joining West Ham in 2023 but he struggled last season and wants a move.View image in fullscreenChelsea have held talks with West Ham over Mohammed Kudus.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockChelsea have reached out to Brighton about João Pedro, who could be available for £60m. Nothing is imminent, though, and Newcastle’s interest in the Brazilian forward is more advanced. Chelsea have also looked at RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons and Hugo Ekitike but have been put off the latter by Eintracht Frankfurt’s £84m valuation. Unitedhave also scouted Ekitike.Mamadou Sarr aims to become the best centre-back in the world after joining Chelsea fromStrasbourgfor £11.9m. The 19-year-old defender is not short of self-belief after a breakthrough year in Ligue 1. Sarr said he tried to model his game on Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and has developed under the watch of Liam Rosenior at Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Strasbourg manager described Sarr as a “scary” talent and is said to think the France Under-19 international can become world class.“When I was a kid I had a dream,” Sarr said. “It was to be the best centre-back in the world. I trust him and I trust myself.”Sarr seems suited to Maresca’s preference for defenders who are comfortable on the ball. “I think I anticipate well,” he said. “With the ball, I can pick a good pass. I want to be like Virgil van Dijk. I love Van Dijk. But some people tell me I play like Ibrahima Konaté.”Van Dijk’s leadership skills stand out to Sarr. He talked about working hard in training to establish himself at Chelsea. There is a lot of competition in central defence, including from Tosin Adarabioyo, Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah and Benoît Badiashile, and it is not clear whether Sarr will be sent on loan.Explore more on these topicsChelseaStrasbourgWest Ham UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The nine existing SLB clubs are refusing to join, and have had their interim licence to run their own league next season suspended by the BBF.In an attempt to resolve matters it is understood that the BBF last week offered the SLB another 12-month licence that would enable the league to operate next season, a proposal that was rejected by the clubs.The BBF’s position is that as the SLB is operating without a licence it cannot endorse applications to join competitions organised by the Federation of International Basketball Associations, as doing so would jeopardise their own position.The BBF has informed Manchester that their application to join Europe’s premier competition, the Basketball Champions League, would not be endorsed and the club have now missed the deadline to register.An email from the BBF to Manchester sent earlier this week read: “As Fiba’s national member federation, the BBF will only endorse clubs competing in our officially sanctioned national championship competitions. Since notification of termination of the licence held by Super League Basketball Ltd has been issued, Manchester does not currently meet this requirement for the 2025-26 season. We are therefore unable to consider endorsement at this time.”Manchester are exploring legal action on the grounds of restraint of trade, while the BBF also faces the threat of being sued by the other clubs over the GBBL licensing process. The other SLB clubs are believed to be united in their support for Manchester.View image in fullscreenLondon Lions in action against Manchester Basketball in February.Photograph: Carol Moir/AlamyThe BBF has also made it clear that it will not back the Lions’ bid to join Europe’s second-tier competition, the EuroCup. In addition, the governing body is not supporting attempts by the Eagles and the Flyers to join the European North Basketball League. Those competitions are not organised by Fiba, however, so it is unclear at this stage whether the BBF can block them.The BBF rejects claims that it is blocking visa applications, an allegation the federation regards as symptomatic of the entitlement of certain clubs. As the sport’s governing body the BBF is charged with submitting governing body endorsements for potential overseas signings to the Home Office, and feels it is unable to do so for unlicensed clubs. The BBF declined to comment.A spokesperson for the London Lions told The Guardian: “The London Lions stand unequivocally for the principle that British clubs should have the freedom to pursue excellence wherever it exists, to grow the game on the biggest stages.“We hope that the decision to keep Manchester Basketball Club out of Basketball Champions League is reversed, which will allow growth of professional basketball in the UK, providing opportunities for British athletes, coaches, and clubs to compete at the highest level.”Explore more on these topicsBasketballSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Barry Smethurst, 41, a record shop worker trying to travel by rail from Saddleworth to Manchester Piccadilly, did not agree.Waiting on the platform for a morning train that was nowhere to be seen, he asked Meta’sWhatsAppAI assistant for a contact number for TransPennine Express. The chatbot confidently sent him a mobile phone number for customer services, but it turned out to be the private number of a completely unconnected WhatsApp user 170 miles away in Oxfordshire.It was the beginning of a bizarre exchange of the kind more and more people are having with AI systems, in which chatbots try to negotiate their way out of trouble, deflect attention from their mistakes and contradict themselves, all in an attempt to continue to appear useful.Smethurst’s joust with Meta’s AI began when he told it the TransPennine helpline it had dug up looked like a private number. When he asked what this number was, the AI quickly said it shouldn’t have shared it and tried to change the subject, saying: “Let’s focus on finding the right info for your TransPennine Express query!”But Smethurst wanted to know why it had shared the private number, which it turned out belonged to James Gray, 44, a property industry executive from Oxfordshire who is also a WhatsApp user and whose number appears on his company website.The AI explained vaguely it was generated “based on patterns” and promised to “strive to do better in the future” by admitting when it didn’t know an answer. But it then falsely described the number as “fictional” and not “associated with anyone”. When Smethurst challenged that, it admitted: “You’re right,” and said it may have been “mistakenly pulled from a database”.Asked which database, it muddied the waters further by contradicting itself again saying: “I didn’t pull the number from a database. I generated a string of digits that fit the format of a UK mobile number but it wasn’t based on any real data on contacts.”With the conversation going round in circles, Smethurst said he did not believe the chatbot and told it: “Just giving a random number to someone is an insane thing for an AI to do.”“It’s terrifying,” Smethurst said, after he raised a complaint with Meta. “If they made up the number, that’s more acceptable, but the overreach of taking an incorrect number from some database it has access to is particularly worrying.”Gray said he had thankfully not received calls from people trying to reach TransPennine Express, but said: “If it’s generating my number could it generate my bank details?”Asked about Zuckerberg’s claim that the AI was “the most intelligent”, Gray said: “That has definitely been thrown into doubt in this instance.”Developers working with OpenAI chatbot technology recentlyshared examplesof “systemic deception behaviour masked as helpfulness” and a tendency to “say whatever it needs to to appear competent” as a result of chatbots being programmed to reduce “user friction”.In March, a Norwegian manfiled a complaintafter he asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT for information about himself and was confidently told that he was in jail for murdering two of his children, which was false.And earlier this month a writer who asked ChatGPT to help her pitch her work to a literary agentrevealedhow after lengthy flattering remarks about her “stunning” and “intellectually agile” work, the chatbot was caught out lying that it had read the writing samples she uploaded when it hadn’t fully and had made up quotes from her work. It even admitted it was “not just a technical issue – it’s a serious ethical failure”.Referring to Smethurst’s case, Mike Stanhope, the managing director of the law firm Carruthers and Jackson, said: “This is a fascinating example of AI gone wrong. If the engineers at Meta are designing ‘white lie’ tendencies into their AI, the public need to be informed, even if the intention of the feature is to minimise harm. If this behaviour is novel, uncommon, or not explicitly designed, this raises even more questions around what safeguards are in place and just how predictable we can force an AI’s behaviour to be.”Meta said that its AI may return inaccurate outputs, and that it was working to make its models better.“Meta AI is trained on a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets, not on the phone numbers people use to register for WhatsApp or their private conversations,” a spokesperson said. “A quick online search shows the phone number mistakenly provided by Meta AI is both publicly available and shares the same first five digits as the TransPennine Express customer service number.”A spokesperson for OpenAI said: “Addressing hallucinations across all our models is an ongoing area of research. In addition to informing users that ChatGPT can make mistakes, we’re continuously working to improve the accuracy and reliability of our models through a variety of methods.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)WhatsAppMetaSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have not been confirmed by Meta. OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, said it had nothing to add beyond its chief executive’s comments.“They started making these giant offers to a lot of people on our team – $100m signing bonuses, more than that comp [compensation] per year,” Altman told the Uncapped podcast, which is presented by his brother, Jack. “It is crazy. I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that.”He said: “I think the strategy of a tonne of upfront, guaranteed comp, and that being the reason you tell someone to join … the degree to which they’re focusing on that, and not the work and not the mission – I don’t think that’s going to set up a great culture.”Meta last week launched a $15bn drivetowards computerised “super-intelligence”– a type of AI that can perform better than humans at all tasks. The company bought a large stake in the $29bn startup Scale AI, set up by the programmer Alexandr Wang, 28, who joined Meta as part of the deal.Last week, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Deedy Das,tweeted: “The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous”. Das, a principal at Menlo Ventures, said Meta had been losing AI candidates to rivals despite offering $2m-a-year salaries.Anotherreport last monthfound that Anthropic, an AI company backed by Amazon and Google and set up by engineers who left Altman’s company was “siphoning top talent from two of its biggest rivals: OpenAI and DeepMind”.The scramble to recruit the best developers comes amid rapid advances in AI technology and a race to achieve human-level AI capacity – known as artificial general intelligence. The spending on hardware is greater still, with recent estimates from the Carlyle Group, reported by Bloomberg, that $1.8tn could be spent on computing power by 2030. That is more than the annual gross domestic product of Australia.Some tech firms are buying whole companies to lock in top talent, as seen in part with Meta’s Scale AI deal and Google spending $2.7bn last year on Character.AI, which was founded by the leading AI researcher Noam Shazeer. He co-wrote the 2017 research paperAttention is all you Need,which is considered a seminal contribution to the current wave of large language model AI systems.While Meta was founded as a social media company and OpenAI as non-profit –becoming a for-profit business last year– the two are now rivals. Altman told his brother’s podcast that he did not feel Meta would succeed in it’s AI push, adding: “I don’t think they’re a company that’s great at innovation.”He said he had once heard Zuckerberg say that it had seemed rational for Google to try to develop a social media function in the early days of Facebook, but “it was clear to people at Facebook that that was not going to work”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a crazy claim to make, but I think it is true, and if it is correct, then over time I think that will dwarf everything else [AI has achieved].”Explore more on these topicsOpenAISam AltmanMetaExecutive pay and bonusesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMark ZuckerbergnewsShareReuse this content"

There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” he said.Jassy ended the memo by urging employees to be “curious about AI” and to “educate yourself” in the technology and take training courses.“Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fraudsters typically generate revenue on platforms such as Deezer by using bots to “listen” to AI-generated songs – and take the subsequent royalty payments, which become sizeable once spread across multiple tracks.The tactic aims to evade detection measures triggered by vast listening numbers for a small amount of bogus tracks.Thibault Roucou, the director of royalties and reporting at the Paris-based platform, said the manipulation of AI-generated music was an bid to “get some money from royalties”.“As long as there is money [in fraudulent streaming] there will be efforts, unfortunately, to try to get a profit from it,” he said. “That’s why we’re investing in fighting it, because we know it’s not going away and we need to be one step ahead every time.”Deezer deploys a tool it says can detect 100% AI-made content from the most prolific AI music models such as Suno and Udio.Deezer said the AI-generated music streamed by fraudsters ranged from fake pop and rap music to artificial mood tracks. The platform blocks royalty payments for streams it has identified as fraudulent.Deezer revealed in April that AI-generated music now represents 18% of all uploads to its platform, or 20,000 tracks per day. The company said it was removing all fully AI-generated content from its algorithmic recommendations. Deezer has more than 10 million subscribers worldwide, whilemarket leader Spotifyhas 268 million.Roucou said he did not know who was behind the fraudulent streams but the perpetrators appeared to be “organised”. The global streaming market was worth $20.4bn last year, according to trade body the IFPI, representing a sizeable target for fraudsters.In itslatest global music report, the IFPI said fraudulent streaming steals money that “should be going to legitimate artists”. It said generative AI had “significantly exacerbated” the problem.Last year, a musician in the US, Michael Smith, was charged in connection with a scheme to create hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs and stream them billions of times, obtaining $10m in royalty payments.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

But in a security operations room in Oslo, just a few metres from the sparkling fjord and its tourist boats, floating saunas and plucky bathers, maritime cyber experts say not only is it technically possible, but they are poised for it to happen.“We are pretty sure that it will happen sooner or later, so that is what we are looking for,” saysØystein Brekke-Sanderud, a senior analyst at the Nordic Maritime Cyber Resilience Centre (Norma Cyber). On the wall behind him is a live map of the ships they monitor and screens full of graphs and code. Two little rubber ducks watch over proceedings from above.In an unstable world, shipping, ports and terminals are taking on enormous strategic importance as targets for destabilising infrastructure and espionage. This is particularly relevant in the Nordic countries, which share land and sea borders with Russia.Finland and Sweden are now Nato members and all countries are beefing up their defence capabilities amid hybrid attacks and rising fear of war.View image in fullscreenA digital map monitoring the whereabouts of vessels around the world at Norma Cyber.Photograph: Sara Aarøen Lien/The GuardianWith the ever increasing digitalisation of ships – and, as a result, more opportunities for hacking – plus rapidly sharpening AI tools to speed up getting around complicated systems, it is a case of when, not if.View image in fullscreenOslo harbour, from where maritime cyber experts monitor the risks to vessels around the world.Photograph: Karl Hendon/Getty Images“These systems [on ships] are very complex and it is hard to understand how to operate them. But with AI you can just keep asking questions: ‘How does this component work?’, ‘Can you go through this 300-page manual and find me the password?’ So everything goes fast,” says Brekke-Sanderud.Based in the headquarters of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association on the quayside of the Norwegian capital, Norma Cyber works alongside it and the Norwegian Shipowners’ Mutual War Risks Insurance Association (DNK).The three organisations came together two years ago to set up a shipping security and resilience centre to monitor the global threat of war, terror and piracy – physical and digital. They also carry out work on behalf of the Norwegian government.View image in fullscreenNorma Cyber staff, from left: managing director Lars Benjamin Vold; analyst Øystein Brekke-Sanderud; and Øyvind Berget, chief technology officer.Photograph: Sara Aarøen Lien/The GuardianWhile remotely crashing a vessel is technically possible, hackers hoping to cause chaos need not go to such dramatic lengths. Simply making something on a ship stop working could lead to a blackout on a vessel or systems malfunctioning, says Lars Benjamin Vold, Norma Cyber’s managing director.And there is mounting evidence that states are looking to harness these powers against their adversaries at sea.View image in fullscreenAn oil tanker pumping ballast water, one of the functions that could be hit in a cyber-attack.Photograph: Islandstock/AlamyIran is already understood to have researched how to use cyber-attacks to disrupt ballast systems – which pump water into vessels to ensure stability–to affect ships and satellite systems. And April saw an unprecedented hack that allegedly took out116 Iranian Vsat modems– used in satellite communication by ships – simultaneously.“When you talk about nation states, it is about their will to do something,” says Vold.While potential “threat actors” such as Russia and China have extensive capabilities, these also have to align with their mission, which could change at any time.So while the threat level has been relatively consistent, maritime vulnerabilities are on the rise. “Things are digitalising more and more, so there are more potential ways in,” says Vold.Norma Cyber has also reported civilian vessels such as fishing boats, research ships and cargo vessels being used for espionage in the Baltic, north Atlantic and the Arctic. USB devices have also been used to infiltrate maritime systems, including by a China-linked threat actor calledMustang Panda.Last year, Norma Cyber noted 239 disruptive cyber-attacks on the maritime sector, with the pro-Russian group NoName057(16) behind most of them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When crews come up against jamming of satellite navigation systems in the Baltic – Finland has accused Russia of being behind such disruptions – they are left with little option but to navigate without it. “Good seamanship is the best mitigation measure,” says Vold.But as well as the invisible threats of the digital world, the maritime industry is also facing unprecedented physical problems. Vladimir Putin’sgrowing shadow fleetof hundreds of unregulated vessels carrying sanctioned crude oil from Russia to predominantly China and India poses a growing threat to the environment and the global shipping infrastructure.The shadow fleet is made up of ageing oil tankers, the identities of which are hidden to help circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow.

And with15% of crew membersinternationally either Ukrainian or Russian, the composition of crews on ships has taken on new significance since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.“If you have a Russian captain on a ship carrying aid to Ukraine, those don’t mix that well, right?” says Svein Ringbakken, managing director of DNK. “So those are sensitives that are being addressed in the industry.”View image in fullscreenLine Falkenberg Ollestad, adviser to the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and an expert on Russia’s shadow fleet.Photograph: Sara Aarøen Lien/The GuardianLine Falkenberg Ollestad, an adviser at the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and an expert on the shadow fleet, fears its growing presence is creating a “parallel fleet” of underinsured substandard ships operating on the sidelines, where they do not know what is happening on board or the conditions and wages of its seafarers.If there were to be an environmental incident on one of the vessels, she says, it also poses a threat to Norway’s coastline. Some ships listed as sanctioned by the US are still operating, she says. Most of them are at least 15 years old. “Our concern is that the situation is getting worse the longer it continues.”‘Losing hope with every day that passes’: torment of the ships’ crews abandoned at seaRead moreAnother big question, she adds, is whether the whole situation has already gone too far to come back from.“Is the shadow fleet that is operating outside the western jurisdictions the new way?

Last year, almost 20,000 new titles were released on the PC gaming platformSteamalone, the majority disappearing into the content blackhole that is the internet. So when a smaller studio is offered the chance to get on the stage at the Summer Games Fest, an event streamed live to a global audience of around 50 million people, it’s a big deal. Not something that you want to spectacularly misjudge.Enter Ian Proulx, cofounder of 1047 Games. His short slot at the event earlier this month had him walking on stage with a baseball bat to promote the online shooter Splitgate 2 by announcing that he was “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year”, while wearing a cap bearing the slogan “Make FPS great again”. It did not go well. Gamers and fellow developers criticised his decision to diss another studio’s game as well as his politically charged use of a Maga/Trump meme, especially withanti-ICE protestersbeing beaten and arrested just across town. Proulx defended his actions, denying that his use of the cap slogan was political, but four days later hemade an apologyvia X explaining: “We needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.”What Proulx failed to anticipate is that in the fast-paced meme culture of 2025, context, nuance and sociopolitical intricacy are vital and constantly changing. You can’t simply put on a cheeky grin and appropriate whatever signs and symbols are floating around 4Chan – look atElon Muskand how embarrassingly dated his mid-2000s edgelord shtick has become. You can’t deploy the Maga anthem without contextualising it; and you definitely can’t claim to be the cutting edge saviour of the FPS while promoting not only a sequel but a battle royale mode of all things. In 2025 – are you kidding?View image in fullscreenBacklash … will anyone play Splitgate 2 now?Photograph: 1047 GamesI don’t know the exact situation at 1047Games, but I’ve visited hundreds of game development studios all over the world. No matter how progressive they want to appear, there is often, at the very top, a familiar monoculture of middle-class men of a certain age, with certain tastes, who can sometimes overlook the fact that their experiences and views might not reflect those of everybody else. Proulx said something telling: “We tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.” In the boardroom, surrounded by likeminded pals, it probably seemed like a laugh, but perhaps they should have checked with someone else first.Splitgate 2is now in the unfortunate position where a portion of its potential customers were turned off by this ill-judged Maga bit, and an entirely separate portion hate that Proulx apologised for it, thereby capitulating to the woke mind virus. Multiplayer games rely on an engaged community to spread the word about them, so this is very much not ideal.There are smarter things Proulx could have done on that stage with his 30 seconds of fame. When you look back at greatest E3 moments of years gone by, the memorable spectacles have been positive: former Xbox chief Peter Moore and hisHalo 2 tattoo; game artist and director Ikumi Nakamura charming the whole world with her unguarded enthusiasm for Ghostwire: Protocol; actorKeanu Reevesshouting, “You’re breathtaking!” at an audience member during the Cyberpunk 2077 stage show; Swedish developer Martin Sahlin tearing up talking about the platform game Unravel. In a culture heavy with faux machismo and attitude, these charming, funny, daft moments broke through like shards of sunlight. You don’t need to take to the stage with a slogan or a baseball bat. The greatest asset you can wield in this highly digital, massively anonymised creative industry is humanity.What to playArcade-y … Rematch.Illustration: Sloclap/SteamThere are a few eye-catching games our this week, includingDate Everything, a game in which you can flirt with your toaster; Tron: Catalyst, a novel take on Disney’s cyber-universe from Bithell Games of Subsurface Circular fame; andFBC: Firebreak, a three-player co-op spin-off from cult studio Remedy’s oeuvre.I’m personally most interested inRematch, however, an arcade-y 5-v-5 football game whose developers have clearly played a lot of Rocket League. Unlike EA Sports FC, you inhabit just the one player rather than the whole team, and all those players have the same flashy skills, so there’s none of the stats and strategy of EA Sports FC. In other words, this is a football game that you can enjoy without knowing much about football.Available on:PC, PlayStation 5, XboxEstimated playtime:whatever you want to put into itWhat to readView image in fullscreenElegance … Anna Williams in Tekken 7.Composite: Guardian Design;  Bandai NamcoAs part of the Guardian’s Pride month series aboutunexpected queer icons, Keza MacDonald wrote about the Zelda series’Link as a non-binary icon; Jason Okundaye wrote aboutthe divas of the fighting game genre; and Jordan Page wrote aboutthe gender-playfulness of Pokémon.

I’ve always thought Edmund Spenser’s 16th-century epicThe Faerie Queenewould make a great open-world game.”Conveniently, as an English literature graduate myself, this is something to which I have given a lot of thought. In terms of classic works that would make great games, I’d play The Rime of the Ancient Mariner as a dark, rogue-like take on The Oregon Trail with the visual style of The Return of the Obra Din; I’d play Conrad’s Heart of Darkness as a Silent Hill-style psychological horror; or Pride and Prejudice as rules-heavy dating sim (we came enticingly close to this with the now sadly defunct multiplayer online game,Ever, Jane); both Tom Jones and Middlemarch would make incredible open-world adventures.In the category of “historical writers who would now be game designers”, I would put two obvious candidates: Mary Shelley and HG Wells, writers who were interested in and profoundly inspired by science and technology. I’d also say Bertolt Brecht, a dramatist who used various technologies to capture the interest of popular audiences, and August Strindberg, who wrote plays, but also took photographs and dabbled in the occult. I could see him presenting some wild, densely symbolic role-playing adventure at the Summer Games Fest – and he wouldn’t need a baseball bat or a cap with a dumb slogan.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterGame cultureNintendo Switch 2featuresShareReuse this content"

We all know that Mario Kart World isundoubtedly a multiplayer masterpiece, and original Switch games from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet to Zelda have been updated to look amazing on the new console, but there’s otherwise a severe lack of Nintendo-made launch games for the Switch (beyond the £8 tech demo, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour).Thankfully, other developers have stepped in to fill the gap, releasing a bunch of updated versions of games that have been out on other consoles for a while. What should you pick up when you’re tired of Mario Kart World?Hitman World of Assassination: Signature EditionView image in fullscreenShimmering with energy … Hitman: World of Assassination.Photograph: IO InteractiveBuilt to be replayed over and over, Hitman is a series of intricately designed assassination scenarios in settings from the Amalfi Coast to a creepy old UK country manor, each one teeming with tantalising ways to take out your target. Developer IO Interactive maintains a schedule of live events to keep you sneaking back into this morally questionable stealth game. In handheld mode, World of Assassination looks especially stunning, the Switch 2’s HDR screen lending extra vibrancy to a classic Berlin nightclub level. Thankfully, Agent 47’s antics fare just as well in docked mode, each locale shimmering with energy as characters bustle about their routines – all at a good framerate.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate EditionView image in fullscreenImpossible port … Cyberpunk 2077.Photograph: CD ProjektPolish developer CD Projekt Red is back again with another impossible port, the most high profile third-party launch title on Switch 2. Years ago, The Witcher 3 was crammed on to the original Switch at the lowest possible resolution, losing its beauty, atmosphere and arguably something of its essence – but Cyberpunk 2077 fares far better. While this sci-fi RPG infamously chugged along on PS4 and Xbox One, Cyberpunk 2077 is perfectly playable on Switch 2. It supports a litany of motion control options, including new mouse controls, and indoor missions and cutscenes look startlingly good. Yet the futuristic facade begins to unravel whenever you hop into your cybercar. When hurtling around Night City’s seedy streets – especially in the Phantom Liberty expansion – the processors visibly strain under the load, blurring and softening the city around you. If you’re keen to lose yourself in Cyberpunk 2077 wherever you go – or this is your only console – this is a solid enough effort. For everyone else – you’d be best off roaming Night City on PlayStation 5, Xbox or a capable PC.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HDView image in fullscreenStealing away the hours … Bravely Default: Flying Fairy.Photograph: Square-EnixOf all the games I was excited to see running on my shiny new £400 console, an upprezzed 3DS game certainly wasn’t the top of my list. It should have been, as Bravely Default HD breathes new life into one of the best RPGs of yesteryear. Freed from the shackles of a teensy screen, this painterly storybook world suddenly glistens with life and detail. While the simplistic character models betray their 3DS origins during cutscenes, against all odds this endearing playable diorama looks stunning in 4K and even better on Switch 2’s 1080p handheld screen – proving that a good art style really is timeless. Bravely Default is the closest we’ll ever get to a Final Fantasy IX sequel, so if you’ve had enough of getting blue-shelled and are pining for an eye-catching RPG to steal away the hours, look no further.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Sonic X ShadowGenerationsView image in fullscreenBlue blur beauty … Sonic X Shadow Generations.Photograph: SegaWith Mario busy zooming across the racetrack and Donkey Kong’s banana-fuelled escapades still a month away, it falls to the blue blur to bring platforming to Nintendo’s new console. Luckily Sonic’s Switch 2 debut is a thing of beauty. In handheld mode, this remake truly shines, offering a sublime marriage of colour and speed as you’re hunched over that chonky screen. A remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations, this redux adds an all-new Y2K-esque Shadow-centric expansion, a la Super Mario 3D World expansion Bowser’s Fury. What leaves a sour taste, however, is how publisher Sega has priced this. Despite launching on the original Switch last year, owners of the Switch 1 version have no discounted upgrade path for Switch 2, forced to pay full whack once again. This is a fast, fluid and furious port – it’s just a shame for the people who already bought the inferior version.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Kunitsu-Gami: Pathof the GoddessView image in fullscreenCriminally overlooked … Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.Photograph: CapcomOne of 2024’s weirdest games dances and slashes its way on to Switch 2 with delightful results: you are a demon-hunter accompanying a dancing priestess through mythological Japan. A cut above most other launch ports, Kunitsu looks remarkably similar to the PS5 version when playing docked, giving this criminally overlooked game a second lease of life on Nintendo’s new machine. Melding demon-dismembering action with engrossing village defence, Path of the Goddess’s pick up and play game loop fits the Switch 2 perfectly. It takes a noticeable visual hit in handheld, however, so playing on the TV is the optimal way to go.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Yakuza0: Director’s CutView image in fullscreenGraphical highlight … Yakuza 0.Photograph: SegaThis reimagining of Tokyo’s 1980s gangster underground is a game I’ve started multiple times and always abandoned. Yet after playing this sublime Switch 2 port, I’m determined to finally see Kiryu’s story through. Boasting gorgeous lighting and running at 4K and 6OFPS when docked, along with Hitman, this Director’s Cut is a graphical highlight for Nintendo’s new hybrid console. With a drama-laden storyline filled with betrayals, oddball side quests, back alley fisticuffs and drunken karaoke, Yakuza 0 offers the meatiest – and strangest – narrative-led experience currently on Switch 2. With 25 minutes of brand new cutscenes, and an all-new four-player co-op multiplayer mode, this is the definitive version.How good is it on Switch 2? 5/5Street Fighter 6View image in fullscreenSlick and responsive … Street Fighter 6.Photograph: CapcomI can’t help but think fondly about the 3DS launch game Super Street Fighter IV 3D as I batter seven shades of cells out of Ryu on Switch 2. Featuring every mode and fighter yet released, this is a generous package. Battles feel slick and responsive, keeping that core frame rate as reliably consistent as you need in a fighting game. Yet where Street Fighter 6’s art style shone on PS5, its roster of iconic fighters look oddly off-brand on Switch 2. Chun Li’s legs feel disproportionate. Zangief’s eyes bulge as if he’s been straining his bladder during a long haul flight – it all feels like a Temu version of the real thing. If you’ve yet to play Street Fighter 6 elsewhere, these visual quirks will probably go unnoticed, but for those who can hadouken on other platforms, this is one fight worth sitting out.How good is it on Switch 2? 3/5Puyo Puyo Tetris 2SView image in fullscreenLazy … Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.Photograph: SegaSega has let the side down again with Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S: it’s another “upgrade” of an existing Switch game, at full price. Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds a few new multiplayer modes and little else. This puzzle game barely benefits from enhanced resolution or framerate improvements, and there is little point in buying this insultingly lazy launch title. Stick to the Switch 1 version for your fix of gooey globules and trance-inducing tetriminos.How good is it on Switch 2? 1/5Fast FusionView image in fullscreenPulse-pumping … Fast Fusion.Photograph: Shin’en MediaThe Switch 2 launch title least likely to break the bank. A download-only release, this four-player futuristic racer is Wipeout meets F-Zero – and only costs £13.49. Just like Shinen’s Fast Racing Neo on Wii U and Fast RMX on the original Switch, Fast Fusion is a glorious technical showcase, putting the Switch 2’s processors through their paces with stunningly rendered 4K racetracks. With fuse-able vehicles, online showdowns and a predictably pulse-pumping soundtrack, Fast Fusion is the perfect edgy racing counterpart to the saccharine Mario Kart World.How good is it on Switch 2? 4/5Explore more on these topicsNintendo Switch 2GamesNintendoNintendo SwitchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But military action only increases the dangers instead of ending the threatWed 18 Jun 2025 14.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 20.18 EDTShareEighty years after the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and 40 years after the US and Soviet Union pledged to reduce their arsenals, the threat of nuclear war has resurged with a vengeance. The age of disarmament is over, a prominent thinktankwarnedthis week: “We see a clear trend of growing nuclear arsenals, sharpened nuclear rhetoric and the abandonment of arms control agreements,” said Hans M Kristensen of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.The world’s nine nuclear-armed states have amassed the equivalent of145,000 Hiroshima bombs. Israel’s illegal attack upon Iran is purportedly a last-ditch attempt to prevent it joining this club – as Israeldid long ago, though does not admit it. While Tehran possesses the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon if it chose to, US intelligencebelieves it has not made that decision– and would still need up to three years to build and deploy one. Israel does not appear to be striking Iran because US nuclear diplomacy has failed, but because it fears it might succeed. Many of its targets are unrelated to the nuclear programme, and some even to Iran’s military. Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly invoked regime change: more honestly,regime collapse.Few believe Israel can destroy Iran’s nuclear programme without the US. The Israeli prime minister seeks to bait Donald Trump into joining this assault: if he can’t get one of the peace deals he wants, how about taking a military triumph? Mr Trump’s shifting rhetoric has suggested he is beingdragged along, tothe alarm of Maga isolationistsand others who recognise the folly of seeing an easy win. But he may still hope to threaten Iran into a deal.The bigger threat is nuclear proliferation globally. The remaining US-Russian nuclear arms control treaty, New Start, is due to lapse in February – leaving themwithout limits on their arsenalsfor the first time in half a century. Both are already pursuing extensive modernisation programmes. China is still far behind, but its armoury is growing fastest, at around 100 warheads a year. This month’sstrategic defence reviewcommits the UK to spending £15bn on new submarine-launched warheads and opens the door to the reintroduction of air-launched nuclear weapons. North Korea appears to bebuilding a third uranium enrichment site. Taboos elsewhere are eroding, in an increasingly unstable world where impunity reigns. Support for an independent deterrent has soared in South Korea, no longer confident of the US umbrella.Weapons are becoming not only deadlier, but riskier, withthe integration of nuclear and conventional capabilitiesincreasing the prospect of miscalculations. And potential flashpoints dot this bleak landscape. Russia has repeatedlytalked up the threatof nuclear war in Ukraine – but that does not guarantee it is an empty one. India’s unprecedented use of Brahmos cruise missiles in last month’s clash with Pakistan signals a new and dangerous phase in south Asia’s strategic balance.The 2003 US invasion of Iraq, coupled with the survival of North Korea, sent the message that the safest course is not to shun weapons of mass destruction but to pursue and cling to them at all costs. Attacking Iran, whichlimited its programme in exchange for sanctions relief, will only fuel that conviction. It may set back Tehran’s nuclear progress somewhat, but makes it more likely torush for the bomb– and avoid the international scrutiny it previously accepted. Saudi Arabia and others would surely follow fast. Arab and Muslim countries have rightlydenouncedIsrael’s strikes and called for disarmament “without selectivity”. The current crisis makes that look a more hopeless cause than ever – but is the clearest evidence of why it is needed in place of a nuclear race which can have no winners.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As Israel attacks Iran, a moderate rise in oil prices rests on questionable assumptionsWed 18 Jun 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTShareFinancial markets picked up the clear message when Donald Trumpcut shorthis stay at the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies this week. Despite calls from fellow western leaders to de-escalate the crisis, the president’s early return to the White House was taken as a sign that the US is considering joining Israel in its military action against Iran. Trump says hewants Iran’s unconditional surrender.This is where modern summitry came in half a century ago. In 1975, the first meeting of what eventually became the G7 was convened at Rambouillet in France in an attempt to work out a joint response to the oil shock that accompanied the Yom Kippur war betweenIsraeland its neighbours.Back then, the impact of higher crude prices was immediate and brutal. The cost of crude rose fourfold in a matter of months and killed off the post-second world war boom, leading first to higher inflation and then to recession. A second dose of stagflation arrived a few years later when the Iran-Iraq war led to a further doubling of oil prices. Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 again led to higher oil prices and weaker activity. History suggests the Middle East can cause all sorts of problems for the global economy.The response to the latest conflict has been much more muted. Oil prices have risen by about $10 a barrel but that will give only amodest upward jolt to inflationand certainly nothing to compare with the shocks of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. At least so far. The region has form and given the risks, the financial markets are taking a remarkably sanguine view of events, even though there are reasons for a moderate degree of optimism.The first oil shock of the mid-1970s was triggered by an embargo orchestrated by Opec, a producers’ cartel that isless able to affectcrude prices than it was half a century ago. Some countries – the US in particular – are much less dependent on imported oil than they once were. Wind and solar power provide alternatives to fossil fuels. The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has been raging for almost two years, with only a small and short-lived impact on oil prices.All that said, it is less than three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in global oil and gas prices,contributing to a cost of living crisisthat is only just abating. The latest UK inflation figures released on Wednesday showed theannual increase in prices at 3.4%– well down on the recent 10.9% peak but still above the Bank of England’s 2% target.The comparison between the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and Israel’s attacks in the past week is not exact. Russiaaccounts for 17%of global gas production, while Iran is responsible for just4% of oil productionand China is the biggest customer for its crude exports. That helps explain why the financial markets have been relatively relaxed, with the $10 a barrel boost to oil prices reflecting a sense that the conflict will be contained.The US’s potential involvement raises the stakes. One possibility is that the deployment of US military firepower will quickly overcome Iran’s resistance and lead to regime change in Tehran. Another is that Iran will retaliate by seeking to close the strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage through which 20% of the world’s oil passes daily. That would send the price of oil rocketing from its current $75 a barrel to well over $100 a barrel. The shock would be more severe and longer lasting were Russia and China to get dragged into the conflict.The markets are betting that none of this happens.Oilprices are at their current level because dealers think Iran has had its military capability depleted by Israel’s attacks, that Iran would damage its own economy by seeking to close the strait of Hormuz, and that Russia and China will be wary of becoming involved.Iran and Israel crisis: what does it mean for the price of oil?Read moreThings may indeed pan out this way, but the call by the non-US members of theG7for a de-escalation of the crisis highlights the real risk that it might not. Western economies are still feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, higher energy prices and a cost of living crisis, and could well do without another setback. Petrol prices are already set to rise, the first evidence of higher inflation and a fresh squeeze on disposable incomes. It goes without saying that it would be better for the global economy to avoid yet another Middle East oil shock.But if the financial markets have called it wrong and oil prices do start to spiral upwards, it is important that policymakers don’t panic. Higher energy prices are initially inflationary but are then deflationary because they add to business costs and leave consumers with less money to spend. Central banks should resist the temptation to respond by raising interest rates because that would only add to the risks of recession and higher unemployment. Likewise, finance ministers should avoid raising taxes or cutting spending if weaker activity pushes the public finances deeper into the red.In the longer term, countries like the UK need to make themselves self-sufficient in renewable energy and thus reduce their exposure to the Middle East’s fossil fuels. The lesson to be drawn from the damage caused by the repeated oil shocks since the 1970s is that we have been here before and it doesn’t end well.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The answer, it would seem, is the entire establishment. The 33-year-old democratic socialist and New York City mayoral candidate has surged in the polls in recent weeks, netting endorsements not just from progressive voices like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez andBernie Sandersbut also his fellow candidates for the mayoralty, with Brad Lander and Michael Blake taking advantage of the ranked-choice voting system in the primary and cross-endorsing Mamdani’s campaign.With the primary just around the corner, polls have Mamdani closing the gap onAndrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor ofNew York. This has spooked the establishment, which is now doing everything it can to stop Mamdani’s rise.TakeMichael Bloomberg, whoendorsedCuomo earlier this month and followed this up with a$5m donationto a pro-Cuomo Pac. The largesse appears motivated not by admiration for Cuomo – during his mayoralty, sourcestold the New York Timesthat Bloomberg saw Cuomo as “the epitome of the self-interested, horse-trading political culture he has long stood against” – but animosity towards Mamdani and his policies.Mamdani wants to increase taxes on residents earning more than $1m a year, increase corporate taxes and freeze rents: policies that aren’t exactly popular with the billionaire set.Bronx congressman Ritchie Torres (who was once progressive but moved steadily away from that and now receives fundraising assistance fromfar-right donors) is another establishment Democrat trying to prevent a Mamdani win at all costs. Torres, who makes his pro-Israel positions explicit, has criticized Mamdani for pro-Palestine comments. Torres has even said he won’t run for governor in 2026 if a socialist like Mamdani becomes the mayor because it will “revolutionize the political landscape”.The New York Times’ editorial board is also aghast at Mamdani’s sudden popularity. On Monday, itpublished a pieceurging New Yorkers to completely leave the candidate off their ranked-choice ballot, arguing that the assemblyman is woefully underqualified for office and has a bunch of wacky progressive ideas that will never work including free buses and frozen rent. The Times, whichannounced almost a year agothat it will not make endorsements in local elections, did not officially endorse a candidate but it certainly didn’t tell people not to put Cuomo on the ballot. It seems being accused of sexually harassing multiple women and then going after those women in an aggressive and intrusive way (including demandinggynecological records) isn’t as disqualifying as progressive policies. And, of course, the sexual harassment is just one of many scandals that Cuomo has weathered, including allegations hecovered up nursing home deathsduring the pandemic.Nobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great, yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring about changeThe Atlantic also came out withan anti-Mamdani piece, albeit one that was more subtle and which focused on the process rather than the personality. Staff writer Annie Lowrey argued that ranked-choice voting in a mayor primary, used by New York City since 2021, is not truly democratic: “Without ranked-choice voting, Cuomo would probably steamroll his competition. With ranked-choice voting, Mamdani could defeat him.” While there are problems with ranked choice (as there are with first-past-the-post systems), I think the bigger democratic threat might be a system in which a billionaire can swoop in with millions to prop up their preferred candidate at the last minute.All of this is anti-Mamdani mobilization is depressingly predictable: the Democratic establishment is allergic to fresh blood and new thinking. Shortly after Trump won the election last year, and the Democrats also lost the House and the Senate, Ocasio-Cortezlaunched a bidto become the lead Democrat on the House oversight committee, which is an important minority leadership position. Ocasio-Cortez has become a lot more establishment-friendly since getting into power in 2018 (New York Magazine even decreed in 2023 that she is just a “Regular Old Democrat Now”), but she’s still not centrist enough for the Democrats, it seems.Nancy Pelosi reportedly sabotagedthe 35-year-old congresswoman’s ambitions and ensured that 74-year-old Gerry Connolly, who had esophagus cancer at the time, got the job instead. Connollydied age 75earlier this year, becoming thesixth House Democratto havediedin office in 12 months.Then there’s the Democratic backlash to David Hogg, the young Parkland shooting survivor turned politico. The 25-year-old was briefly vice-chair of the Democratic national committee but stepped on powerful toes bycriticizing the partyfor its “seniority politics”. Hogg, who has said that he’s worried about his generation losing faith in democracy, pitched competitive primaries which challenged Democratic incumbents who had become too complacent, injecting new blood into the party. This did not go down well and various members of the DNC had voted to hold new vice-chair elections that could have led to his ouster. Instead of waiting to be kicked out, Hogg recently said he would stepaway from the role.I am not a Mamdani evangelist, but while some of his ideas are a little pie in the sky, he’s authentic and ready to fight for normal people rather than corporate interests. Sure, he doesn’t have a lot of experience. But he has a huge amount of potential. He’s managed to get at least 26,000 New Yorkers to volunteer for him. And I don’t mean they’ve sent a couple of text messages: one week they knocked on almost 100,000 doors. Michael Spear, a professor of history and political science at a Brooklyn college,told Jacobinthe degree to which Mamdani’s campaign has galvanized New York City voters is unprecedented: “I don’t think there is anything like it” in New York history.Nobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great. Everyoneknowsthere is a need for change and yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring that change. Instead of rallying around fresh talent like Mamdani that can clearly mobilize young voters, the Democrats aremulling a $20m planto try to manufacture a “Joe Rogan of the left” who can connect with young men, rather than support an authentic grassroots candidate who is already connecting with them.Will centrist interests prevail in New York? We won’t know until, at the very earliest, late on primary night, 24 June.

Now watch them make the same mistake about Iran | Owen JonesRead moreWhat we heard should have been cause for cautious optimism – yet instead, Washington squandered a rare diplomatic opening, seemingly allowingIsraelto start a disastrous war of choice that may soon drag in the US.Contrary to the narrative that Iran was dragging its feet in negotiations, we saw no evidence of deliberate stalling. In fact, Iran’s worsening economic crisis had created a strong incentive for Tehran to strike a deal – one that would provide sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program, with even the possibility of broader normalization with the US on the horizon. Middle-class Iranians we spoke with elsewhere in Tehran were frustrated with the economic situation and, despite a highly developed sanctions-resistant economy, eager for sanctions relief allowing them greater access to international travel and trade.Iran’s foreign minister, AbbasAraghchi,emphasizedflexibility on nearly every issue outside Iran’s red line on low-level uranium enrichment. That was echoed in private conversations we held with foreign ministry staff and members of the nuclear negotiating team. Domestic enrichment is non-negotiable for Iran but theybelievedthey had front-loaded their concessions to Witkoff, offering up a 3.67% limit on their enrichment with whatever monitoring and surveillance mechanisms were necessary for the US to feel confident the deal was being honored.Enrichment, even at a low level, is a matter of national pride, a symbol of scientific achievement and a defiant response to decades of sanctions, the red line consistently stated in our conversations and one which they thought was agreeable to Witkoff. Iran claimed to be completely blindsided by Witkoff’s 18 Maystatementthat zero enrichment was the only acceptable terms for a nuclear deal but was open to returning to talks to discuss ways forward. After weathering immense economic pain to develop this capability, no Iranian government – reformist or hardline – could feasibly surrender to the zero enrichment demand. The idea that Tehran would dismantle its enrichment program in 60 days, as the Trump administration demanded, was never realistic.The Iranian government seemed empowered enough to make a deal – if the US had been willing to take yes for an answerThis was not mere stubbornness – it was rooted in deep mistrust sown by Trump. The US had already violated the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) by unilaterally withdrawing during Trump’s first term, despite Iran’s verified compliance. Why would Tehran now accept another agreement requiring total denuclearization, with no guarantee Washington wouldn’t renege again?Iranian officials signaled openness to creative solutions, including shipping excess low-enriched uranium to Russia; forminga regional consortiumfor enrichment;allowingUS inspectors to join International Atomic Energy Agency teams – a major shift from previous positions. Other ideas were also floated at the Tehran forum, albeit not from official sources – temporary suspension of enrichment and a pause on advanced IR-6 centrifuges as confidence-building measures.Araghchi’s expressed willingness to return to JCPOA-permitted enrichment levels (below 4%) – was a concession so significant that it drew criticism from Iranian hardliners for giving too much, too soon. This was not the behavior of a regime trying to stall; it was the posture of a government eager for a deal, engaged in an effort to avoid spoilers in Jerusalem, Washington and at home in Tehran, and knowing full well that long, drawn-out negotiations would offer more, not fewer, opportunities for enemies of diplomacy to strike.The US team, led by Witkoff and mediated by Oman, seemed to share this urgency. The Iranian government seemed empowered enough to make a deal – if the US had been willing to take yes for an answer.Yet here we are, on the brink of another Middle East conflict – one that was entirely preventable. Instead of seizing this rare moment of Iranian flexibility, the US chose escalation. The consequences may be catastrophic: a wider regional war, soaring oil prices and the total collapse of diplomacy with Iran for years to come.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it’s taking cues from himShiri Pasternak and Dayna Nadine ScottFederal and provincial governments are ‘flooding the zone’ with damaging corporate giveaways under the guise of resistanceWed 18 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 15.32 EDTShareSteve Bannon calls it “flooding the zone”.Donald Trumpdemonstrated it in his first weeks back in office, when he introduced over 100 executive orders. Regardless of their legal viability, the sheer volume of policy changes is the point. It is a political strategy to overwhelm institutions, courts and social groups, preventing effective opposition.In Canada, we are witnessing our own version of “flooding the zone” from our new prime minister,Mark Carney, in coordination with provincial and territorial premiers. Carney is the former governor of the Bank of England. Before that, he was the governor of the Bank of Canada. He recently won the federal election by defeating a rightwing opponent Canadians feared would steer them too far towards Trump policies. Yet Carney’s “negotiations” with Trump have so far involved gentle reminders that Canada wouldnever become the 51st state, as threatened by the US president, and capitulations to Trump’s demand to strengthen our border security and increase defense spending. In reality, Canada is moving much closer to the authoritarian rule of Trump.Under the guise of “elbows up” – a hockey reference calling on Canadians to fight back against Trump – massive corporate giveaways are taking place across the country. Characterizing Trump’s tariff war as an emergency that demands drastic action, the province of British Columbia has passed Bills 14 and 15, expediting resource extraction and development. In Ontario, Bill 5 was whipped through the legislature in recent weeks, creating Special Economic Zones that the premier says will fast-track mining in the “Ring of Fire” – a vast region of boreal peatlands rich in critical minerals.Federally, Carney has introduced an equally authoritarian legislative proposal called the Building Canada Act, which will grant to cabinet the extraordinary power to waive the application of almost any federal law in respect of projects it deems to be in the “national interest”. He has also introduced omnibus legislation called the “Safe Borders Act”, which willweakenrefugee protections and terminate potentially thousands of pending immigration permits and applications. Moreover, it is likely to be twined with thebeefing up of police and borderforces. Finally, the defense ministerannouncedtens of billions of dollars in spending on new security infrastructure in line with Trump’s new Nato priorities.These so-called “emergency” levers being pulled in the national interest are a complete stunt. Besides a couple of thousand new security recruits – and a small surge of workers for an extremely short period of construction – there is no job creation here, no reduction in cost of living, no difference to Canadians at the grocery store. As ever, almost none of these dollars will “trickle down” to the vast majority of people across the country. Moreover, the fast-tracking of resource extraction involves not only an assault on Indigenous jurisdiction and environmental regulations, but also onworkers’ rights and protections.Instead, let’s look at who really gains from this concentration of new power in the executive branches, and who loses.In British Columbia, it’s the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission line and Ksi Lisims LNG that’s on the docket for approval at the moment. Its financial investors include Wall Street companiesdeeply embeddedin Trump’s inner circle. The Sisson Project in New Brunswick is operated by Northcliff Resources, which is mostly owned by the Todd Corporation based in New Zealand. New Brunswick recently brought the Sisson Mine back from the dead thanks to nearly $30m in cash to the project fromboththe Canadian and US governments.In Ontario, the Ring of Fire has been “explored” by a number of companies, but it is primarily the privately held Wyloo mining company that stands to benefit from Ontario’s decision in Bill 5 to exempt its Eagle’s Nest mine from environmental assessment entirely. This – when combined with Ontario’s bankrolling of the new all-season road through the peatlands that is necessary to get the minerals out – is a huge public subsidy to the company, owned by an Australian billionaire – cynically promoted as shoring up our national autonomy.Indigenous peoples across the country promise that this legislative bullying will generate a backlash of blockades and direct action on the land. To attempt to stem the damage, the Ontario government announced a $70m contribution to theIndigenous Participation Fundfor First Nations to supposedly have more input in regulatory processes, and a tripling of the Indigenous Opportunities Fund, which provides loan guarantees to First Nations seeking to access financing to become proponents of resource extraction projects. The federalIndigenous Loan Guarantee Programhas also been expanded to these same ends, doubling to $10bn.A common thread in this onslaught of new legislation is the creation of “legal black holes” and the dangerous centralization of discretionary power federally within the privy council office and in provincial cabinet offices. Neither equity stakes nor more “consultation” alter the balance of power in these startling new arrangements.What happens when these projects are contested, even despite extensive consultation and the availability of financing? If history is any indication, the needs of federal and provincial governments – citing “critical infrastructure” for securing national interests – will surely take precedence over Indigenous rights.It is not only the tactic of “flooding the zone” that is being replicated here, but the content of how the political emergency is being defined and solved. Who needs to become the 51st state when our own governments are ready to implement all the same policies of pillage and oligarchic power themselves?Shiri Pasternak is an associate professor in criminology at Toronto Metropolitan University.

But ranked-choice voting is also helping make him competitiveWed 18 Jun 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 18.31 EDTShareWith a week left until New York’s Democratic mayoral primary, one might have thought that the former governor Andrew Cuomo would be measuring the drapes at Gracie Mansion. Real estate developers, corporations like Doordash, a smattering of billionaires and even Billy Joelhave shoveled cashinto his campaign, with his Super Pac spending more money than any other outside force in the city’s political history. This is on top of his entering the race with major name recognition advantage, amounting to a20- or 30-point leadas recently as May.But according to a new poll, Zohran Mamdani – the insurgent state assemblyman and democratic socialist whomthe Nation recently co-endorsedalong with fellow mayoral candidate and New York City comptroller Brad Lander – has pulledaheadof Cuomo for the first time.And while Mamdani’s campaign deserves credit for offering a clear, inspiring, progressive message, the fact that he is competitive can also be partly credited toNew YorkCity’s ranked-choice voting (RCV) system. It’s a winning system for candidates who would otherwise be sidelined or would cannibalize each other’s support – and for voters who can finally cast their ballots based on policy rather than pragmatism.America’s politics have long been dominated (or diluted) byfirst-past-the-post (FPTP) voting. In it, citizens cast their ballot for one candidate, and whoever receives the most votes wins. Straightforward as it seems, this method forces an either/or choice, often resulting in voters deciding between the lesser of two evils. Not only does thisreinforce a two-party duopolyin general elections, but it also incentivizes a binary choice between the two leading candidates in primaries.For the candidates themselves, the system encourages scorched-earth campaigns that divide parties and inflame the narcissism of small differences. The progressive senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren came into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary as allies with much more in common ideologically than their centrist opponents. But there was no electoral incentive for either of them to form an alliance with the other. Instead, they fought to consolidate a minority faction within the party, and got mired in agrislyandpublicfeud. The mudslinging did leave one person standing – Joe Biden.In contrast, RCV makes it possible for dark horse candidates to work together. After Mamdani’s campaign reached the fundraising limit, heurged his supportersto donate to a fellow anti-Cuomo candidate, Adrienne Adams. Adams, in turn, has maintained a focus on criticizing Cuomo, even deleting atweetthat was perceived as a swipe at Mamdani. These contenders are making it clear they truly believe – as the Nation’s editorial board wrote in our endorsement – New Yorkers deserve better than Andrew Cuomo.Critics of ranked-choice voting argue it’s too confusing, but successful implementations of the system in other jurisdictions suggest otherwise. In Alaska’s 2022 congressional special election, the first statewide RCV election there,85% of peoplewho cast their ballots said they found the method to be simple. It also enabled the Democrat Mary Peltola to fend off an extremist challenge from Sarah Palin. Maine has also seen promising results from RCV, with60% of its votersfavoring the system. Cities like Minneapolis and Cambridge, Massachusetts, haveenjoyed higher turnoutafter the implementation of RCV.But RCV is only as effective as its participants make it. Ahead of New York City’s mayoral primary in 2021, I wrotea columnexpressing high hopes for how the debut of RCV could reshape the city’s politics. But that race became chaotic for other reasons.Scott Stringer and Dianne Morales’s campaignscollapsed. Advocacy groups had to un-endorse and re-endorse – in some cases, multiple times. There was a progressive effort to coalesce around Maya Wiley, including a belatedendorsementfrom Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Meanwhile, pragmatists who felt Eric Adams and Andrew Yang lacked substance turned to the sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia. If Wiley and Garcia had cross-endorsed, one of them might have defeated Adams. Instead, Adams won the primary in the final round byjust over 7,000 votes.This time, the mayoral candidates seem to have learned. On Friday, Mamdani and Landercross-endorsed each other, encouraging their supporters to rank the other second. Mamdani explained the decision with a refreshing mix of idealism and realism: “This is the necessary step to ensure that we’re not just serving our own campaigns – we’re serving the city at large.” This was followed byanother cross-endorsement, between Mamdani and former assemblyman Michael Blake, on Monday. And the national progressive movement is much more united than it was in 2021, with bothOcasio-Cortez and Sandersendorsing Mamdani in the home stretch this time.By treating each other like allies rather than adversaries, the anti-Cuomo coalition might just prevail. If anything, it is the establishment wing of the New York Democratic party that is struggling to coalesce – as evinced by the New York Times’non-endorsement endorsementthat, if you squint, could be perceived as encouraging New Yorkers to support Cuomo, Lander, hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson, or flee the city.The Nationhas a long history of covering New York’s mayoral races. Although no New York mayor has been elected to higher officesince 1869– just four years after the magazine was founded – the office has long held fascinating implications for American progressivism.Fiorello La Guardia, whom Mamdani and Lander have both named as thegreatest mayorin the city’s history, took office at the height of the Great Depression and led the city through the second world war. Over 12 years of cascading crises, he transformed the city with a bold vision characterized by expanding public housing and public spaces, curbing corruption, and unflinchingly supporting the reforms of the New Deal.Now, nearly a century later, New Yorkers have an opportunity to bring the city into a new era once again. And ordinarily, making that kind of change possible would require making a tough choice. But if it happens this time, it will be because of a ranked choice.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsNew YorkOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

You can pick up a Trump bible and some of Melania’s lovely “Vote Freedom” jewellery. You can stay in one of his hotels, golf in his resorts, and get yourself aTrump watch. You can buy some of the Trump-branded cryptocurrency that has made the familyextremely rich. You can also, as announced on Monday, buy a gold Trump smartphone for just $499 and useTrump mobile as your service providerfor $47.45.I know what you’re thinking. All this is wonderful, but where are the Trump-branded home goods? How can I demonstrate my loyalty to the president while cooking stew in my kitchen? Well, I have great news. Because capitalism is relentless, the Instant Pot brand is coming out with a Trump-inspired design. (Instant Pot, if you’re not familiar, is a pressure cooker thatgained a cult-likefollowing several years ago, then went on adownward spiralwhen it was bought by a private equity firm.) The company isapparently planningvarious products emblazoned with “Make America Great Again”.According toSemafor, a portion of the profits of the Instant Pot collaboration will be donated to the “Trump Presidential Library”. At least two other home goods companies are also reportedly planning Trump-related releases, with profits being donated to Trump’s library. These include a tableware and collectible items company that has proposed plates with Trump’s face on them. Another company is thinking about a “Mar-a-Lago” and “White House” sheets collection. So you can really get into bed with the government.It doesn’t end here, does it? I imagine product development teams across the US are in brainstorming mode right now and we can look forward to more Trump-adjacent products with profits donated to Maga causes. Perhaps some enterprising confectionery company will come out withICEcream: with every purchase going towards deporting an immigrant. Supplement companies could start sellingred pills. If Elon Musk gets back in Trump’s good books, perhaps we’ll get Musk-branded contraception: guaranteed to never work, to help his pro-natalist plans. And, consideringTrump’s purported nickname(“Trump Always Chickens Out” or Taco), Taco Bell surely has scope to get in on the action.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMarketing & PRConsumer affairscommentShareReuse this content"

Empty seats – which are apparently a festering scourge upon the game of football or a tragedy representing the plastic bankruptcy of American soccer fandom and/or the Club World Cup – have been commonplace in the competition’s opening dozen games. Social media is awash in panoramic photos of empty banks of seats, informing you that this image, so obscene in its emptiness, was taken a mere 45 minutes before kickoff – or (gasp) even closer.Why do we care? What is it about the sight of a whole lot of plastic folding chairs with nobody in them that inflames our passions? Since when did we all becomeClint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention?Trent Alexander-Arnold takes first step of Real Madrid high-wire act | Barney RonayRead moreEmpty seats mean unrealized revenues from tickets, concessions, merchandise, parking and exploitative fees, but that stuff isn’t affecting our bottom line. The marketing strategy that demanded premium prices for those seats was misguided at best and laughably hubristic at worst, but it was not ours. There were plenty of inflated promises about guaranteed sellouts, the “greatest spectacle in club football history”, involving the “32 best teams in the world” that are being made to look completely silly in hindsight – but we weren’t the ones who promised them. At most, the extent of our involvement with an empty seat at theClub World Cupis sitting next to one.Still, the tenor of the zeitgeist contains a strange mix of worry, sadness, and above all, cynicism. The empty seats are taken as a physical sign that whileFifamay care a little about games taking place in front of passionate fans, it cares far more about the money it gets from selling the TV rights, advertising space, and other considerations – often to the sovereign wealth fund of the country hosting a future World Cup, or the previous one. In theory, the empty seats prove that fans and atmosphere – the things that make soccer what it is – are of secondary importance.I would suggest that these critiques, while valid and true, miss the point. We are just talking about seats here. Not all of them are empty, and many of them are in very, very large stadiums. So far, Club World Cup venues have been about 52% full on average, using attendance figures as announced by Fifa. (In reality, those figures are likely far more representative of the number of tickets sold or distributed rather than butts in seats, but they at least give us an idea.) Going by the median percentage, which downplays the outliers, stadiums have been at 43% capacity.View image in fullscreenFluminense fans were loud and boisterous in their team’s 0-0 draw with Dortmund.Photograph: Elsa/Fifa/Getty ImagesThose are ugly numbers. If a professional club team (or several) consistently played in front of stadiums that were half-full or less, one might question whether they’re playing in the right stadiums. If this dynamic sounds vaguely familiar to you, you may be a fan of MLS. The US first division began its life by living a week-in, week-out version of this very problem – a new competition that nobody knew quite what to make of, with most teams playing in massive NFL or college football stadiums in which even decent crowds were made to look minuscule and sparse. The league slowly but surely learned its lesson – nearly every one of its 30 teams plays in their own intimate grounds, the largest of which top out at about 30,000. It’s not a league of constant sellouts, but the environments have improved markedly. It’s a lesson Fifa should have learned, given they’re hosting this tournament in MLS’s backyard. There were plenty of raucous Brazilian fans on hand at the cavernous MetLife Stadium on Tuesday for Fluminense’s draw with Dortmund, but the 84,000 capacity venue was still half-full. It leaves you to wonder how much more intense the occasion might have been just down the road at the 25,000-capacity Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls (which is also more easily-accessible by public transit).Myriad other factors have affected turnout.There are well-founded fears of Ice raids, which may well have kept immigrant fans – undocumented or not – away from stadiums. For traveling fans, visa processing times have been a nightmare. In the case of teams like Ulsan Hyundai, Urawa Red Diamonds and Mamelodi Sundowns, the competition is far enough away to make travel all but impossible. For domestic fans, many games take place in the middle of workdays. And that’s without even getting into ticket prices, which started in the hundreds of dollars and have only dropped as the dynamic pricing model has kicked in with kickoffs looming.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seen another way, thousands of Atlantans (as well as Chelsea and LAFC fans) showed up despite all the mitigating factors listed above, in the middle of a Monday work day, for a game in a competition that nobody seems to know what to make of, involving an MLS team that plays 3,000 miles away and who only officially qualified weeks ago. I submit to you that, given all that, the attendance was a minor triumph. Chelsea will play in front of fewer fans when they visit Bournemouth’s Dean Court this upcoming Premier League season.Similarly, perhaps it should be celebrated that just under 35,000 came to see Flamengo play Esperance de Tunis later that night in Philadelphia, or that 40,311 dealt with the well-known traffic and crowd issues at the Rose Bowl to watch Monterrey v Inter. These are not the sellouts Fifa promised, but those promises, like many Fifa boasts, were stupid. The enthusiasm evident in the crowds themselves tell the rest of the story.When crowd sizes rankle, perhaps the problem is one of perception; of Fifa’s uncanny ability to get in its own way. Football’s world governing body has allowed the luxurious excesses of the World Cup – as in the actual one, the one that will take place next year – to cloud its vision of what this tournament, what the club game, is and can be.The World Cup hasprestige. So much prestige, in fact, that fans can be assured that no matter which teams they’re going to see, they will be watching a seminal moment in the modern history of those countries’ sporting stories; and perhaps a milestone in the life of a country itself. Being a club fan is far more intimate, even for the biggest clubs in the world. It’s a regular, everyday devotion that simply doesn’t fit with Fifa’s maximalist tendencies.Maybe that’s why empty seats at these games have become such a focal point – they’re an uncomfortable reminder that the world of every club is only so big.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It was the G8 from 1997 to March 2014. Then Russia annexed Crimea and had itsmembership suspended,establishing the rule that participating nations should not seize their neighbours’ land.The White House used to condemn that sort of thing on the grounds that “it violates the principles upon which the international system is built”. These days, not so much. On Sunday, shortly after arriving for a G7 meeting in the Kananaskis resort in Alberta, Donald Trump told his host, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, that Vladimir Putin’s expulsion from the clubhad been a “big mistake”.Within 24 hoursTrump was back in Washington. There is precedent for the early departure. In June 2018, during his first term,Trump bailed on a G7 summitto meet North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. This time he cited the escalating Israel-Iran conflict.That crisis is serious enough to justify the president clearing his diary of extraneous commitments. But it is revealing that dialogue with the US’s closest allies is a disposable engagement.Arrogant unilateralism is an old feature of US foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. It is the prerogative of a superpower to disregard input from its strategic dependents. But Trump’sG7snub is not just a crass exaggeration of the usual American style. Sympathy with dictators and discomfort in the company of democrats express Trump’s governing ethos.“America First” is a doctrine that cannot conceive of mutual obligation between nations. There can be no G7, only the G1 and clients. Leaders who operate in deference to law and independent institutions are weak and contemptible. Strongmen who recognise no legitimate brake on their actions, who have folded the national interest into a personality cult, are admirable.To say that Trump indulges Putin misconstrues the balance of power. The US is vastly stronger than Russia, but its presidency, bound by fussy checks and balances, lacks the despotic agency of the Kremlin. Trump is envious.He claims simply to want deals with dictators, but he seems also to crave validation from them. By contrast, he thinks it is humiliating for the US commander-in-chief to be seated at a round table as the peer of a German chancellor or the prime minister of Canada – barely a proper country. The idea of coordinating foreign and trade policy on the basis of shared respect for political pluralism and the rule of law is an idea Trump finds absurd, if he even understands it.His agenda is dissolution of the west. The US’s former allies need to recognise the magnitude of that ambition. Even when it is acknowledged, the scale of the challenge poses paralysing dilemmas. Layers of economic and military dependency are not easily peeled back. That is true for all of Europe, but especially Britain, where servicing the “special” transatlantic relationship has been the axiomatic priority for decades. The road to a different strategic configuration, closer to allies on our own continent, is made rockier by Brexit.British audiences watching Trump defile the US constitution might wishKeir Starmerwould give voice to their dismay. But there will be no “Love Actually moment” – the term used derisively by diplomats for a fantasy re-enactment of Hugh Grant’s cinematic rebuke to a swaggering, lecherous bully from the White House.Seasoned Trump handlers warn that disagreeing with the vindictive, thin-skinned president is best done behind closed doors. The art is not to challenge his view, but dress up dissent as a smarter way to satisfy his interests. Contradicting him in public is an act of self-injuring futility.Confrontation is not Starmer’s style and his method is not fruitless. Trump found time on his curtailed trip to Canada tosign the executive orderimplementing a milder regime of punitive tariffs on Britain than is faced by most other countries.“I like them,” Trump said in explanation of relative leniency for British exporters. (The compliment was confounded by his mistakenly describing it as a deal with the EU.)Being liked by Trump is a transient condition. His deals are perishable. The ones signed with Canada and China in his first term were discarded. There are short-term commercial gains to be made by playing along with this capricious game, but the cost is accepting that the old rules no longer apply.That is bad for free trade and cataclysmic for democracy and international law. Over time, reluctance to say aloud that Trump is an authoritarian menace to the US’s constitutional republic becomes complicity in the assault.The justification for silence is realpolitik – the argument that foreign policy should be moulded to the world as it is, not brandished as a demand that it be something else. But Trump inhabits a world fashioned around his own narcissistic delusions, populated by corrupt sycophants and far-right ideologues. Realpolitik in Trumpland is not an accommodation with reality but its wilful negation. It means normalising a project to hollow out US democracy, fill the shell with tyranny and call it freedom.Solidarity with Americans who are resisting that process is one reason for leaders in other countries to talk about it more candidly. Another is to anticipate and contain the risk of contagion.The Maga movement is indigenous to US politics, and not all of its culture-war obsessions resonate across the Atlantic. But it is also an ideological mothership supporting a flotilla of extreme nationalist parties, campaigns and digital influencers in the EU and the UK.Nigel Faragesails in that slipstream. The Conservatives drift aimlessly alongside.Trump himself is deeply unpopular in Britain, ranked unfavourably even by Reform UK supporters. HenceFarage is not as quickas he once was to boast of chumminess with the Mar-a-Lago crew. He also bristles when reminded that he oncespoke of admiration for Putin. It is one of few lines of questioning that unsettles the mask of amiable composure.In the coming years, Farage has a balancing act to perform, fellow-travelling with a global consortium of far-right provocateurs and Kremlin apologists, while cultivating the aura of mainstream respectability required of a potential prime minister. He is well practised at the trick. It might be harder if the dark nature of his politics, the reliance on division, the cynical stirring of conflict, could be exposed by association with Trump; the British franchise of a toxic brand.That argument is harder to make as long as the reality of what is happening in the US is smothered in a gloss of realpolitik. Fear of provoking the tyrant keeps democratic leaders from telling the unvarnished truth about his regime. It is a risk. But a more insidious danger grows in silence, and there is no method for countering tyranny that leaves the truth unspoken.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next four yearsExplore more on these topicsG7OpinionDonald TrumpKeir StarmerNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I won’t be at the roundtable but I do have a few ideas.First off, remember that productivity is the amount you produce with the hours and equipment you have. Work better with what you have or (usually) get better equipment to do your work faster, and productivity increases.It is not about reducing the cost of producing things. Getting paid $10 less an hour to do the same amount of work does not increase productivity even if your employer is more profitable.Wealthy Australians are worried we might realise how rigged the system is in their favour | Greg JerichoRead moreUnfortunately, productivity is often confused with profit and so business groups argue the key is lower company tax. They claim this will increase investment in things that increase productivity (such as new equipment or new buildings and structures).The evidence,though, is pretty nonexistent.The massive 2017 Trump company tax cuts, for example, which cut the federal US company tax rate from as high as 35% to a flat rate of 21% did bugger all to spur investment:If the graph does not display click hereHopefully the Productivity Commission will heed the advice of the current productivity commissioner, Danielle Wood, who in 2018wrote that cutting the company tax ratewould “see national incomes go backwards for six years”.And income is really what productivity is about – specifically workers’ income and their living standards.In theory, the real value of how much you earn an hour should rise in line with productivity. In the 1990s this mostly happened but from 2000 onwards workers have missed out:If the graph does not display click hereSo, when worrying about productivity, we must remember to ask who benefits.But what could the government do to improve productivity? Here is a short, non-exhaustive list.Abolish the fuel tax creditThis year, the government will pay about $10bn in diesel fuel rebates to mining and transport companies and the agriculture sector. By 2028-29 it will be $13bn. Despite growing almost as fast as the NDIS, we never hear the government talk about needing to rein in the expense:If the graph does not display click hereBut the fuel tax credit not only encourages use of fossil fuels, it creates a disincentive to investment in more efficient and productive new vehicles –such as electric trucks.Fund research and developmentResearch and development is vital to produce new equipment and technology (such as electric trucks). But the Australian government spends much less on R&D than most other OECD governments:If the graph does not display click hereDump the instant asset write-off for small businessThe government in April extendedthe $20,000 instant asset write-off for small business. This was purely a political rather than economic decision. Rather than encourage investment in productivity enhancing equipment, it is mostly a tax rort to buy big utes.How do we know this? Well, last weekthe AFR’s wealth reporter, in a column about avoiding paying tax, described the instant asset write-off as “a favourite perk of small businesses and sole traders”. They ain’t lying.Stop encouraging investors buying propertyWhat else is a bad productivity investment? Residential land. It adds bugger all. ButAustralians devote far too much capital to property– almost 2.5 times that of the US:If the graph does not display click hereOur tax system encourages this with the 50% capital gains tax discount and negative gearing, while also reducing housing affordability.TheParliamentary Budget Office estimatedthat removing the tax discount and negative gearing on investment properties would raise about $13.35bn in 2025-26.Put dental in MedicareDental health hurts the economy and reduces productivity because workers avoid going to the dentist because of the cost and end up with chronic issues that reduce output. A public system would be much more productive because it would massively reduce the cost hurdle for workers.The PBOestimated that putting dental into Medicarewould cost $13.7bn. Rather conveniently for us, that is essentially the same as removing the CGT discount and negative gearing.GST on private school fees and private health insuranceBy the same token, we know health systems that are dependent on private health insurance, such as in the US, are unproductive because the resources devoted to them deliver worse outcomes than public health:If the graph does not display click hereAustralia’s health system is generally well regarded buta recent report notedthat we faired quite poorly when it came to access to care.Private health insurance is not a productive industry – consider the hours and expense devoted to marketing that yields no extra benefit.The same goes for private schools and the fees people pay. A 2022 study found that private educationdoes not improve a student’s academic performance. More resources devoted to no better outcomes is the essence of poor productivity.Currently both are exempt from GST, which effectively incentivises people to spend money on them (as does allowing donations to build structures in private schools to be tax deductible).Including both within the GST would deliver revenue that could go to improving productive public schools and hospitals, while repairing the shrinking tax base of the GST.Best of all, because richer households spend more of their income on both private school and private health insurance, the tax would actually be progressive.If the graph does not display click hereControversial? Of course. Which is why a government would also want to announce something huge – like say dental in Medicare.Productivity is an ongoing issue but the key is to always think about who benefits from changes and that the solutions are not about increasing profits or offshoring labour or reducing workers’ pay but should always be about making people’s lives better.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsBusinessHousingTaxSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Now a precedent has been setCharles Watson is chair and founder of River ActionWed 18 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 13.27 EDTShareThe recent ecologicalcollapse of the River Wyedue to pollution from intensive agriculture has been well documented. But the slow-motion repetition of this ecocide on the neighbouring River Severn has largely unfolded out of sight.For years, local authorities have been waving through industrial-scale livestock production units across the catchment of this iconic river. These toxic megafarms produce vast quantities of animal waste, which is spread on local land with minimal consideration for the cumulative environmental destruction it can cause.This week, the high court called time on this practice. In a landmark ruling, the court quashed Shropshire council’s planning permission for a230,000-bird intensive poultry unitnear two protected wetland sites and a mile from the banks of the Severn. The court found the council had unlawfully failed to assess the cumulative impact of adding yet another waste-spewing chicken megafarm to an already bloated cluster ofintensive poultry units(IPUs).Digestate, the byproduct of these plants, is often spread excessively on farmland. It can be highly toxic and rich in nitrates and phosphates, the very substance fuelling ecological collapse in rivers such as the Wye and Severn. The court found this risk was not incidental but a foreseeable impact that should have been evaluated under the law.This judgment sets a critical precedent. Local planning authorities can no longer ignore the full environmental footprint of these developments. They cannot assume waste vanishes once it leaves the farm gate. Most significantly, they cannot continue treating each factory farm unit as isolated when together they create a systemic environmental crisis.In Shropshire, more than 28m chickens are crammed into anescalating number of industrial sheds. The proposed site was just 400 metres from another unit housing nearly half a million birds. Satellite images show many others blanketing the surrounding landscape.This slow death by poultry units has been made possible by a negligent planning system. It also exposes a gaping hole in how environmental waste is regulated. Digestate is not benign. The dense concentrations of nitrates and phosphates it carries fuel catastrophic algal blooms. Yet councils have routinely treated it as someone else’s problem. The court was clear: those days are over.It also struck down Shropshire’s vague, unenforceable planning conditions, which tried to shift responsibility for manure disposal to third parties without oversight or accountability. This legal sleight of hand no longer holds. Local authorities now must know, and can enforce, exactly what happens to the waste. “Somewhere else” is no longer a defence.The ruling lands at a crucial political moment. The Labour government has made clear its intent toloosen planning restrictionsin the name of growth. But environmental protections are not bureaucratic burdens. They are the last line of defence against irreversible harm. This case reaffirms that environmental law has teeth and must be upheld even as politics shifts towards deregulation.So what happens now? Shropshire council has confirmed it will not appeal. The developer may resubmit a new application, but any future proposal must address the court’s findings: a lawful environmental impact assessment and a rigorous, science-based assessment of cumulative harm under the habitats regulations.More broadly, this judgment should send shockwaves through the planning system. Councils will have to stop rubber-stamping similar poultry applications and should review their processes. Developers will face greater scrutiny. And communities fighting to defend their rivers now have powerful new legal tools at their disposal.Revealed: More than 24,000 factory farms have opened across EuropeRead moreOf course, there will be resistance. The big agri lobby will whine about red tape. But what it calls red tape is simply the law – which is put in place to protect public and environmental health, not industrial convenience. If you want to dump another 200,000 chickens into a river catchment already choking on phosphates, the burden is now on you to prove you won’t make things any worse.Having instigated and funded this landmark legal action, River Action will now go into overdrive to ensure this case law is embedded across the UK’s planning system. We’ll also support other courageous local campaigners – like our advisory board member Dr Alison Caffyn, who personallyled the Shropshire claim. Backed by our legal team, we’re fully armed for the fight againstindustrial factory farming.Had this ruling come a decade earlier, the River Wye’s collapse might have been prevented.

But just staying at home is no answerWed 18 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTShareAfter coordinatedprotests across Europe last weekend, it’s easy for the ethically conscious tourist to feel uncertain. Across southern Europe – and particularly in Spain, Italy and Portugal – there are headlines blaming visitors for everything from overcrowding to housing shortages. In gentrifying neighbourhoods, slogans such as “Tourists go home” have appeared on walls and windows, with some angry residents grabbing headlines bysquirting water pistols at tourists.Does that mean a golden age of tourism is over? No. Does the complicated relationship between those who want to visit the world’s most interesting places and those who live in them need a reset? Probably.For the most part, protesters are calling for a total overhaul of a model of tourism that, they argue, drives up housing costs, harms the environment and creates low-paid, unstable jobs – while concentrating profits in the hands of a few.I’ve seen this first-hand. I live inLavapiés, a vibrant and multicultural neighbourhood near Madrid’s main train station. When I moved here 12 years ago, the area was a haven of traditional bars and restaurants and independent shops. Today, many of those restaurants – once offering a fullmenú del díafor €8 (£6.80) – have doubled their prices. A recently built Ibis hotel, complete with a digital price board resembling a petrol station display, now advertises fluctuating nightly rates of about €150 to €250. Local businesses have been replaced by ground-floor tourist accommodation, with passersby able to peer straight into capsule bedrooms from the street.Lavapiés has one of the highest concentrations of unlicensed tourist rentals in Madrid. These small flats, originally built in the 18th and 19th centuries to house the city’s growing industrial workforce, remained affordable for centuries. Now, thousands of such flats are listed on Airbnb at rates rivalling those in the city’s wealthiest neighbourhoods. But tourists aren’t choosing these places maliciously – short-term rental platforms offer cheaper, more flexible options for groups, especially in a market where a basic hotel room can easily cost €100 or more a night.This is not just a story of tourists replacing local people; it’s one of policy failure and economic imbalance. In Madrid, decent food is often still relatively affordable – but the same can’t be said for accommodation. The charming, no-frills guesthouses with lace curtains and wrought-iron balconies are disappearing fast, and the gap they leave behind is being filled by unlicensed rentals in former homes. There are roughly 15,000 illegal tourist apartments in Madrid alone, rising to more than 66,000 across the country.To its credit, Spain’s leftwing coalition government has attempted to regulate rents and pledged to build more housing. But these plans, combined with resistance from regional governments, fail to address the immediate impact that tourist rentals have on the availability of affordable homes. In the case of Madrid, the regional government, presided over by the rightwing People’s party (PP), has refused to declare “high-tension areas” in order to allow city councils to limit rent increases as provided for in the new national legislation.View image in fullscreenGraffiti at a protest in Barcelona, Spain, 15 June 2025.Photograph: Marta Perez/EPALikewise, the PP-dominated Madrid city council recently approved a modification of town planning rules, formally separating tourist accommodation from residential buildings. Although the official line is that this is a step towards protecting housing for local people, it has in reality paved the way for entire buildings to be converted into tourist-only properties and made it easier to transform ground-floor commercial premises into tourist lets.As southern Europe’s cities and islands have passed a tipping point, some are calling for an outright ban on tourist flats, starting with those that are unlicensed. That may be necessary, but solving the housing crisis will take more than just tighter regulations and housebuilding – the other half of the equation is addressing the lack of decent, mid-range places for tourists to stay. Spain continues to build hotels, but too many new developments are glitzy four- and five-star projects aimed at luxury travellers. This shortage of modest, comfortable accommodation mirrors the broader shortage of affordable housing for residents.As Europe responds with growing resentment towards tourists, many people are asking: is it even possible to enjoy a trip without contributing to the problem? Can you still visit Madrid, Barcelona or the Canary Islands without encountering the “Tourists go home” signs – or being squirted with water pistols? Should you?Campaigners mount coordinated protests across Europe against ‘touristification’Read moreThe answer is yes. First, it’s important to put the water pistol incidents in perspective: these are symbolic, isolated acts and far from the norm. More importantly, tourism is vital to Spain’s economy,accounting for roughly 12% of GDP. The country wants tourists, but that doesn’t mean business as usual should continue. National and regional governments, and city councils, must do far more to regulate short-term rentals, support local communities and invest in affordable infrastructure – for residents and visitors.But travellers have an important role to play too: by choosing accommodation designed for tourists wherever possible; by learning about housing pressures in the places they visit; or by exercising judgment about where and when to travel. Opting to visit a resort town on the mainland rather than a city on an island might put less pressure on local communities and resources, for example.Times can be tense, but don’t let guilt define your presence as a tourist. Feeling bad for visiting a place only plays into resentment and shifts the focus away from where it belongs: on deficits in housing and tourist accommodation. My advice is no more water pistols: instead, plan and build so countries work for residents and tourists.Leah Pattem is a multimedia journalist based in SpainExplore more on these topicsOvertourismOpinionSpainItalyPortugalEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Whether anti-abortion, anti-transgender, anti-immigrant, anti-human rights or just anti anyone who doesn’t look like them, they are collaborating; amplifying one another and sharing their political and cultural successes. Their rhetoric now dominates our discussions, and increasingly our ballot boxes. In response, some argue caution or even capitulation – as if we can stop the public being dragged to the extremes if we speak in hushed tones or water down our ambitions for social justice. As we witness the consequences of this, it is time to speak up for those values that drive us to show that another future is possible.On Tuesday, parliament had the opportunity to set abortion in England and Wales on the same modern, regulated footingas it is in Northern Ireland: as a human right. Instead, a vote on this was explicitly blocked by the providers of this service and their supporters, telling MPs to back another amendment, to get a single exemption from prosecution for women “over the line” instead.That is what happened. In contrast, my proposed amendment would have gone further, offering “protection to all those involved in ensuring that women can access safe and legal abortions”.In the current parliament, any pro-choice amendment would have passed. A critical opportunity not just tostop the destructive prosecutionsand investigations under outdated laws of everyone, including medics, but to also protect access for the 250,000who have an abortion every year, has been missed. As a result, the laws that make abortion a criminal act remain, ready to be exploited by those who wish to attack access should they come to power.The right to abortion is under threat in Britain. Secure it now – or risk losing it  | Stella CreasyRead moreWith the Donald Trump playbook increasingly dominating our politics, such judgments about what to fight for and when will become even harder – and even more important – in the coming months and years. Even when presented with evidence of the risks to women’s rights, progressives in the UK retain a confidence that isn’t merited. US colleagues warn of the compromises made in the Barack Obama and Joe Biden years on securing abortion rights that left them so exposed. Although Trump pledged not to get involved in abortion as an issue, within his first week back in office he signeddirectives to attack accessas well aspardon those who harassed clinicians.Many in the UK may have been shocked bythe overturning of Roe v Wade, but to those working on abortion access, it was entirely predictable. Pleas to get ahead of these forces fell on closed ears there and have now done the same here. Now, US medicsfight extradition chargesfor providing abortion care to those who have crossed state lines to access one. Legislatorsreclassified abortion medicationas a dangerous substance to reduce access. Funding for family planning clinics is being cut off as well as international programmes that support women’s healthcare – all in the name of promoting family values.Networks using women’s bodies as the battlefield for the culture wars are not just in the US. Across Europe, restrictions on access and bans are being put forward and won by far-right political groups once in office. In Poland, abortionhas been effectively bannedsince 2020. In Italy, under Giorgia Meloni, anti-abortion activists are now beingencouraged into abortion clinics. Under Viktor Orbán, women in Hungary seeking an abortion are now required tolisten to the foetal heartbeat repeatedlybefore treatment. The cross-pollination of hatred across issues such as immigration, gender and ethnicity exists on this topic, too. Across the world, these forces whip up allegations of “abortion at birth” or “sex selection”. Our mainstream newspapersrepeat these claims, claims that have no foundation in the medical evidence, but deter those with the power to protect women’s rights from acting for fear of appearing to endorse such acts.View image in fullscreenReproductive rights protesters outside the Heritage Foundation following the election of Donald Trump, Washington DC, 9 November 2024.Photograph: Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockEvents of this week reflect how these ideologies and those who follow them are already defining what those on the left consider possible in office. But those on the right will not stop their attacks because we pull our punches – indeed, they will become increasingly emboldened, believing that they have us on the back foot.As the culture wars intensify, the left needs to set out not its blue roots, but its true roots, showing how, at its best, it delivers emancipation. That means telling a story that recognises how poverty, inequality and injustice take many individual forms but are collectively devastating. Each holds back people in every community from realising their potential, to the detriment of all of us who will not benefit from what their talents can achieve. Rights – whether human, reproductive or economic – act as a launchpad for such freedom. Ours vision for the future is one in which equality liberates the ability to succeed – whatever race, sex, religion or age you are, or what political view you hold.In the coming months and years, attacks on progressive values will intensify. As we face them, let this missed opportunity to reform our abortion legislation so that it is fit for the 21st century, remind us all that half measures are not what we are in politics to take. In politics, as in life, fortune favours the brave, and the alternative possible future that these forces wish to snatch from our children compels us to fight for it – not least because we know those opposed to it will never be satisfied.As we face what comes next, regret has no place in our toolbox for securing progressive outcomes. But remembering this moment and learning from it is vital.Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionHealthWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, the cereal company, and not just because cereal is all I have time to eat in between my many jobs.The Kellogg’s factory in Battle Creek, Michigan, was where, in the early 20th century, the dream of a world free of work and rich in recreation first took off – and even, for a few brief shining years, soared. In 1930, the “managed work reduction” movement – seeking to take advantage of the productivity gains enabled by automation to usher in a golden age of leisure – found an influential champion in WK Kellogg.Intrigued by the utopian possibilities, Kellogg opted to shorten his factory’s workday from eight hours to six, and increased daily shifts from three to four. The 30-hour working week was widely taken up by US business leaders as asmart and progressive strategy– not just protecting against the threat of mass unemployment caused by mechanisation, but also spreading the benefits. Forbes magazine reported the following year that “thinking men in industry are saying … ‘Shorter hours for men and longer hours for machines’.”By the 1932 US presidential election, the six-hour workday was the favoured solution to national unemployment, and hours were expected to continue to decline nationally. “No one thought it would stop,” says historian Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt, the author of Kellogg’s Six-Hour Day and Free Time: The Forgotten American Dream. “For the most part, people were optimistic: the definition of progress was higher wages and shorter hours.”And yet what we wound up with, not just in the US but globally – as you will doubtless be aware – was not “mass leisure” or even shorter days made possible by machines, but longer hours spent toiling on them. By 1940, support for managed work reduction had all but evaporated, reflecting missteps by government, labour and industry – and a breakdown in mutual commitment to the vision.Today the dream of “work reduction” is long dead, even forgotten. OECDdata showsthat the average time spent on leisure has decreased since the 1980s, even in economies (such as the UK’s) that have grown in that time. Official time-use statistics suggest thatrecreation has been decliningeven since 2020, particularly for women, younger people and those on lower incomes.Time is money, they say – but it seems many of us feel impoverished in both. Recent research by Lloyds Bank found that the average Briton has only 23 “genuinely free” hours a week (from a total of 168). And 86% of respondents said they needed more.But the Lloyds report had a sunny spin, proclaiming that “emerging technology” could free up nearly two hours a day within the next two years. It casts a wide net, pointing to robot vacuum cleaners and driverless cars (and Lloyds’s new banking tools!), along with further advances in automation and AI, as capable of creating more time in our day.These shifts are already under way. Many people in all lines of work are routinely using AI tools such as ChatGPT – and for more involved, consequential or sensitive tasks than you may imagine. ChatGPT can achieve in seconds work that could take a person hours, often to a passable degree. But are the time savings created going towards more free time or more work?Microsoft cofounder Bill Gateshas predicted thatAI will replace people “for most things” within a decade, ushering in a two-day working week (and a five-day weekend). And yet, right now, even a four-day working week seems like a pipe dream, let alone the drastic measures (such asuniversal basic income) that will be necessary to absorb the shock of mass redundancy.Even we, the workers, are sleepwalking towards the future. From my reporting, it seems people are using ChatGPT not to clock off earlier, or even on time, but to get more done and keep on top of their seemingly endless workload.Is AI about to steal your job? – podcastRead moreA century ago, there was a collective desire and will to use technology to manage work, underpinned by the belief that leisure was akin to freedom. It was assumed that people would make choices to free up more time to spend with family, or on their hobbies. But that vision was tested – and eventually crushed – by the emerging view of progress as more money with which to buy more things, and of work as “the centre of life”. The Kellogg’s workers eventually voted in 1983 to abandon the six-hour shift, swayed by the threat of redundancies – and the promise of pay rises. Overtime was widely seen as a fair trade-off for less leisure. As one dissenting employee put it: “The work hogs won.”I first learned this in 2020 from anarticle by Hunnicutt. Reading of the flagging commitment of Kellogg’s to the six-hour shift made me feel the same agonised paralysis as watching a character in a horror film drift towards a slow and painful death. “Nooo!” I wanted to shout. “It’s a trap!”I fear we are at a similar crossroads now. New technologies reallycouldgive us more free time, shift the locus of life and meaning away from work, and even restructure society towards recreation and connection;theywillreplacevast numbers of us in our jobs. We already know that hard limits to growth exist, even if we fail to meaningfully acknowledge them. How we weather the change ahead will depend on our vision and daring, and how big we are prepared to dream.It’s not enough to recognise the possibilities, though that’s a start, says Hunnicutt. We need to believe in the merits of leisure, and “non-material growth – something besides more money and more work, forever”. History shows that this “respected, respectable, inspiring, historical alternative” is possible, even under capitalism. But if we don’t fight for our free time, we’ll just find more ways to waste it at work.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsWork & careersOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

It can be an integral part of activismKelley SwainActivism comes in many forms. I hope, in some small way, my writing is part of itTue 17 Jun 2025 20.27 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 02.48 EDTShareTime, it seems, is moving in strange ways for many of us. A colleague recently said, “mourning, reckoning and activism all seem to require different speeds,” and I’m grateful to her for that. I’ve often thought that the “gear-shift” between my paid work and the unpaid beautiful work of mothering feels like a rusty old manual car that I don’t quite understand how to drive.Lurch. Clunk.Add to that combination of work and parenting the imminent collapse of the world one was raised in, and there is a lot more grit than just clunky gears.The thing is, the world isn’t changing: our illusions about “the west” are finally being pulled down, and with it, our perceptions of time.When I was last able to visit the UK, where I lived for nearly 18 years, and which I consider (in confusing and complex ways) my home, one of my oldest and dearest poetry friends was in the midst of a family difficulty outside the scope of their usual experience. When Mick was 80, his sister, Quaker activistGaie Delap, had been imprisoned for action against climate change. At the time of my visit, Mick and the rest of the family was in the midst of getting her case into the media as much as possible, because Gaie was supposed to have a tag fitted that allowed her to be in home detention, but for months, a tag could allegedly not be found.As a psychologist I have witnessed a surge in climate grief. This is what I tell my clients | Carly DoberRead moreThe point is, the UK government spent time and money imprisoning a 78-year-old woman trying to protest against governmental failures around climate change, because her heart is breaking for her grandchildren. And the government would rather put her in prison than do a damn thing to curtail climate change.Sitting across from Mick and crying with him about his sister who was in prison, who was suffering ill effects to her mental and physical health due to the conditions there, was humbling for many reasons. Here were the elders I was longing for, the intergenerational grieving and fighting for justice that I’d been wondering about. I love that many people in their generation are fighting, and moreover – psychologically and perhaps spiritually more important – I appreciate their acknowledgment of the pain and suffering that is impacting us all. They are suffering it, too, and they are also fighting. They are grieving, openly. There is solidarity in that.I, and many of us from inherited Puritanical backgrounds, are not taught to express grief. Stoicism was upheld as much more laudable, but we’ve learned, often the hard way, that damming the river only causes it to burst the banks somewhere further downstream. Think of this generationally. As writer-activist adrienne maree brown writes: “This palpable, active, ongoing grief is a non-negotiable part of this period of immense change. Grief is one of the most beautiful and difficult ways we love. As we grieve we feel our humanity and connection to each other.” Solidarity in grief creates connection, community and spirit, that keeps us going. There are many cultures and communities that have been doing this long before I began to realise it, but I’m grateful to come to it, finally.Importantly, acknowledging the interconnected collapse and brutality of western settler-colonialism, capitalism, the military-industrial complex, genocide and climate change does not mean an individual has to feel like it istheir fault. Yes, we can do better. We can always “fail better”, as Beckett writes. But the tricky bit here is that if one feels it istheir fault,they often react antagonistically – they pull back. They shut down; don’t want to talk about it: “it’s not my fault”. Instead, I suggest we all grieve. Find others with whom it is safe to grieve. As Joshua Schrei says in The Emerald podcast, sit with your neighbour and breathe, together. Feelings of reactivity create severance. But, looking at Joanna Macy’s writing, grief is an integral part of activism. So is gratitude. Think of a set of scales, perhaps: grief on one side, gratitude on the other.Activismsits in the middle.And what is activism, we might ask? It’s taken me a while to understand that it comes in many forms. I hope, in some small way, this writing is activism. The millions of people out on the streets, across the world, civilians marching, together, waving flags and protecting their neighbours, or speaking out in support of people across the world whom they’ve never met: this is also activism. And grief. Sitting with your friend, or your mother, or your neighbour, and grieving. The time it takes will ebb and flow in unfamiliar ways: allow it. Feeling the pain and complexity, together – that is activism, too.Kelley Swain works in the field of medical and health humanities.

In Neck Study II a woman, eyes closed, holds up her head so we can study the curves and dips of flesh on her stretched neck. Saville notes these anatomical realities with a pencil in precise nuances of shading, also observing every contour of her face and the bones under her thin shoulders. It is beautiful. It is true.So what the hell – I thought – was she doing in the adjacent gallery where massively enlarged faces, pummelled by life and her art, are lit as harshly as flash photographs? They include her portrait of a boy with a bloodied beaten face, lip twisted, eyes dazed, used for the cover of a Manic Street Preachers album that was banned from supermarkets for being too disturbing. That was just a small reproduction. Here you are confronted by the colossal real thing, faces that truly get in your face.View image in fullscreenLip twisted, eyes dazed … gallery view of Stare, 2004-05, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: David Parry/National Portrait GalleryI ran away, at first, from this massive panorama of damage to look at some lovely drawings of motherhood in charcoal and pastel that take inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo to create tender moments between mother and baby, the figures seen through clouds and storms of exploratory drawing suggesting ever-moving life. Through this turmoil she finds monumental moments of intimacy. In Study for Pentimenti IV a baby boy sits cockily on his pregnant mother’s naked tummy: he’ll always be top child.The tenderness continues, this time between consenting adults in bed. A white woman and her Black lover lie together in naked union, she placing a hand on his bare leg, feeling the flesh. In other scenes it’s him holding her, or their heads at opposite ends of the bed, her foot feeling his ribs. In the most beautiful, charcoal is immersed in a pink pastel rain that turns the room into a rose bower. This is a 21st-century Degas – as it obviously wants to be.View image in fullscreenUnabashedly erotic … Compass, 2013, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Mike Bruce/© Jenny Saville. All rights reserved, DACS 2025. Courtesy GagosianOne artist it does not make you think of is Lucian Freud. Ever since the early 1990s, Saville has been compared with the late British figurative master, hyped as a young female Freud, or criticised as “just not as good as Freud”. This exhibition proves how utterly different they are. He never drew anything as unabashedly erotic as Saville’s Degas daydreams.Saville’s drawings and pastels ground her art. If you need your figurative artists to be properly skilful – and if they’re depicting the human face and body, you should – here’s her diploma art. But when she paints, she knowingly overrides every rule she follows as a draughtswoman. When she paints, she goes wild.Jenny Saville: ‘I want to be a painter of modern life, and modern bodies’Read moreIt’s there in her gargantuan early canvases, epically thrusting nipples, tummies and hips towards your eyes. Seated on a stool with meaty legs protruding, or lying at an angle that puts a great hairy nest of pubic hair right up by you, these women wonderfully overwhelm you. Walking among them, one physical detail after another looms up, expanded, so alive they still seem to be growing.Scale in art can do more than just look impressive, or important, or freakish. It can change the relationship between art and beholder, even magically invert subject and object. When Saville paints big naked people they’re alive. And when she paints pain, the effect is terrifying, because she takes you behind the eyes of the injured.View image in fullscreenThe eyes of a prophetess … Rosetta II, 2005-2006, by Jenny Saville.Photograph: Unknown/© Jenny Saville. All rights reserved, DACS 2025. Courtesy GagosianI’m ready as I’ll ever be, now, to go back and look at her paintings of violence. Witness, painted in 2009, is a brightly lit face with a smashed mouth that gushes blood. A woman has been assaulted. Her eyes are closed, her teeth bared in a bloody scream, but that makes it sound melodramatic and nightmarish, like a Francis Bacon painting, whereas this is real. You know it’s no exaggeration. The painting is photorealist.Other faces are similarly troubling. A young woman looks at you, her face horizontal – she could be dead on a slab. All around you, it’s equally horrible and real – scarred girls and battered boys. You feel guilty for looking at them. Yet, equally, they are looking at you. Because these faces are so much bigger than you, they seem more real than you. It is not your civilised morning in an art gallery that is real, but their living, or dying, hell.In her mysterious painting Rosetta II, a towering lost face sways as if remembering tragedy, but her eyes are blue, glazed and clouded, the eyes of a prophetess. Looking, suggests Saville, is not really the point. You have to see beyond the details of skin and bone, beyond anatomy, to feel the ungraspable but omnipresent realness of others. When that understanding hits you it’s a shock.Jenny Saville: The Anatomy of Paintingat the National Portrait Gallery, London, opens 20 JuneExplore more on these topicsJenny SavilleExhibitionsPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

The trouble with shifting Evita’s big balcony number from stage to streetIn the new Evita at the London Palladium, Rachel Zegler sings from the theatre’s actual balcony – meaning the big-paying audience doesn’t experience what passersby get for free. Could this gimmick catch on?Mark LawsonWed 18 Jun 2025 10.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 12.36 EDTShareIn the theatrical tactic “breaking the fourth wall”, characters acknowledge the presence of the audience. As when, in the current NationalTheatreproduction of Stephen Sondheim’s final musical, Here We Are, the performers, walking forward, stop in shock at seeing a big room full of strangers.The director Jamie Lloyd, though, is pioneering a technique that might be called breaking the theatre wall. In his revival of Evita, previewing at the London Palladium, Rachel Zegler’s Eva Perón sings Don’t Cry For Me Argentina – supposedly delivered from the Casa Rosada presidential balcony in Buenos Aires – from the balcony outside the Palladium, while the audience inside has to settle for a video feed.Last year, at London’s Savoy theatre, Lloyd staged the title number of another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical,Sunset Boulevard, with Tom Francis delivering the song while walking up the stairs from his dressing room out on to the Strand and then back down into the theatre, all filmed by a backwards-moving camera operator capturing live images shown on a screen to theatregoers. Since the Olivier-winning production became Tony winning on Broadway, Francis has been doing a version of the route in and out of the St James theatre along West 44th Street.Paying Evita audience upset as Don’t Cry delivered offstage to West End passersby for freeRead moreBoth staging stunts prompted social media complaints about shelling out big money (top tickets are around £200) to find the night’s big numbers are being sung to passersby for free. There is artistic loss, too. The anthemic, dramatic titular song in Sunset Boulevard features lyrics, from Don Black and Christopher Hampton, that are among the most effective, except those by Tim Rice, that Lloyd Webber has ever worked with. Joe Gillis, a Hollywood chancer who has run out of money, sings of Norma Desmond, whose career has stalled: “She was sinking fast, I threw a rope / Now I have suits and she has hope / It seemed an elegant solution.”This number, starting the second act, is a show highlight. But, in Lloyd’s production, the tight writing and explosive orchestration were, for me, lost in the jeopardy of the gimmick, as the audience – and, it seemed to me, Francis – fretted that he might fall down the steps, crash into the camera, be accosted by a reveller or police officer, or electrocuted if rain drenched his microphone. (Should Manhattan be hit by wilder weather, a route inside the building has been mapped, according to the New York Times, though not yet used.)The question is what explosion of the venue adds theatrically. Perón’s hold over the Argentinian populace depended to a significant degree on her being Catholic – the musical is very strong on the Buenos Aires first lady’s co-option of the scriptural Madonna that the secular Madonna later played in the movie version – and their being poor and living under military dictatorship. These days, poverty will regrettably be well represented on the streets of London, though relevant faith and tyranny less so. Does a dead fascist singing to tourists and boozers enhance or distract from the action of Evita?When the Belgian director Ivo Van Hove stagedOpening Nightlast year at the Gielgud, Sheridan Smith, playing a boozy, unreliable actor, was nightly seen outside on Shaftesbury Avenue and beamed to screens inside, staggering drunk from a limo to the stage door. This worked dramatically – because the external scene was in character – and gained useful publicity, although not enough to prevent the flawed show closing early.View image in fullscreenFreeloaders … the packed street outside the Palladium.Photograph: UnBoxPHD/YouTubeLess seems gained from throwing musicals out on to the street. Relevantly, Hampton, co-librettist of Sunset Boulevard, also wrote a solo play, Tales From Hollywood, about eastern European émigrés in the California movie business, in which characters include Austro-Hungarian writer Ödön von Horváth and German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, who demonstrates his theatrical technique of “alienation”, drawing attention to the lighting or frequently breaking the fourth wall in other ways. Von Horváth says: “Brecht always liked people to be aware they were in a theatre. I said to him more than once, ‘But Brecht, what makes you think they think they’re anywhere else?’”A good question, which Lloyd intensifies by putting the singers somewhere else. By following Sunset Boulevard with Evita, he has now staged two of Lloyd Webber’s best-known shows. Logically, the next might be Jesus Christ Superstar. And, if he continues his signature of street theatre, then logically the title character will be crucified outside, looking across from his West End Calvary towards department stores and fast-food joints.That may raise questions for whoever is archbishop of Canterbury by then, but also for theatre audiences. Just as the fourth wall should only be breached for very good narrative reasons, people who have paid a lot of money to sit in a theatre may reasonably expect that the most important songs in a musical will be sung in front of them.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsAndrew Lloyd WebberfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those fleshy breasts! The National Gallery’s ‘fake’ Rubens looks very real to meHow can anyone call Rubens’ sumptuous masterpiece Samson and Delilah a ‘fake’ and ‘a shoddy artefact’? The Flemish master is simply doing a superb job of copying his own favourite outlaw artistJonathan JonesWed 18 Jun 2025 06.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 18 Jun 2025 06.43 EDTShareSamson, a huge muscular hunk of a man, slumbers in the lap of his seducer Delilah, in a bedchamber sumptuously lit by candle. As Delilah looks down on the unconscious form of the great biblical hero, her accomplice is cutting the very tangled locks that hold his superhuman strength. Meanwhile, at the door, soldiers are waiting by torchlight. At the heart of it all is Samson’s rippled naked back, nestled on the woman’s pink silk skirts.Is this a painting by the Flemish baroque master Peter Paul Rubens? Hell, yes. The wonder is that anyone would ever think otherwise. And yet some do. Michael Daley and his campaigning group ArtWatch UK, and the art historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis (among others), are getting traction with their claims that theNational Galleryowns a “fake” or “modern copy” and is covering up that reality.Only Rubens could have painted both this lavishly sexualised male body and, just inches away, dote on Delilah’s breastsThey appear to be talking about a different painting from the one I know. In an UnHerdarticleabout her long struggle to disprove this painting’s attribution to Rubens, Doxiadis reveals that, from the moment she first beheld it at the National Gallery in the 1980s, she rejected it – and still does – as “a shoddy artefact, lacking the brilliance of my favourite European painter”.We’ve all got our own tastes, but I cannot recognise this description. Shoddy artefact? Samson and Delilah currently hangs in a gallery of other Rubens masterpieces and easily takes its place there – it commands the room, draws you in, and it repays detailed, repeated looking. I looked at it again only last week, as I have been looking at it for years, always finding new nuances.Fresh doubt cast on authenticity of Rubens painting in National GalleryRead moreThis lovely painting, however, has been confusing people since the National Gallery bought it in 1980 because it doesn’t look like the cliche of a Rubens. Where are the swirly draperies, fiery skies and flouncy paintwork? But it doesn’t look typical of him for a good reason: it is his passionate attempt to paint like someone else.When Rubens painted Samson and Delilah in 1609-10, he had recently returned to his home in Antwerp, Belgium, after an eight-year working holiday in Italy. While this was typical of north European artists in the dying years of the Renaissance, he stayed longer than most, studying the dead greats such as Leonardo, Michelangelo and Titian but also becoming obsessed with one living artist – Caravaggio, whose works were prominent in Rome and Florence.They never met because Caravaggio went on the run after killing a man in 1606, but unknown to him, he had an eloquent champion in Rubens. After Caravaggio’s shockingly real, even godless painting The Death of the Virgin was rejected by a church in Rome, Rubens persuaded the Duke of Mantua to buy it and when his collection was sold to Charles I this radical Caravaggio came to Britain – before ending up in France after Charles was beheaded. Rubens also clearly copied Caravaggio’sMedusainto his own works, more than once, including on Athena’s shield in the National Gallery’s Judgement of Paris.View image in fullscreenA Caravaggio-esque Medusa (far left) in Rubens’ The Judgement of Paris.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesBut Samson and Delilah is Rubens’s most extravagant homage to Caravaggio, a painting in which he tries to fully understand this outlaw artist’s lighting, sensual shocks, and even his creamy yet exact brushing, which means a much smoother, more consistent surface than you get with later, more expressive and “painterly” Rubens canvases. The soldiers at the door, the old woman with the candle, the hair-cutting – though Caravaggio preferred to sever the whole head – are gloriously Caravaggio-like.The way that Rubens lingers on every shadowed furrow of that exposed male back is very like Caravaggio, too. It also resembles Rubens’s powerfully erotic drawings of male nudes – including his enthusiastic portrayals of classical statuary. Yet only Rubens could have painted both this lavishly sexualised male body and, just inches away, dote on Delilah’s breasts with that strip of linen setting off their fleshiness. This is more than voyeurism. Delilah is one of many powerful women who appear in Rubens paintings –so frequently, indeed,that it’s another clue to his authorship.Even when he’s imitating Caravaggio, Rubens can’t help being himself. The light is his, the candle glow is buttery and warm, like a pancake in an Antwerp kitchen. That mixture of southern sensuality and northern homeliness is another Rubens trait.The quirkiness of this painting that gets some people’s goat – its cocktail of Caravaggio-ism and Rubens’s own carnal abandon – is actually a clue to its authenticity. What copyist would have been so subtle as to recreate this moment when Rubens takes on Caravaggio – especially in the earlier 20th century when Caravaggio was not rated as he is today? The window for such a faking is improbably narrow – between the 1950s when Caravaggio started to be rediscovered and 1980 when this was bought by the National Gallery.I’ve criticised the National Gallery plenty but it does not engage in cover-ups. In 2010, it put on an exhibition owning up to “fakes” in its collection. That information is also on labels in its rehang: for example, the label for Giorgione’s The Sunset reveals that Saint George and the dragon are a modern addition. It is not confessing anything about the Rubens because there’s nothing to confess.Is Samson and Delilah a “shoddy artefact” that a 20th-century copyist could have slapped together? No, it is a superb, seductive masterpiece about the power of desire, in which Rubens assimilates the vision of Caravaggio while remaining utterly himself.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingNational GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year, almost 20,000 new titles were released on the PC gaming platformSteamalone, the majority disappearing into the content blackhole that is the internet. So when a smaller studio is offered the chance to get on the stage at the Summer Games Fest, an event streamed live to a global audience of around 50 million people, it’s a big deal. Not something that you want to spectacularly misjudge.Enter Ian Proulx, cofounder of 1047 Games. His short slot at the event earlier this month had him walking on stage with a baseball bat to promote the online shooter Splitgate 2 by announcing that he was “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year”, while wearing a cap bearing the slogan “Make FPS great again”. It did not go well. Gamers and fellow developers criticised his decision to diss another studio’s game as well as his politically charged use of a Maga/Trump meme, especially withanti-ICE protestersbeing beaten and arrested just across town. Proulx defended his actions, denying that his use of the cap slogan was political, but four days later hemade an apologyvia X explaining: “We needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.”What Proulx failed to anticipate is that in the fast-paced meme culture of 2025, context, nuance and sociopolitical intricacy are vital and constantly changing. You can’t simply put on a cheeky grin and appropriate whatever signs and symbols are floating around 4Chan – look atElon Muskand how embarrassingly dated his mid-2000s edgelord shtick has become. You can’t deploy the Maga anthem without contextualising it; and you definitely can’t claim to be the cutting edge saviour of the FPS while promoting not only a sequel but a battle royale mode of all things. In 2025 – are you kidding?View image in fullscreenBacklash … will anyone play Splitgate 2 now?Photograph: 1047 GamesI don’t know the exact situation at 1047Games, but I’ve visited hundreds of game development studios all over the world. No matter how progressive they want to appear, there is often, at the very top, a familiar monoculture of middle-class men of a certain age, with certain tastes, who can sometimes overlook the fact that their experiences and views might not reflect those of everybody else. Proulx said something telling: “We tried to think of something and this is what we came up with.” In the boardroom, surrounded by likeminded pals, it probably seemed like a laugh, but perhaps they should have checked with someone else first.Splitgate 2is now in the unfortunate position where a portion of its potential customers were turned off by this ill-judged Maga bit, and an entirely separate portion hate that Proulx apologised for it, thereby capitulating to the woke mind virus. Multiplayer games rely on an engaged community to spread the word about them, so this is very much not ideal.There are smarter things Proulx could have done on that stage with his 30 seconds of fame. When you look back at greatest E3 moments of years gone by, the memorable spectacles have been positive: former Xbox chief Peter Moore and hisHalo 2 tattoo; game artist and director Ikumi Nakamura charming the whole world with her unguarded enthusiasm for Ghostwire: Protocol; actorKeanu Reevesshouting, “You’re breathtaking!” at an audience member during the Cyberpunk 2077 stage show; Swedish developer Martin Sahlin tearing up talking about the platform game Unravel. In a culture heavy with faux machismo and attitude, these charming, funny, daft moments broke through like shards of sunlight. You don’t need to take to the stage with a slogan or a baseball bat. The greatest asset you can wield in this highly digital, massively anonymised creative industry is humanity.What to playArcade-y … Rematch.Illustration: Sloclap/SteamThere are a few eye-catching games our this week, includingDate Everything, a game in which you can flirt with your toaster; Tron: Catalyst, a novel take on Disney’s cyber-universe from Bithell Games of Subsurface Circular fame; andFBC: Firebreak, a three-player co-op spin-off from cult studio Remedy’s oeuvre.I’m personally most interested inRematch, however, an arcade-y 5-v-5 football game whose developers have clearly played a lot of Rocket League. Unlike EA Sports FC, you inhabit just the one player rather than the whole team, and all those players have the same flashy skills, so there’s none of the stats and strategy of EA Sports FC. In other words, this is a football game that you can enjoy without knowing much about football.Available on:PC, PlayStation 5, XboxEstimated playtime:whatever you want to put into itWhat to readView image in fullscreenElegance … Anna Williams in Tekken 7.Composite: Guardian Design;  Bandai NamcoAs part of the Guardian’s Pride month series aboutunexpected queer icons, Keza MacDonald wrote about the Zelda series’Link as a non-binary icon; Jason Okundaye wrote aboutthe divas of the fighting game genre; and Jordan Page wrote aboutthe gender-playfulness of Pokémon.

I’ve always thought Edmund Spenser’s 16th-century epicThe Faerie Queenewould make a great open-world game.”Conveniently, as an English literature graduate myself, this is something to which I have given a lot of thought. In terms of classic works that would make great games, I’d play The Rime of the Ancient Mariner as a dark, rogue-like take on The Oregon Trail with the visual style of The Return of the Obra Din; I’d play Conrad’s Heart of Darkness as a Silent Hill-style psychological horror; or Pride and Prejudice as rules-heavy dating sim (we came enticingly close to this with the now sadly defunct multiplayer online game,Ever, Jane); both Tom Jones and Middlemarch would make incredible open-world adventures.In the category of “historical writers who would now be game designers”, I would put two obvious candidates: Mary Shelley and HG Wells, writers who were interested in and profoundly inspired by science and technology. I’d also say Bertolt Brecht, a dramatist who used various technologies to capture the interest of popular audiences, and August Strindberg, who wrote plays, but also took photographs and dabbled in the occult. I could see him presenting some wild, densely symbolic role-playing adventure at the Summer Games Fest – and he wouldn’t need a baseball bat or a cap with a dumb slogan.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterGame cultureNintendo Switch 2featuresShareReuse this content"

Hus opens with force: Helicopter, Triumph, Fight for Your Right, Fortune Teller, Reckless, and No Denying come in quick succession. He spits with braggadocious swagger, jumping from a protruding platform into the throes of the adoring crowd standing in the stalls. Even looking up towards the gallery, the venue’s grandeur feels entirely fitting for commemorating such a heavy-hitting UK No 1 album, which has become embedded in British rap, Afrobeats, dancehall, and general culture over the past five years.But sound-balancing issues persist throughout. The orchestra is barely audible and placing them behind Hus, while logical for crowd interaction, doesn’t seem to have been accounted for in the mixing. Hus offers no insight into his decision to introduce classical elements and hardly speaks throughout.After that vibrant (if somewhat rushed) opening run, he vanishes and we reach the show’s nadir. For 15 minutes, throwback hits Common Sense, Bouff Daddy, Dem Boy Paigon and Friendly play through speakers with minimal accompaniment, and energy ebbs exponentially – dangerously – from the audience.View image in fullscreenOne and Only … J Hus.Photograph: Eva PentelReturning with 2019’s Daily Duppy freestyle fails to jumpstart the evening. Even the orchestra members, idle, begin filming on their phones. So when Play Play finally drops, its impact is dulled: a disappointing moment for Big Conspiracy’s biggest song, which cemented Hus’s status as the godfather of Afroswing.Did you see what I done? How J Hus became the voice of young black BritainRead moreThere are still spellbinding moments, though. For Big Conspiracy’s title track, strings swell as fog fills the lower stage and Hus performs seated on a stool next to iceè tgm; during One and Only, he stands at the end of a platform, illuminated by a single spotlight. Hus’s hooks are in a league of their own but are sometimes underappreciated, so the tenderness lent by this staging helps to amplify his melodic gifts. It’s a shame, though, that when Hus closes with 2023’s Who Told You, leaving Repeat, Big Conspiracy’s third-biggest track, notably absent.Hus himself is an engaging, impulsive performer and his catalogue will go in the annals of British music. But this experimental return to live music, coming after an arena tour was cancelled in 2023 and never rebooked, needs a clearer vision. The crowd leaves with questions about how rigorously planned this all was, despite the spectacular moments when venue, band, orchestra and rapper align perfectly.Explore more on these topicsJ HusPop and rockRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Also known in agricultural circles as the hare moon or the corn planting moon, it’s closely associated with new life and new beginnings.“Happy flower moon day!” beams Durand Jones, leader of soul outfit Durand Jones and the Indications, whose forthcoming album Flowers – led by the single Flower Moon – also deals with the theme of fresh starts. We’re serendipitously speaking on 12 May, along with his bandmates Aaron Frazer and Blake Rhein.Jones is at home in New Orleans, and dressed rather fabulously in a kimono and a battered old baseball cap. Frazer, the band’s falsetto-singing drummer, is in Los Angeles, where he moved in 2024 after 10 years or so in New York, while Rhein, in Chicago, doesn’t turn his camera on throughout our interview and – despite being the band’s guitarist and core producer – interjects only once or twice over the course of our hour-long conversation.Fittingly, there’s been a great deal of growth and maturation since Durand Jones and the Indications’ 2021 album Private Space. We’re still in the world of retro soul with modern, hip-hop-tinged production, but the disco and funk influences of that third album have given way to gentler, altogether more romantic moods; the O’Jays, William DeVaughn and other Philadelphia soul heavyweights; the Chi-Lites and even Barry White.Their popularity is certainly blooming: they’re gearing up for a long US tour, followed by European shows in early 2026, and have just got off the road supporting Lenny Kravitz in arenas. Frazer says the experience was “absolutely sick” and, pleasingly, they never once saw him not wearing sunglasses. “Whether it’s on stage or in the hallways, no cameras or crowds, his default is strut,” Frazer says. “That brand of rock’n’roll, with the tight leather pants and the swagger, has been mimicked so much, but when you see an original version of it, it’s super cool.”On the personal side, meanwhile, the past couple of years have also been transformative. Jones used his 2023 solo album Wait Til I Get Over to open up about being queer, something he tells me has set him free in every aspect of his life. “The biggest thing I realised was that I had spent most of my life trying to make people around me feel comfortable, and I hadn’t realised I wasn’t comfortable myself,” he says. “Now, I feel like a whole different person. I feel settled. With my solo album, my intent was to put out art, but it was also a chance to reflect on the things that I felt most insecure about. Coming back to the Indications, I felt ready to be vulnerable with my art in a way that I wasn’t before.”View image in fullscreen‘I feel like a whole different person’ … Durand Jones performing in London, September 2022.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianFrazer also got candid for his second solo album, last year’s Into the Blue, mining heartbreak, grief and loneliness in the aftermath of a breakup and relocation to LA. There is a worry that a group with two vocalists, both of whom release solo material, could have an inherent tension, perhaps exacerbated by the trio living in three separate corners of the US.But Flowers could not sound more harmonious, and Frazer says “the emotional health of this unit has never been better”. Their extracurricular activities only serve to enhance the spirit of collaboration once the band reconvenes, he argues, and “having other avenues for expression only helps longevity”.The band (which features two further auxiliary members) formed after Jones, a virtuoso saxophonist, met Frazer and Rhein in 2012 at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music. They released their self-titled debut album in 2016, a collection of gloriously retro gems rooted in 50s doo-wop and early 60s vocal harmony groups. Their music caught the ear of theChicano lowrider community, who became fierce champions of the band, and the album was rereleased to wide acclaim in 2018.Second album American Love Call took the Indications further towards the mainstream. Released in 2019, a year before George Floyd’s murder and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, it was prescient and politically charged, examining the fractures in American society and the crisis in racial equality.But no matter how despairing (“It’s morning in America / but I can’t see the dawn”), the band’s music is underpinned by the idea that love will always win. Flowers is no different, although Jones and Frazer say it can be hard to remain positive in the face of such dire politics.“It’s so scary to see what’s going down here in the US. It feels like the start of a dictatorship,” says Jones. “To see this administration literally disregard the orders of the supreme court is insane. Fascism starts with silencing folks, and we’re seeing that. After you’ve silenced the news media, you go after the arts. We’re starting to see that and it’s alarming. I am afraid, and that’s crazy to say out loud. It’s only been a little over 100 days, but there’s a lot of … what’s the word … evil happening in America. And I feel as if I’m idly standing by.”One song on Flowers, I Need the Answer, Jones’s favourite, takes a softer, conciliatory approach. “We’ve been out on the streets protesting, and we’ve been trying to talk to our fellow man in many ways, about the injustices that we feel. I Need the Answer is about just stopping and saying: ‘I disagree with you, you disagree with me, but let’s sit down and talk about this.’ I think we can find some ground that we can walk on together. We have to.”View image in fullscreen‘It doesn’t even faze me when someone says we’re on their sex playlist’ … Durand Jones and the Indications.Photograph: Elan WatsonA source of power for him and Frazer in the face of such polarised times is the number of fans who have approached them to tell him how the Indications’ music has changed their lives. “I’ve lost count of the number of grown-ass men who have cried in my arms,” says Jones. “People on the brink of suicide who say our music has saved them.”“These interactions mean more than any interview, radio play, TV appearance or whatever,” continues Frazer. “Getting to hear from someone about how your music is in their life, or seeing a video of a marriage proposal and your song is playing in the background is just incredible,” he says. “It doesn’t even faze me any more when someone says we’re on their sex playlist. I say: ‘Great, very happy you invited us into your space, glad we could help.’“I heard from a janitor who told me our music helps them get through a shift, someone who was locked up in a state penitentiary who told me our music was played by people waiting out their sentences. Hearing that our music has a very concrete role in someone’s life, that, to me, feels like making it.“And to take a song like I Need the Answer, that’s a salve. We can be a soundtrack to someone’s lovemaking or their work or their cooking or whatever. We have the opportunity to speak to people with an open mind.”Flowers is released via Dead Oceans on 27 June. Durand Jones and the Indications are at Rough Trade East, London, on 3 July, Love Supreme Jazz festival, East Sussex, on 4 July and will be touring the UK in February 2026.Explore more on these topicsSoulPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blacklisted, a new show at New York Historical, profiles the lives of the so-called Hollywood Ten, who were creatives caught up in the communist witch-hunt – to disastrous consequences affecting their lives for decades thereafter. It brings to mind suggestive, and uncomfortable, parallels with politicized persecution in the US today.“At this point, TV was just beginning to become influential,” said Anne Lessy, an assistant curator who coordinated the show. “There was a lot of anxiety around these mass entertainments and how much power they had, in part because the second world war effort had been so successful in propaganda. A lot of the blacklisted artists were important in those efforts.”‘We live in a second Red Scare’: what can we learn from a chilling book about Florida’s past?Read moreIn addition to rising fears around the newly unleashed power of television, Lessy added that there were powerful backlashes around rising equality, promoting racism, xenophobia and antisemitism. Politicians and other opportunists were keen to take advantage of these social fissures – persecuting members of the Hollywood elite was widely viewed as a stepping stone for ambitious politicians.“This was a way to give yourself a real bounce in terms of your political career,” Lessy said. “A relatively junior member of congress, Richard Nixon, was on the [House Un-American Activities Committee], and then in just a few short years he’s elected senator from California, and then vice-president. So it really did become a platform that many politicians saw as a way to advance their own ambitions.”View image in fullscreenCivil Rights Congress, America’s ‘Thought Police’: Record of the Un-American Activities Committee, 1947.Photograph: Courtesy of the Unger FamilyBlacklisted explores this crucial history through the lives and stories of various Americans, including the Hollywood Ten – a group of screenwriters and directors who were held in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions before HUAC. While the show was originally curated by Jewish Museum Milwaukee in 2018, when things such as book bans and “don’t say gay” bills were just beginning to pick up steam, its resonance with the US political situation has only increased in the years since.The president and CEO of New York Historical, Louise Mirrer, explained that when she found out about Blacklisted, it felt like a slam dunk. “The exhibition was brought to our attention by a member who saw it a few years ago at the Skirball [Cultural Center] in Los Angeles. Even already at that time, around the country, we were starting to see a lot of attention paid to books in school libraries, the curriculum taught in schools – it just seemed like this theme of being blacklisted really resonated and was important to bring to our audience.”One of the narratives that Blacklisted explores is that of Dalton Trumbo, an award-winning screenwriter known for films such as Roman Holiday and Spartacus. Because of his blacklisting, Trumbo actually worked on these films and others under a pseudonym, and was not able to receive any credit for his Academy award–winning work. It was only in 1960 that he was again given screen credits – for his films Exodus and Spartacus – and it was not until 2011 that he received full credit from the Writers Guild of America for his work on Roman Holiday. “So many screenwriters had to work under fictitious names or fronts,” said Lessy, “and it was often not until the 80s or 90s that they got credit for their work.”Beyond not being able to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor, such blacklisted writers and actors experienced serious limitations to their careers and ability to support themselves. Among the historical ephemera collected in Blacklisted is the unemployment benefits application of actor Madeleine Lee, who was unable to earn a living due to the witch-hunt that buried her career. Such consequences could be lifelong. “Blacklisted artists struggled to survive,” said Lessy, “and the impacts often lasted for a very long time. Many blacklisted creatives were not getting an accurate pension into the 80s and 90s. Films were still crediting an alias or front.”View image in fullscreenAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAgainst this governmental persecution, Hollywood creatives deployed many forms of resilience. They relied on community ties for mutual aid, and they carried on their creative practices outside Hollywood. For this version of the show, New York Historical has added an examination of how New York theater was a lifeline for so many who had run afoul of state-sponsored attacks. “New York theater never adopted a formal blacklist, and so the theater world became an important refuge,” Lessy said. “Actors’ Equity was one of the few entertainment unions to actually pass an anti-blacklist resolution.”One of the cases that Blacklisted examines is that of a stage production of the book The World of Sholom Aleichem. Considered a forerunner of Fiddler on the Roof, the book delves into 19th-century Jewish diasporic communities throughout southern Russia. It was turned into a very popular theater show that consisted largely of blacklisted staff, even garnering a rave from the New York Times and going on to become a prime-time TV presentation. “They took this Russian-Jewish folktale and turned it into a really popular show,” Lessy said.The show also looks at how figures such as playwrights Arthur Miller and Lillian Hellman were given a lifeline by New York. Miller was held in contempt of Congress in 1957 and subsequently blacklisted from Hollywood, while Hellman was blacklisted early on, in 1949. “They had such undeniable talent and were able to continue to thrive on the New York stage,” said Lessy.Ultimately, individual citizens fighting back helped to erode the powers of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In the 1957 supreme court case Watkins v United States, the labor organizer John Watkins won a ruling that HUAC’s power was not unlimited. “I really love the fact that the legal curbing was very much an ordinary person who decided to fight back,” said Lessy. Subsequent rulings further limited Congress’s power to persecute individual Americans, offering some hope for curbing the Trump administration’s abuses of power and avoiding yet another American witch-hunt.Blacklisted: An American Story is on view at the New York Historical until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsMuseumsFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Swansea is a place of creativity, resilience and inspiration and I’m excited by the possibilities this presents not just for artists, but for the people of Wales.”The theatre company will be based at a “public sector hub” being built on the site of the former St David’s shopping centre in Swansea’s civic centre, Swansea council said. The centre currently houses the country council chamber and a library.“This isn’t about just an office space, but a cultural hub which welcomes creatives in,” Sheen said, adding that the company was working on plans to make the space come alive.Swansea’s council leader, Rob Stewart, said the announcement was a proud moment that showed how far the city had come as a creative hub.“We’re thrilled that Welsh NationalTheatrehas chosen Swansea as its home. The impact of hosting world-class theatre in Swansea will be transformative. It has the potential to stimulate a new generation of local talent and inspire even more visitors to come,” said Stewart.The company’s first production –Our Town, by the US playwright Thornton Wilder, which is believed to have inspired Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood – stars Sheen. It will debut at Swansea’s Grand theatre in January before touring Wales and the Rose theatre in Kingston upon Thames.Next year, the 56-year-old will also play Owain Glyndŵr in Owain & Henry, a new play by Gary Owen about the clash between the last Welsh-born Prince ofWalesand King Henry IV, in a Welsh National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre co-production.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fraudsters typically generate revenue on platforms such as Deezer by using bots to “listen” to AI-generated songs – and take the subsequent royalty payments, which become sizeable once spread across multiple tracks.The tactic aims to evade detection measures triggered by vast listening numbers for a small amount of bogus tracks.Thibault Roucou, the director of royalties and reporting at the Paris-based platform, said the manipulation of AI-generated music was an bid to “get some money from royalties”.“As long as there is money [in fraudulent streaming] there will be efforts, unfortunately, to try to get a profit from it,” he said. “That’s why we’re investing in fighting it, because we know it’s not going away and we need to be one step ahead every time.”Deezer deploys a tool it says can detect 100% AI-made content from the most prolific AI music models such as Suno and Udio.Deezer said the AI-generated music streamed by fraudsters ranged from fake pop and rap music to artificial mood tracks. The platform blocks royalty payments for streams it has identified as fraudulent.Deezer revealed in April that AI-generated music now represents 18% of all uploads to its platform, or 20,000 tracks per day. The company said it was removing all fully AI-generated content from its algorithmic recommendations. Deezer has more than 10 million subscribers worldwide, whilemarket leader Spotifyhas 268 million.Roucou said he did not know who was behind the fraudulent streams but the perpetrators appeared to be “organised”. The global streaming market was worth $20.4bn last year, according to trade body the IFPI, representing a sizeable target for fraudsters.In itslatest global music report, the IFPI said fraudulent streaming steals money that “should be going to legitimate artists”. It said generative AI had “significantly exacerbated” the problem.Last year, a musician in the US, Michael Smith, was charged in connection with a scheme to create hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs and stream them billions of times, obtaining $10m in royalty payments.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Erotic Vagrancy by Roger LewisA gloriously gossipy portrait of Hollywood power couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Roger Lewis’s twin biography is read with just the right amount of archness by actor Justin Avoth. The “erotic vagrancy” of the title refers to a statement issued by the pope during the pair’s brazen antics in Rome while filming Cleopatra when they frolicked on a yacht in full view of the paparazzi. Both were married, but not to each other.Available via Riverrun, 22hr 58min2. James by Percival EverettThis Pulitzer prize-winning retelling of Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is seen through the eyes of “Jim”, an enslaved Black man and friend of teen runaway Huck and his pal Tom Sawyer. It is read by Dominic Hoffman, whose performance is wry and charismatic, highlighting the code-switching of the protagonist and giving the character an agency denied him by Twain.Available via Mantle, 7hr 49min3. Tom Lake by Ann PatchettPatchett brought in the big guns for the audio version of her novel about a family who are reunited for the cherry harvest on their Michigan farm. Meryl Streep gives terrific voice to matriarch Lara and her three adult daughters Maisie, Emily and Nell. As they set to work, the girls quiz their mother about an idyllic summer in her youth when she joined a production of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, during which she had an affair with the leading man.Available via Bloomsbury, 11hr 22minDavid Nicholls: ‘I’m genuinely deathly at a dinner party’Read more4. You Are Here by David NichollsNicholls’s sixth romcom is ideally set up for a dual narration, which comes courtesy of actors Lydia Leonard and Lee Ingleby. Leonard is Marnie, a divorced copy editor from London who has come to the Lake District for a group hike along Alfred Wainwright’s coast-to-coast route. Leading the walkers is Ingleby’s Michael, an earnest geography teacher with a passion for rock formations. The pair are frosty at first but, as others in the group flake out, they find they have more in common than they thought.Available via WF Howes, 8hr 27min5. The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha ChristieMove over David Suchet, there’s a new Hercule Poirot in town. This adaptation of Christie’s first novel stars Peter Dinklage as the moustached sleuth called to investigate an incident at an Essex country house. Emily is a widow who has recently remarried a man 20 years her junior. When she cries out in the night, her adult children find her bedroom is locked from the inside. But when they break down the door, she is already dead.Available via Audible Originals, 3hr 53min6. A Voyage Around the Queen by Craig BrownYou don’t have to be a royalist to enjoy this portrait of Elizabeth II, expertly narrated by Harriet Walter, which also examines the psyche of her subjects. Instead of a biographical account, it is a patchwork of news reports, documentary excerpts, letters, diary entries, overheard anecdotes and even dreams. From these we learn that Kingsley Amis loaded up on Imodium before meeting Her Majesty lest he fart in her orbit and that Paul Theroux dreamed about leaning his head in her bosom.Available via 4th Estate, 19hr 46min7. The Lost Loves of Boysie Singh by Ingrid PersaudA fictionalised account of a real-life gangster from Trinidad, Persaud’s evocative novel tells of a pirate who terrorised the inhabitants of Port of Spain and the Gulf of Paria in the 1940s and 50s. Told in Trinidadian dialect by four women with whom he was involved, it is alternately narrated by Persaud (who reads Mana Lala), Melanie La Barrie (Popo), Martina Laird (Doris) and Chanel Quesnel (Rosie). Each give lively and nuanced readings as they provide troubling glimpses into the life of a charismatic yet dangerous man.Available via Faber, 14hr 11minWhere to start with: Patricia HighsmithRead more8.

Smith’s comes when he is caught in the corner of a restaurant in the Hamptons on the last night of summer, snorting cocaine from a key. He walks calmly out with the two khaki-clad police officers, poses for a mugshot and posts his $500 bail.Smith is Black, which won’t help, but he comes from wealth, which will. So he calls his sister, who calls his father in Atlanta, who tells his mother, who collapses on the floor in shock then starts calling lawyers. Smith prepares for his court date with a series of AA meetings and counselling sessions that will make it clear that this promising young man is on the road to redemption.The contrite lines Smith rehearses have some truth, and his legal troubles are not the only thing on his mind. He was a model student as a boy, living up to the pedigree of his family of Atlanta landlords, lawyers and professors. At university, new social worlds opened thanks to newfriends Elle, the effervescent Black daughter of a successful soul singer, and Carolyn, an impulsive white art-world scion.After graduating, Smith shares a New York apartment with Elle, mixing brunches, hook-ups and club nights with fairly half-hearted work. A content strategist at an arty startup, he is in an investor meeting when his phone buzzes with the news that Elle has been found dead of an overdose. Revelations and rumours spread and Smith spirals, partying harder until his arrest a few weeks later. Before long, a Vanity Fair journalist is pestering him with questions, and Carolyn won’t answer his calls.Brooklyn-based writer and academic Rob Franklin, like Smith, moved from Atlanta to New York. He shared an apartment with a young woman, Lyric McHenry, who died from a widely reported overdose. His watchful and poetic debut does not dwell on the obvious drama of arrests or police investigations. It is about a gay twentysomething trying to figure out his place in the world, and plenty more besides: this is a book about New York that’s part love letter, part reckoning; a tale of glamorous club kids and their sometimes bleak inner lives; and an account of the way privilege and race intersect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Carolyn’s set seem to live “entirely by what looked best in retrospect”, moving from impossible-to-get dinner reservations and bleary afterparties to stage-managed meet-ups in which a picnic is “incomplete without a tuft of bundled peonies, a sketchbook casually strewn”. One apartment has “an emerald slab topped with a polar bear hide” instead of a couch; Smith’s workplace is built of “polycarbonate and Lucite” and peopled by “ex‑bankers in boot-cut denim and software engineers in Yeezys”.There are moments when Smith relishes this life and finds joy in his friendships and the release of the dancefloor. But shadows are ever present. Smith claims he isn’t addicted to a substance as much as a desire to “negate or obliterate” time. As his court date beckons, he looks back on the detritus of Elle’s life: the piled gift bags and cosmetics that were her payment for interning, the inverted drugs baggies that filled the bin.Smith’s status and connections grant him access to exclusive circles, but his entry is conditional: he is a “brown, queer interloper” who offers Carolyn’s group a multicultural veneer. Elle’s death is made to fit a tragic story: “Black pain”, Smith reflects, “was always spectacle, was always entertainment.” The Instagram comments quickly descend: “junkie”, “whore”, “u got wut u deserved”.If Smith’s race lends a fragility to his privilege, others are broken already. He passes “scattered, limp bodies splayed out on benches” in a park and joins a new crowd who hand out emergency supplies and drug test kits. Franklin charts Smith’s slow, uncertain journey towards stability with sometimes overheated prose: rather than addiction, he speaks of “a desire inescapable, and often ruinous to those who possess it, to scrape with fanged nails against the marbled flesh of being”. Yet for the most part he grounds his lyrical writing with granular details, from sidestreets and brand names to vivid late-night conversations, in a book that really convinces. This fine debut probes grief, friendship, hedonism and the hard edges of the city as it walks a young man towards a second chance he knows others may not get.Great Black Hope by Rob Franklin is published by Summit (£16.99).

For young adults especially, audiobooks are a natural fit with how they live and read.”Audiobooks have “soared in popularity over the past 10 years”, said Dan Conway, chief executive at the PA. “The same is true of podcasts, so clearly audio content in general is hugely on the rise.”“Publishers have invested more and more in producing high-quality content that grabs attention,” he added. “Some of the most successful audiobooks of the past few years have offered listeners the opportunity to hear world-renowned figures deliver their stories themselves. We have also seen full cast productions, high-profile casting and innovative recording techniques.”Tina, who runs the book-themed Instagram account@tbretcand listened to more than 100 audiobooks last year, said that her life is “busier than ever”, so audiobooks allow her to “enjoy myself while doing the many life tasks that come with being a working mom of two”. Audiobook production has also “come a long way, and sometimes listening to a story brings an even better experience than reading a book with your eyes”, she said.The PA also reported fiction revenue rising 18% between 2023 and 2024, surpassing £1bn for the first time. “Fiction growth has been driven by fantasy and romance,” said Conway. “The desire for escapism in these tumultuous times may be a factor in the recent success of these genres.”While revenue for consumer nonfiction – which excludes academic and education books – saw a 4% decrease, this fall brought the category in line with fiction, with both bringing in £1.1bn each in 2024. Revenue from children’s books remained static at £413m.Digital revenue – encompassing audiobooks and ebooks – rose 17% between 2023 and 2024 in the consumer market, to £566m.“It’s fantastic to see fiction, audiobooks and digital thrived in 2024,” added Conway. “Clearly publishers have been giving book lovers what they want with engaging content in a range of formats.”The digital revenue figure includes earnings through subscriptions such as Spotify’s Premium, which allows 15 hours of audiobook listening per month.Spotify saw a 35% rise in listening hours between January 2024 and January 2025. “Whether it’s during a commute, at the gym, or taking a walk, audiobooks open up storytelling in those in-between moments”, said Duncan Bruce, director of audiobook partnerships and licensing.“We’ve also removed the friction for people to try an audiobook for the first time, placing it in the centre of one of the world’s most used apps. We’ve seen strong crossover from music and podcasts, with fans discovering audiobooks through artists like Blink-182, Britney Spears and Bob Dylan, and podcasters including Louis Theroux and Steven Bartlett, proving audiobooks have the power to spark a whole new love of reading.”Audiobooks are “helping to engage people who don’t usually consider themselves readers,” agreed The Reading Agency’s Hicks. They are “a gateway into the joy of reading for many who might otherwise feel excluded”.Like Spotify, Audible has seen “substantial increases in membership and listening hours, including a 22% rise in our kids’ content offerings, as well as huge uptick in engagement and appetite across genres like romance and LitRPG [literary role-playing games]”, said its chief content officer Rachel Ghiazza.“Advances in production have made the audiobook experience increasingly immersive and accessible,” she added. “Though substantial progress has been made, the audiobook sector remains an emerging and rapidly evolving space.”The PA also reported print revenue experiencing a 2% rise in the consumer market across 2023 and 2024, to £2bn. “While digital has been growing faster it’s important to remember that print is still by far the preferred medium in the consumer market, accounting for 78% of revenue,” it said.The export market for consumer, academic and education books saw a 3% increase to £4.5bn last year – this constituted 63% of the publishing industry’s overall revenue.Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksPublishingSpotifyAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

A great many of these vivifyinggenii lociare birds, although their identities aren’t always obvious because language evolves over time. We need a guide.Enter Michael Warren: teacher of English, amateur ornithologist and a man who lives in a Britain different to the one most of us inhabit: a medieval one, which by some magic has “survived in another dimension parallel to our own”. The gift he bestows in this gorgeous book is that, by the end, we live there too, newly able to read the growth rings of place, and to perceive an alternative land shimmering over the one we already know.The secrets lie in plain sight and plain speech, spelled out on maps, road signs and along urban streets: toponyms invoking cranes and crows, hawks and geese, eagles and owls, swallows and thegeac– an old name whose pluralgeacsbecame theExofExbourne (Devon)and theYaxof Yaxley (Cambridgeshire).That bird, unlikely as it may seem, is the cuckoo. I’ve just spent a week in the species’ stronghold of Dartmoor, hearing them close to our tent and recognising for the first time, thanks to this book, their neurotic yikker and throat-clearing “gowk”,which is still the bird’s northern and Scots name.Some may already know that theecoof ecology and economy is from the Greekoikos, meaning “home”. But go back further, explains Warren, and we reach a proto-Indo-European root wordueik, which via the Old Englishwicalso gives uswick, a word relating to settlement: literally, a place where life happens. For our forebears, birds oftenwerethat life, a presence that turned space into place: the cuckoo clearing (Yaxley), owl valley (Ousden), buzzard stone (Wroxton), jackdaw stream (Cabourne); woodpecker pool (Finmere), cranes’ brook (Cranbrook).Warren’s wordcraft is sublime. His description of a perching tawny owl, for example: “In the monochromatic shades of night, sharpened to high contrast by the glare of intrusive light [its] eyes are sunless planets … two gaping bores, as though someone blew the night clean through the back of its skull.” If there is something ofThe Peregrineauthor JA Baker in that example, Warren’s style is more textured and generous, weaving fascination, family life, and lightly carried expertise. There are other voices too: those of naturalists, writers and a gamekeeper-turned-goose-guardian who accompany him on some of his quests, plus the time-worn words of poets, scribes, monks and scholars. Of particular importance are 131 sheets of bound vellum held by Exeter Cathedral since at least AD1072. TheExeter Bookcontains almost all we have of Old English poetry and the earliest written mention of many of our birds.The bird most often invoked in English toponyms is not the cuckoo, nor the ubiquitous crow. It is the crane – a species we lost for a few centuries and whose persona now seems hitched to ideas of unpeopled wilderness. It was not always so, suggests Warren. While cranes have been elevated by rarity, gulls were once quasi-angelic, their clinging to inhospitable coastal rocks evoking the monks who established their cells at the extreme edges of these islands. Now diminished in popular perception, they are seen as gutter-life, scavengers on the trash-tides of our consumerism.Given the loss of many of the birds Warren references from the places named after them, this book comes to seem like a long-form prayer of sorts, a eulogy – or, to put it another way, a recalling of fire from embers.

But what this powerful documentary from Sophie Compton and Daisy-May Hudson (the latter of whom is the director of just-released filmLollipop) does is to demonstrate the cruelty and injustice of a system that incarcerates the vulnerable.Shot in 2021, it follows six women returning to HMP Holloway in London before demolition began a year later. In the first scenes, they walk back into the prison, some into their old cells. The building is abandoned, ivy creeps up through the floorboards, but it’s still Holloway: “Fuck, I remember this smell,” says one. During a week-long workshop the women – brave and unfailingly articulate – share their stories. All of them experienced trauma in childhood, most masked it with drugs or alcohol, or unhealthy relationships. Of the six, two are now charity CEOs: Aliyah Aliand Mandy Ogunmokun, who both work to support disadvantaged women.The poet Lady Unchainedis also in the group.‘Prison was the first place we felt sisterhood’: six women return to the ruins of HollowayRead moreThe sessions, chairs arranged in a circle in the old prison chapel, are intimate and tough to watch. “I’ll always be sad my whole life,” says one woman, reflecting on her experience of childhood sexual abuse. Leading the seasons is workshop facilitator Lorraine, and a trauma psychotherapist sits in too. In the hands of other film-makers, this could feel exploitative – or at the very least leave you concerned for the mental wellbeing of the participants after the cameras switch off. But the film producers explain at length in notes provided that their process involved working with the six women, who had a say in the final edit and were given access throughout to a psychotherapist. Their collaborative documentary feels like essential viewing for policymakers.Holloway is in UK cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPrisons and probationWomenUK criminal justiceDomestic violencereviewsShareReuse this content"

P-Orridge challenged gender identity but it is clear from the interviewees that there were no wrong answers when it came to pronouns: “he”, “she” and “they” are all used. This is a sympathetic and amiable official docu-biography in which the subject comes across as a mix of Aleister Crowley, Charles Manson and Screaming Lord Sutch. The “P-Orridge” surname makes me suspect that Spike Milligan might have been an indirect influence, although there’s also a bit of Klaus Kinski in there as well.Genesis P-Orridge: fantastic transgressor or sadistic aggressor?Read moreGenesis P-Orridge, known to friends and family as Gen, started as a radical conceptual artist, rule-breaker, consciousness-expander and tabloid-baiter who with Throbbing Gristleinfluentially coined the term “industrial music”, a term later to be borrowed without acknowledgment by many. They were, in the words of Janet Street-Porter, shown here in archive footage, “too shocking for punk”. P-Orridge formed a new band, Psychic TV, in the 1980s, and then also formed a group of likeminded occultist provocateurs called Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. (The film tactfully passes over how very annoying that spelling is.)At the beginning of the 90s, P-Orridge and his family, including first wife Paula P-Orridge, went to the US to escape a (later retracted) allegation of ritual sexual abuse. In the US, they were the guests of counterculture figure Michael Horowitz, father of Winona Ryder, and P-Orridge’s career in art, music and peripheral celebrity blossomed. After divorce from Paula, P-Orridge married the artist Jacqueline Breyer, known as Lady Jaye, with whom Gen pursued a radical project of “pandrogynous” fusion, involving breast and lip surgery.By the end, there is maybe a you-had-to-be-there factor with all this, and the film leaves you with a nagging feeling that P-Orridge was not seriously important in either art or music – but was pugnaciously sincere, too unselfconscious to be a narcissist and certainly a real one-off.S/he Is Still Her/e: The OfficialGenesis P-OrridgeDoc is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGenesis P-OrridgeThrobbing GristlereviewsShareReuse this content"

During a Tinder date, a woman found herself in a pretty awkward situation: her poo wouldn’t flush, and in an attempt to discreetly dispose of it, she ended up wedged between two windows. The story was turned into a viral meme, and even made the headlines. Now, a musical by two of the creators of the hit podcast My Dad Wrote a Porno (Jamie Morton and James Cooper) has been spawned from the incident, too.The central premise remains, but with a few creative tweaks. Lucy and Peter have been raised on Disney movies but are chronically unlucky in love. Misguided help arrives in the form of Lucy’s cutting anti-guardian-angel, Miseraie, and Peter’s insufferable finance bro flatmate, David. After matching on a dating app, they meet at a Mexican restaurant and do their best to keep up appearances. But, would you believe it – it turns out they might just be each other’s perfect match after all.View image in fullscreenEvery number is a hit  … Lovestuck.Photograph: Mark SeniorWith Alison Steadman’s voice guiding us through the show as a romcom style narrator, everything falls, predictably, into place. But with a powerhouse score by Bryn Christopher and Martin Batchelar, the stage erupts into a celebration of modern love at its most mortifying. In Picture Perfect, Lucy sings of the flawless lives she sees online. In Shit!, her embarrassment spills out of her at a panicked rate. Every number is a hit.After the original actor playing Lucy suffered an injury in rehearsals last week, Ambra Caserottihas stepped in last minute. Though you’d never guess it: her voice melts like butter, and she brings a dry sense of humour to the role. Coupled with Shane O’Riordan as Peter, the pair make an endearing and suitable awkwardly match.By the end, it turns out it’s better to be yourself, even if you happen to be the internet sensation known as “poo girl”. It’s hardly revolutionary stuff. But with stylistic traces of Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss’s Why Am I So Single?, the musical glistens with wit, intelligence and a high gag rate. There’s a hell of a lot of poo chat, but if you can get onboard the toilet train, you’re sure to leave laughing.AtStratford East, London, until 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDatingreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Frick Collection in New York and Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom at theMusée Carnavaletin Paris both hum with a timeless energy that transcends the exhibits on display.The Little Museum of Dublinis also such a space.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The modern world disappears and I imagine myself back in Georgian times, when this red-bricked terrace was built along with so many of the beautiful squares and parks throughout the city centre.DublinerTrevor Whitepersuaded Dublin city council to lend him this building back in 2011 to open the first museum in the city dedicated to all things Dublin. Armed with a great idea and no collection, he took to the airwaves and asked the listeners of the belovedMarian Finucane show on RTÉ(Ireland’s national broadcaster) to trawl through their attics and cupboards for one-of-a-kind curiosities and mementoes relating to the Irish capital.Armed with a great idea and no collection, Trevor White asked RTE radio listeners to trawl through their cupboards for curiosities relating to DublinMore than 1,000 exhibits flooded in, ranging from a pair of Bono’s iconic sunglasses to a ticket for the only Dublin concerts the Beatles played, in 1963. James Joyce’s death mask was donated along with a first edition of Ulysses. A bottle of unopened lemonade rescued from the wreck of a mail boat torpedoed off Dublin during the first world war was offered for display coupled with an unopened jar of Sudocrem from 1931 (the antiseptic cream was invented in the city). A 1980s ledger from a nearby Magdalene laundry (where pregnant, unmarried women were forced into servitude) was unearthed with listed clients including the president’s residence and state agencies. All the items were carefully curated according to the decade of their provenance and exhibited throughout the museum’s high-ceilinged rooms.The museum became an immediate hit with locals and visitors and more than a million people have taken the 29-minute guided tour of the exhibits over the past 14 years. Tripadvisor rates it as thethird best visitor attraction in Ireland, and the12th best in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe U2 room includes a photo of the band members when they were schoolmates.Photograph: Gintaras VarnagysI often find myself there, early on a Sunday morning, when very little else is open in the city, sitting in the recreation of Irish Times editor Bertie Smyllie’s office on the top floor with views across Stephen’s Green to the Dublin mountains. Eccentric Bertie pedalled his bicycle to the newspaper until 1954 with a typewriter balanced on his handlebars. He was responsible for championing many of Ireland’s greatest writers including Patrick Kavanagh and Flann O’Brien. Next door, in the U2 room, I like to pick out the teenage incarnations of the band from a black-and-white class photo at Mount Temple, the school where they famously first met as schoolboys. This photo, just like this museum as a whole, brings a sense that the past can still be accessed.As visitor numbers rocketed, the museum sought funding to expand its exhibits and shop into the basement and garden and to install a long-overdue lift to provide universal access to all the floors. After a year of renovations, at a cost of €4.3m, the museum reopened on 5 June with a new library and archive, a screening room and a new exhibition of fearless women snaking up the stairwell, taking its cue from a quote by President Mary Robinson: “I was elected by the women of Ireland, who instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the system.”One of the world’s finest doll’s houses has taken up residence on the first floorOne of the world’s finest doll’s houses has taken up residence on the first floor. Modelled on Leinster House round the corner, the seat of the Irish government, Tara’s Palace took more than 20 years to build and it has been given to the museum along with a slew of new donations to celebrate the reopening. President Mary McAleese has sent in her rosary beads; the original maquette for the sculpture of singer Luke Kelly (of the Dubliners fame) in the Docklands has found a perch; and a whole room of wild and wonderful taxidermied animals with a Dublin connection have taken up residence.View image in fullscreenThe death mask of celebrated Irish author James Joyce.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyIn 1988, Dublin marked the millennium of its founding with a year-long celebration of civic events. Many homes in the city still proudly display a famous milk bottle from this time, embossed with the Dublin City coat of arms, and you can find one of these on a mantelpiece at the museum. After decades of neglect and inner-city dereliction, 1988 marked a sea change in how many Dubliners viewed their capital. Trevor White also traces the igniting of his passion for Dublin to this time. Everything he has worked for at the Little Museum of Dublin, along with his equally passionate team, has been designed to inspire an ongoing appreciation and love of Dublin, the little city that could.Little Museum of Dublinis open9.30am to 5pm, with the guided tourbookable for€18,littlemuseum.ieExplore more on these topicsDublin holidaysIreland holidaysCultural tripsMuseumsEurope holidaysCity breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ash column was observed to be grey with thick intensity,” it said, after the alert level was raised.There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties.Geology agency head Muhammad Wafid said residents and tourists should avoid carrying out any activities within at least 7km of the volcano’s crater.Virgin Australia confirmed some flights between Brisbane and Melbourne and Bali were cancelled on Wednesday due to the eruption.Jetstar also cancelled four flights from Australia into Bali on Wednesday morning, while Qantas said it was keeping a “close eye” on the situation with flights scheduled to leave later this afternoon.Air New Zealand cancelled two flights between Bali and Aukland on Wednesday, saying it would “continue to closely monitor” the volcanic ash cloud.“Safety is always our first priority and we will only operate into and out of Denpasar when it is safe to fly,” the airline said.Air India, Singapore’s TigerAir and China’s Juneyao Airlines also cancelled flights “due to volcano”, Bali’s international airport website said.Several domestic AirAsia flights leaving for Labuan Bajo on Flores were also cancelled.“Ngurah Rai is still operating normally but it depends on the flight schedule, but some of the flights are cancelled due to a volcano. It depends on the route and also the airline,” a Bali airport customer service agent who declined to give their name told AFP.Wafid warned of the possibility of hazardous lahar floods – a type of mud or debris flow of volcanic materials – if heavy rain occurs, particularly for communities near to rivers.He also urged residents to wear face masks to protect themselves from volcanic ash.National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesman Abdul Muhari said in a statement late Tuesday that at least one village had to evacuate, without providing numbers, and ash rain was reported in several villages outside the exclusion zone.The spokesman called on residents around the volcano “to evacuate to safe locations” as tremors were still being detected, which indicated ongoing volcanic activity.Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki erupted multiple times in November, killing nine people and forcing thousands to evacuate, as well as the cancellation of scores of international flights to Bali.Laki-Laki, which means man in Indonesian, is twinned with the calmer but taller 1,703m (5,587-foot) volcano named Perempuan, after the Indonesian word for woman.Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”.Explore more on these topicsBaliVolcanoesBali holidaysIndonesiaAir transportAsiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s usually made with ripe but firm fruit, which aren’t all that dissimilar to the under-ripe and slightly flavourless apricots and plums found in most UK supermarkets and which make a great British stand-in for ume.Umeboshi (Japanese-style fermented dried plums, apricots and peaches)Our global food system is a wondrous thing, but as a Slow Foodist, consultant and food systems thinker, I can’t ignorethe benefits of shorter food chains, from lower transport emissions and reduced waste to improved quality and flavour. Of course, food miles are only one piece of the emissions pie, but that doesn’t mean they’re inconsequential, and we ought to consider them alongside other contributory factors such as livestock production and deforestation.Many fruits such as mangos, bananas and apricots continue to ripen after harvest, so these delicateclimactericfruits are usually picked hard and green, and ripened in climate-controlled rooms filled with natural ethylene gas. It’s an ingenious process, but it can produce floury, tasteless fruit with fewer nutrients.By comparison, local, seasonal fruits tend to be tastier and more nutritious, but if you’re unlucky and end up with fruit that just won’t ripen, you can either cook it or turn it intoumeboshi, which is a fun fermentation project. Like most fermentation recipes, the essence of this one is very simple, yet it’s still a scientific process that requires care and attention to detail. Everything needs to be very clean and sterilised with vinegar or alcohol. Also, due to their high sugar content, fruits such as plums, apricots and peaches are prone to mould during fermentatation, so keep your hands and utensils scrupulously clean. And make sure the fruit stays submerged in its brine, or “plum vinegar”, to help prevent mould forming; if at any stage specks of mould do appear, it’s best to compost the entire batch. There are plenty ofdetailed umeboshi guides onlineif you’d like a more in-depth explanation.Firm apricots, plums or peachesA splash ofwhite-wine or cider vinegar18% sea salt– that is, 1kg fruit will need 180g saltA clean vessel with a lidA weight– a plate, fermentation weight or bag of salt, say)Soak the fruit in water with a generous splash of vinegar for a couple of hours. Using a toothpick or tweezers, remove the little stem from the fruit, taking care not to cut into the flesh itself, and save any bruised or blemished fruit for something else, because they’re more likely to develop mould. Weigh the fruit, then measure out 18% of its total weight in sea salt (that is, 180g salt for every kilo of fruit). Wipe out a clean storage jar or fermentation pot with vinegar or alcohol, then start packing in the fruit in layers, scattering each layer with the salt. Put a small clean plate or fermentation weight on top, then weigh that down with a clean weight or a sealed bag of salt.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app, scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Leave to ferment in a cool place out of direct sunlight for four weeks. Over the first three to seven days, the juices will slowly draw out of the fruit and submerge it. Make sure the fruit remains submerged, but don’t crush it down.When hot weather is forecast, drain the fruit (save the brine for dressings), then lay it on a rack and dry in the sun for three to five days, until it shrinks and turns crinkly. Store the dried fruit in a clean, airtight jar. Traditionally, umeboshi is aged for one to three years, but to be on the safe side, aim to consume it within a month or so.Explore more on these topicsPickling, fermenting and preservingWaste notFoodFood wasteJapanese food and drinkFruitSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even the empty pods have so much flavour and sweetness, which makes them perfect for a quick salad on the side (toss thinly sliced raw, blanched or even griddled pods with chopped tomato, sliced onion and coriander, drizzle over some fresh mint raita and sprinkle with chaat masala). Blanch the fresh peas without any seasoning before you make the curry, then add them to the simmering gravy near the end. You can swap them for frozen peas, too, if you like.Spiced green pea and coconut curry (pictured top)AKA Maharashtrianambat vatana rassa, this is a family recipe from our home in Mumbai. Traditionally, we use kokum, or dried wild mangosteen, to impart a sour, tangy flavour and a hint of colour, but you could use tamarind instead – the curry should be tart and tangy, so add to taste and according to the quality of your tamarind paste (the one I use is a pretty weak one, so I needed two tablespoons). We usually serve this with a buttery spiced ghee rice.Prep10 minSoak20 minCook20 minServes4300g podded fresh green peas, or frozen peas, defrosted2 tbsp vegetable oil12 fresh curry leaves½ tsp ground turmeric350g boiled potatoes, cut into chunks5 kokum petals, soaked in 50ml warm water for 20 min, or 2 tbsp tamarind paste, or to taste(see recipe introduction)Salt, to tasteCooked rice, to serveFor the coconut paste3 dried kashmiri red chillies1 tbsp coriander seeds1 tsp black peppercorns120g grated fresh coconutCook the fresh green peas in boiling water for two to three minutes, then drain and refresh; if you’re using frozen peas, there’s no need to cook them first, because they’ll get cooked directly in the curry sauce.Now for the paste. Soak the red chillies in 100ml warm water for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a blender, grind the coriander seeds and peppercorns to a rough powder. Add the soaked chillies, their soaking liquid and the coconut to the blender and blitz to a smooth paste.Put the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat. When it’s hot, add the curry leaves and coconut paste, and fry, stirring, for two minutes.Stir in the ground turmeric, fry for a minute, then pour in 250ml cold water, bring to a simmer and cook for a minute.Turn down the heat, add the peas, the cooked potatoes, the kokum and its soaking liquid. Season with salt to taste, simmer for a final two minutes, then serve warm with rice.Green pea and potato curryView image in fullscreenMaunika Gowardhan’s green pea and potato curry.Ormatar ka nimona, which hails from Benares in northern Uttar Pradesh.
